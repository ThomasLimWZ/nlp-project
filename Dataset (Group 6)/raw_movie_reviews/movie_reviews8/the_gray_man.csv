"7","/10","It's not bad, but 200mil USD should produce more, right?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8358650/?ref_=tt_urv","lovemichaeljordan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur115595273/?ref_=tt_urv","22 July 2022","It doesn't look like a cheap movie, but no chance that this movie had over two hundred million dollars in budget. It's a decent and enjoyable movie but it shouldn't cost that much. Spend your money on better things instead of this easily consumed but entertaining film. Companies like Netflix and Disney keep producing mediocre content when they have insane budgets. Do they spend every penny on the CGI and hire children to do the writing? The writing in Gray Man is not bad, but maybe we should expect more when they have an almost unlimited budget?The action is good some of the time. The actors did a great job and it looks legit when they fight. Some action scenes use way too much greenscreen which is a shame. I thought we had learned by now after Tom Cruise's success. But of course it is much easier to do some of these sequences in the computer (and safer).There are many location titles in this movie. Probably too many, but at least it becomes clear where we are. The environments are very nice, but the absolute best thing is neither the environments nor Ana De Armas, it's Ryan Gosling. Jesus, he's in phenomenal shape. Has he put on some weight for Barbie? It's great that he's back on the big screen. WFun to see him in an action role similar to James Bond or John Wick, and he does a great job. He's charismatic, good-looking, funny and has perfect comedic timing. Without Gosling this movie would've been a 5/10.Ana De Armas is also great in the film. She has proven to be fierce in both this and James Bond. Soon we will surely see her starring in her own action film.","541 out of 730 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Not a masterpiece, but very enjoyable","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9329424/?ref_=tt_urv","norrlands_chatte","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8085304/?ref_=tt_urv","18 September 2023","I don't really get all the haters of this movie, because I don't think it's bad at all. For myself, I bought Gosling as the stoneface with quick remarks and found it enjoyable. It's not a deep story and you could argue that the characters are cliche, but even if they are, I think it works in this movie. The action scenes are decent, but not top of the line. It's a good vs bad classic, very basic, with characters easy to read. Chris Evans is convincing as the role of the psychopath. The child actor does a great job as well. Billy Bob Thornton is also quite decent. So even if the story is a simple one, I found it quite enjoyable.","7 out of 7 found this helpful.

Or at least nice to see a different part of him after seeing him for 10+ years in the Marvel universe.However, I'm worried that they might be trying to set up a franchise here, which might not be a good thing. James Bond can do that, Jason Bourne did it, John wick certainly did it. But there isn't enough in this movie to set up the franchise.. here it's a ""meh"" film where the ""meh"" attempted to hide in a whole heap of action scenes.. granted. Some of those action scenes are pretty good. But it's still surrounded by ""meh""","50 out of 71 found this helpful.

Obviously it's not a masterpiece of action movies and doesn't come close to Bourne or 007, however, it still manages to be a good movie, the plot is a little cliché and shallow has secondary plots that don't go deep and for me in that, the movie falls short. The action scenes have a lot of cuts which honestly takes the excitement out of the scene. The various locations, despite enhancing the film in terms of photography, are very beautiful.The point for a lot of people not to have liked the movie is that it doesn't propose to be deep, it just introduces the characters and you have to accept them, there's not much explanation about why they are like that or how they got in that situation, it's a simple plot, for a simple movie and aimed at a large audience, does that make the movie bad? Obviously not. So I highly recommend this movie if you're just looking for fun and action scenes.","78 out of 115 found this helpful.

"7","/10","It may not be the ""Bond killer"" I'm sure the producers were hoping for, but The Gray Man is a solid action thriller that delivers.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8360407/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","23 July 2022","Court Gentry (Ryan Gosling) is a man serving a lengthy prison sentence for murder when he's approach by CIA Donald Fitzroy (Billy Bob Thorton). Fitzroy impressed by Gentry's lethal skills and lack of familial connections offers him recruitment into the Sierra program, wherein convicted felons agree to work for the CIA as deniable off the books assets who can ""operate in the gray"" in exchange for commuted sentences, which Gentry accepts taking the designation Sierra Six (""Six"" for short). 18 years later Gentry continues to operate for the CIA as the last member of the Sierra program much to the ire of Denny Carmichael (Regé-Jean Page) who has succeeded Fitzroy in position and voices disdain for Fitzroy's tenure including the Sierra program. When an assassination in Bangkok assigned to Six reveals his target was Sierra Four, Four gives Six an encrypted drive that was Carmichael's true objective and this sends Six into the wind. Carmichael seeking to retrieve the drive before it can be decrypted enlists the aid of sociopathic private contractor and former CIA assassin Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans) to take down Six and retrieve the drive and Hansen issues a bounty on Six that sends every assassin after Six. Additionally Hansen takes hostage Six's now retired mentor Fitzroy as well as Fitzroy's niece Claire (Julia Butters) to ensure Six has no allies.The Gray Man is an adaptation of the novel of the same name that is the first in a series by author Mark Greaney who first came to prominence as a co-author on several Tom Clancy novels during Clancy's final years. Published in 2009, attempts had been made as far back as 2011 with Brad Pitt initially slated to play the lead only for the project to never come together, and later Charlize Theron entered discussions to play a genderswapped version of The Gray Man but this too never came to pass and Theron instead pursued her adaptation of The Coldest City with Atomic Blonde. The eventually landed at Netflix in June of 2020 with directors Anthony and Joe Russo who'd directed some of the MCUs best regarded films and a budget of $200 million making it the most expensive project to ever be tackled by Netflix. With a well regarded series of books and an A-List team behind and in front of the camera, it's clear Netflix wants this to be a long lasting franchise and given all those solid parts it probably will be, but while the movie is entertaining it's not going to be the replacement for Bond of Mission: Impossible the producers clearly want (yet anyway).To start off on the best aspects of The Gray Man, the movie delivers everything you hope to see from a big budget directorial effort by the Russo Brothers with the plethora of international locales, epic scope of the action, and thrilling and creative action sequences that wow and dazzle with the technical craft firing on all cylinders. The movie features a great supporting cast with Bond alum Ana de Armas as Dani Miranda a nice Deuteragonist to the movie even if she does feel like she ducks in and out appearing at just the right time after we've lost track of her, Billy Bob Thorton is quite good as Fitzroy and brings his quirky offbeat charisma to the well worn mentor figure as reliable as ever, and Julia Butters is also very good as Fitroy's niece Claire with Fitzroy and Claire nicely positioned for Six as a surrogate family who add emotional weight to the stakes. But hands down the best performance is Chris Evans playing wildly against type as Lloyd Hansen who's about as far from his Captain America persona as you can get without playing Hitler. Hansen is an absolute monster and he clearly loves every minute of it as he revels in sadistic glee at trying to take down Six and alternates his superior smirk with bouts of violent and explosive rage that more often than not have a lethal edge to them as his handler Suzanne played by Jessica Henwick tries in vain to keep tis rabid dog on a leash. The movie's really solid and engaging entertaining with the supporting cast, the action, and the villains elevating the very stock ""stolen list"" plot that's part and parcel to most spy movies, but the movie doesn't do all that much at making the titular Gray Man himself all that interesting with Six feeling more akin to an audience proxy than a fully fleshed character.While Gosling is a good actor and effectively plays ""strong and silent"" type hard edged protagonists as seen in Drive, I never felt like that was a stylistic choice here and more like Gosling's character was just a blank slate. Admittedly they do give Gosling more meat to chew on around the halfway point and even gives him opportunity for some humor, but for a good stretch of the movie Six is very opaque as a character with the nature of who and why he murdered someone not revealed until the beginning of the third act. I think that's what holds this movie back from being on the same level as the best of 007 or Mission: Impossible because it doesn't have a hero as defined as James Bond or Ethan Hunt in their best adventures, I do think however it's better than Quantum of Solace, Spectre, Mission: Impossible II & III, and especially that last Jason Bourne film, but it's still not quite at the level of the best of the comparable spy franchises.The Gray Man is a solid entry in the genre of spy themed action thrillers and will definitely satisfy the appetites of those waiting for Mission: Impossible to close its book and a new face to say ""Bond, James Bond"" as it delivers on action, spectacle, and character to solid measure. The movie doesn't make its titular Gray Man the most interesting protagonist with his monosyllabic title and largely stoic delivery in the first half keeping us from getting to know him all that much character wise, but there is solid ground developed if they do decide to pursue a sequel.","137 out of 215 found this helpful.

Of course as many others I wondered who took all the money Netflix paid for this production but as with so many other big productions today, it's not the point if CGI, actors or travel expenses of the crew were overpriced, the problem lies in the script. The art in script writing is to build up characters and a story.

A trait that you learn to realise stems from his past. He isn't a bond, or a charming, chivalrous man. He's a pawn on a board, never at rest.

Say what you want but you can find elements of practically any movie in another movie to some degree.Now the actual movie - the hero characters are loveable, the action is non-stop and you do find yourself rooting for the protagonist. However, there are downfalls, the choreography of the fight scenes is mid-tier, there are opportune kill shots the villains don't take and that leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Chris Evans character is tacky and poorly constructed. His acting is great but the execution of the main villain leaves much to be desired. With some tidying up of main villain and some more finely tuned fight scenes that don't leave any plot holes I would say this would get an easy 8/10, for that reason it's unfortunately a 7. Anything less than a 6 is harsh and quite frankly this isn't a movie where you have to sit down and think, it's meant to be enjoyed just like John Wick.Enjoy it for what it is, don't believe any reviews scoring it lower than a 6, quite frankly it's these types of people that live to write a bad review about things, crazy that people can watch multi million dollar movies using a 8 dollar subscription and think they are being mugged off of their time, get a grip.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

The only grace was seeing Ryan Gosling on screen. A big budget film with neither strong screenplay nor efficient set up, The Gray Man feels like a sunk ship with lots of efforts vanishing in vain.Aside from two hand-to-hand combat scenes, the fights are a dimly-lit mess of quick cuts and bullets flying, something similar to what Michael Bay has done all over these years.Being a big budget film, The Gray Man is a disappointment to a greater extent, considering that the project had A List actors, but a poor storyline.My Rating: 5/10.","470 out of 654 found this helpful.

We see all types of action but the fight scenes are what stand out the most. They are high speed with lots of cuts, frantic and hectic. This is not how I would normally describe good fight scenes, but it somehow works here. You can follow it all. The fight scenes are fantastic.At the same time, I really don't understand why this wasn't rated R. This is the exact type of movie that should be. I think it would have stepped up a level if it was allowed to show all the blood and didn't need to shy away from showing the stabs/shots. They did a good job of hiding it without being too obvious. But it would have had significantly more impact if they didn't hold back. My jaw could have dropped a bunch of times. And the usual reason for limiting it to PG-13 is theatrical box office. But this is a Netflix movie with a very limited theatrical release one week early. Very odd decision.The story is more than serviceable. Not everything works and there's a lot that isn't fleshed out. But I was never bored in any of the non-action parts. I was fully invested in the story/characters even though it's far from the movie's best attribute.There are a bunch of great lines of dialogue and some really good callbacks. I like the villain but I don't feel like the script gave him enough to fully encapsulate what they were going for. He has a little Caster Troy to him, but isn't nearly as memorable.Why isn't Jessica Henwick in more stuff? She's always awesome. Although I wish she had more to do here.If you're an action junkie like me, you will likely have a blast with this movie. It's worth seeing in theaters unless you have a great sound system. Trust me, you want it LOUD. (1 viewing, 7/18/2022)","73 out of 144 found this helpful.

The globetrotting is pointless - no culture, just a few buildings - and the choreography surprisingly bad at times. The characterisation is nil and de Ames quite bad in a peripheral role.

Of course when that's pretty much all you watch, it becomes all of somewhat the same story line. It's all in how you deliver the story line and the action that takes places that sets it apart from others. With that being said, I absolutely love this movie. To say I love this movie so much after watching it, I mean I love it enough that I haven't stopped looking into about the movie after watching it. I've NEVER rated a movie on Netflix, with of course giving it a loved rating and I've NEVER came onto imdb to rate or look into the rating of a movie and here I am talking as high as I can of it. My rating might not mean much on here but after scrolling and reading critic reviews for a few minutes and seeing how disappointed I was in other people's opinions on the movie, I wanted to definitely express how great I thought it was. Ryan Gosling and his added touches throughout the movie and his love, care and compassionate parts for Julia Butters made it for me. And of course all the action with Ryan and Chris Evans, my eyes stayed peeled on the screen. Again one of my favorite action films I've watched yet. Give credit to these producers and actors where credits due without the money aspect and politics, they truly deserve it for delivering a great movie!! I can't wait for a sequel!!!","5 out of 5 found this helpful.

Of course, that seems to be an unpopular opinion, or more so that my interpretation of 'serviceable,' in this context, is that this film wasn't bad by any means; it just could've been better. Based on what I've read, some people agree that it was serviceable but still with plenty of 'not-so-good,' with which I can't entirely agree; others hated it all together: and I think it comes down to how the last few years to now, there has been an oversaturation with films that are just serviceable, getting under the skin of enough people now, like the sound of a waterdrop in an anechoic chamber constantly, or maybe just being in one of those chambers long enough, to where they can't enjoy them and want all of them to be perfect.Contrary to what seems like the majority's opinion, in that this film is one of the worst films ever, in somewhat of a hyperbole way, that's not the case. The story was super straightforward and run-of-the-mill: the pacing and progression were fast-paced; big deal. The general filmmaking, like the use of CGI: quick cuts sometimes, ""shoddy"" lightning, as in a bit dark sometimes, and ""bad"" dialogue, which didn't come across that way to me but rather intentionally juvenile, and I thought it was appropriate and delivered appropriately, while understandably somewhat of a turn-off, wasn't that detrimental. Some of the camera work was creative, which I can appreciate. I was expecting those aspects to be much worse or certain ones to be worse because of how the majority seemed to have felt about them. They could've been better, but the negative things said about them are blown way out of proportion, in my opinion.Generally, there were some things a little rough around the edges.The fight choreography was quite decent, except at times, the direction and editing spoiled the choreography by Daniel Hernandez (?) and the ones performing it, whether the actual actor/actress or stunt doubles.I feel like the film would've benefited greatly with a better score; it was alright but underwhelming. I also feel like it wasn't as prominent as it should've been.The cinematography (while decent enough at times, especially with certain shots) felt bland and uninspired overall.Both the score and cinematography seemed to fluctuate back and forth from good to less-than-good.The quick cuts and blinding colors during the fight sequence between Six and Four were a bit much, and as quickly as it began, it was over, thanks to so many quick cuts. Fight sequences take forever to do: and require so much effort, I'd imagine, and just for ones that don't even last that long, so making them super fast-paced as your vision isn't an issue; using that as an excuse to half-ass it with cuts: or rather how you do it, is the issue, especially since it spits at the hard work done by those who choreographed and performed it. But that's the only instance where the quick-cut approach was an annoyance.All the performances were decent. Ryan Gosling was Ryan Gosling but with more of a serious tone to his character, which wasn't a problem. Ana de Armas was a pretty face; sorry, a super pretty face: her attractiveness is remarkable, and her performance wasn't bad at all; she had some good action/fight sequences. I haven't seen any films Gal Gadot is in, but I know people consider her a pretty face with subpar acting ability, and I feel like Ana de Armas isn't just a pretty face. Regé-Jean Page and Jessica Henwick did alright; their performances gave the impression of being aggressively comical. Billy Bob Thornton gave a surprisingly decent performance; his acting in the scene with Lloyd involving fingernails was funny. Chris Evans and Julia Butters were the stand-outs for me; his performance was entertaining, and her acting was quite good, including feeling natural.Ryan Gosling is now two-for-two with having a young co-star actress who somewhat stole the show. First, it was Angourie Rice in The Nice Guys, and now it's Julia Butters in this film.I was impressed by Dhanush/Lone Wolf. He was essentially this film's equivalent of Randeep Hooda/Saju in Extraction. And I liked that a lot; I liked Saju a lot. Both stole the scenes they were in; both were also powerhouses. So, in a sense, Lone Wolf, and, by extension, Dhanush, was a highlight. His reappearance in a sequel would be delightful.All-in-all, this is a slightly above-average enjoyable watch. It had its faults, but I didn't consider most of them to be as horrible as most people. To those with a stick up their ass: maybe use it to give your prostate an ol' massage, yeah? And to those without a prostate: get creative with that stick. Its use is better for that than hating everything about this film.I'm surprisingly quite interested in a sequel, which, as I'm writing this paragraph on Tuesday, has just been announced/confirmed to be happening. This film was left open-ended, and there was also the whole thing with the ""Old Man."" I was surprised to learn that the novel was the first of a series. I know. I know: how dare he be interested in a sequel of this sewer waste!? Well, deal with it.Anyway, I'm looking forward to the sequel and hope it's improved on certain aspects in this one. Even if it isn't, or not to a greater degree, I'll probably still enjoy watching it as long as it's like this one, entertainment-wise. Should this turn into a series of films and not just a sequel, that would be cool; I'm sure the novels are pretty good.(By the way, just as a throwaway comment, Callan Mulvey's accent in this film, and the sound of his voice, immediately reminded me of Small Hands/Aaron Thompson. If you don't know who he is, watch the video/scene with him, Owen Gray, and Kristen Scott. That's essentially the peak of 'p word.' Callan also sounded like Alex Hassell, Translucent in The Boys. And ironically, Alex looks similar to Small Hands. I doubt anyone cares about this, but I wanted to mention it.)","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Hey, I'm with you! Mine are also quite different. Also I don't remotely look like Ryan Gosling - especially not when you consider the one scene where he takes of his shirt (depending on what you like, you may find that arousing or abhorent I reckon, but I can't even imagine what he had to go through to get that ... physique - no pun intended) ... just saying.But it is not just the Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans show. There are some other players involved - like Billy Bob Thornton. Great as always - but also a kid, which was quite unexpected. For me at least. Also since I had no idea who was in the movie besides the two main actors, I also was pleasantly surprised by Ana De Armas and her appearance - fully clothed in case you are wondering.The Russo brothers call this their realistic take/movie. Considering they had a long Marvel (MCU) run, it is understandable that they might feel this way. All things considering though, this is quite often anything but realistic. I'm not complaining mind you - you can tell by my rating of course. But don't come into this with the expectation that it is real life. Or the stunts are actually plausible. Especially one extended action scene in Eastern Europe is quite over the top. Even with the physique Ryan has, he clearly had to be unable to walk to say the least after that.But the movie is not just full of action. It also has a lot of one-liners ... and a lot of recalls (planting and all that stuff). One is a bit odd (actually only really works when it is said the first time, about personal space, second time feels wrong - or not as funny as the Russos probably thought it would be), but overall they work really good.So while there is a lot of action and quite a bit of blood - there is also a lot of (silly) humor. And it works - the Russos have worked out how and what audiences might want. Because they are ""audience"" as well (sorry for the pun or bad writing, but you get the point).I was lucky enough to watch it on a big screen, before it hits the smaller screens on Netflix. But I think since it is well mixed, it will work either way. Shame the Russos allegedly have said something negative about cinemas though. I feel that that was not called for (if they actually said cinema viewings are elitist - they are not ... at all). But that aside, they know how to do an entertaining movie. Even if you may feel like there could be more to the ending than there was ...","237 out of 424 found this helpful.

An action thriller that does nothing new and doesn't even play the greatest hits in a particularly memorable fashion.Ryan Gosling is a fine leading man but sadly isn't able to do anything with his character's surface level depth and very hit and miss humour. Ana De Armas is equally let down by the material, resulting in an equally fine performance not worthy of the talent on screen.Chris Evans on the other hand, is able to give the strongest performance of the film by a country mile. He's clearly enjoying being able to play against type once again and it results in a bonafide scene stealing, larger than life character.The Russo Brothers direction is very mixed. The film is competently shot for the most part but hindered by some distracting and misplaced drone shots. The film has a few moments of style but is extremely dull and bland overall.The action sequences are equally hit and miss. Many are enjoyable on a base level but still too choppy or obscured by random things but a couple have genuine weight and impact. The CG is distractingly cheap which really breaks the larger set pieces.","212 out of 357 found this helpful.

Action movies don't need to be 'simple' or 'dumbed down'. There are great action flicks over decades that are praise-worthy and some of them are even defining sub-genres of their own like Heat or Bourne series and some are just standing alone like Ronin or John Wick and ageing like a good wine.Sadly, The Gray Man is neither of these things: it's not going to define any new genre, it's rather exploiting the well-established one and it won't stand the trial of time. It's rather algorithmic crowd pleaser that ticks familiar boxes, but while watching it you feel like you have seen all that before in a hundred of different places. It's not a bad movie per se, it's just ridiculously unimaginative although it packs some visual punch.","280 out of 493 found this helpful.

Movie Review -The Avengers director duo, Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, have teamed up for an action drama with Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, Ana De Armas, and Dhanush. What we expect from the trailer is an action-packed ride, and nothing else. Netflix has already done it last year with Red Notice, which broke records on OTT viewing. Now, with the same aim, the Russo Bros have tried their version of a spy-action-drama with a basic old plot and a lot of action. The duo deliver some high-octane action sequences to make fans happy, but the film doesn't know anything better about the storyline. The old cliches bore you despite a short runtime, with action sequences working as the saving grace.The film follows the hunt for the CIA's most skilled mercenary known as Court Gentry, aka Sierra Six (Ryan Gosling), who has accidentally uncovered dark secrets of the agency. He becomes a primary target and is hunted around the world by a psychopathic former colleague, Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans), and international assassins. Another CIA agent, Dani Miranda (Ana de Armas), accompanies Six just to save her reputation, while Lloyd calls upon a sexy Tamil friend, Avik (Dhanush), a merciless killer. The cat and mouse game between Lloyd and Six forms the crux of the rest of the story. While following a cliched plot, The Gray Man tries no variety at all, which hurts. The screenplay seems pacy due to back-to-back chase sequences and action stunts, but lacks interesting conflicts.Performance-wise, Ryan Gosling as Sierra Six is decent. Frankly, this isn't an acting-driven film, but still, the actors try to add something extra of their own, which is noticeable. Six's character is quite prominent because of Ryan's physics and emotional quotient. Chris Evans' gruesomeness as Lloyd and his never-care-for-anyone attitude with humour packs a good punch. However, the basic points like reliability and temperament are missing from his character. The female forces, Ana De Armas, Julia Butters and Alfre Woodard, have done well with their limited screen space, but they do play important roles in the film. Indian actor Dhanush has like a 10-minute role, and it's all about merciless and bloodshed action. Yes, he has his heart in the right place, which will surely please his die-hard fans.The technical aspects of The Gray Man are below par. Except for brilliant cinematography, the other technical aspects fail to leave a mark. Stephen F. Windon's camerawork may not be that great, but look out for those action scenes. The way he pans and shifts the camera in the darkness is indeed praiseworthy. The editing by Jeff Groth and Pietro Scalia has had a few problems coming continuously right from the beginning. It's an action-packed film alright; that's some extra boost for sure, but the background score doesn't grow as it should have been. The action stunts are enjoyable, though.The Russo Brothers have adopted the novel with no extra features, which makes things very corny. Also, their intention to start a franchise based upon a novel seems interesting. The reputation of the Avengers films has put tremendous pressure on Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, and I guess that's why anything they make looks underwhelming. Of course, not every film they make can be that big and marvellous, so it's okay to look for a different view through different perspectives. The Gray Man takes you on an action-packed ride filled with out-and-out merciless fight scenes and bloodshed, despite the weak story at the centre. So overall, it's a watchable affair for your eyes if you don't mind not putting extra strain on your brain.RATING - 5/10*","230 out of 409 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The critics say ""The Gray Man"" is bad - that's how you know it's good","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8341359/?ref_=tt_urv","darkreignn","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33659536/?ref_=tt_urv","16 July 2022","A non-stop thrill ride from beginning to end, ""The Gray Man"" boasts an impressive action set piece every ten to twenty minutes; so those with short attention spans - such as myself - can rejoice, as the Russo brothers have crafted a movie where viewer entertainment is top of mind.Holding a staggering 52% rotten critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, it should come as no surprise that audiences, contrarian as they are, are highly enjoying this movie. And while I often find my own opinion to sway side to side like a pendulum from the critic score to the viewer consensus, in the case of ""The Gray Man,"" I am planted firmly with the audience. Admittedly, the critics, pretentious as they seem to be, may or may not have some valid complaints; the film can be said to have a lack of innovation and ingenuity with its storytelling, and in terms of its purported ""bland"" visuals, the movie is rather dark, which caused me to squint and strain my eyes in the theatre. Besides those two things, however, ""The Gray Man"" is a super solid action film that constantly pumps adrenaline into the veins of its viewers.With the breathtaking, neon drenched opening sequence, you will immediately recognize that there is competency behind, and in front of, the camera. Ryan Gosling and the gorgeous Ana de Armas are thrust front and center in the introduction, and their stoic, serious performances also demonstrate a dedication to quality - this isn't your typical Netflix production that's meant to only be viewed on your laptop monitor. A masterclass in tension building, the opening action sequence alone will tell you all you need to know about ""The Gay Man"" - it delivers. Expertly helmed with smooth transitions from hiding in plain sight stealth to John Wick style shootouts and Bourne-esque hand-to-hand combat sequences, the first fifteen to twenty minutes of the movie contains some of the most exciting and impressive looking scenes of action that I've seen in a film, period. From Gosling silently taking out enemies in the midst of New Years fireworks to engaging in a fist fight in the middle of said fireworks display, my jaw was planted on the ground as soon as this movie started. And the intensity didn't stop there.A fight on a military aircraft that ends in a desperate dive back down to solid ground? Check. A city market shootout that turns into a city-wide car chase? Check. A sneaky house invasion that goes from quiet to guns blazing at the drop of a hat? Check. With ""The Gray Man,"" the Russo brothers put their talent of action on full display by making literally every single action sequence seem like it should be taking place at the climax of the film. After every set piece I found myself thinking, ""Surely things can't get any bigger from here,"" and the next set piece always upped the ante and blew my expectations out of the water. The minimal use of shaky camera and hyperactive editing will also ensure a clear line of sight with most - if not all - of the action, empowering viewers to feel absolutely immersed in what's occurring on screen.Ryan Gosling is as handsome, muscular, and attractive as ever in his role as Six, a man who has a particular set of skills that you probably don't want to be on the receiving end of. Foregoing the quiet hero performance that so many other movies wanted him to emulate, ""The Gray Man"" allows Gosling to be charismatic, a suave talker who is as smooth with his words as he is with his proclivity toward violence. Chris Evans also got jacked for his performance as Lloyd Hansen, a merciless killer who actively enjoys inflicting pain on others. The film pits Six and Lloyd against each other in a Evans v Gosling match up that I never even knew I wanted. Evans looks like he is having an absolute blast in his role, seemingly more comfortable playing a villain than he was as a superhero. And as a Gosling fan I may be a bit biased, but I of course thought he was great in the movie; there is no Oscar-worthy acting at play here, but it's clear that everyone is playing their part professionally.""The Gray Man"" is a movie that is being lambasted by critics - that's the only sign you need that it's actually going to be good. This is a very thrilling action film that I am legitimately looking forward to watching again when it releases on Netflix. If you're a fan of action movies, you cannot go wrong here. Sure, the film may have benefited by being a little bit brighter visually, and there were a few moments of iffy editing, but none of the cons overpower the astounding action pros.","276 out of 549 found this helpful.

Additionally some actors give the distinct impression that they're hamming it up for the cameras rather than playing a character in service to a story. On the other hand Evans does a very good job playing a psychopathic foil to Gosling's surprisingly sympathetic hero.The good news is the movie gets better as it progresses, leaving you feeling on a high at the end, but the questionable stylistic choices towards the beginning stop this action flick from approaching greatness.If you're looking for a quality action movie look no further, but be prepared for some bumps along the way.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Since this is my first time watching their non-MCU movie so I won't be comparing it. This is just my initial thought about The Gray Man.The Gray Man is about CIA's most skilled agent, Court Gentry codename Sierra Six who accidentally uncovers dark agency secrets. He's being hunted by an international assassin with a bounty on his head and forced to go on the run. The only person he can trust is fellow agent, Dani Miranda.The plot is very cliché, it has been told many times before. It almost reaches the point where these kinds of stories are being overdone in a movie and i don't think it's bad thing though, but what makes them different from one another is the action sequences it brings. The Gray Man actions is top-notch, especially the hand-to-hand combat, it's so clean. Though some big action scene contains too much CGI (there's one scene that looks like a video game cutscene). I'm not expecting this movie has some CGI in the first place, i thought it will be more practical considering the budget is at 200 million.Ryan Gosling did a great job in this one, and Chris Evan proves his acting range once again, he can play a wise superhero and a sociopath. Their interaction everytime they meet or talk is hilarious cause of their contrast character. Ana De Armas should lead an action/spy movie, her role in No Time To Die was just the beginning. And Dhanush, it's was my first time seeing him but he's definitely the scene stealer, we need to see more of him in this type of movie.Overall, this is one of those movies that you just have to enjoy regardless of the plot. I'm not sure if it's worth a rewatch but I don't think it's forgettable either, The Gray Man still has some great moments.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

America in my memory, but his poor acting in this movie deleted the great performances from the past.I would watch it after 4-6 beers to make me fall asleep, but sober and with good intentions, this is unwatchable.

Why is that John Wick or Damon's Bourne, as unreal as they were, get good scores while The Gray Man has to put up a fight to get a good report card?Ok, so it's a gourmet combo made up of elements of Bourne, Wick, Bond, and countless other over-the-top action movies. But why should it be made feel guilty for that? I mean, we all cheered the other movies way back from Die Hard, no matter now corny they were, so what's the gripe if Gray Man borrowed from its predecessors, and churned, what turns out to be a highly entertaining movie?Great SFX, and camera work. A thrill a moment of a ride. Ridiculous plot - I get it. But that hardly differentiates it from the rest of the marbles already in the bag.Plus, the actors look like they're having fun. Ok, on that account perhaps give a pass to Billy Bob Thornton, who plays Billy Bob from other movies like Fast. But the rest are invested well enough to keep us glued right to the end. Ryan Gosling could play a 100 year old tree and still elicit enough emotion to make you sense that's there's a lot more underneath his disinterested demeanour; Chris Evans hams up his bad guy role without making you feel he's hamming it up. And you know he's hamming it up cos his 'stache makes him resemble an 80s Freddie Mercury; who grows that kinda facial weed in the 21st century? And Ana De Armas remains reliable as she has in her previous acts, further cementing her ability to traverse both dramatic and action roles with ease.This is the quintessential action pop-corn movie. That's all there is to it. None of the heavy philosophy ala Dune or the hoo-rah machoism of Maverick. Yes, you can park your brains safely outside the movie hall, and still feel helluva satisfied when you go back home. And sometimes, that's all we want after a hard day's work.","30 out of 52 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Classic Spy Movie With Elaborate Action Scenes, Sizeable Cast And Charismatic Lead Actors","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8353939/?ref_=tt_urv","rannynm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1257208/?ref_=tt_urv","20 July 2022","The Gray Man is, first and foremost, a classic spy movie. The draw of its elaborate action scenes, the size of its cast and the charisma of its lead performances keep it afloat in the pool of familiarity.Court Gentry (Ryan Gosling) is a CIA operative who carries out killings of whomever they desire, as part of a deal he made decades ago to dodge prison time. On a job in Bangkok, as he dies, his target reveals the unexpected kinship he holds with Court and gives him a drive containing damning information about the people Court works for. These two discoveries force him to drop everything and go on the run with the intel. Back at the CIA, Court's boss (Regé-Jean Page) is furious about the intel leak and Court's betrayal. In response, Court's boss calls in a former operative named Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans). Rejected by the CIA for his violent, psychotic methods and his lack of concern to amend them, Lloyd has no qualms about eliminating whoever stands between him and his mission's objective. And so, a cat and mouse chase begins between Court and Lloyd, a battle of wits and ability that tracks the entire globe.The Gray Man has a lot going on besides Chris Evans and Ryan Gosling, but they are absolutely the reasons to see this movie. Ryan Gosling tones Court down- you really believe he was nurtured in his line of work, not born into it. Gosling is eternally tired in the role. Every obstacle, every adversary gets the same tossed off ""Are we really doing this?"" look from Gosling. Yet there's also an eternal spark: his wit, as if the opportunity to fire off a quip is what keeps him going through stab wounds and raining gunfire. The quipping brings something new to this spy archetype-the sense that this is just a particularly tough day on the job for Court and Gosling communicates that really well.Every performance has its equal opposite reaction; so the yin to Gosling's yang is Chris Evans as Lloyd Hansen. Where Gosling is just barely limping his way from explosion to explosion, Evans is confidently striding after him. He walks into this movie with a prominent mustache on his lip, or ""trashstache,"" as Court calls it, and a smile on his face, ready to do his thing. Lloyd enjoys his job. He waxes poetic about the joys of improv in torturing and the opportunity to kill the prized asset of his former employee only sweetens the deal and raises his spirits. Evans is whistling and skipping as he inflicts government-sanctioned mayhem. It's fun to watch him play a character this unraveled and unafraid of any repercussions for his psychotic actions.The Gray Man also features setpiece upon setpiece of impressive action. It's not always the best-presented, and the editing can be discombobulating, but there are points where directors Russos find their footing. And the magnitude of some of the confrontations between Court and enemy forces also make seeing this movie worthwhile. A tram racing through the streets of Prague with Ryan Gosling dodging enemy fire, for example, or a fistfight in the middle of a firework launcher with fireworks erupting all around-there are moments in The Gray Man that are undeniably cool.There is no real lesson to The Gray Man other than maybe staying out of the hitman industry. However, there are moments of action in The Gray Man where scale and invention and star power all line up for something that feels truly thrilling. Even if it doesn't reinvent the wheel and it feels as if The Gray Man lacks an ""X-factor"" to set it apart from other cinematic spy fare, it's a reminder of why the genre is so irresistible: the stars, the scope, and elite operatives with big personalities and shifting allegiances.I give The Gray Man 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults, for language, intense action, and multiple instances of torture. The Gray Man is in theaters for a brief period starting July 15, 2022, and launches on Netflix globally on July 22, 2022.

It's more or less what you'd expect from a ""secret agent gets betrayed by his organisation"" type film. But let's be real: when you're watching a movie like this, the story doesn't have to be groundbreaking. It just has to have good special effects and good action sequences.On that front, The Gray Man delivers. The action sequences are some of the best ever done in a Netflix movie. It's quite clear that they've made pretty good use of the huge budget this movie had.Really, my big issue with some of the action sequences is that the directors were obviously a little bit reluctant to light some of the night scenes properly. I don't know why this is, but a lot of directors seem to be completely oblivious to how much light a digital camera loses, especially during darkly lit scenes. It wouldn't have killed them to turn a light on for some of the night action scenes; the choreography was fine and would have held up.But y'know, beyond that, this movie is fine. It's probably going to be remembered as one of the better action movies of 2022.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

You've likely heard, and maybe used, the old adage, ""everything but the kitchen sink."" It's typically meant to emphasize the inclusion of many unrelated and often unnecessary elements into a conversation or event. It also provides a description of the strategy filmmaking brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo have taken with the action sequences in the highest budget Netflix original movie to date. Of course the Russo brothers have directed numerous Marvel movies, including AVENGERS: ENDGAME (2019), so subtlety is never anticipated in their films. If you are curious to know what kind of kitchen sink you get for $200 million, Anthony and Joe show us: lots of guns, a global trek to various countries, more big guns, plenty of characters - some relevant, some not, even larger guns and weapons, lots of rayon, and the destruction of a town square in Prague.Fans of turbo-charged action films such as the John Wick and Jason Bourne films will likely be quite satisfied with the set pieces, stunts, and manic gun fights and fist fights that are packed into a two-hour run time. There is so much bouncing around the globe that it's kind of difficult to keep up - especially since there doesn't seem to be any particular reason for all of the globetrotting (well, other than it's pretty unusual). I couldn't keep track of every locale, but we definitely visited Bangkok, Austria, Croatia, and Czechoslovakia. And that's beyond Washington, D. C., and Langley, where we spend time in dark offices.Co-director Joe Russo co-wrote the screenplay with frequent Russo Brothers collaborators Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and it was adapted from Mark Greany's novel (the first in a series). Ryan Gosling stars as Court Gentry, codename Sierra Six, a CIA black ops hit man recruited directly from prison by veteran CIA agent Donald Fitzroy (Oscar winner Billy Bob Thornton). This is Gosling's first movie in 4 years (FIRST MAN, 2018) and it's nice to have him back in a role that will recertify his 'man card' before next year's BARBIE movie. As you might expect, Gosling's Six is cool as a cucumber, popping off quips, and stoic in the face of adversity. In fact, much is made of his character's 'street cred', despite most every scene involving colossal mistakes, should-be death encounters, and enough mayhem to make Allstate jealous. Six is so cool that he has less reaction to being shot or stabbed than I have when I stub my toe on the leg of the bed.When Six's mission goes awry due to his human compassion, three things happen. First, Agent Dani Miranda (Ana de Armas) bails him out (the first of a few). Second, his target gives him advice and the always mysterious thumb drive with incriminating evidence; and third, his corrupt station chief, Denny Carmichael (Rege-Jean Page, ""Bridgerton"") throws a tantrum and hires a psychopath to track down Six and eliminate him. The psychopath is Lloyd Hansen played by Chris Evans, sporting an evil mustache and resort casual attire. It seems Mr. Evans is having fun with the villainous role that he hopes will put distance between his career and the Captain America role he has embodied for more than a decade. The argument could be made that he overplays his hand here, but he does get to spout the already infamous line, ""If you want to make an omelet, you gotta kill some people"".Other players here include the always terrific Alfre Woodard as a former station chief, Jessica Henwick (Bugs from THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS), Dhanush as yet another hired assassin, Shea Whigham in flashbacks, and Julia Butters as the 'damsel in distress'. You might recall Ms. Butters' scene-stealing turn as the precocious child actor in Tarantino's ONCE UPON A TIME ... IN HOLLYWOOD. This film's title is derived from the term for a CIA operative who effectively moves around without being noticed or remembered (the opposite of a Kardashian). The ironic thing is that Gosling's Six is almost never undetected. He is frequently in fights, shootouts, car chases, and either causing or escaping explosions. Even the Russo's ""gray"" lacks subtlety! It makes perfect sense that the film's cinematographer, Stephen F Windon, is best known for his work on multiple entries in ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise. Here he employs some supersonic drone shots in order to add further hyper-activity to the proceedings. Again, this one is for extreme action fans, not those looking for a brainy spy-thriller.Opens in theaters on July 15, 2022 and on Netflix beginning July 22, 2022.","20 out of 52 found this helpful.

The acting is professional, the story moves fairly consistently, and the action scenes are meant to inspire awe, and they do. If the viewer is looking for new innovation in the spy caper genre, he or she is likely to leave disappointed. It means to entertain with lavish action set pieces. There is raw physicality in every scene: every punch feels the crunch. The film does an outstanding job of letting the main character with his motivations and inner conflict be left in a conflicted and interpretive state. One hopes this can be exported in future installments. Special consideration is given to performances by Chris Evans and Alfre Woodard. Evans portrays the primary antagonist: Lloyd Hansen. The performance walks the thin line of despicable and alluring. Evans as an actor brings such an assured physicality to his performance. A true joy. And finally, Alfre Woodard as the mentor makes the most of limited screen time. With every glance you sense her history with the agency, the country, and her protégée. Remarkable stuff, hope she can return in some capacity in future installments. Yes, all the plot points will ring familiar, but I encourage viewers to just relax and enjoy the massive spectacle and aim to entertain. It's got a game cast, stunts, and great locations; most notably Prague.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

It is a very big budget movie, almost 200 million dollars which is somewhere near 1600 Cr INR, a lot could have been better. The bad part was the continuity in different countries. The Russo Brothers went almost all over the world from Prague to Coatia to France to wherenot, but just to show where the Agent can hide? That was unnecessary spending to be honest. And the same mistakes that most movies are doing today, how many bullets can a handgun shoot? There were some really good chilling action scenes. Dhanush played his role beautifully. He looked like the Mad Dog of The Raid. His fierce action timing makes you feel he is born for action but the world will be totally surprised when they know he is a method actor of India. Action movies don't need to flow simply and smoothly and are sensationalized in every 2nd scene. Sadly the Gray man doesn't explore any new genre and follows the same well established action and it wont stand the trial of time. It algorithmically tried to tick all boxes but fell short with randomness. The only saving grace were action scenes with a very weak storyline. Ana de Armas should be given more action movies. She is hot and the audience loves her actions. Watch it for Dhanush if you are from India. The last fight between Evans and Gosling especially with that small knife is too good.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I was never bored and always into what was happening on screen for the duration of this movie.The cons for this film for me can all be boiled down to my header; yet another modern action film that sacrifices story for action. Action movies, the good ones anyways, used to be smartly written and story driven, with the action sequences more of an afterthought while still being well executed. Nowadays, it is a barrage of 10-15 minute action sequences strung together with as much CGI as can be infused. And I've personally become a little desensitized to the flash. I'd love more heart. There were a plethora of interesting relationships in this movie I would have been happy to see more of.But, alas, that was not the case.

While the Gray man makes its way up due to its Stunts and should have been given an R rating, it feels more like a forgettable Mission Impossible movie. Performance also plays a key role with Ryan Gosling putting up his best to be a smooth and action character, he undoubtedly feels like a miscast actor. Evans however makes it worth a watch as he acts as a tough and brutal ,yet street smart character, Ana De Armas still did her fantastic performance with playing alongside Ryan while Dhanush gives one of his best performance as a secondary Antagonist while having a brief screen time. Criticism plays in giving a very un-detail story and lack of dialogue and while the cast is of top end actors it still feels only a one time watch.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

In the present days, Gentry is the agent Six (Ryan Gosling) and he is assigned with agent Dani Miranda (Ana de Armas) to assassinate a suspect of selling security secrets to enemies in Bangkok. They fight and before dying, the man tells to Six that he was Four from the Sierra program and gives a pendant with an encrypted drive disclosing the corruption of CIA director Denny Carmichael (Regé-Jean Page). He sends the drive to former CIA agent Margaret Cahill (Alfre Woodard) in Prague and asks Fitzroy to extract him from Bangkok. Meanwhile, Carmichael hires the psychopath mercenary Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans), who kidnaps Fitzroy's niece Claire (Julia Butters) to force Fitzroy to betray Six. He escapes and convinces Dani to help him to save Claire, and they go to Vienna to find where she is using her peacemaker. But Hansen is hunting him down using a team of mercenaries.""The Gray Man"" is an action film with the excellent Ryan Gosling in the lead role. The flawed plot is stupid and the viewer must shutdown his brain and enjoy the action. In Prague, instead of the mercenaries break in Margaret's house, they prefer to shoot from the street.

But that's it. There's a total absence of character. Why is it that most of the big Hollywood actors play the same kind of role no matter what? I mean, this guy is just unbelievable. I've seen almost all his films of the last decade and they should just start naming his characters Ryan gosling. From action packed blockbusters to cheesy cake frosting sweet musicals, he's always that same dude. And this time he was lacking something that one thing he always had. A really good co-star. You liked Ana and Ryan in Bladerunner? Unfortunately she doesn't come anywhere near that performance. Her short appearance in James Bond in a kind off similar role was ten times better than this. Which might have been the biggest disappointment and yet somehow was to be expected as I think she's not a great actor. What she more than makes up with looks and innocent-like sexiness. This time she isn't able to arouse and tingle. When you come to the conclusion that mr captain America is the most entertaining says a lot. Because that performance wasn't all too good as well. Gosling needs others to make up for his zero and always non present character depth whom were not to be found in this one, unfortunately. Lots of big names, some I really was looking forward to, for example Billy Bob. But also the rising stars were flat and uninspiring. And who is responsible for whatever happened to Jessica Henwick? I hardly recognised her and the few things I've seen of her, I thought she was lovely. But this!? What was she, or her management, thinking? No no no, what a shame! She obviously did her best, but this is bad casting. Career endingly bad. So in conclusion, a meagre 6 for not completely wasting 2 hours of my time. But that's because most of the actors have this charming something that you wish they do well and make you care about them in a way I can't explain. Ana, billy Bob, Ryan, Jessica, I want them to do well but they didn't live up to my already low-ish expectations.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you enjoy mindless action scenes, you'll enjoy running this in the background.Ryan was okay, Evans was good as a villain. Ana was severely underutilized, I liked her cameo in Bond more than her full role in this one but she's a force to be reckoned with and somebody needs to really consider her in a Bourne/007 kinda role.Dhanush was good in the limited time he got, but I don't know if he was specifically cast for pleasing the Indian audience, if this is just plain tokenism or if this was a proper well-thoughtout decision - maybe all of the above - but I'd love to see a spin off of Avik San as well.That's pretty much all about the movie. Could have been a great one, but it ended up being, for me, just an okay-ish movie.Is it just me or does Ryan Gosling look like Emran Hashmi with a French-beard? XDAnd, can someone PLEASE cast Ana de Armas in a Bond-style role and build a franchise around her beating up bad guys?","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Despite Gosling's best efforts, the film falls flat, delivering a lackluster and uninspired experience.Gosling's performance as the titular Gray Man is solid, as usual. He brings his trademark intensity to the role and elevates the material. However, the script and direction fail to support him, leaving him stranded in a sea of mediocrity. The film's action set pieces are uninspired, and the plot feels like a rehash of other, better, action movies.The film's pacing is also problematic, dragging in some places and feeling rushed in others. The world-building is also lacking, and the film never fully engages the audience in its world and characters.Overall, ""The Gray Man"" is a disappointing experience that fails to live up to the potential of its talented lead actor.

UNTIL this movie, his portrayal of such a cool badass and also extremely likeable without any of those traits taking away from any other. Also Evans was phenomenal, i was addicted to his banter which he had with...everyone. Julia Butters did a great job. As the smart ass young kid, a role that usually ends up hammed up, insufferable and irritating she played it perfectly making the character likeable and appreciated. Especially the relationship between her and Six.

It's not terribly deep (but the Bond films that this owes a lot to aren't either), so it boils down to how well everything is done on screen. Lots of car chases, explosions, fights, and fast edits and cuts done at a smooth professional level ... all of that would make me give this just a 6/10. It all fits pretty routinely into the recent trend for shadowy, amoral goings-on within the CIA or whatever the organization-of-the-month is that the hero has to combat. But I bump it up one more notch mainly because of Ryan Gosling's performance in the title role. They wrote some really good dialog for him and he's got a great, low-key ironic delivery style that is refreshing.Chris Evans is fine too as a wacko rogue agent that we, the audience, are supposed to hate from the start (and we do). Nothing going on here is all that subtle. In recent roles Evans seems to be trying to get as far away as possible from that Captain America persona that he also did so well for years. Ana de Armas, Jessica Henwick, and Billy Bob Thornton are good additions too.Just like the Bourne films did for Matt Damon, it looks like the versatile Gosling can be quite an effective action movie hero. I expect some sequels.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In many places it gives the impression that the screenwriters ignored the books of the series that go beyond the first volume. Some important storylines from the books can no longer be implemented in possible sequels because the basics have been destroyed. It is also not clear why the elementary loner image from the books was abandoned and ""The Gray Man"" suddenly becomes a team player in the film.In the end, the impression remains that a lot of potential was wasted. The book, which is over 400 pages long, or the 11-hour-long audiobook, is actually much more exciting than the film. An implementation as a series, as Amazon Prime has shown with ""The Terminal List"" (based on a book by Jack Carr) or ""Reacher"" (based on a book by Lee Child), would certainly have been a much better solution.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is evident in their 'choices' but this movie is insanely good. It's a spy thriller of a guy turned spy who is chic and sauve with his role. He slides away through the scuffle and jam like it's nothing. Gosling plays a slick spy who isn't fazed at all by violence or assault. He simply moves with panache. The camera and cinematography is amazing. It moves smoothly and shows the viewer what other directors need to have. The story is alright but this is for the thrill seeking junkies who want a dose of this world which they only know from hearsay. There are some things which could've been improved on but the action scenes are phenomenal. They really made a picturesque movie. Don't trust the other reviews. Trust me this is fantastic.

When really analysing it? It has a poor screen play and the pacing is way too high. Similar to other action movies of the last decade the plot moves at a fast pace (something like taken) except here we are constantly moving from one location to the other with a set piece occurring at each one hardly staying anywhere for more than 5 minutes apart from the climax.Character goes somewhere, bad people turn up (sometimes out the blue), a fight occurs, on to the next location.The CGI is not great, and given a serious amount of over the top action you have to suspend your disbelief pretty often and instead of thinking ""oh that's cool"" you just think ""that is ridiculous"".The plot is simple enough, something with so much action can't exactly be Shakespeare, but there isn't much in the way of character development.There is a seriously heavy use of crazy drone camera shots in this movie.The best way to sum up my thoughts watching this movie was that it is written and portrayed like you are playing a computer game. You movie through the story, wave after wave of bad guys attacking you. You meet mini bosses, you defeat them and move onto the next who is harder than the last. The action scenes are over the top with everyone jumping around and fighting like they are karate experts who also happen to be into their parkour. The main characters run around shooting guns and rocket launchers with no thought or effort and hit their target whilst everyone else can't hit a barn door. I particularly laughed at a scene where
Ana De Armand is running full pelt under gun fire hip firing a grenade launcher with pin point accuracy though you have to arch your shots to hit a target.As I said, it is an OK watch, it's fine, I musky enjoyed it but the plot was weak, the pacing was all off, awful CGI and over the top action. Just suspend your disbelief.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This one comes out of the gate quite strong with a quick exposition and a darn good action sequence in the first ten minutes. What follows though is the standard man-on-the-run-fare with the usual beats.The movie is littered with tropes that we have seen a thousand times, like the retired mentor who has a daughter/niece that gets used as leverage/damsel because how else can you inject some drama?Unfortunately, the action gets more and more cartoonish (too much CGI) throughout the runtime and it's sometimes even hard to see what's happening. It also enforces the feeling that our hero is quite invincible. Several persons get shot, stabbed, tortured and hit endlessly but they brush it off like a videogame, except the henchmen of course.The positive things to note are that some of the actors are giving good performances like Gosling, Ana de Armas, BillyBob Thornton and Chris Evans. Evans in particular has tremendous fun, but his character feels also very empty (like many Marvel villains). His sole purpose is to stop our protagonist, nothing more personal or any interesting motives here. He's just a psycho but I also didn't cheer when he finally gets the short end of the stick.The other good thing I can say is that the movie passes by pretty quickly, the dialogue is snappy and that's about it. It's an alright movie to pass an evening but nothing more.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

When I say typical action film I mean the ordinary type of stories , CIA hiring mercenaries , dark secrets ... However ,they tried to create a dramatic aspect with the girl the thing I found interesting .And what was unexpected is action scenes to be typical too, Russo brothers failed to make something impressive except for those magnificent drone shots ,they were more of like a freestyle thing ,it was remarkable to be fair .And here we come to the acting performances , As we all know action movies are easier for actors , having a charisma and a good training will do the job ,but Ryan Gosling have been charismatic in the laziest way I've ever seen , his cold experience didn't work for me .I really enjoyed watching Chris Evans playing the villain ,being a psychopathic with mustache ,and it's always good to see the lovely Ana De Armas ,she did just fine .But really how this is a 200 million dollars budget film? Maybe it's because of the fireworks and the flames !

As a popcorn guzzling fight fest to enjoy on the big screen with proper surround sound it is simply good fun. Chris Evan's character is the standout one: a pumped up moustachioed psycho who is quite happy to blow up half of Prague. Ryan Gosling is solid, but his character, and Ana de Armas's, has no real empathy with the viewer, being sketched only superficially. I think negative reviewers are misreading the intent of this film.

What's mind boggling is with how a movie with so much action can feel like white noise. You've seen it before...many times. A highly trained CIA agent learns more than he should thus the hand that feeds him seeks to crush him. Between many eye-catching scenes and endless gunfire, the agent is hunted down by his equal who has an endless supply of soon to be dead bodies. All while a team observes and pulls levers from a command center. Will he be able to survive to shine light on what he's learned? Don't get me wrong, it's still entertaining action spanning well-known international locations with major car manufacturers working to get their fancy top spec vehicles some screen time. This can easily be compared with Bourne Identity. I guess why I was less than enthralled was I just didn't care about the characters. An attempt at character development was made but to no effect.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

So, I was really looking forward to this one. (We don't talk about Red Notice.)Unfortunately, the best evaluation I can give it is 'it's okay'. The CGI ist horrible at times making wish they had spent much more on it. The story is pretty bland and you've already seen variations of this probably a dozen times already. The characters seem really interesting, but aren't given much room to develop beyond the surface level characterization. The same applies to the antagonists. While I think Chris Evans did a good job in portraying the unhinged Lloyd, his puppeteers did not. They seemed like goofy villains instead of the high achiever Harvard alumini they were supposed to be. I'd have gone with intimidating and calculating instead of goofy.

This movie doesn't help their resume. The Gray Man is a mindless summer action flick. One that will probably be instantly forgotten once watched by many. Everything from the story to the acting is just so average. The Russo brothers gave their best attempt at making a John Wick movie. Even with a great lead performance from Gosling (who carries the hell out of this movie) they still failed to achieve that kind of greatness. With all that being said, there is one aspect of The Gray Man that is great, the action sequences and set pieces. The action is amazing, and while it's not at the level of John Wick, it's not too far off. Overall this is a slightly above average action movie that's worth a watch on Netflix if you've got nothing else to watch. Comparable to another slightly above average Netflix action movie, Extraction. Great action, good lead performance, zero substance whatsoever.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's the story of Sierra Six, an agent of the Sierra program gone rogue after a mission where he is assigned to kill one of his own, another Sierra agent. It stars Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas. The movie is packed with explosions, guns, combats, and classic good/evil characters. I think it's a classical action movie while revealing some novelties here and there which makes up a good experience.I have mixed feelings about the story and characters. The direction that Six takes and his motivations are confusing at times and even out of character. The story starts with search for truth but changes to rescue mission toward the third act. Even the unsatisfying ending makes you wonder about the characters motivations for his insubordinations in the first place. I know the story is an adoption of a book with the same name, however, I feel it is a lame excuse to say that's how it is in the book!Having said that, this movie is packed with other things to be enjoyable. Some of the dialogues are funny and innovative in an action movie (you don't throw a loaded gun). Also, the locations, the action sequences and the combats keep you on the edge of your seat half the time and it never gets boring. The back stories told non-linearly adds to the experience and reveals more as you progress into the move. You never get bored during the movie and would enjoy every moment.In conclusion, if seen as an ""action movie"" with not that high of an expectation, The Gray Man can be a great movie and a definite must watch.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Lloyd Hansen is crazy enough to make it work. Forget skulking around, this guy is willing to pour more and more guns into an area. He'd have been wasted in a spoof, given how maniacal he gets as the action heats up.In comparison, Ryan Gosling is a robot in his delivery. I mean, at one point they literally call his character a robot based on how he acts. As befits this genre, he's pretty bullet/bomb/knife proof and goes from set piece action scene to set piece action scene, as he carries out his missions, alongside the prerequisite lucky and seemingly impossible escapes, that keep the film moving along. It may seem the same result, but in the big Prague scene, I was rooting for the bad guys to fail more than for him to escape.Ultimately, I wonder if they've left enough at the end to make a second film (or maybe more), given there seems a few too many loose ends that could do with tying up (or just characters that need tying up).","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Fast forward 18 years and Six is in Bangkok to take out a baddie, assisted by the compulsory ethnic bad ass girl. Turns out, the CIA guy running the show and his - not surprisingly - ethnic female colleague are corrupted and Six is forced to go rogue.

Expect the usual OTT chase scenes, with lots of guns, explosions and armies of mercenaries taken out by two guys.Last but not least, all the boxes for inclusivity are checked, and some more... there is even a Tamil guy supposedly bad, however you know that given his exotic origins he cannot be really that and he's needed to come back to episode 2 of this tripe.""Boring"" as Billy Bob actually say.","46 out of 89 found this helpful.

Actions scenes are fun and there is plenty of it. But story and plot are mediocre, makes it a forgettable experience even right after viewing.About the acting; Cris Evans egocentric, megalomaniac villain role was executed really well, he is the shining star character in this movie.But the best perforce was the little girl played by Julia Butters, the range she shows in every shot is aw-inspiring. Honestly rest of the cast should take acting lessons from her. If this talented kid keeps it up than she has the potential of becoming one of the most exceptional actress in future.The main man Ryan Gosling has the physic to become an action hero, but his ken doll-esque stoic performance was dry and as flavorless as cardboard in this movie.Ana de Armas, is too cute, innocent looking and petite to be a believable gun totting, building jumping badass action star. I have seen her good action in other movies but for this role it was not a good fit.Dhanush played a role of a badass gun for hire, but his performance was short, weird and not at all intimidating, it is hard to pull of for a scrawny Indian guy as a badass no matter how well the action choreography.Jessica Henwick's character was whiny, lame and as useful as a prop table. Honestly I don't know why this role was written.As a mastermind villain Regé-Jean Page's role is as un-intimidating as it can be, the worst casting in this film. Rather than becoming a menacing main villain his performance felt like a just graduated out of business school brat intern.Overall it is just a time pass action flick.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I thought the characters and plot were a bit weak in the source material. With the exception of ""Six"" and to a lesser degree, ""Claire"", the character depth is even weaker here. They tried a few things that did work better than the book, at least in this medium, but a lot of the weaknesses of the source material are magnified when condensed down to 2hrs. To be fair, I'm not looking for a Merchant-Ivory level of depth and intrigue, but there were some great actors portraying characters with a depth, purpose, motivations, and backstory were far below their level and capability. It's a shame to see talent like this wasted on hollow characters.Action sequences were great. Really, great action in the film. If that is all you're looking for, you may love the film.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's too long, there is too much action (yes, I think there is a limit) and too much gun violence. I know some of you might not agree with me, but I really did not enjoy seeing people hit each other and shoot up a whole city for the sake of a whim of one rotten apple.Granted the fight choreography is well done (this seems to be an ongoing trend in recent movies) it gets old real quick without a supporting story. This film being based on a book, had to potential to avoid this pitfall but- did not, making it just a mediocre Bond movie (reference to 007 in-movie acknowledged)
The story is unfortunately a bland one. A CIA agent (Ryan Gosling ""Six"") is being crossed by someone from the inside and they spend the entire movie proving it, along with idiocracies like driving cross-country with a tuk-tuk or blowing up a plane with a single hand-gun bullet or a USB-drive that can be read but not copied (total BS btw)
As far as acting goes, I did not feel any warmth from any of the characters, Ana de Armas giving her one of her weaker performances, Billy Bob Thornton supplies his regular low-quality acting, and others are ok but when the movie is all concentrated on shooting there is not much time for character development. Same goes for CGI, it is almost ok but does show its limits in heavy scenes, such as the chase scene.To its credit, this movie did make me crack a smile from time to time and it has some good catch-phrases like ""who throws a loaded gun"" but it was not enough to elevate it above the average action movie. Overall I would recommend only to people who can't get enough of Bond-like movies and are not turned off by action overload, I personally, had enough of it.Exact score: 61 / 100.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I know this is a shock to you but some of us are not from the USA. I am sick of the sense of entitlement in these movies that the USA can have undercover 'black ops' in any country they wish and murder law enforcement officers whenever they wish without consequence. It is a constant subliminal message that the USA is more important than other countries. Guns aren't cool, the USA isn't great and this horrible public penis waving needs to stop. Why do they want to believe that their country is full of clandestine organisations bumping off their own citizens? Wasn't that their justification for invading Iraq? Chris Evans' character is a preposterous cartoon and the second best Ryan in Holywood is indestructible. It's a globe trotting barrel of nonsense wrapped up in a hand stitched quilt of jingoism.

The Russo brothers have turned out a fantastic movie very much in the vein of John Wick, only dare I say, slightly more believable. There are no magic bullet deflecting suits and the hero gets the stuffing kicked out of him plenty of times, so you never totally feel he's as unstoppable as Mr W, which keeps you wondering how he's going to get out of the next fight.But there is a good story, plenty of locations and some amazing fights. If you want to enjoy yourself for a while then definitely watch. I hope they can turn this into a series and develop the story further. Well done all.

All the archetypes you would expect are also present and played well by a stellar cast. Chris Evans is unhinged antagonist, Billy Bob Thornton is retired mentor, Rege-Jean Page is crooked politicain and Ana De Armas is the good agent caught in the middle. The plot is just as cookie cutter, involving Gossling being hunted by the people he used to work, computer files nobody was meant to see and hostages needing rescued.Of course, all these things are tropes for a reason and done well (like they are here) equal an enjoyable movie. And the Grey Man is an enjoyable movie, with exciting, well excecuted set pieces and great looking globetrotting location shots. It gets pretty ridiculous, with CIA affiliated Chris Evans ordering his men to gun down police officers in allied countries but thats all part of the fun.Rather less fun is being left with a massively unsatisfying ending. The film is far too interested in trying to set up an extended universe (guess the Russos just cant help themselves) and as a result is afraid to resolve anything. This has the opposite result to the one intented as its hard to be excited about more stories in a generic spy world when they can't even finish one. Want to find out who the ""Old Man"" is? Want to see more of the ""Lone Wolf""? Not now I don't.Essentially, your enjoyment of The Grey Man will depend largely on how you take things being mostly the same when the credits roll as they were twenty minutes in. If that doesn't bother you this is a fun caper well worth a couple of hours.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The book is ALWAYS better than the movie. That said, Anthony and Joe Russo - apparently of Marvel fame - have overseen a visually spectacular movie with some excellent action scenes and Ryan Gosling as Courtland Gentry aka The Gray Man aka Sierra Six is an engaging lead, and Gentry is definitely a bad hombre. Chris Evans as former CIA assassin and now private contractor Lloyd Hansen is a worthy adversary, and portrays the volatile Hansen with a mean, ruthless edge. I also thought Billy Bob Thornton as Donald Fitzroy, the man who founded the Sierra program, and who recruited Gentry from a Floridian jail. The action is fast-paced, and the ending is impressive, but I keep coming back to one thing: it isn't as good as Greaney's books.

It is called ""The Grey Man"" as these trained or hired assassins are also ""disposable"" people as no one will ever miss them once they are no longer needed from the agency. And ""Six became
""The Gray Man"" once he reneged a simple request of turning over everything from his latest target he was assigned to assassinate which was a USB flashdrive that was personally given to him making him the number one target.Although the central them is similar to what one can find in a Jason Bourne movie, the movie still consists of some never before action sequences even though it is helped by some CGI as it would be too costly if an actual subway road train is to be blown up.

I am likely in a tiny, microscopic minority. But let's ride past all the nasty name-calling. Let's see:1. Dim colourless cinematography intended to impart fear and foreboding...check (it's cheaper too!)
2. Constant action scenes that aren't just barely decipherable - you've seen them before...many, many, many times.3. Zero - and I mean ZERO - character development. If I said the monsters in DOOM I had better backstories I'd be exaggerating, but I'm not that far off...
4. 200 million? Really? I will continue to harp on how many starving children might have been fed were it not for this hideous abomination.5. To the gumby-like subhuman screenwriters: either he's superman or he's not. You can't pick and choose, scene by scene, what he can and can't handle.6. (To the writers in 5.) You win the golden turkey by making a cute little kid our hero must (really?why?) rescue generic, listless and, ultimately, pointless. Clue: kids in real life, unburdened by the greed and ambition of grown-ups, tend to be a lot cooler than a clueless film industry might let on.6a. These idiots supposedly cornered this guy for life. (i) at no stage of my existence would I have accepted infinite servitude, (ii) if, somehow, it's 18 years later and I'm still in, I certainly wouldn't have allegiances - particularly if I discover those very allegiances are worthless - and, it should be pointed out - it would never take 18 years to understand that.7. It paces like a video game (see no character development above.)Netflix seems to scour every zoo on earth looking for the most feral, stool-flinging chimps to direct or produce movies and tv. I could rant on about this, except that Amazon and every outlet does the same, with the odd exception.","83 out of 180 found this helpful.

Huge, sleek action sequences constantly move from one location to the next-one obstacle, one threat to the next-and it's so, so riveting to watch.The editing consists of a lot of quick cuts, and usually that would bother me, but it's actually quite effective because the action is never hidden from the frame. Every single shot is inserted to clearly show the impact of a person's physical movements. This movie has some of the best-shot, brutally choreographed action in a PG-13 movie I've seen since Mission: Impossible Fallout.As for the character department, the script has the bare minimum, and sometimes not even that. But that doesn't stop any of the actors from knocking it out of the park, adding a lot of charm and charisma to their performances.I had a blast watching this.

I liked her performance and most enjoyed Chris Evans's, although his dialogue could have been better (true of every character). The fight sequences were well done, and there was an inner-city action sequence in the middle of the film that was especially impressive.

What plot there is, as it is really just there as a vehicle to get to the next fight scene.However, the action scenes are largely quite exciting, though many of the hand-to-hand combat scenes are of the perfectly-choreographed punch-and-parry type.

The Gray Man borrows elements from better examples of its genre just so it could deliver a big-budget blockbuster extravaganza that's dull, predictable & formulaic throughout.Directed by Anthony & Joe Russo (Winter Soldier & Civil War), the story follows a CIA assassin who goes rogue after uncovering dark secrets about his agency but soon finds himself hunted by a psychopathic former colleague. Employing a fast pace & frenetic approach in an effort to heighten intensity, the film features many frenzied action set pieces but the Russos' effort only comes off as a hustle with zero verve & vibrancy.The action-packed scenes ring hollow coz they are terribly shot, poorly choreographed & more invested in pyrotechnics than characters. Add lame dialogues & pitiful attempts at humour to it and we've got a film that's horribly smug about its own incompetency. The star-studded cast is more or less wasted in their roles but Ryan Gosling still manages to stand out. Chris Evans is as wicked as his trash stash while Ana de Armas plays her part responsibly.Overall, The Gray Man is a globe-trotting genre romp featuring a generic premise, clichéd script, cardboard characters & lifeless action set pieces. A dry blend of mediocre direction, serviceable performances, exaggerated camerawork & preposterous series of events that culminate with an idiotic final confrontation, Russo brothers' latest is yet another lacklustre addition to the long list of disposable entries in the Netflix canon and is as forgettable as it is unstimulating.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

It's not a bad film at all. I saw critics bashing this movie and typically that's what they do when it comes to Netflix films, some deserved some not. Even so, it does stick in your mind so my expectations were low. But it's enjoyable and I wasn't once bored.Don't get me wrong there's a few issues and annoyances, but on the whole it's an action packed movie with good performances from all, pretty solid plot and great action sequences.So what's wrong? My main concern throughout was the lack of dialogue. It's not a silent film or anything drastic, but it seemed to lack that killer edge when it came to character dialogue. Ryan Goslings character reminded me of 'Drive', very quiet and reserved most of the time meaning dialogue would suffer at times. But overall, it felt like the movie was missing a minute of conversation when explaining something. If you understand me!Depth on certain characters could definitely be improved. We knew very little of any of the characters from outside the plot. Would have loved to have known more about Chris Evans' character for example. The plot itself was decent, I just felt like it was missing that killer punch needed to really excite. But that's nit picking really. The ending is okay, could have been a bit better and a bit shorter, but it definitely satisfies!Outside that though it's a really fun film. If you like action films then you'll enjoy this. The action sequences are really well shot and it has everything you need. Explosions, fighting, guns, car chases etc etc. It's not a film that will win awards, but it's a entertaining watch!Not much else to say really, other than give it a watch if you're needing a Friday night film! I'd recommend. 7/10 today.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A fun, action-packed experience that mostly makes up for its cookie-cutter plot","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8377001/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","28 July 2022","""The Gray Man"" is an action thriller film based on the novel of the same name by Mark Greaney. Directed by the Russo brothers (""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and ""Civil War"", ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Endgame"") and starring Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas, it delivers a fun, action-packed experience that mostly makes up for its cookie-cutter plot.In 2003, CIA agent Donald Fitzroy (Billy Bob Thornton) approaches a convicted murderer (Ryan Gosling) with a business proposition - that if he works for the CIA as an assassin, his freedom will be guaranteed. With few other options, the murderer immediately accepts, adopting the codename ""Sierra Six"", and quickly builds a reputation for being one of the CIA's deadliest assassins. Eighteen years later, while on a mission in Bangkok, Six accidentally messes things up, forcing him to go on the run from his employers with vital secrets in hand. In response, the CIA recruits the sociopathic former agent-turned-mercenary Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans) to hunt Six down before he can expose classified information to the public.With the success of two ""Captain America"" and two ""Avengers"" movies, the Russo brothers have firmly established themselves as filmmakers who know how to handle an action film. Their knack for treating the audience to creatively shot setpieces of fistfights and explosions interspersed with classic hero tropes has proven to be a winning formula. Since finishing their work on the MCU, the brothers have taken on a few different projects such as producing the surreal mind trip ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" and directing the crime drama ""Cherry"" but the two seem more at home with the action genre. Thankfully, ""The Gray Man"" features the brothers doing what they are best at, and that is providing an enjoyable romp that succeeds over some of its glaring faults.The film's biggest problem is that all feels so cut-and-paste from other better action movies. Because of this, the film just never feels like it has its own identity. For almost the entire duration, I kept ticking off all the tired tropes and clichés that I have come to expect from this typical film template. Everything from the anti-hero being recruited by the government for a top-secret job to the villain understanding his every move has all been done so many times before in the past. Films like the ""Bourne"" series, the ""Mission: Impossible"" movies, and even the Russo brothers' own ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" have all been shamelessly ripped off here to make this unimaginatively conceived action film that could easily pass for a bargain bin movie. However, if you were to ignore all of that and enjoy it simply on the merits of action alone, then I suppose the film sort of works.Despite all its weaknesses, the film's action is at least exciting enough to keep you invested. We see characters exchange blows in a few well-shot fight scenes as well as some decently choreographed car chases. Though highly derivative, I will admit these moments did provide some of the best reasons to watch this film in the first place. Additionally, the film's pacing is so brisk that it never drags at any point. For a film riddled with clichés that clocks in at roughly two hours, including 12 minutes of end credits (yes, I really timed it), this helps separate it from the usual action pictures helmed by directors like Michael Bay who usually the pad out the runtime by overusing slow motion. Best of all, unlike most Michael Bay movies, which are all action and no substance, the Russo brothers are actually capable of making us care enough about the two lead characters so we can anticipate what their fates will be in the end. Of course, as previously mentioned, it's highly predictable as to how things will turn out for each of them, but thanks to the Russo brothers' well-handled direction it goes a whole lot better than how it could have.Though we've all seen this type of character before, I think Ryan Gosling played the lead role quite well as Sierra Six, the unnamed convicted murderer-turned professional assassin. Essentially he's like Jason Bourne combined with Ethan Hunt with a dash of John Wick and Angus MacGyver for good measure. It's pretty fun to watch as he fights his way through dozens of bad guys using both his intellect and combat skills to overpower them. Gosling has always had that air of reserved unpredictability to the characters he plays and someone like Sierra Six fits that bill perfectly. I think he has what it takes to be an action star, should he choose to continue doing more films like this one.Also, it's quite refreshing to see Chris Evans play such a villainous role since completing his time in the MCU. Although this isn't the first instance where he's played an antagonist (see ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" and ""Knives Out""), his character Lloyd Hansen is certainly the most disturbing one so far. From torturing people by ripping out their nails to holding a child hostage at gunpoint, this man is a sociopath through and through. That combined with his superior intelligence makes him an incredibly dangerous enemy for anybody to face. I never realised Evans had it in him to play such an evil, unhinged character, especially since he is still so set in many people's minds as the clean-cut Captain America. It just goes to show that the Russo brothers know how to successfully bring out all of Evans's talents as an actor, which may have gone to waste under different filmmakers.I do wish we got to see more of Ana de Armas as Dani Miranda, one of Sierra Six's most important allies. Her character basically just came and went whenever she pleased, only really showing up during crucial action scenes. Perhaps this was done to make her seem more like a mysterious femme fatale figure, but for the most part she felt very underwritten. With that in mind, I did enjoy all of her scenes, not just because of her physical attractiveness but also due to de Armas's proficiency at handling weapons during a shootout. Hopefully she will return for the inevitable sequel, because she and Ryan Gosling have good chemistry with one another.If you're up for some solid action and a fun dynamic between hero and villain, then ""The Gray Man"" should fill the void for anyone craving that particular fix. However, don't bother looking for anything original, as virtually everything this film does has been done several times before. Apparently, there are going to be sequels and spin-offs made that are set within its own contained universe, much like those other Russo brothers-directed movies. I can definitely see the potential in this series becoming a successful action franchise, but in order for that to happen it needs to find ways to distinguish itself from all the other ones first. Still, I have faith in whatever the Russo brothers may bring to the table in the near-future, so I guess we'll just have to wait and see.I rate it 6.5/10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The storyline follows a government agent who is assigned to kill a similar agent as himself. In the process he hears more than he should about his agency and a mercenary is hired to kill him. The mercenary will leave no stone unturned to get this mission done including kidnapping the agent's adopted father and the father's daughter. Now the mercenary has really pissed the agent off and the fight may be brought to him...This movie is codirected by Anthony and Joe Russo (Captain America) and stars Ryan Gosling (The Notebook), Chris Evans (Captain America), Billy Bob Thornton (Bad Santa), Ana de Armas (Knives Out), Jessica Henwick (Love and Monsters), Alfre Woodard (Annabelle) and Regé-Jean Page (Bridgerton).There is so much to like about this movie - the action scenes are ultra violent, over the top and entertaining. The use of weapons in those fight sequences are also top notch. The cast is impressive and Billy Bob Thornton was hilarious. Chris Evans was also a tremendous villain. The dialogue and banter is brilliant and well written. There are some over the top scenes that weren't needed like the train scene and parachute battle, but it didn't overly detract from the film - though I will say the plane ripping apart was cool and well done. The conclusion is worthwhile and worth sitting through 2 hours and 9 minutes of nonstop action.Overall this movie isn't perfect but it is on par with similar films like John Wick, The Bourne Identity and the recent Daniel Craig Bond movies. I would score this a solid 7-7.5/10 and recommend seeing it once.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

With decent pacing, good/realistic choreographies and a somewhat satisfying ending.. it is a movie that entertains with a plot that keeps moving. If you are tired of the same-y content, as other reviewers here, you could just watch something else. Otherwise, stick around for the eye-catching set pieces (CGI galore), excellent camera work and lots of known great actors doing their thing and being likeable.Personally, I liked the simple story that unwraps itself well and doesn't really aim too high.. nor too low. It's just right.And although Ryan Gosling plays himself, again, with his dry and stoic delivery.. he plays an unstoppable action-man, but it works well this time. The rest of the famous actors were given very well-written characters. Like the talented Ana de Armas, who reprises her James Bond 007 role (not really, but.. yeah), and joins the BladeRunner actor again.. or the charming Chris Evans doing something more ""wacky"" this time.Would easily recommend for a good Friday night.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Before watching, I estimated the gigantic budget of 200 million, a wonderful cast of first-class actors and was waiting for a bombshell popcorn movie, which will not have a strong, but at least a little meaningful plot.What actually happened?First, it seems to me personally that 30 percent of the budget went to the fees of the star trio. Because of this, the quality of the graphic component was not as high as it could have been. In some scenes, the economy of effects is too visible.The fights pleased me, there are no questions here. Dynamic, effective, driving. Delivered by professionals in their field. I saw several receptionists for the first time. In terms of the handling of weapons, elements of fiction may be present, but where would we go without that.History. It's there just for the tick. The motivation of the heroes is questionable, many things happen conditionally or to connect events. This aspect was ignored by the creative team, and because of this, they lost the necessary sense of apathy towards the characters.Active persons. I liked Gosling - he is the only guy in the movie for whom I really worried. He knows how to mesmerize a rogue, he learned this a long time ago. Armas was too little for me, I wanted to watch the beauty more. Chris disappointed. In my opinion, this is a failed role for the star of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Evans here looks like a narcissistic mad sadist with the same facial expression throughout the footage. The other boys and girls are nothing more than decorations and tools for the movement of the story.What happened in general? Watch shooting and face-to-face fights with beer and chips after work - maybe it will work. Although, in my opinion, the film copes with this task with a stretch. If you want to enjoy an action movie with a complete story, you should go to the other door.The Russo brothers made a picture at a time and spent a significant amount of money that the streaming service could have spent on producing several other projects.That's a 6 out of 10, gentlemen. No point more.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

When the CIA's top asset, who was forced to do this job to get out of prison uncovers agency secrets, he triggers a global hunt by assassins set loose by his ex-colleague.The movie has a big sum of action scenes: approximately 1 action scene every 20 minuts, and most of them are creative and pretty entertaining. Directed by the Russo brothers, the colors and cinematography are amazing. Also, as usual, the brothers bring a surprising amount of comedy that lightened the action, all that without mentioning the perfect pacing to the movie. After No Time To Die and The Gray Man, Ana de Armas should definitely get her own solo action film. Chris Evans grew out of his Captain America character as the role really suited him. As always, Ryan Gosling gives an amazing performance.However, all those characters, except Ryan's, lacked depth. Additionally, its your standard action movie plot with your standard action movie music. But other than that, I didn't find anymore big mistakes in the movie which makes me wonder how critiques gave it such a low score.If they worked on those little problems and took more time to fix them, the movie had the potential to be a top tier action movie, especially with the 200 million dollars budget.Score:8/10.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Is it because it's Netflix and they must pay for what they did with our stock portfolio? The Gray Man is a kick ass action film with charismatic actors and a really tight plot. There is no time wasted on exposition, just action action action punctuated by glibness and Evans clearly having a blast playing the bad guy. Ana de Armas was kind of wasted in the role, though. They could have done better with her character.Anyway, the film is based on a book published in 2009. There are eleven more books!! So it makes sense to push as much value in this film in hope of a bankable franchise. Bourne did it, James Bond did it, so why not ... Six? Why Six? Because 7 was taken by Seven of Nine. Clearly the author is not GRRM and there will be more material to adapt than movies they can make.The story is the same as a billion other films where the skilled action hero gets betrayed by the people controlling him therefore he has to take things into his own hands. For once I would like to see one agent who struggles to implement command and strategic functions that for his entire career he had other people taking care of. You know, like an engineer trying to be a CEO... Hahaha! Make that movie, Netflix!There is not much more I can say about the film because there isn't much there. It's a fun, very fun, action film with a predictable plot and the same logic holes that all films of the genre have. But it's a tiny little bit better, so I liked it and rated it high.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

They get their money's worth in spades even if we 'more discerning bods' aren't quite as enthusiastic. And for that it hits the nail on the head. Oh and unlike many such offerings, I was interested enough to watch it to the end: this is very well-made bollocks.It is obvious the Netflix who spent - it is said - $200m on making The Gray Man are setting it up to be a franchise and that is pretty apparent from how the film concludes. Might well happen. I was reading just yesterday how the era of the 'mid-budget' film, all those 'little gems' from yesteryear some pine for is over and the streaming services, which are pretty much ousting the Tinseltown studios, have realised the really big, big money is in this kind of blockbuster.Quite simply the returns are far greater. Netflix's $200m might sound like a lot but if things go right - always a risk, of course - in time that outlay could turn into more than $1bn. So the equation is not hard to understand: why spend just $50m on a film which returns 'just' $300m when there is this kind of action-schlock around to be made which will rake in far more moolah? Might not delight some but just how much clout do they have, sunny Jim? As they say, money doesn't talk, it shouts.For what it was intended to be and what it is, The Gray Man is top-dollar, 24-carat gold: it has enough fighting, killing, destruction, 'exciting' car chasing to keep mindless adolescents of all ages and genders more than happy.Oh, and belatedly the industry has cottoned on that 'the lassies' also have money to spend and really, really, really no longer are content to have heroines who are tootsey-cutsey homemakers just dying to fall in love and get their man: so The Gray Man has two - that's two - girl protagonists for the girls.One is an extremely capable CIA agent who can take on any man, the other is 'a villain', though not quite a straightforward 'villain' - she is no one's fool and quite prepared to give her fellow - male - villain a run for his money. Good thinking, Netflix.So there you have it: The Gray Man is certainly not one for the 'cineaste' snobs, but it isn't supposed to be. Those for whom it was made more than get their money's worth. Hence my score, 7/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

You get THE GRAY MAN!Everyone's favorite cereal-shunning lead stars at Court Gentry, a.k.a. Sierra Six. A CIA assassin who, by all accounts, just wants to sit down and watch some Netflix (according to Gosling himself) is thrust into an action packed international trek from the very start of the film. The destination being a collision course with Lloyd Hansen, a smarmy, love-to-hate villain with a trash 'stache unlike any you've ever seen before, played by none other than Chris Evans.Along the way, Six encounters many friends and foes from Ana De Armas, Julia Butters, Billy Bob Thornton, Alfre Woodard, Wagner Moura, to Dhanush, Callan Mulvey, Regé-Jean Page, and Jessica Henwick. With a loaded cast, and a breakneck speed, some of the characters feel rushed, and don't get as much screen time as perhaps they deserve. But the talented actors make up for the limited screen time with excellent performances all around, with only a couple exceptions (more on that later).The standout performances are, of course, Ryan Gosling as Six, bringing charm, charisma, and humor to what could easily be Generic-Action-Lead-#412. He MAKES this movie, and aside from simply being entertaining to watch, he also helps you (the audience) to care, when editing and the script sometimes make that hard (more on that later).Chris Evans is the other side of the coin, playing the perfect, psycho and sociopathic foil to the world of CIA professionals. It has been said that Evans was chosen for this role so he could play according to his own personality, and it shows. Evans seems more comfortable in the skin of Lloyd Hansen than he ever did as Steve Rogers.Ana De Armas surprises as a deadly agent in her own right, and while she is not given much to do dramatically, she shines nonetheless.Julia Butters' performance as the young Claire brings much needed heart to this film, and while her role serves as a plot-device more than anything, Butters still manages to make you care for the character.There are a few negatives to this film, the greatest being the editing, as some of the action scenes descend into chaos through breakneck cuts and hyper-efficient storytelling. This film would have benefitted from an additional 10 minutes of runtime just to let certain moments breathe. There are also some interjected character development scenes that feel unnecessary, and serve as nothing more than a distraction from the main plot. Again, with more runtime, those scenes may have had more impact.Billy Bob Thornton and Rege-Jean Page do not fit into their roles as well as everyone else in the cast. Thornton manages to deliver most of his dialogue with as little nuance and emotional range as possible, while Page feels inconsistent, giving some scenes an experienced level-headedness, while others are given the 'just read the script and I don't know what emotion to play' treatment. Despite this, neither of these performances manage to detract from the overall experience.The Russo Brothers, along with Markus and Mcfeely, bring their Marvel expertise to adapt the spy-thriller novel 'The Gray Man' by Mark Greaney, and while they do manage to interject heart and humor into their emotionally cold source material, they never manage to reach the heights of their previous work (looking at you, Captain America: The Winter Soldier). Still, the heart that they do manage to bring out from the source material takes this film from the been-there-done-that area, into a surprisingly heartwarming story.As far as the action goes, the Russo's are at the top of their game, bringing not only excellent choreography, but also some of the most visually inventive fight scenes since the first John Wick film. Two of the stand outs include the opening fight scene, as well as the final clash between Six and Lloyd.As this film is going straight to Netflix after only one week in a (poorly marketed) theater campaign, the lucky few viewers who actually make the trip to cinemas will get to savor the experience of seeing the incredible action on the big screen!Also, as a pleasant surprise, Netlix has produced a decidedly non-woke film that simply aims to entertain, rather than push a political narrative.In conclusion, Ryan ""Literally Me"" Gosling, and Chris ""Literally Him"" Evans face off in a fun, inventive, action packed ride that brings humor when needed, and will leave the audience with a surprisingly warm heart.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

This is the type of movie that usually would star B-C List actors. The A list talent of Ryan, Chris, Billy Bob and Alfre is what made this movie good. Ryan, I like having him back and he was great as an action role. He had some funny one liners, if you like a dry sense of humor like I do. Chris I heard, almost passed on this role because he didn't want to play a villain. He was kinda great as a psychopath creep with a 70's porn star look going on. I didn't know that was Billy Bob, I kept thinking how his voice sounded like Billy Bob but he looked unrecognizable, I don't usually care for him as an actor but I liked him in this role.The only bad acting was that dude that was in Bridgerton. His acting was so bad...odd casting choice as he basically has been in one season of a Netflix show, he wasn't in the same league as his co-stars and it really showed.For Netflix quality, this is about as good as it gets.Cinematic quality it probably would of bombed in the theatersI liked it, it was better than I expected.

Totally agree with the reviewers that say don't rate a film unless you see it.Storyline was okay but when you come away after watching the film you will realise that it was a set of action sequences with bits if storyline thrown in between the action scenes.Is this a bad thing, no but then if you go into this film with the intention of seeing an Oscar winning movie, then your going to be disappointed.Then again if you like the Jason Bourne movies then you will like this film.Ryan Gosling was excellent as the hero and I am hoping that he does more of these type of movies.Chris Evans was way over the top as the bad guy, which suited the role. For the reviewer who said that it looked as if Chris had been training hard for this film, no he hasn't in fact he has shrunk in size since his Captain America role, go and see that to see Chris pumped up.Now the only fault I found with the film is the cgi and green screen scenes, these stood out like a sore thumb and for the money Netflix paid for the film to be made you should not see anything bad in the film. In fact in one noted scene the main actress jumps off a bus and into the floor, you could tell she was held by wires. These should not be noticeable if the movie cost 200 million people to make.Also the kung fu scene in which the bad fights Gosling and Armas, totally out of place in this film.My six star score is for the film overall.This means, switch your brain off and sit back comfortably and enjoy a movie in which you don't need to think for the next two hours and ten minutes.Don't expect a great movie, again if you like these films, please enjoy.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The action is fine, and the acting is serviceable, but for 200 MILLION Dollars, you expect more. The original Terminator cost 6.4 million (18 Million Inflation) has better action and performances. Obviously, comparing this to the terminator is harsh. So would comparing this to any other good action film. The Russo Brothers' work within the MCU is solid. Outside of the MCU, their work is hit or miss. I'd consider this a slight miss.Let's start with the positive: the action. If not for the amount of action, I would have given this a 4. If you're a fan of every action film ever made, then you'll love this movie. Because that's what it is, an action movie with the plot points of every action movie ever. One of the negatives to me is the characters. Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans are the stars of this film, but I never felt anything for them. Not once did I care what was going to happen to them. They could have died, and I would have been happy because this movie would have been over quicker. I've never read the Gray Man novels. I don't plan on reading them. I only knew of the author Mark Greaney because he co-wrote three books with Tom Clancey (A great author). If I were a fan of the books- I may have enjoyed this more. Honestly, I'm not sure if that would have helped. I don't understand how this could become a franchise. It wasn't a bad film, but it wasn't good either. It was mid.6.5/10 A underwhelming action film that is unmemorable.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ryan Gosling, in his first action film, is the show-stealer. He brings the heart while Chris Evans brings cruelty and meanness a little to well; however, I think I still saw a few Captain America moves!I watched this with my 10 year old son and he LOVED it and thought it was GREAT! Definitely some Fortnite-like moments, but with blood and brutal hand to hand combat violence. Ana de Armas plays the strong female action role well enough. The acting all around was solid. I didn't even realize until after I watched that the actor who played the CIA director is the same actor who played the Duke in Bridgerton Season 1; the roles are so different that I didn't recognize him at all!The script wasn't bad, I didn't find myself saying ""this writing is awful,"" as in many action films. It has a few comedic lines scattered throughout and a somewhat familiar plot. The characters are who they are from start to finish, so it is really ALL action and survival. This did not bother me at all. I found the whole film captivating and entertaining, and I am ready for the SEQUEL!It seems that many people are disappointed in Netflix and this film. Were they paying attention? Were their expectations too high? Why are they so concerned with the movie budget? There was obviously a lot of work put into the making of this film-people got paid, fun was had, and so what if I'm easy to please! If you need to escape from reality and like action, I recommend watching.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

But: The Russo brothers managed to create a modern action flick reminding me of ridiculous classics like ""The Last Action Hero"". The first half is awesome and just right. It's only the CGI madness with the tram in Prague that propelled me out of the zone. Also the editing is really poor and way too fast. It's nice that the story takes us through Europe. However no apartment in Vienna would look like this one, believe me. It's like the scene was set in Turkey and they changed the location in post. The final fight is entertaining but the story just won't end there. It goes on way too long and the movie loses it's momentum actually in the final battles. Sad. But the concept of filming with drones and crazy camera work really makes this movie look different. Also the beginning scene with the assassination in the club was shot extremely interesting.Ryan Gosling is really good in and as ""The Gray Man"". Finally he gets to play a witty badass with a soft side for the kid. He's got cool lines and he is convincing in his action scenes. The fight choreo overall is very good and unique. I can't point the style, but there is a lot of arm work included. Ana de Armas is pure gold. Her character is such a nice addition to Six. Billy Bob Thornton shines probably the last time in his career? Chris Evans was cast to be Six but he chose to play the villain instead which was a great decision! His performance is stunning to watch and especially his moments of terror are truly terrifying. Dhanush is pure fun I tell you. Regé-Jean Page doesn't manage to convey any kind of sympathy so I couldn't connect with him. His character is basically a big part of the plot of the movie but he fails to be dangerous or even a likeable bad guy.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This fusion of Bourne Identity and James Bond almost survives intact with a remarkable attempt at scriptwriting. There is the rare effective use of flashbacks, a lot of creativity in the fighting and action scenes that raise the bar above other action thrillers as well as efforts to tie up lose ends and avoid obvious logical miscues, and include a number of multi-plotted upscale situations. What especially comes across experiencing this movie is that somehow the director pushed the envelope of believability in the multitude of action scenes and storyline that kept the story more authentic than most action movies. The thoughtful, non-action espionage scenes helped to give this movie more substance and even the inclusion of scenes that required an additional assist and the ethical behavior of a super assassin really helped to make this movie more unique and memorable. Unfortunately unlike a major blockbuster motion picture and with three scriptwriters (of major superhero movies), either the budget was not there, the energetic thought of the writing of the last fourth of the movie ends with too many cuts, simplistic escapes or break ins that do not carry over the finesse and style of the rest of the movie, perhaps focused too much on a similar sequel-like superhero franchise and sacrificing a crisp, well-written ending. There is a lot in this movie to appreciate and commend, but the end result is a little disappointing knowing that this movie could have been even better, maybe even a real breakthrough movie for the genre. It is worth seeing though for what the future might hold for action thrillers. Other similar movies to consider include: Enemy of the State (1998); Shooter (2007); Salt (2010); Safe House (2012); Survivor (2015); American Ultra (2015); Red Sparrow (2018); Anna (2019); Polar (2019); AVA (2020); The Protégé (2021).","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

James Bond, Mission Impossible, Jason Bourne and dare I say it even XXX with Vin Diesel are films this tries to borrow from with a star studded cast and a big budget, but it comes off as hollow.There's nothing refreshing or new here, and while I can't say that all those other spy films are masterpieces of originality or plausible scenarios, at least they offered something that was unique to them and you could tell some passion went into producing them. The Gray Man feels like a lot of money was thrown at a film crew to make some sort of spy action film, but everything feels just so commercial. The acting is just phoned in by most of the cast, and you never get any sense of feeling for the characters or caring much about the story.The film goes through at least 10 different locations where things happen, but most are so rushed through that you don't really appreciate any of them and they add little to nothing to the story. Its almost like they rolled the dice on what country to set a scene in, filmed it there, and then edited it into the wider film. In fact it isn't just the locations, but much of the film is just paper thin plot and uninteresting characters weaving together action sequence after action sequence. Don't get me wrong, the action isn't badly done, but there's just so much of it that you don't really appreciate the sequences the way you might in other films. Its just another shootout upon shootout, and you become a bit numb to it.This isn't a bad film per se. But I strongly recommend you watch one of the Bond, Mission Impossible or Jason Bourne films that so obviously inspired this, as they are far superior.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

I did and I did.Loads of humorous lines, our hero is a little bit indestructible and our villain is really a villain.. very cliché and predictable at times..(We played location bingo during the film - missed Virginia and Prague) you can say the lines before they are uttered but it's a fun watch.Chris Evans was very enjoyable and his villainy knows no bounds, destroying entire city blocks and performing various other atrocities with no recourse, whilst being Omni present most of the time, and our hero is just that.. a hero.. don't ask how he escapes from various impossible situations.. just know that off camera he did it, any hero worth his salt can survive the odd stab, bullet, fall, explosion, concussion, .... Lots of ways to pick holes in this film but we laughed, enjoyed the actions scenes and at times marveled at the cgi.If you enjoy Bourne, die hard, bond, dead pool.. you'll enjoy this.

Not that what we get is bad, but it's all just a little too average. By the numbers plot, minimal characterization, and zipping from one action set piece to the next really prevents this film from reaching its potential.Evans is having the time of his life literally twirling his mustache and Gosling gets to exhibit some of his killer comedic chops. There are sprinkles of Russo comedy here and there, which really does add to the film. Ana de Armas is nowhere near as vexing as in No Time to Die, but I mostly blame the writing. The action is pretty solid, with the opening sequence feeling quite unique and original. The rest of the action doesn't fully follow suit though. It's also a little baffling where the $200M went as the CGI is fairly suspect at times.The Gray Man isn't the classic blockbuster Netflix was hoping for, however it is still reasonably enjoyable for fans of action and the spy genre.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I say this because there is so much stupidity and impossibilities in the spy operations, action sequences, stunts and believably all round dumbness, that you would expect that the whole debacle would just fail/flop! But unbelievably it does not! Forget about the 'Over The Top' rule bending...of everything...and this actually works; thanks mainly to its cast.I can definitely see why Chris Evans turned the lead role down, after playing good guy Captain America for years, he obviously wanted to do a full about turn in your face bad guy. Well he does and boy do you really get to hate the psychotic madman that he portrays. Ryan Gosling is super laid back and cool as the hero and its so funny and out of place in a film of sheer unbelievable mayhem, panic and chaos...but its all so tongue in cheek, it works great! I liked every minute of its subtle humour, dead pan jokes and the constant dry comedy.You will find yourself repeating 'NO WAY', 'Never happening' and 'Say What' whilst trying to keep up with everything that is going on during the high octane stunts and action scenes. I think directors are trying to make more John Woo/John Wick high energy outings (not that you could even come close to Keanu Reeve's super assassin) and that can only be good. Its not a John Wick or a Jason Bourne knock off but if its done with a lot more of the unbelievable events this portrayed, it could become a good film franchise; as by the end of this film you absolutely know there is going to be a sequel!Take it as it is and immediately stop comparing to Bond, Bourne and all the other genre types!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film is a good on action and visuals, but short on depth and development of the Gray Man, Courtland Gentry. It just pushes you right into the action with a small plot.This would have been a great series if Netflix chose to go that direction - there's definitely enough books to capture that. I think the directors wanted to cash in on the humor more than the actual plot and development of a good story. There's so much more depth to the actual character of Gentry than the movie showed. I think Gosling played a decent role, but the directors could have portrayed Court Gentry as a different type of person.

Sure the action scenes are shot pretty well, but if the film doesn't have a soul, what 's the point? This is the problem when you hire ""movie stars"" rather than actors to lead your movie. The film will look great but it will be a dull ride. There are so many actors in Hollywood who could've made Chris Evan's character extremely memorable. I just couldn't buy him as a psychopath.There's nothing new here. In fact we have seen this exact story more times than I can count. A spy has his own agency turn on him and try to eliminate him. Where do they come up with this stuff? The movie basically banked on the Russo brothers directing good enough action that people wouldn't even notice. They give it their best admittedly but it wasn't enough.This one was a complete miss for me. It's technically well made but I won't remember a single thing about it 24 hours from now. 5/10.","12 out of 22 found this helpful.

It's an action thriller through and through, produced and directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, from a screenplay the latter co-wrote with Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. With a budget of $200 million, it is among the most expensive films made by Netflix, but other than the big names attached, it doesn't really feel like a $200 million movie as it feels cheaper than that. I like how Netflix and the producers have so much faith in the film franchise they just created, it's ambiguous and after watching the film, I'm here for the sequel and spin-off. I do hope they improve some things for the sequel though as the franchise has potential.When the CIA's most skilled operative-whose true identity is known to none-accidentally uncovers dark agency secrets, a psychopathic former colleague puts a bounty on his head, setting off a global manhunt by international assassins.The Gray Man is actually a good action thriller, a film that could have been great if it weren't for the clichéd and poor written script and another thing I found lackluster was the pacing, it's too fast, like the most important thing is to get to the next action scene. But honestly, I like Ryan Gosling's character and the world building we got. The dialogue could have been better, but it works. Though those criticism, I found The Gray Man to be well shot and the set pieces along with the fight choreography to be quite great. The cast is also perfect, both on the drama side of things and the more action oriented scenes. It stars Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Jessica Henwick, Regé-Jean Page, Dhanush, Wagner Moura, Julia Butters, Alfre Woodard and Billy Bob Thornton. The cast did a great job, mainly Ryan Gosling who were terrific. But the thing that made me most impressed is of course the cinematography, it's incredible with so many gorgeous shots. But my honest opinion is that The Gray Man was a let down, something was missing and it was heart, it wasn't original. It was like a typical action film. It entertained me with its action sequences and Ryan Gosling as the action hero.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Yeah, as you might figure, I am not a particular fan of him. But I opted to give the movie a chance.And color me impressed. This was some action-packed movie, from the beginning and right up to the end. And I have to say that I was definitely well-entertained by this movie from writers Joe Russo, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. It was really an enjoyable action thriller with lots of fast-paced non-stop action.The storyline in the movie was also good, because it was a rather interesting storyline; well-written and enjoyable. I will go as far as to say that there wasn't really a dull moment throughout the 122 minutes that the movie ran for.I will say that Ryan Gosling definitely impressed me with ""The Gray Man"", and he was rather good in the movie and in that particular role. It was also really great to see Chris Evans in a non-heroic role for a change. The movie also have some nice performances from Ana de Armas, Billy Bob Thornton and Alfre Woodard.The action sequences in the movie are fast paced, adrenaline packed and really impressive. And the movie is well-worth watching for the non-stop action alone.If you haven't already seen ""The Gray Man"", you definitely should do so if you enjoy action thrillers, with emphasis on action.My rating of directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo's movie lands on a well-deserved eight out of ten stars.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

There's just so much chasing and running and bouncing around scenes. While the visuals were pretty good in some scenes, I'd say there wasn't much to the rest of all the moving. Ryan Gosling was great as the Grey Man, and I honestly enjoyed his character. And Chris Evans' was fun and well written for the most part, but I just have such a hard time fitting him to a sociopath roll, so I feel like there should've been someone else for that. Billy Bob Thornton being a hardcore CIA agent was plenty fun though. And it was refreshing to see Julia Butters again since Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. I did enjoy most of the action scenes, but some felt either too slow or too boring, and that kind of knocked the movie off style. I especially hated how that end fight panned out, and that was some pretty crappy writing in my opinion. But it revived itself for the most part in the minutes to come afterwards. So, it wasn't a great, memorable film, but I think a better sequel would maybe make up for it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The characters are interesting and the movie breezes along at a good pace not getting bogged down in overly long scenes.However, that is about all this film offers. There is very little in character development and the plot is a paper thin McGuffin chase. The actors all played there roles well although Ana de Armas seems stuck playing a character with none of the charm or sensuality we have seen in her roles before. This is no fault of the actress simply the fact that if her character had been played by a man it would have been identical. Sadly no repeat of the kind of character she had in No Time to Die (where she stole the film).In summary an enjoyable action film, worth a watch, but nothing amazing.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Props to Gosling, Evans and the rest of a truly great cast and props to the Russo brothers for maintaining a perfect pace and energy while still character building and weaving together a lot that puts some nice twists on this kind of movie.Cheers.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

The plot feels weak and is nothing like Bourne or Bond, but it's mostly a weak mystery surrounded in an all out action environment.So why did I give it a 7?Well, the action scenes are nothing short of incredible and I like the cast's performances. Especially Evans, who felt more like a muscular psychopath than Captain America. I also enjoyed the final fight between Hansen and Six. That scene had a slight ""No Time To Die"" feel, except it was anticlimactic and wasn't the perfect ending that Fukunaga had achieved in that Bond film.In conclusion, The Gray Man has a very weak plot and a cliche ending, but the incredible action scenes along with the cast makes this a worthwhile watch.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"7","/10","One hell of an entertaining ride","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8371842/?ref_=tt_urv","dmansel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur123353548/?ref_=tt_urv","26 July 2022","The Gray Man, a story of a CIA aset who stumbles upon a number of agency secrets that could be damning for his superiors, manages to trigger a global assassin-lead manhunt spearheaded by a maniacal former colleague who will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission.While suffering the fate of its 80s and 90s predecessors that scarified character development for bullets and explosions, The Gray Man is a complete 180 degree turn from the Russo's previous film, Cherry. In that movie (a deep dive into a man struggling with addiction to find his way in the world after experiencing war), the progression and regression of Cherry as a character is the very heart of the film. Here in The Gray Man, no such screentime is given to fully flesh out any of characters outside of an intro scene for Gosling's character, Sierra Six. Much like what John Wick eventually turned into, with so many interesting people to explore in the movie, The Gray Man feels like the first in a universe that could be ripe for a motley crew of killers and spies and shadowy organizations. That so little focus is given to characters like Suzanne Brewer is frustrating; with an actress as talented as Jessica Henwick, who we've seen in multiple action roles, there's a mountain of possibility with only a molehill of actual relevancy. Whether that's breadcrumbs for further screentime or a busted potential only remains to be seen.Starring Ryan Gosling as Courtland Gentry, aka Sierra Six, our titular Gray Man is tasked with carrying out wetworks for the CIA. As a hired assassin, Gentry is cool, reserved, almost unflappable as he encounters each obstacle and finds ways to surmount them. While looking downright cool in the role, it unfortunately does nothing to challenge the actor himself; having seen Gosling portray characters like this in Drive and Blade Runner 2049, it's not a stretch to see him play the role here. Delivering a dry wit that bounces off of Chris Evans' more extravagant performance, Gosling glides through the scenes and hits his mark with the ease of a man moving through a house he's lived in for years.Chris Evans is the very definition of shenangians in this film. Continuing to lean into his heel turn started in Knives Out, Evans' outright glee of playing a character that himself takes absolute joy in the horrible things he does for a living, Evans looks like he's having the time of life. Complete with the absurd mustache and breathtaking inability to care about anyone or anything around him, Lloyd Hansen is one of the year's most entertaining villains. There's been a recent outcry on social media of moviegoers longing for a return to antagonists with less pathos, and their prayers couldn't have been any more answered. There's little development to Hansen; no tragic backstory, nothing that could shed him in any possible forgiving light, and not a hint of remorse for his heinous actions. He's the villain who believes rules are only for those who adhere to them and thanks to his freewheeling nature he's unburdened to do whatever he pleases to accomplish his goal. Evans delights in playing such a one note scumbag, and it's through his delight that the audience is ok going down this road with Hansen as he pursues Six. Outlandishly boorish and wildly ostentatious, Evans knows exactly what the character needs and delivers in spades.Unfortunately, Evans' extravagance completely overshadows both Jessica Henwick and Regé-Jean Page as the film's executive CIA agents. As the overarching villain of the story, Page's Denny Carmichael is given astonishingly little screentime without much in the way of explanation for his actions or motivations. Page is reminiscent of action movie villains from decades ago: a good looking man in a suit with secrets to hide as a catalyst for the protagonist to go on the run. At that simple task, Page is competent enough. The most underserved characters are the main women of the film, Henwick's Suzanne Brewer and Ana de Armas' Dani Miranda. They both float in and out of the movie, and while de Armas has more to do here than she does in last year's No Time to Die, her character is still shortchanged a good action scene and we as an audience still have as of yet to see the actress really cut loose in an action role with capabilities that have only been teased thus far. As a suit and Carmichael's right-hand woman, Suzanne Brewer is something of the film's moral center, or could be if she had more screentime to play out her inner conflicts. Despite the atrocious wig she's burdened with, Henwick's character is interesting and likeable enough (and is in enough of a position of power by the film's end) that another outing that took the requisite time to focus on her would be more than welcome.Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, formerly of Marvel Cinematic Universe fame, The Gray Man is a perfect vehicle to display their love of action. Delivering a second act scene that could be the spiritual successor to the highway fight in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it's the action set pieces that are first and foremost here. Technically, it seems the siblings have never been more unchained; sweeping drone movements that make for dazzling establishing shots are also unnecessarily used to insert the audience into action, more just because they can than for any real creative reason. Directorial flourish is always welcomed so long as it serves the story, but flair for flair's sake is often employed in an attempt to dazzle the audience into overlooking other weaknesses. Outside of that, there's some visual spectacle to the film worthy of praise. Shot by cinematographer Stephen F. Windon, responsible for six of the nine Fast and Furious movies (and currently shooting the tenth), his eye for actualizing over the top action scenes is perfectly congruent for the story the Russos are trying to tell. Boasting an outstanding color palette starting with Six's initial scene surrounded by fireworks, Windon's lens set against the backdrop of numerous European countries captures all the characters and their locations while looking their best.Overall, The Gray Man is the perfect movie to check out after a hard day's work with popcorn and drinks in hand. Propelled by Gosling and Evans, with over-the-top direction from the Russos, the film has a vibrancy and more than enough absurdity to make it a fun watch from beginning to end. While the plot itself is thin and relatively cliche, it's what the Russos choose to do with it that squeezes that lack of substance for every morsel of entertainment. At just a hair over two hours long, the cat-and-mouse chase that hops across countries with little regard for international law starts with a bang and continues a breakneck pace throughout. Almost all style with very little substance, it relies on the audience's willingness to relax and be taken along for the ride. If they're willing to do that, it's one hell of an entertaining ride.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Cool, but not what you expect from the Russo brothers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8377946/?ref_=tt_urv","alekspredator87","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52780913/?ref_=tt_urv","28 July 2022","""The Grey Man"" was quite an expected film. Many bloggers talked about it long before it was released. And there were several reasons for that at once. The first and, in my opinion, the main reason is the participation of the Russo brothers in the position of directors, who gave us such masterpieces as ""Captain America 2"" and ""Captain America 3"", as well as such mastodons of cinema as ""Infinity War"" and ""Finale"" about the Avengers. The next important aspect of expectation is the cast. The stars of the first magnitude who were involved in the project are always in demand in high-level action films and their participation in the work on the picture also aroused confidence in the ""Gray Man"".However, even at the stage of the trailer release, I had doubts about creating some kind of iconic picture. It looked like Joe and Anthony Russo were preparing a large-scale action movie and nothing more. What do. I was ready for it, and the viewing did not disappoint.The picture is designed in the best traditions of modern blockbusters with a lot of beautiful action scenes. I would like to emphasize that the picture uses non-standard and very successful camera angles and framing, both in chases and in fights. It looks fresh and, combined with excellent sound, presents chic scenes that are drawn one after another for the audience. The fights are set perfectly. I would compare the realism of the battle scenes with the best representatives of the industry from the ""Raid"" series. It is very interesting to watch numerous martial arts and shootouts, and a high-quality picture takes the viewer into the thick of events, allowing you to almost feel the danger of what is happening on the screen.The plot of the picture is intriguing, the characters behave in the frame as they should in such films: self-confident, bursting with masculinity heroes (even Ana de Armas tries to keep up with the men on the screen), clear quick decisions that do not leave numerous extras a chance of survival, stone faces of the characters that almost they do similar things every day or even an hour. This, on the one hand, strongly creates color, and, on the other hand, sharply reduces the credibility of what is happening on the screen. But again, I personally don't forget that I'm just watching an action movie, and the concept of this picture boils down to the fact that all the main characters are mostly cardboard, and their task in the frame is to surpass opponents.It is worth noting the actors' performance. It follows from my previous thought. The characters that are embodied on the screen by actors of the first magnitude do not require strong drama through emotions. Here, all the most interesting things are shifted towards entertainment on the screen, and not to various kinds of experiences. Therefore, Ryan Gosling changes face only if he gets seriously injured. Ana de Armas is not bad. The girl is good physically, her participation in combat scenes pleases no less than the fights and shootouts in one of her previous works - about James Bond. For some reason, Armas even reminded me of Scarlett Johansson in Iron Man 2. The desire to do many tricks on their own causes true admiration for actresses. Billy Bob Thornton performed, as always, shrilly. His hero, although a minor character, sets quite a strong tone to the narrative.Separately, I would like to mention the game of Chris Evans. The actor turned into a villain quite well. I'm used to the image of Steve Rogers: a noble and honest soldier who will lay down his bones for the sake of his loved ones. Then the actor did a good job of showing the ambiguous father of the family in ""Protecting Jacob."" Well, in the ""Gray Man"" it is an abhorrent hero who was created in the best traditions of villains with such an appearance and, of course, wild charisma. Lloyd Henson, played by Evans, breathes danger and wildness. This is a man who will stop at nothing, because he simply does not know how to lose. I remember Evans the most in this movie. But to be fair, I would like to note that although the actor was remembered for his performance, I often had a feeling that this was still a game, an attempt to be what a villain should be. That is, it was not immersion in his hero, but only an effort to immerse himself. Sometimes I couldn't believe in this Lloyd, the illusion of the work was broken. Probably, this is still an actor's blunder. Or maybe a weak scenario.The film allows you to see many beautiful places all over the planet. Such diversity was even sometimes excessive. I only had to have time to read the names of a particular city, so as not to get confused in the rapid movements of the heroes. Again, the competent work of the camera team and clear directing make it possible to see cool pictures on the screen.""The Grey Man"" has been viewed. Expectations were not much fulfilled, but there was no disappointment either. And this is a great joy for me personally. I saw what I expected. A high-quality action movie that is sure to please with visual and sound sequences: a lot of chases, shootouts, fights and explosions. I don't even remember when I saw something as wild, but beautiful. Probably, it was some kind of ""Raid"".The picture came out a walk-through. As they say, for once. I fully admit that the demanding viewer will be disappointed. However, if you do not wait for a masterpiece in every sense, then the picture will seem good. At least a couple of hours won't be wasted.7 out of 10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Movies should take a leaf out of Top Gun: Maverick's book and try to be as practical as possible.The three main cast members all do great with Ryan Gosling in the lead and expanding upon his type of role he played in The Nice Guys. Chris Evans makes for a really good villain and hams it up at just the right moments. Evans is fast becoming a right decent actor, those Fantastic Four movies seem but a distant memory. Ana De Armas is also good here and after Bond is making a reputation as quite the action hero.For all the action, it's a shame there isn't really much to it. I wish there had been more story to it but five minutes can't pass without some sort of explosion. The end fight between Gosling & Evans is done well and once again makes you think had there been more substance to it, The Gray Man could have been a great action movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

That's why I think they started with a simple plot and a lot of exciting action scenes.

When Gosling takes out a fellow agent he pockets some incriminating evidence against CIA nasty Regé-Jean Page who in turn, hires psycho killer Chris Evans to find and kill Gosling.With a simple, derivative storyline, this is just a very well crafted James Bond type affair. What raises its calibre and produces a film of considerable fun is the cast. Gosling is a great, twinkle in the eye, action tough guy, Evans is clearly enjoying himself as the nutter and there is fine support from Thornton, de Armas and Page. Coupled with pretty much non stop, impressive action set pieces, switch off the brain and enjoy - clearly a sequel is anticipated.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Nonetheless after watching this movie I felt as relieved as I feel after a good sh***.Let's start with the pro's. If you don't mind the over the top Micheal Bay movie action, you actually have a great time watching this film. The pacing is amazing, mainly because the constant action has to cover up the fact that the script writer probably didn't even know he was hired to write a story. The acting is ok. Thornton and Gosling are ok, Almas is good and Evans is probably giving his greatest performance since Knives Out. Add a great movie score to that and an editing that reminds you of every Bond and Mission Impossible movie.Sadly this movie is made as Red Notice was made. Been there done that. They literally copied a scene from Moonraker and the end fight was another copy of Lethal Weapon. The dramatic music score and opening scene in Bangkok was a copy of the Macau scene from Skyfall. I could go on if I wanted to.In short: if you're looking to have a good brainless time watching a solid no-brainer, then you will have a great time. If you're looking for a new Bourne movie you will be left disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The action sequences, lighting angles, use of new and unseen camera work, perfect execution of an age old story formula, you name it and they did it all right.Inclusion of Dhanush was a good idea to indulge most of us Indians and I am totally glad he didn't turn out to be a second fiddle character like a lot of other Indian actors, who hyped their Hollywood projects but only had a tiny bit to do. And I really suspect the Russo Brothers tweaked the script a bit to suit the status dhanush carries among his Indian fans. This, only the Russo Brothers can confirm though.Ana De Armas has come a long way from her Knock Knock days. I'm happy she's lived up to her potential and the direction she's headed as an actor.Chris' antagonist feels a bit out of place in the beginning as we're all almost only used to seeing him as Captain America, but oh boy he's convincing, so much that you eventually start seeing him as Floyd.All the actors held their end well.The hero of the movie is the screenplay though. They managed to turn a basic story into something so engaging you can't look away even for a moment or you'll miss something.The book of the same name the movie is based on, is written by Mark Greaney, I'm now totally interested in reading it.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

A talented actress with intensity, striking facial expressions, and can convey the right amount of mysteriousness.I actually enjoyed Chris Evans in this different role. After a stellar job in Knives Out, it's nice to see he's trying not to get pigeonholed after playing Captain America for 10 years. His acting convinced me in this role. Looking forward to what he does next, as well as Knives Out 2.Ryan Gosling delivers as expected.Action was fun and entertaining.As many other reviews said, the major downside was the writing. A decent plot, but the back to back action scenes often left little time for character development. The acting, action, and some stunning visual effects saved it enough for me to give out a 7. If you come into it not expecting much for a plot, you will love this movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Ryan Gosling is supposed to be in prison, major make up department fail, he looks like he just walked off a runway, perfect hair and everything, minutes later he's all dressed up and looks the same, just as good, no contrast. The editing gave me major vertigo, you get a cut every 3 seconds. I'm a fan of Gosling and of his work, he's usually fantastic, but Gosling and Billy Bob Thornton have no chemistry whatsoever. They're like the same actor, their acting styles are way too similar to be in the same movie together, you need a Tommy Lee Jones or a more flamboyant actor opposite a guy like Ryan Gosling. Too much lipstick on the teenage girl, major distraction, make- up department messed that up. They spent a lot of money on this movie, feels like they wasted it. I'm having a hard time finishing it.

The acting was great, the cast was great, I liked all the characters portrayed, the fight scenes were good - some a little over the top and a bit too far, but ok it's a movie, I get it. What let this movie down was the plot, either they had too many plot lines going at the same time or they didn't know how to tie them off. It was like two movies mushed into one, or it could've been a miniseries. The plot needed to be scaled back and tidied up for a 2 hour movie.

This is an entertaining flick and well worth your time.While entertaining AND satisfying, the Hollywood Showmanship got a bit excessive... Gray Man is a popcorn action flick but it falls short when its arrogance bites into its believability.Reminiscent of a 90's Arnold action flick (Eraser, True Lies), Ryan Gosling is the DRIVEr, Ana D is both likable & believable as a clandestine agent with loyalty & a heart. However, Captain America & Carmichael are weak (both writing & acting). Plot & action keep your attention but the story, writing and cinematography are at times unnecessarily flashy.Gray Man is a solid 70 out of 100 for entertainment but it's far from ""The Bourne Identity"" (which definitely inspired GM).The simplicity, intelligence & believability of Bourne is also its appeal. As well as its independent roots.G Man is loose at times but solid overall.If you're looking for entertainment and can see more shades than black & white then you'll enjoy the Gray.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Chris Evans is great at playing someone you love to hate. The longest break in an action sequence is probably only 10-15 minutes. If they had made it rated R and gave a little more depth to Goslings character I could have easily put this at a 9.

Clearly a miss, but there are enough good acting, bits of good dialogue and quality action to enjoy watching while cleaning the room and folding the laundry.Synopsis:
The star of ""La La Land"" and ""Drive"" plays a spy named Sierra Six (""007 was taken""), who was recruited out of prison by a handler named Donald Fitzroy (Billy Bob Thornton). After that very brief set-up, ""The Gray Man"" hits the ground running with a mission gone very awry when Six is tasked by a new boss named Denny Carmichael (Regé-Jean Page) with taking out a target that turns out to be a fellow secret agent. The dying man tells Six that Denny is a bad guy before handing him the intel to prove it. Immediately, our stoic hero is on the run, before he's really had any time to develop a personality as a movie character. That kind of blank protagonist is fine for taut, precise action films like those in the ""John Wick"" franchise, but this isn't nearly that tight of a production. This movie needed an Ethan Hunt, someone defined by more than just the clichés that he won't shoot a kid and he has a dark past. (Seriously, it would be tough to name five characteristics of this hero that we're supposed to follow for two hours. Never a good sign.)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Turn the damn BOOK into a movie. Don't just use the book title and some character names and call it a day.Netflix could have gotten three movies , a damn trilogy, from the first book alone. Or made a six part series like THE NIGHT MANAGER.In the movie the Gray Man is cracking jokes while he is being hunted, shot at. Really!?In the book the Gray Man is alone and wounded in various cities, with no passports, no weapons, no money. His genious survival skills are part of the thrill. He's not wearing flashy suits. He's being betrayed by his network but still staying two steps ahead. That tension is nowhere to be found in this 'adaptation'. This 'loosely based on'.If you say you're spending $200 000 000, 00 ( please, look at those zeros) on a movie...
(I'm realizing just now where the money went. The Avengers directors, the Avengers actor, the cute Ryan (okay, all the Ryans are cute. Gosling, Reynolds, Phillipe etc etc), the bond girl, the veteran actor (Thornton), the veteran actress (Woodard), the Bridgerton hunk and so on and so forth)
I think maybe $90 000 000, 00 ended up on film. So, this is a $90 million movie.I thought it would give the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE FRANCHISE, the BOND FRANCHISE, the FAST and FURIOUS FRANCHISE ( the BOLD and the BEAUTIFUL, the YOUNG and the RESTLESS) and all the franchises a run for their money.","13 out of 27 found this helpful.

So if you're into movies like John Wick - you cant miss that one for sure.Overall, this movie worth spending your time if you are ok with standart story, and great action sequences qlong with charismatic characters.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

The Gray Man is an entertaining action movie that keeps you looking forward to the development of a light story, with its unlikely, but dizzying and spectacular action sequences. They appropriately appropriated a couple of recent good elements of current cinema, such as streetcar fights and drone shots, which achieve a better finish than Michael Bay's attempts in his last 2 films, but still need to be perfected. The airplane sequence is amazing, but a bit confusing.The general story of the film has been seen before, the stereotypes of the characters at their different levels is also something already shown in the cinema, however the pair of brothers prevails by showing their imprint in the action cinema.The main cast's performances are delivered entirely to Netflix's latest venture, but are left flat, without depth.The film delivers the formula exhibited by the Russos in the MCU, mixing a lot of action, light humor and some emotion to try to market an entertaining but disposable film that deflates in argumentative weight and in meaning.Recommended for an afternoon after work on a busy day where you just want to see something light.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plot is a pastiche of Jason Bourne and 007, competent but far from intelligent in most aspects. But the plot is inexcusably bad at multiple parts. So contrived it hurts as much as some of the dialogue. However, you can expect some people doing some fun choreography, a couple cool set pieces, and barely passage acting.A few things are literally never explained and seem to be hand waved to make elements of the plot happen. Like, for instance, how does the woman know where the control Center was. How did they track to the last set piece location? Why did the guy switch the mission objective from killing the guy to retrieval suddenly? Stuff just kinda piles up. Fights happen though. That's the important part.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In this case, it's one of the many variations of ""The Dirty Dozen"" in which criminals are freed from prison in order to take on suicidal missions to save the government. The prisoner in question is played by the incredibly handsome Ryan Gosling, and, in a turn of fate for a Netflix production, can actually act.The plot leaps off the premise into a muddled combination of ""Man from UNCLE"" meets Ted Bundy, but you get the idea. This is a movie about action, not realism. Lots of things blow up. Lots of men use karate to fight. Everything is loud.BUT wouldn't it have made more sense to use the acting skills of the line up instead of wasting $200 million blowing up things on a green screen?I will give it a 6 for effort and Ryan.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We get a stupid amount of locations thrown in for the sake of it (as if the more the better), so lots of private jet hopping. I sure hope Prague made some good money for their part in a surreal action set piece.It tries to be funny, maybe MI or John Wick style, but it doesn't have the actors, back history or script to pull it off. Way too much OTT CGI as opposed to actual stunts or fights just make it seem like complete fantasy rather than at least having one foot in some reality.Ana de Armas is a saving grace as she looks great and does her best, Ryan Gosling is sleepwalking through it and Chris Evans is just being a camp OTT bady with bad tach, bad clothes and bad lines. Can over-acting be good acting??Despite the lavish budget and non-stop action I found myself looking at my watch well before the end, suggesting a run time of over 2 hours is just too much to sustain for this type of movie.I can't help but be disappointed.6/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But this was a paroxysm of meaningless hi-tech action -- simply to show it can be done. It's an utter mystery why Netflix would blow $200 million on it. The script - and I use that word loosely here-- must have been written by a couple of frat boys who got their inspiration from a violent video game. I mean there was not a moment of plausibility anywhere in the plot.Yes, there was a lot of buzz about the movie after it first came out. But that's simply the residual hum from all the explosions that lingers in your head after the film ends.I hope it was a good pay day for these actors. But in the pantheon of American films, the gray man is as colorless and unmemorable as they come. For Netflix, it will be one massive loss to be deducted at tax time. What a shame given the quality of the actors and the money that was available for production. As for the alleged screenwriters, have you considered another career?","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Over and all The Gray Man was good one time watch movie and in no way it is a waste of time all you have to do is put your expectations down and leave your brain in refrigerator.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Right? Absolutely! It is an action movie that is fun and a good watch for a family with older kids. I was particularly interested to see Chris Evans as a bad guy... and that is worth the watch in itself. He plays a psychopath that does not like to fail and will use any means necessary to win. He is fantastic and Ryan Gosling was an absolute beast in his role and in all the action sequences. You can see the Jason Bourne and Ethan Hunt influence in his action style and demeanor and it works for him! My kind of action. A must watch movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But the only thing lacking is a substantial story line as it is formulaic and its always a kid (girl) to be saved. Now argumentatively we don't watch these action but with such big names on board in front and behind the camera we do expect more.Performance wise Ryan Gosling with his deadpan straight face delivery was awesome and funny. He looked very good in his action sequences. Chris Evans played the maniac role very convincingly. Ana De Armas is a bad ass, shes a superb action star and needs her own movie.

But the Russo brothers seems to excel at that skill. Perhaps they got used to directing scripts that you could write on the back of a stamp whilst diving into Capt America and Avengers, but it's painfully evident just how style-over-substance this ""dynamic"" duo is when they dive into something not artificially elevated by fan culture. I don't resent them, per se, but I do resent what movies like this are doing to the industry as a whole. We could've had a whole array of meaningful or exceptional films from actual great director duos (like the Coen Bros) for the budget that was pissed away on this horrible, mediocre, poorly written, overly stylized, and incredibly predictable waste of everyone's time.

It is an easy watch with lots of funny comments, timely dialogs and lots of action. Yes, it looks like all characters are immune to pain and no bodily harm causes them any discomfort..Goslings' character got stabbed, cut and shot numerous times, Evan's shot off fingers don't make an issue for him.. however, I think this is the look and feel they were going for.. something in between Mission Impossible and Kingsman movies. I loved Gosling in the movie and his character of a cold guy who risks his life to save people he cares about and shows his killer and sensitive sides. Some pretty good fight scenes!! Evans did a great job as well! If I want to watch a movie again, it is a good movie for me! I have watched it already 3 times!

They have a much higher batting average when it comes to their TV show production than their films. For every Irishman there are 20 Ridiculous 6's (I chose that example for the pandering fact that our lead characters name is Sierra 6, I couldn't pass it up. Sorry.)The Grey Man sits somewhere between those two examples. Is it high cinema? No. Is it terrible? Absolutely not. Is it missing that something that most Netflix films do? Without a doubt, which is a shame cause there is so much to like about this film from the quilt dialogue that everyone is having fun with to the effortless Gosling charm or the absolute ball that Chris Evans is clearly having getting to play a million miles away from Captain America. Side note, I was totally unsure and not sure about his choice of haircut for the film, but I have to admit it totally fits the character.Plot is Gosling must survive his own agency trying to wipe him out after getting his hands on some info that could bring down a corrupt government official. Cue said government official using his crazy 'will do anything' asset Played by Evans to retrieve said info and take out Gosling. Pretty straight forward.The supporting cast are all solid and it was great to see Billy Bob again as he really doesn't do enough for how good he is.I will say I love that they didn't do any damsel/love interest in distress and respected the female characters as much as the male ones. They don't get much character development, but no one really does, so it's an even playing ground in my opinion.The score is great. It's shot fairly well, but there are a couple times in action sequences where action isn't as clear or geographically cohesive as they should have been.Please don't get me wrong. I enjoyed this flick and will watch it again but if you're after insane 'what is going on' action then 6 Underground is for you.My main gripe with The Grey Man is that it should have had a couple of moments to stop and give us a little character depth. It would have gone a long way. Also, thing I love the most about Goslings performance is when ever he gets hurt he just grunts like he is frustrated that it happened. It's really charming.I recommend turning the lights off, popping some corn, cracking a coupla brews and having a fun Friday night. This is a check your brain at the door and collect it on the way out situation. The film kinda falls apart if you think about it too much afterwards so don't. Be in the moment.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Evans is unrecognizable (from a performance perspective) and it's clearly visible why he denied the protagonist's role for playing a psychopathic antagonist.Ana de Armas and Ryan Gosling are equally fantastic. I expected a more screenplay for Alfre Woodard as she's a fabulous actress. Seeing Dhanush in a smaller role yet excellent hand-to-hand combat was a treat.Another interesting aspect of the film is its cinematography and effective use of drones (mostly).As already stated, the film's story and writing are a bit of a disappointment. It seems like writers had a checklist to make sure they cover every plot element from the most famous franchises.The espionage part lacks effectiveness as the screenplay is action-heavy and seems like there wasn't enough room for it in the script.Ana de Armas' character never gets a chance to tell her story to viewers and her involvement in all this mess made by seirra six doesn't make much sense.In finality, Even with a formulaic approach, Russo Brothers' The Gray Man is an action-packed fast-paced thrill ride with a ton of fun in it if you can keep your expectations under control and don't compare it with the previous ventures of the directors.As someone who enjoys Liam Neeson action-flicks a lot, I think I've managed to allot some space for such escapist cinema.Had this film had better a script and a more mature direction, it would have been a phenomenal achievement for Russo Bros out of the MCU but as they are returning for a sequel, I hope they will rectify the minor problems with which this film suffered.Rating: 7.3/10Follow on Instagram/Letterboxd: m_movie_reviews.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It doesn't matter what budget you use for a movie once it's released, it's open for all kinds of criticism and praise. This movie deserves both, but I found it just one time to watch. Nah nah na ... still there's a lot to share with you my dear filmy buffs.It's a spoiler free short review that won't talk about the story, but the story disappoints. Why did I say that? Come on anyone who is a regular cinephile can agree on this, it's a high budget mediocre. Again, I do not want to sound like a cheated ex of Russo brothers. In fact, I am a great admirer of their work myself. Once you watch it you know that you already have seen this kind of story in other spy or mission films. But ""Mostly, it's loss which teaches us about the worth of things."" Ohh I just fell in love with dialogues.Every film is different and honestly writing compared to art is not my cup of tea. However, I don't compare. I still found it a blend of mission impossible, 007 vibe. The fun fact is in a scene where Claire (the girl played by Julia) asks Six ""Six is an odd name"" and six replies ""Yeah, Yeah Just 007 was taken, so."" This dialogue says a lot itself. Makers had an idea that what they are making can be compared badly. There was a very thin line. On the other hand, as an audience we have consumed so much content with similar pillars, and the plots that we can't help but point out the similarities.What hooks you well? There are movements filled with high octane action which actually glued me to the couch. The tramp chasing sequence and the lone wolf fight work for the action lovers. However, in other scenes there is no major novelty in fight choreography.Now comes the best part which I loved the most: the camerawork. It is a marvellous job. First when the speedy camera rolling like a roller coaster showed up It felt like a flying dragon but later, I got used to it. I searched on IMDB and found Stephen Windon as the DOP of film, hats off to him.The biggest highlight of the film is the famous casting. Chris Evan as the bad guy looks bad with exactly a good moustache. He makes you hate him which succeeds him as an actor. His sexy Tamil friend Dhanush equally delivered a fantastic job. Screen presence was not much, but in the sequel maybe he will get more action scenes who knows. Now our lead Gray Man aka six real life Gasling is enough to entertain you with his charming smile. He fits the shoes for the character of six. The bond between Six and Claire brings emotions to the story.Never doubt the Russo brothers and their potential. Sometimes in the creative process things go up and down. It happens. Maybe they were trying to create something extraordinary but couldn't make it. Today's failure is tomorrow's victory, just stick to the learning.

Ryan Gosling is in prenominal shape and pulls off the quiet, but ultimately caring hit man character. He probably adds a star with his performance alone.Chris Evans was outstanding as the psychotic bad guy, but the concept behind him being a ""Contracter"" who failed out of the CIA program is a little farfetched, even for a mindless action flick.The plot has been seen before and there is nothing very original about the story line, but my biggest problem may have been the cast decisions with the heads of the CIA's operations department. Both Regé-Jean Page and Jessica Henwick were way too young for their positions and seemed like diversity choices vs what would be expected in those roles. The roles very well could have been an African American or a woman's role, but not at their ages. It was just kinda silly how they acted throughout the entire movie as well.But again, if you wanna take your mind off and enjoy Gossling kicking some butt for two hours, then you won't go away too unhappy.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","The Russo Brothers May have Peaked with the MCU","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8722242/?ref_=tt_urv","emryse","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur128569426/?ref_=tt_urv","7 December 2022","As someone who likes Marvel movies, possibly more than I should given their quality, I've seen a solid chunk of the Russo brothers filmography. While from Winter Soldier to Infinity they have consistently produced some of the MCUs best work, they never seemed to have the same ownership of their films that say a James Gunn or Taika Waititi has. What I'm trying to say is there films lacked a certain stylistic flair, while still being enjoyable there was nothing that ever screamed to me, this is what the Russo brothers brought to the table. Perhaps that's an unfair assessment but never the less I was excited to see some of their post MCU work and find out what they would do without the creative shackles of having to fit into Feige's masterplan. So on a flight back from Greece over the summer I decided to see what they had to offer with the Gray Man. Turns out, not much.The story is fairly predictable, it follows a super covert Jason Bourne style spy with a special set of skills that means he can beat up anyone he faces, who goes awol after learing a secret he wasn't supposed to know, this leads to him racing round the world with a price on his head, hijinks ensue. There are hundreds of films that have done this before and will be hundreds to come, so how does this one set itself apart? There's a little girl? I guess that's somewhat unique. Ok, so storywise there isn't a whole lot going for it, what about the acting? Ryan Gosling is decent, he's doing that quippy tough guy with a heart of gold thing that, again has been done to death. Ana De Armas is in the film. And then there is Chris Evans, after starring in all of the Russo's MCU films he returns here as the villain. Playing a very similair character to the one he played in Knives Out, he's the snarky wiseass who is just evil because it's fun, again this isn't new. Chris Evans is a fun actor and I've seen a lot of praise for him bringing some much needed life to this xanax of a film but honestly he's just trying too hard for me here, it doesn't come across as sincere and feels forced.Alright so let's not focus on the actors, this is an action film, how's the action. Bland, one or two creative ideas mixed in but not enough to keep things interesting. Honestly this film is almost a perfect 5, it's not necessarily bad but there was nothing here that felt original or different in any way from the rest of the genre. The only thing that makes it a 6 was that it was fairly well shot.Painfully average but my eyes liked it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Which movies of this type aren't exaggerated? Mission Impossible, Jason Bourne, even James Bond all have the protagonist escaping the impossible, surviving certain death, and uttering humorous dialogue. That's partly what makes them so entertaining. For you critics of such things, put your money where your mouth is and try writing one better or that appeals to your overinflated sense of movie perfection.I thought the movie was well written, acted, and directed. It was never boring at all. Ryan Gosling is surely an A lister, Ana De Armas after this, Bond, and Ghosted, should be considered for the role of 007 if they care to move in that direction. Julia Butters reminds me of Natalie Portman in Leon where you just know that girl has got a bright future ahead of her. Unfortunately for Julia, she is listed as being 4' 8"" and unless she grows a bit more that short stature could hinder her from getting good roles. Chris Evans plays the antagonist brilliantly. He's a bad guy with charisma that you actually like. Too bad they killed him off because if there is another one, it would have been nice to see him and Gosling go at it again.This movie is definitely worth the watch. Just take it for what it is, an action movie with some scattered humor.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is some fantastic sequences and the exotic locales are nice to look at. Its mostly mindless action, but it is fun.Ryan Gosling is Six, an assassin for a covert government agency (aren't they always?) who is sent on a mission to kill a rogue agency agent. Before his quarry dies, he gives Six a medallion that contains an encrypted drive. It apparently has information on all the illegal stuff the agency has been doing. Six realizes he might be playing for the wrong team and goes on the run. His former handler, Fitzroy (Billy Bob Thorton) tries to help him but is compromised when his niece (Julia Butters) is taken as leverage. The agency then sends an off-the-books assassin, Lloyd (played with devilish malice by Chris Evans), to kill Lloyd and retrieve the drive. Along the way, Six teams up with Dani Miranda (the fascinating Ana de Armas) another agent who initially is trying to bring in Six, but then turns into an ally.The locations are gorgeous. Prague, Czech Republic, France, and Vienna show up at various times as the combatants cross Europe hunting each other.The plot doesn't really break any new ground, but under the direction of the Russo Brothers, it does have some great set pieces. The shootout atop a train on the street of Prague is exciting and well shot and is a highlight of the film. The conclusion was kind of a let down as it replicates every other action film of this kind. Still, the movie as a whole was fun to watch.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The action, while entertaining, is absurdly chaotic and over the top. Sequences like the plane falling out of the sky are unnecessary and nearly impossible to follow. I have seen movies with 10% of The Gray Man's budget (The Raid 2), deliver better action sequences. Some of the action is solid, especially a few of the fight sequences but I was disappointed with the PG-13 rating. There is little impact in a lot of the gunfights because of the neutered rating. Nameless henchman will get shot with very little SFX feedback registering with a satisfying effect. The plot is also all over the place with some mediocre acting outside of the three leads. The movie ends with sequel aspirations in mind, and it takes away from a completely satisfying ending.Despite all my gripes with The Gray Man I was entertained throughout. After a long week it's nice to sit back, relax and watch something as over the top and ridiculous as The Gray Man. Movies are meant to entertain by the end of the day, and if you can turn you brain off there is certainly entertainment to be found. However, if you turn your brain on you will find The Gray Man to be another massively budgeted action movie that fails to deliver a decent plot.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

From the shambolic ""Red Notice (2021)"" to the atrocious ""The Man from Toronto (2022)"", Netflix has made a habit of putting out big ticket star-studded action films on their platform, only to vastly under-deliver on built-up expectations. While ""The Gray Man"" is definitely an improvement from these earlier misadventures, it isn/t a worthy addition to the Russo brothers' otherwise eclectic filmography.Ryan Gosling stars as ""Sierra Six"", an ex-convict turned assassin groomed and trained by the CIA to conduct sanctioned 'wet' ops for them around the world. After an operation in Thailand goes south, this poor man's Jason Bourne comes in possession of a memory card that holds proof of some sanctioned hits the CIA higher-ups have executed around the world. I mean commeon!!! How many spy thrillers can one make based on this same thread?!! Chris Evans enters the scene as a psychopathic mercenary tasked with hunting down Sierra Six in an ultra-pretentious, wannabe villain role that just goes to show how far the actor has fallen from the highs of the MCU and this mantle as ""Captain America"", the former leader of the Avengers.Filmmakers across the world seem to think that if you throw in some gorgeous actors, international locales and some decent fight sequences with eye-catchy BGMs, they can cover up for run-of-the-mill, unimaginative storytelling in spy/espionage thrillers. They seem to be forgetting that franchises like ""Jason Bourne"" and ""John Wick"" were built on innovation, with the former relying on krav-maga inspired ground level close quarters combat and the latter, still continuing to set the standard on what has come to be known as ""gun fu"", a gorgeous mix of kung fu and other martial arts alongside gunplay. They were also able to paint intricate character studies of their titular heroes as conflicted, broken men which the viewers could easily relate to and empathize with, none of which happen in ""The Gray Man"".The stunt design from ace choreographer James Young is the only thing that makes this movie watchable, holding together the tedious storytelling and caricature-ish characters. From the exhilarating opening sequence to the train-top fights to whenever Dhanush is unleashing the carnage on screen, you tend to forget the wafer-thin storyline and mildly enjoy the goings on. However, such moments are too few and far between and ultimately result in no convincing payoff by an ultra-generic final act and ""shudder"" an open-ended climax that leaves the door open for a sequel. Not recommended!In a year that has delivered some of the best espionage spy thrillers in recent memory like ""Munich: The Edge of War"" and ""Operation Mincemeat"" as well as stellar TV shows in the same genre like ""The Old Man"", ""Slow Horses"" and ""The Ipcress File"", ""The Gray Man"" simply doesn't cut it to make any lasting impression when the bar has been raised so high.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo manage to hold the viewer from the first to the last scene, with a movie where the fights, car chasing, guns, grenades, and an innocent hostage teenager with heart problems are the main ingredients. They get everything right but the plot. It's a traditional one where the CIA hires a ""good guy"" who just happened to be a killer to perform dirty jobs. The tables are turned when he himself becomes a victim of the CIA. We've seen many other movies with a similar plot and this one is no different. The most absurd thing about this movie is that the main characters look like robots, with so many stab wounds, burns, and torn nails, none of them feel pain or act like they are in pain.If you like action movies, this is perfect for you.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is just about non-stop action from beginning to end for two hours. There is a plot, a little one, but who cares?! Plot is not the name of the game here. Ryan Gosling's charisma helps carry this along and one can see him actually playing Bond, though that will never happen after this as Netflix wants to start a new franchise. I'm not sure how as this doesn't slow down long enough for Gosling to develop a character, but that may not matter in this era. Chris Evans is his super evil foe and he plays it well until the inevitable final confrontation. The true waste here is Ana.de Armas who was about the best thing in the latest Bond film, No Time to Die, but when not kicking butt in this, she's not all that interesting. It's all about one man, Gosling, defeating endless numbers of people in preposterous and over the top ways to get to just one, Evans. It's not boring, but it is sort of routine despite all the action.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Action scenes are very badly done with multiple cuts during them, as a result you can barely tell what is happening. There is also an over reliance on CGI, there are some scenes that feel right out of a super hero movie, which considering the directors, is not surprising. The worst offender of all though is the dialogue, I am not even exaggerating when I say that almost all of the dialog is just jokes and dialog. Even when some characters are dying they are still cracking jokes non-stop making it impossible to even remotely care or take this movie serious. The two stars are for Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans who are at least doing what they can, avoid it all costs there many better action movies, like the mission impossible movies.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

On terms of story there isn't really one since there is more action than there is acting. Chris Evans is the best part of the movie has the main bad guy he plays a complete psychopath which we don't normally see him play as most people see him as the good guy. The movie is beautifully shot tho but the writing wasn't on par with it especially the character development there is some but not a hole lot.

Gosling is the Gray Man an operative of a super secret faction used for covert affairs (the film opens up w/Gosling on a murder for hire mission in Bangkok abetted by de Armas, a CIA agent) but when the hit doesn't go down to the letter of his superior's, Rege-Jean Page, dictates, Gosling becomes a target for retribution (especially since Gosling's target, a former member of his group, hands off a thumb nail drive containing Page's shadowy activities). Gosling now has to globetrot his way to freedom (as well as track down his recruiter, Billy Bob Thornton, & his sickly niece, Julia Butters) while a noisy a-hole version of himself, limned by Evans, is hot on his heels. Even though the action set pieces makes even the casual action hound lick their lips, there is a lot of artless art on display as the film ultimately is as weighty as a bag full of feathers but the Russos know how to keep the momentum going w/o devolving into Michael Bay-ish visual hysterics. Also starring Jessica Henwick as Page's right hand woman & Alfre Woodard as another of Gosling's handlers.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It contains many moments and remarks of irony that indicated to me this was just meant to be a young, fresh, ironic take on the spy thriller genre.I appreciated the real gunshot sounds! The protagonist faction's characters were well-cast, and their dialogue was generally fitting with the producers' intent as above.The cast for the antagonist side of the house was horrific, however, with the only exception being the Lloyd character. I thought in particular the Carmichael and Suzanne characters' acting and dialogue were cringe. Depending on what the producers intended with this movie, I think these characters would have been more believable if played by older actors.The action, once again, made me think about the intent frequently. If I attempt to take the movie seriously, it fails because of its overuse of destruction and completely unimaginative and reckless action sequences - albeit with some humor - especially considering what they chose to name the movie. If I assume, however, that it tries to be ironic and funny and does not want to be taken seriously, it brings a few original moments to the table.Overall, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and accept the fact that I was entertained and that this movie has no intention of being anything but a forgettable flick.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

People hear Goslyng, Evans, the Russo brothers and a big budget, and get their expectations up. Im not all to easy to please, but I thought this was an action flick, it was, and to a decent score of 7. I feel like the entire point of «flicks» is to be easy entertainment, and that it was. Very much from start to finish. Are only actors like Jason Statham allowed to do movies like this and get a decent rating? Cmon. Why not let Gosling in on all the fun?!Can you dissect the movie down to a series of flaws and missed opportunities and compare it to the best of all films? Sure, and then it's a 4-5. But let movie makers have some fun with it, and make some badass characters that does badass stuff and shrugs of some stab wounds that didnt hurt, pay the most expensive actors to do it, and roll with it. I normally don't let those things slide to easily, but it felt obvious to me the movie confessed it sins and said «I know, but hey, it looked cool, right?», and thus I forgave.The movie is fast paced, jammed packed with action - some good, some bad - some cool and funny characters, Gosling in particular, a few momorable scenes, and a great child actor. Some questionable camera work at times, sure, but mostly top notch. A very decent action flick, which it clearly intended to be. And in that category, I think it deserves a 7.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Then I read that Netflix is trying to make this the new 'Jason Bourne' franchise and I thought well it must be good for someone to say that.After watching it, yeah it's good enough, it follows a pretty much generic spy movie formula but it's a formula that worked. It's just pretty predictable. Directed by the Russo brothers so the action's expected to be great and it was; it's type with extravagant car chases, guns with seemingly endless bullets at times and a lot of fist fights as well, enough to get the adrenaline pumping. So it gets the job done on that end and the leading trio of Gosling, Chris Evans and Ana de Armas did great too; I felt like Regé-Jean Page wasn't cast right and Netflix was just riding the wave, wringing out his Bridgerton success, he didn't do badly though.Only problem is I didn't feel as emotionally invested despite actually liking this, I was watching for the thrill and not exactly rooting for anybody; I think that'll be needed if Netflix actually wants this to be the next Jason Bourne. It carries a lighter tone, there's a huge conspiracy and huge things at stake and all but I didn't really care or feel the urgency for the good guys to win, or in the life or death scenarios. It's just not as well gelled as it should be.At the end of the day I still think it's a solid watch and would recommend. It's good fun and good enough to deserve a prequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Aside from what most people said about how Anthony and Joe Russo have done something very poor, i recommend that you watch it yourself and judge it personally because tastes vary from one to another.

Evans confirms himself as a good villain, as in ""Knives Out"", crazy enough to make the writing of this film hold up, even if is very simple and already seen (a killer hired by the CIA to give him the opportunity to redeem himself through the fight against crime? Come on ...).However, there are some good elements that in my opinion could have been developed better, such as the backstory of Six (Ryan Gosling) and a possible link with the past of Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans). A real shame. A direction full of flashbacks that distract from the emphasis of what could have been a real moral journey against a corrupt system, where the boundary between good and evil is no longer defined.And the action scenes, 200 mln budget and the crucial sequences, like the cargo one, appear like a video game cutscenes with an extremely confused editing.I'm disappointed, but at least entertains.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Agreed, it does not have a story and not upto the expectations considering that the creators of this movie actually made box office hits.But personally, I did feel this movie to be not so bad. With Chris Evans who played his role like a true villain and ryan gosling as a dude who is just doing his job.This movie is not for everyone. Some like drama mixed with action and you will not expect anything that you have seen in Avengers or any superhero movies. Ryan Gosling has heavy plot armour in this movie gotta agree.I mean they should have added more content to this movie considering the price it took to make this movie.What I liked from this movie are the fight scenes and chase scenes where Chris Evan's character sends out many assasins to end Ryan Gosling.But this movie is definitely not your average Russo movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Overall, it is much less credible, but very au courant with girl boss agents seemingly equal to their male counterparts both in their physical prowess and ethical dysfunction.Gosling plays the trained assasin, ""Six,"" in a super secret rogue CIA program. Plucked from prison, where he's serving a long sentence for killing his abusive father, Six gets his ""freedom"" in exchange for a lifelong commitment to kill ""bad guys"" for the agency on a no-questions asked basis.Eighteen years later, he has become very very good at his job. On assignment in Bangkok, however, it all goes wrong one night when his target, before dying, informs him that his name is ""Four"", and hands him an encrypted USB drive, which we later learn contains incriminating information about the super secret rogue assasin program. Panic erupts in Langley as the heads of the super secret program fear exposure via the release of the contents of the drive to the media and initiate orders to find and kill ""Six"" and retrieve the drive.In reality, they would simply initiate a psy-op, branding the story a ""conspiracy theory."" Or, even better, they would prevail upon the legacy media and tech giants to suppress it on the grounds that it is ""disinformation.""But then there wouldn't be any excuse for the ensuing travelogue to a couple of dozen exotic locales, innumerable chase scenes, impossible escapes and a trail of military-scale death and destruction across at least three continents. By the end of the movie, I was exhausted by the frequency and scale of the violence displayed, but YMMV.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But if you are looking for a fun action film on Netflix look no further.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Chris Evans character was immature and he played it so well. I found it quite funny sometimes. The only annoying part to me was on the plane. Obviously in other fight scenes they used a lot of camera magic to make things seem like stuff it wasn't. With that being said, the movie magic was pretty affective. Good action and a little laugh. It was exactly what I thought it would be. I would watch it again.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It is appreciated that Ana de Armas is making the effort to be a hero and that Chris Evans tries to leave Captain America behind, but it was not enough. In addition, the comedy does hinder the film and brings less to the emotional impact of its most important scenes, since it can never be as brutal as it promises or as deep as pretending, and that is because it cannot avoid that its characters do not be nice for a single moment. This makes the story end up repeating clichés of the spy genre that offer nothing to the audience.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A CIA operative offers an immediate release, in return for which the Gosling character must join an elite program to assassinate ""bad guys"". We then go to ""Eighteen Years Later"" and the Gosling character (now nicknamed ""Sierra Six"") is in Bangkok, waiting for the ""bad guy"" to arrive... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest film directed by the Ruddo Brothers, best known for their repeated work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Here they tackle an equally intended big production. Let's state the obvious: there is little to no character development, and the story line also isn't all that relevant: there are ""good guys (and gals)"" and ""bad guys"" and that's about it. So how about the action scenes then? Ultimately, there is one long sequence involving a streetcar chase in Prague that will thrill you and which truly is the MUST-SEE moment of the film. Besides that one show-stopper, the rest feels like rehashed second rate ""Mission Impossible"" stuff. Ryan Gosling is trying his best Tom Cruise-wannabe. Chris Evans as the baddie is strikingly annoying. Ana de Armas (as Gosling's CIA ally) fronts the worst possible haircut. Billy Bob Thornton has a small role (and looks freakishly skinny). The production sets are tops, and the movie plays out in too many countries to name, immediately reminding of James Bond and ""Mission Impossible"" movies, which the movie clearly is patterned after.After a one week limited theater run, the movie premiered on Netflix last night, and I'll admit I was looking forward to seeing it. With a production budget of $200 million (!), this is the most expensive movie from Netflix ever, and one Netflix is hoping to make into a franchise tentpole. Good luck with that, Netflix! I found ""The Gray Man"" to be a big production action movie done strictly by the numbers and without any depth or compelling story telling. Of course don't take my word for it, so I encourage you to check it out, and draw your own conclusion.","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

Some of it is pretty good, some of it is pretty bad, but most of it is just mediocre. The expensive but tepid experience moves from set-piece to set-piece with little thought as to what ties them together. The barebones plot and stock characters do little to hold your attention, and the action isn't good enough to carry the entire experience. The banter between its lifeless core players falls totally flat because none of them have any chemistry whatsoever (mostly due to the writing), while only a few of the affair's incessant quips are even close to being witty. The film falls in an odd limbo when it comes to its tone, resting somewhere between self-serious and self-aware. A lot of it just feels incongruent with itself, a picture that can't quite decide what it wants to be. It's constantly trying to be cool, but it just never is. There are also several eye-rolling moments. Its narrative shortcomings wouldn't be so bothersome if its action was more than just okay overall. The hand-to-hand combat is generally enjoyable, if never quite as easy to follow as it ought to be, and the gunfights are typically tangible. There is an extended sequence set in Prague that's mostly successful, seamlessly moving from a frantic shootout to a fast-paced car chase. The finale is easily the film's highlight, progressing from an explosive siege to a personalised fistfight and culminating in one of the picture's few attempts at subversion. Anything bigger than a gun battle completely falls apart, though. I mean, that Prague sequence I mentioned earlier eventually devolves into a total CGI mess, and a plane crash that occurs prior is so terrible that you literally can't tell what's going on in its entire second half. You get the sense that the Russo brothers just give up a lot of the time, putting effort into the first portions of their set-pieces before throwing up their hands when they realise they're in over their heads and letting the visual effects artists try to fix their on-set mistakes. It often feels like they're just throwing everything they can at the screen in an effort to make things seem more exciting than they actually are, biting off more than they can chew just so they can say they used every bit of the flick's exorbitant budget. Even at its best, their direction is weak. There's no real sense of style and several shots are just bizarre, including a multitude of disorienting drone shots that seem like something ripped straight out of 'The Evil Dead (1981)'. The editing is noticeably choppy in places, too, and a lot of the mostly bloodless violence feels absolutely weightless because of it. This definitely would've been better suited as an R-rated affair, especially as some of the killings are too conceptually brutal for their tame execution to feel suitable. The cinematography is generally muddy and bland, often soaking the screen in so much smoke that it's difficult to parse what's actually being shown. Though some of the establishing work does a decent job in setting up the globe-trotting adventure's various extravagant locales, the overall aesthetic is underwhelming and unmemorable. It certainly doesn't look like it cost as much as it did, although most of the money clearly went to the cast and the councils of the various cities the production obviously hijacked large amounts of. The picture isn't especially bad, and a lot of it is genuinely enjoyable. As I mentioned earlier, its finale is its most entertaining segment, almost seeming like something out of an altogether more interesting affair, and there are smatterings of intriguing action sprinkled throughout that also peak your attention. There are flashes of the feature this could've been, moments which make you forget about the dreariness of the rest of the affair. However, even these moments aren't likely to remain in your memory for long. It's tempting to call this good enough for what it is, but it isn't really. A more apt declaration would probably be that it's good enough for a Netflix original. When you look at its competition, though, that seems like faint praise indeed.","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

There's more but the general public have short attention spans.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Gosling and Evans played to their charsima, whilst Billy Bob and Ana De Armas (two exceptionally gifted actors), just dialled in their effort.Russo brothers did what they do best with the action, but the script was lazy. The ending rushed. Too much brawn, no brains. This could be perceived as my being too critical, but for 200 mil, this movie needed to do more.

"6","/10","A Fun, Generic Action Flick","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8416058/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","8 August 2022","I've never understood why Netflix sinks hundreds of millions of dollars into a film that will only play on their streaming service. I personally think when they choose to spend that much, it should absolutely be worthy of hitting theatres to make some money back. The Gray Man is their latest release with such a huge budget, but being released directly to their service made it feel smaller. I'm complaining about this right now because this film is just average overall, but it has some fun moments and I probably would've had even more fun with it on the big screen. Anyways, here's my review of The Gray Man.Ryan Gosling plays Six, the most skilled person working for the CIA, who begins to uncover dark secrets that are being kept from him. Now trying to survive with a bounty on his head, and hunted by Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans), there is never a dull moment. I say there aren't any dull moments here, but that's only due to the fun action set pieces. There are a lot of action scenes to go along with this premise and most of them are very well-done. For that reason alone I had a lot of fun, but the film itself is very average as a whole. It's a very generic story that doesn't take any risks or give any huge surprises, but I enjoyed the characters and the action enough to want to return for a sequel.At its core, this is a film that is over two hours long, but really just wants to get to the point where Chris Evans and Ryan Gosling face off against each other. I wanted this so badly throughout the film because Chris Evans steals the show as Lloyd and I just wanted to see him get his ass kicked. His portrayal of this flamboyant prick was pretty close to perfect for what they were going for. His performance made the entire film worthwhile, even though I was already enjoying Gosling in the lead role. There's not much more to this film though unless you dissect all the subplots surrounding the main story, which weren't interesting enough for me to even mention.In the end, this Russo Brothers-directed action flick is a fun watch if you're looking for something exciting, but it really does leave all the nuance of great storytelling at the door. I won't fault the film for that though, because it knew what it was striving to be. It's a dumb, fun action flick that only wants to be that. The dialogue is cringe at times and the CGI looks off as well, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't at least have some fun watching it. I can absolutely see where they can dive deeper into Ryan Gosling's character though, Spider-man I can absolutely see why they're making a sequel. The Gray Man isn't great by any means, but there is a lot worse out there.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Their next project cherry left us disappointed. After cherry, their next project gray man was very much anticipated.In terms of making, the gray man is very much in the lines of the winter soldier. The name of the location shown in capital letters reminds you of civil war. Story has nothing new to offer, screenplay is predictable, there are lot of action set pieces in which the plane sequence and prague shootout was impressive. The climax action sequence lacked the punch.Coming to performances, its chris evans as the sociopathic Lloyd Hansen who carries the acting department on his shoulders. Looks like he had a blast playing this bad guy. Ryan gosling's job was to do action scenes well and he does it with ease. Ana de armas was not given proper chance to be badass. If you ask whether dhanush was used well or not then i would say yes and no. He's given two action scenes but to cast a two time national award winning actor for just two action scenes is not actually fair. If just for action, you could have cast vishal.On the whole, if you loved winter soldier for its making and action scenes, then you may like gray man. But if you liked winter soldier for its plot and politics, then gray man would disappoint you.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And the film does appear to be expressing indifference to causing death and cultural destruction in foreign countries.

Also known as The Gray Man, he uncovers dark secrets about the CIA in a drive and goes on the run with it. To stop and kill him before he leaks out the information, the CIA recruit a former psychopathic agent, Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans). Hansen launches a manhunt against Six and thus begins a cat and mouse chase between Six and HansenWhen i first saw the trailer of the film, i was desperately waiting for it cause it looked like an action packed, adrenaline pumping film with a good story. It is action packed, but the adrenaline and the good story are absent.The film opens on a good note with an action scene. But as it progresses, the pace of the film becomes like a rollercoaster, giving no time for character development. The film feels rushed, and the action scenes also seem forced. There is nothing new in the story and there are several moments in the film where you get a sense of déjà-vuThe direction by The Russo Brothers is just average this time. Sure, the shots are very well taken but the pace, rhythm, character development, story of the film, that's a meh. Cinematography, not terrible, but not excellent also. Editing is poor, had the film been cut by 15-20 minutes, it would have been a much, much better watchSpeaking of performances, Ryan Gosling looks like he was forced to do this role. There is absolutely no energy shown by him in the film. On the flip side, Chris Evans looks like he had a great time doing this role. He's the standout performer for me in this film. Billy Bob Thornton gets no scope to perform. Ana De Armas is fine. Jessica Henwick, Wagner Moura and Alfre Woodard are wasted.I would like to give a special mention to Dhanush, who just steals the show in a small cameo appearanceFinal word: A bland netflix film not worth your time.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Probably not. But it is entertaining and is worth watching for fans of big, easy to watch action films.There is a solid list of things it does well. Ryan Gosling is a solid protagonist, injecting his deadpan humour and that mysterious quality he holds into the role. The action sequences, while derivative and familiar, are entertaining and there are plenty of them laced throughout the film.The pacing is pretty solid and there is a good enough collection of characters.However, these characters are not always fleshed out to a sufficient degree. Ana de Armas' character was underdeveloped, and I do think Chris Evans' character should have taken centre stage a little more.The biggest letdown is probably the plot. A device containing information that needs to be retrieved, rogue operatives, globetrotting... Sound familiar? Of course it does, it's the plot for far too many action movies. The lack of originality here meant that at times the film felt like it was going through the motions and it was far too easy to predict, which removed most of the jeopardy.Still, I did enjoy The Gray Man and fans of big budget action sequences and shady espionage thrillers will find plenty to enjoy here.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was very hyped - $200 budget, Gosling, Evans and De Armas, Russo brothers - everything was on-point, but this result is just a disgrace. The visuals are pretty much awful and the storyline is atrociously simple. The action scenes are solid, with some very good ideas here and there, but nothing spectacular. With 200 million in my pocket, I would film the best movie ever, the screenplay and all, I just cannot understand. I cannot. Why, Netflix, why do you invest money in these middy blockbusters. It's insane. I love Netflix.

And yes the plot isn't gonna stack up to an in-depth dissection, but it goes along at a competent pace and doesn't feel like it's 2 hour runtime. The fighting choreography is no John Wick but it's alright. And the CGI is at times too obvious for it's fairly hefty budget. The characters mostly have formulaic backstories with good-guys and bad-guys we've seen before so no one is getting an Oscar nod here (whatever that's worth anyway). But everyone does a solid, if not over-extending, job in their scenes; everyone puts in some effort and looks like they cared and enjoyed it. Chris Evans especially looks like he had fun and he steals every scene he's in. The scenes he and Gosling shared are also sharp and fun. Overall it's an enjoyable ride, with decent action scenes and some fun dialogue. It's not groundbreaking but there's far worse ways to spend 2 hours.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

They have both become smarter with their roles staring in scripts that have some substance. I'm a huge fan of both. So it pains me to say, while Ryan does a good job in this movie, Chris was surprisingly a weak link. He is supposed to be a maniacal villain, but instead he comes across kind of theatrical like he is overacting. The mustache also did not work for him. Not his best work. The movie overall is your typically spy action movie: intricate fight scenes, explosions, gun fights etc. It's entertaining, but nothing that allows it to stand out and become memorable. Not bad, but with the great cast, it could have been epic.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I don't think there's a single location change that isn't accompanied by title text. That aside, this movie is seriously non stop action and it's really enjoyable if you like lots of explosions and fights and who doesn't enjoy another CIA off the books unhinged action hero.Let's talk Chris Evens as a bad guy, it was difficult at first to see him as anything but the wholesome Steve Rogers but dang if he didn't play this role well! Is it the mustache? Maybe the prep boy outfit? I don't know but it turns out Captain can be a bad boy so props to Evens for taking on a non type role for himself. Ryan Gosling really plays up the strong silent type and we get a little bit of back story on his character about halfway through the move but besides that not a whole lot of depth but again this is a non stop action movie and I didn't expect deep character building. All in all this is a ACTION movie and a pretty good one, so for fun filled explosions give it a watch!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You liked it, didn't you? I sure did, but I didn't like it as much as I liked the Broadway Company of Hamilton that I saw in NYC the year before.Such is the case with the new Ryan Gosling/Chris Evans action flick THE GRAY MAN. It is reminiscent of the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, BOURNE and JOHN WICK films - and is very enjoyable - but I like the other movies better.Directed by THE RUSSO BROTHERS (AVENGERS: ENDGAME) and written by Joe Russo, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (writers of AVENGERS: ENDGAME), based on the book by Mark Greaney, THE GRAY MAN stars Gosling (LA LA LAND) as an enigmatic secret agent (is their any other kind) who is sent on a deadly mission that, perhaps isn't what it seems on the surface (are there any other)?This is a plot VERY reminiscent of the aforementioned MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, BOURNE and JOHN WICK films and when Chris Evans (CAPTAIN AMERICA, of course) and Ana de Armas (the latest James Bond flick, NO TIME TO DIE) show up as a few other mercenaries who might be on Gosling's side - or might not - you can't help but be reminded of those other flicks.And that's the trouble with THE GRAY MAN, it just can't compete (at least in my memory) with those other films, mostly because it doesn't do anything new. It is your basic ""Super Spy"" flick, very professionally done, but it isn't anything you haven't seen before.The actors (Gosling, de Armas and Evans) are very good in their roles and have enigmatic (Gosling), out of control (Evans) and mysterious (de Armas) down very well and are ably assisted by wily veterans like Alfre Woodard (CROSS CREEK) and good ol' Billy Bob Thornton (SLINGBLADE) who seem to having a good time going along for the ride.And...it's a fun ride...the action scenes are well done, set-up and choreographed professionally with just enough unique ways to take out a henchman or blow-up some sort of transport to make it interesting to watch, but...again...it's really nothing new.An entertaining 2 hours of film-making - and a film that will have a sequel on the way - there are worst ways to spend your time and with good (enough) action sequences and interesting and charismatic performers to watch - THE GRAY MAN suits its purpose...it entertains.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I wouldn't have wanted to see him go though, but then we wouldn't have had Evans! Argh.This was a super fun, one man army type of movie. The characters (regardless of how charming either of them might be) were very well written. The attraction of having a bad guy that is also kinda ""funny and alluring"" is great. However, Evans was just too alluring and funny. Not his fault at all!!! It's just something that takes you away. I hate saying that someone is too good of an actor to take anything away from them. Like a heal in wrestling though, you can't make them a face and a heal at the same time. Even The Rock could barely pull that off for a half of a second in the WWE. And, yes, wrestling is definitely a dumbed down narrative, and the Rock couldn't shake a stick at Evans in the acting department.

It follows a pretty standard formula that has been done hundreds if not thousands of times before but it's done well enough that it is actually enjoyable. Ryan Gosling's part does not require masterful acting skills but he does a great job nevertheless and I liked his disposition throughout the film. There isn't a role that Billy Bob Thornton can't play and although this character certainly wasn't much of a challenge for him he made the most of it like usual. There's a ton of action and a lot of violence so if you don't like that stuff I'd stay away from this film. I happen to enjoy a good action film once in a while and this was done quite well. Don't get me wrong, there were a few times where I had to do the typical suspension of disbelief but it wasn't ridiculous.

Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans are great. Otherwise, the laziness of the filmmakers is amusing. I'm in disbelief how somebody can turn Prague into Vienna, Berlin or even Bangkok and Azerbaijan. I also don't understand why the Croatian castle is actually French. I think the location work is very important and even though that some audience might not notice, believe me the Europeans notice it very well. If this could be improved, the story structure would be upgraded a bit and the story line wouldn't all be one big cliché, it might be a very good movie. Now it's just a mediocre film that neither excites nor offends.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There is none and it's not because the directors are incapable and dumb to do so, they didn't do so because of the nature of the movie.

It doesn't try to be all serious, there's some good one-liners and the humor was well placed, I liked it.Gosling played his part perfectly and I really enjoyed his character, I hope he does more like this or like Drive.

Thrilling action scenes can be seen. The spy story seems interesting. And there are two of the biggest stars in the world on set. And of course not to mention......the directors are the Russo brothers. I mean...who wouldn't want to see it? But when I finally had the chance the watch it, there's only one word that came to my mind - disappointment. The plot is not exciting at all. It's the same old spy story, which I expected it to add more elements in the first place. They could have studied the characters more, it's just dull and plain.Let me compare it with other movies, for example, James Bond. One of the best features of James Bond is the character James Bond himself is already very remarkable. That kind of, handsome, flirting dude also gave us another angle of what a spy can be. And this movie...I don't think there's anything special about the characters. I don't even think the Loyld Hansen inside is ""psychopath"" enough. Another example is Jason Bourne. Jason Bourne took us around a mysterious and confusing angle about the identity of the skilled agent. It got our attention in it all the time.And this movie...I just think it's so plain. There's no much significant about it. It's just like another ""spy movie"". I wouldn't get my hopes up for it's sequel, and the Russo brothers should have done better than this.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Big disappointment. A super-trained CIA killer being chased around the world by heartless rogue elements from the same organization.Sitting in front of the TV watching this movie, I kept having flashbacks of ""The Bourne Identity"" and a dozen other clones. It's simply a $200 million retelling of the same story with minor variations. Like getting served macaroni and cheese over and over again, until you start speaking Italian with an English accent.The movie came complete with the usual high-tech control room tracking events; and they even threw in a young girl ala ""Man on Fire"". Naturally, everybody is trying to retrieve data tucked away in a medallion, that proves misdoings in the upper echelons of the organization.Improbable battle scenes in three or four world capitals, shootouts with guns big and smalls, vicious close quarter fights, and a fight in the air, where our hero unrestrains himself, overcomes 6 navy SEALs, destroys the bomber that is transporting him, and safely abandons the plane. Where have a seen this before? I forgot. It will come back to me I am sure the next time I'm served macaroni and cheese.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

You wasted all that money blowing up cars and focusing on shooting and fighting, can you write an actual story about humans and not just boring phantasies of toxic masculine heroes?Full of sexism and male gaze scenes, we are all bored of them, please pay some actual interesting people to write a decent script and film from a half decent perspective. Objectifying women on screen for the sake of it is not cutting it any more. The only thing I appreciated was that they didn't force Ana de Armas and anyone else to be together romantically and they gave her a few lines that fought the overt sexism of the other characters. And that she saved him instead of the other way around. But still, she had no story of her own. I hate action movies. Please men, go to therapy and talk your traumas out instead of writing repetitive action movies just to channel all those unaddressed frustrations and pent up rage. Talking does help. Anger is undressed sadness. You can make a movie about that experience, it would be vastly more interesting and useful.

The wooden acting and horrible wigs worn by Gosling and Thornton, along with the clunky dialogue, gave it away. As it continued and the new actors appeared, it just got worse. Some really terrible performances. The only one who rose above a little, was Evans. A little, in a slightly camp performance.Still, I kept watching, over 2 days, breaking it up due to lack of sleep and boredom.I call it a ""movie"" because it is more like various extended videos pieced together with the occasional connection to reality added. Fight scenes could have been good if one could actually see what was going on. Low light in many of them along with jump editing made them hard to watch but maybe that was the point due to bad choreography?No character development made any of the ""loyalty"" exhibited between characters just say so. In fact the final third of the movie depends on just that, making it all so hollow.The ending was so hasty and unrealistic as to be laughable.3 stars instead of 1 because I actually watched it all.

This is the type of movie I love (and miss). This should've could've been a huge hit in the theaters.... 10 years ago. Before sub par LIVE action CGI superhero cartoons became the only thing considered event movies.It has an all-star cast. It's non-stop action. And it has Ana de Armas (need I say more?). I love that Ryan Gosling and Ana de Armas get to work together again (Blade Runner 2049).I did some investigative work into some of the people giving it lower reviews. Some of those same people are giving Thor Love and Thunder and Black Widow high reviews. My lord... good taste in entertainment has completely been flipped on its head. The superhero genre has completely degraded the standards for what a good movie is. When you actually get a good movie like this, it has to deal with the reviews from people who think cartoon CGI LIVE action is quality... SMH... but I digress...This is a good movie.

I like Gosling so I gave it a shot. I had no idea what the movie was about but 10 mins in (fireworks scene) I kind of already felt that its not gonna be great. So what kind of movie is this? What genre does it focus on? I start to wonder.An action movie? The hand to hand combat parts are subpar though they tried to be creative but still came out uninspired. So maybe If the actor doesn't know how to fight, then design it like what in the movie ""Brawl in Cell Block 99"" did for example. Really simple but very heartfelt if ya know what I'm sayinThe action in general feels ""fake"" and disjointed. I don't know what it is too, bad CGI perhaps? The scenarios shouldn't look and feel like it was shot in a movie set. Some really poor editing here where some cuts seem like they were pasted on to where the action is supposedly taking place, but from which direction? Nobody knows. Not even the director I reckon.As for the story and pacing, it just goes all over the place. Also who even gives a F about the acting at this point.

An action thriller. Cinematography, color grading, fight choreography, and Chris, Ryan and Ana were great. The story is not unique but you're a fan of action movies like Mission Impossibles, Face/off, WAR (a Bollywood action movie I saw during quarantine) and stuff like that then the movie is for you. I really enjoyed watching it and going to watch it again and this time with family. As much as I hated the 6Underground which I hated a lot I liked this one. I would like to see more of Ryan Gosling's six. He is a charming and cool hero and also like to see what made Lloyd Hansen the sociopath path he was. I hope they make that sequel and prequel they said they're working on.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The chases are over the top. Even the music is worth noting for its uniqueness and its quirk factor.As Sierra Six (Ryan Gosling) globe trots to complete missions or take out threats, he is accompanied by various associates. His adversaries are numerous and ruthless. We have seen variations on this with Bourne, Wick and Reacher. Gosling can compete with any of them in terms of screen presence and believability.As others have pointed out, Ana de Armas deserves kudos for her performance. One can only hope that she will return for any sequels.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The gray man Is a like watching a fancy computer game with cartoonish action sequences and generic cut sequences in-between the dross.

The action is stupider than a fast and furious movie but it takes itself deadly serious. There's plenty of patented Marvel Humor and not a single joke lands. The rest of the dialogue is pure exposition. Ana de Armas has terrible lines but she tanks them like a champ. The other actors are bland, not because they're bad at acting but because the direction is so poor. Chris Evans is in his element a maniacal murderer, though he is rarely allowed to act truly unhinged. All of the characters are paper-thin archetypes at best, NPCs at worst.Netflix really needs to stop with these formulaic attempts at a hit action film.

Although the plot is extremely thin, the film is expertly shot and directed by the Russo brothers (Avengers: Infinity Wars and Endgame), with fun banter between Gosling, Evans and Ana De Armas, the additional gravitas of Billy Bob Thornton, and an excellent score. There's also a pretty expensive-looking 10-minute action sequence mid-way through taking place in Prague that's almost worth the price of admission in itself.

The Russo brothers direct and once again show their skills in this fast-paced action hit.Well, this would be nice, because the film is by no means a masterpiece. The actors are basically good, but you don't notice anything about it. The budget was probably damn high, but you don't notice it for a second either. Well and the Russo brothers do not prove their skills in any way. And last but not least, of course, there is also action, but Netflix action. So you can already lower your expectations.Honestly, I didn't expect anything else from this movie, because Netfix has proven several times lately that their movies are just for the garbage can. Well and the Russo brothers are not good directors in my opinion either. I like their Captain America movies and Avengers movies, but not because of their directing skills. The two brothers are definitely good at bringing together many characters and then getting a lot of fan service out of it. But let's face it, I don't see a vision of one or two directors in the Avengers movies, but much more of a studio. That's why I just think that you can't really recognize and criticize the skills of the two brothers in these films. Well and with The Gray Man we can see what happens when the two can enforce their vision. Because Netflix doesn't really care what comes out of it in the end. The main thing is that they have new content. But at least you can see that the two probably don't really have much talent, because The Gray Man is generic, boring and almost annoying entertainment, although I wasn't really entertained. So only generic, boring and annoying.But enough of that, because the movie itself is exactly what I expected from it. The plot is already completely generic and I have seen something like this often enough. The movie simply offers nothing special or something that makes the movie unique. That's why the movie is completely generic entertainment and offers no added value.On the one hand, this is also due to the fact that the most important thing in this movie simply does not work. And what is the most important thing in an action movie? Of course, the action, and it is completely cut and shaky. In between, you notice that there were choreographies, because Ryan Gosling and the rest make the movements that look clearly rehearsed. But nevertheless, the action sequences are completely cut. So if you really want good action, this film has definitely been misadvised.But I was also bothered by the humor in the movie. Even if there weren't much funny scenes, there were a few funnier moments to loosen up the movie. But these scenes are completely disturbing and have just made me thrown out of the movie even more than I already did.Well, what another big problem is, that's the characters. On the one hand, the characters are as generic as the movie itself. So Ryan Gosling plays an uninteresting, typical action hero who has no depth. Well, and the rest of the characters are at least as generic and monotonous.So of course, the movie also has some nice moments and also a few action scenes that are okay. Of course, you can also see that there was a lot of budget. Although the movie was still far too expensive for what came out of it. So there are also a few positive things, but the movie just left me cold and that's why I was really bored and downright annoyed by the movie.The actors of the film are basically really good. So I really like all of the bigger actors of the film and everyone has already proven their skills in other projects. Ryan Gosling, for example in Drive, Blade Runner, La La Land, etc., but here he is by no means award-worthy or such in any way. Yes, he is convincing and not bad either, but not really good either.Chris Evans as the opponent wants to show a slightly different side of himself and you can tell. But he just doesn't fit into the role of the villain and his way becomes quite exhausting in the course of the movie.Ana de Armas is still there and she is neither really good nor bad either. She's just there and shows up a few times during the movie and that's it. By the way, this applies to the majority of the cast. Above all, this concerns Jessica Henwick, whom I really like as an actress, but she just doesn't do anything in the movie and is just so superfluous.Well, the movie has a lot of problems, but the most important thing is that the film just left me completely cold. Neither plot, characters, actors, action scenes, soundtrack, the effects or simply the entire film could captivate or inspire me. The movie was just so superfluous, so unnecessary, without meaning and purpose, so worthless, so empty,... just a typical Netflix movie.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Dhanush takes a giant leap backwards for Indian actors with his role and Gosling is looking to nail a role in the next superhero franchise. There is no logic. There is no nuance. There is no humor. There are no witty lines. There is no respite. Avoid at all costs. The characterization is non existent, to call the characters two dimensional would be to add an extra dimension. The action is confusingly shot and incoherent but who cares! Seriously, the ten minute clip I saw yesterday for how Tom Cruise did the latest MI stunts was superb. Watch that and save yourself a migraine.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Imagine James Bond, minus the cool elements, set in a Fast and Furious universe and the film actually takes itself seriously. Before starting this movie, I tried to have an open mind expecting to see something better than Red Notice but by end, the only thing that this one did better were the action scenes. For a 2 hour pure action movie devoid of logic, there needs to be at least some form of narrative for the audience to be engaged in but sadly, it felt more like a 2 hour trailer.The story is about a CIA agent who found some secret information and is now being hunted by killers while trying to save a little girl he was once babysitting. I know a decent script and realism aren't supposed to be factors in Fast and Furious, sorry The Gray Man, but with all honesty, I have played video games where I wasn't able to replicate the action feats of this movie. I could understand if it presented itself as a joke which would have been acceptable, but the Russos make it seem like they filmed a Bourne movie. I loved Ana De Armas in James Bond, but to have her run around like Rambo with 4 rpgs, a grenade launcher and a couple of rifles on her back while shooting at helicopters and being fired at is beyond Call of Duty level.Now comes the best part... Chris Evans. If this man has put as much effort into creating a believable performance as much as he did into changing his outfits, this could have improved the film. Instead, he felt like he was auditioning for a Joel Schumacher Batman movie due to the amount of bad cringe. The visuals looked great and some action pieces were cool but that doesn't compensate the lack of a script and idiotic dialogue. If the film cut 30 minutes, the action alone would have carried it; but in it's present state, I wouldn't recommend wasting 2 hours of your life.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.","11 out of 29 found this helpful.

Fails to really impress at all. Whether it was the ridiculously over the top action sequences or the poor cgi in those crazy moments, it makes you scratch your head at times where that money all went. My guess? The cast and explosives. You would swear this was actually a Michael Bay movie, every chance the film gets there's an explosion.The plot in this film is the same way you played with action figures when you were 10, ""And then, and then, and then this happens, then this person...""It drags and carries a very weak story that is edited incredibly choppy with random flashbacks to try and make sense for the reasoning behind the whole film. When you think it ended, there's more.When it came to the hand to hand combat that's where the movie felt fun and exciting, this is a Russo Bro's special. So there are some highs in this movie and it can be something you just turn your brain off and maybe enjoy a little bit if you really like Spy thrillers....Unfortunately to me this another major swing and miss from Netflix and something that could have been really great.I do think this is a below average film... average at best in the Spy Thriller Genre.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

But that's as far as we go.Story-wise, this film flops on a weak and somewhat cliché premise borrowed from THE SUICIDE SQUAD, combined with a total-nonsense macguffin our hero discovers on the outset. The object in question will cause enough damage to our villain that said villain wants it recovered at all costs.But the macguffin has been held by another character who would have benefited greatly by giving it straight to the authorities. He instead keeps said item until our hero relieves him of it, which puts our hero in grave danger. Convenient, no?As far as casting goes, several of the characters and actors don't particularly match well. Dialog sometimes ends up clunky, unnatural, and even contrived. The spy-chatter sprinkled about fell into that category.

If Netflix, or the Russo brothers think that with a few famous faces alone and huge marketing gimmicks ( which includes using Dhanush to get Indian viewership numbers) they can make money , then I strongly recommend you don't watch this film.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Felt a bit too silly and too easy. But scratch that, because after this point things really change.So this is a fast paced action movie with partial (but not strong) spy element. There is lots of locations and they all look great. Action scenes are well executed and feel very engaging, somewhat but not extremely over the top. What I liked most is the coherence of the script. There is always purpose and continuity as our hero moves along and this is so important to keep the interest peaked. I can't say I encountered any boring parts.Evans is amazing. I like his character, one of the best real villains in the last years by far. Also at no point I saw him as captain America and this is not easy right? He did his part properly. And he was very ruthless overall and especially intimidating with the torture scenes. He did those perfect and if a few people can't stomach them it's their problem, the guy needs to prove he means business.Anna de Armas just proves once again she was used very little in no time to die and that was a shame but that movie was an untidy mess anyway. She sells the badass part really well and she can do more of this, maybe a series? I would certainly watch a (well-scripted) spy series of hers.And Mr Gosling, more ripped than ever, I honestly liked his part and I would love to see this gray man getting a sequel, maybe with a little more spy element though. All in all, he was a great match for the role, enjoyed his performance - he owned the role.So netflix what are you waiting for? Get a better music score and make something of this opportunity. These don't come along too often lately.Finally, anyone knows what happened to sierra 5?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ryan Gosling & Chris Evans show off their mega-watt star power albeit totally different ways, a 180 apart from one another. And plz...anyone w/a functional brain should know they are having fun with these roles. They are very aware this is pure entertainment. The story? Minimal to mon-existent and who cares?I'm so beyond burned out on both DC (all over the place) & Marvel doing the same world ending, universe/multiverse chaos, too much craptastic CGI films over & over....only the culture changes. While it's great to have representation the movies are the same brightly colored film over & over. The Eternals dared to be different & I told myself ""you'll hate it"" boy was I wrong. The ""villains"" were generic cgi per usual but the diversity & the cinematography were original and a visual feast, w/Angelina being the weakest character. It wasn't Endgame but I also never checked my watch. The new Thor? Muscle Jane? Ugh. Give me Beta Ray Bill & Enchantress already! It's 4 films in already, more than any other MCEU stand alone character & still no Enchantress. You're lucky the public took to Cate as favorite comic villain Hela brought to life albeit a watered down version of her that Cate was able to elevate.Back to Gray Man, here our nemesis assassins battle royale spans around the globe, Ryan does all the grunt work while Evans gets underlings to do his dirty work & the cinematography is beautiful and thankfully no Matrix-style fighting, we're pleasantly back to very well choreographed fight scenes.When fun & movie star power come together for mindless but heckuva entertaining 2 hours. Save your heavy critique for Thor, Guardians Of the Galaxy, Aquaman 2 or Fast And Furious 27.The Gray Man is if Tom Cruise and MI19 didn't take itself so seriously like it had a ""you know what"" shoved ""you know where""","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It packs lots of action, it's violent, it reminds you of plenty of other films, so I wouldn't call it original, like when I saw the girl trapped in the room, that room reminded me of Commando etc. They made stuff like that on purpose I think, it pays hommage in a way. I found the Bangkok set visually stunning, a real treat for the eyes, mesmerizing. The scene on the plane was fun.Gosling has this tongue in cheek thing going on, and the connection with Thornton and the girl works for me, Gosling's sidekick was great, love to see a woman taking down lots of stuff. That woman in Prague, that was her in Olympus has fallen, it works. Hand to hand combat was good. All in all entertaining, visually stunning, action packed not pretentious.

I'll break this down into positives and negatives:Positives:1 - The movie isn't preachy or tilting so far left that it repeatedly falls over.2 - It appears to be trying to entertain.Negatives:1 - The story/plot has been done... a lot. If you can't make something original, at least make it good.2 - The visuals are chock full of CGI, everywhere, all of the time. Most of it is very obvious and very bad. Much of it is completely unnecessary and representative of modern lazy movie making. If you can something practically, please do, your audience can tell the difference.3 - The actors are cast for fame over talent. They're adequate but don't ever elevate the material.4 - Dialogue is sometimes cute, but largely expository and cliched.5 - Action scenes are poorly shot and edited without a clear visual flow. Much of what goes on is muddled and poorly choreographed. When CGI is involved (all the time), scenes are hidden behind smoke/mist/fog... a lot.6 - It cost 200 million, but that's likely due to the inflated salaries of the Russo brothers and their stars. Little of that amount shows up on screen.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

A spy action thriller that lives upto the genre! Raw and gritty! The action set prices are awesome and crazy. Leave it to the Russo Bros to thrill us all the way.It was surprising and pleasing to see Ryan Gosling in a new avatar. Loved him in The Notebook, Drive, Crazy Stupid Love, La La Land, The First Man & more. Already a terrific actor, he did justice as the title character here. As someone who is set up, double crossed and chased all over the world, his calm demeanor and dry humour was entertaining. A reference to the Ken Doll was funny (Ryan is Ken in the upcoming Barbie movie).Chris Evans as Lloyd Hansen was having a ball with his character. As an ex-CIA mercenary gone rogue and tasked to catch Six (Ryan), he was the most feared villain ever. And so much fun to watch. Superb!Ana D Armas, stunning Cuban/Spanish actress who exploded on Hollywood screens in Keanu Reeves movie ""Knock Knock"" and got our attention with her awesome cameo in the Bond movie, NO TIME TO DIE, seemed to be having fun in a sort of an extension of her Bond character, though this is a different role altogether. She's a very beautiful & talented actress. As Agent Dani Miranda, she was very comfortable in action scenes as well.Which brings me to our own Dhanush as Avik San aka The Lone Wolf.This isn't his first international movie. In 2018, he did the the adventure comedy , ""The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir"", along with ""Erin Moriarty"" (now famous for the hit show ""The Boys"" on Amazon Prime). It was based on a French novel. Dhanush was praised by both Indian and International critics for his charming performance.Among the other cast, Billy Bob Thornton, Rege Jean Page, Jessica Henwick & Julia Butters did a great job.In ""The Gray Man"", though I wished he had more screen time, the Russo Brothers didn't disappoint us by giving him a blink and miss role. In all of his 15 mins screen time out of a two hour movie, he caught everyone's attention. As a brooding and deadly assassin Avik San/Lone Wolf, he was terrific. His action scenes with Ryan Gosling & Ana D Armas was thrilling. Very well choreographed fights. When Chris's character says ""My sexy Tamil Friend"", you know who is coming to knock your socks off! We have seen him fight 100s in Tamil movies. So how could he not handle two people? Just kidding! He's our Ilaya Superstar. Four times National Award winner (Two as an actor and two as producer) and many other awards/accolades. Multi talented. Someone who acts, fights, dances, sings, produces and directs! 👌🏻👏🏻Netflix has green-lit a sequel to ""The Gray Man"" and also a spin-off of the movie. Russo Bros had mentioned that maybe Dhanush could get his own spin-off movie. Hope that happens and also hope to see more of his character in the sequels.I enjoyed this movie a lot. The excessive and at times over the top action (Esp the one in Russia) might be too much for those who don't enjoy this genre. For others like me who devours anything good cinema has to offer, in terms of content & technical brilliance, this is right up my alley. One can say that this movie celebrates the action genre to the fullest. Russo Brothers do not disappoint. Awaiting their next one.Catch this one at cinemas and on Netflix.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Making movies is hard. Making good movies is even harder. No one tries to make a bad one (well, almost no one, I'm sure there are some Bialystocks out there).This one unfortunately didn't end as a good one, that's a shame considering the budget and talent involved.In short, this movie's writing is unoriginal, the action is poorly executed, and the talented cast is wasted.Everything about this movie screams direct to video B movie, and those cheap action movies are great for what they are, but when you have an A list cast, 200 million budget with writing for one of those cheap movies, it just feels off.As is often the case with badly written movies, the mcguffin makes no sense. It's evidence that implicates the bad people in the CIA in doing bad things, but to get their hands on it they're doing much worse things that make that evidence irrelevantThe worse part was the tram chase scene. That whole sequence made no sense. It made no sense for them to go on a rampage killing cops and the CGI/stunts looked too fake. It was a great summary of everything wrong with this movie.I like the idea of having the kidnapped girl with a trackable device on her, when that was revealed with a flashback, I though great, they'll let the bad guys ""win"" and get away and #6 will come at them out of nowhere.That kinda happened at the end, but mostly off screen. Such a wasted opportuinty of the only knida original idea in this movie.Ah well, at least Netflix learned their lessons with these big budget bombs and are planning to focus more on making actually good movies. We'll see if they're capable of that.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

And I DO like ridiculousness but can't stand ridiculously lame.Though I've only read the first book, it's clear it had potential. This adaptation doesn't live up to it in any shape or form. The way I see it, the problem isn't the premise's familiarity, but the execution!There's a subtle art to differentiating between 'highly skilled people doing extraordinary things with some luck' VS 'seemingly highly skilled, very lucky, yet dumb people doing illogical but extraordinarily cheap-looking things'. The former entertains, the latter insults the viewer.If anything, this movie is quite an argument for why they should bring back mid-range productions with tighter/coherent scripts, editing and with way less CGI (I know its cheaper than the practical stuff but rather save on the big paycheques, because as we can see these big shot 'A-listers' are still no guarantee of success).The funny thing is, Sam Hargrave, a protégé of the Russo Bros, did a somewhat better job with 'Extraction (2020)' starring Chris Hemsworth than the 'masters' themselves. At least action-wise, that one was somewhat more entertaining and consistent.Oh and I do still think Gosling would've been fine as Gentry in a proper movie though. Also, I read that Brad Pitt/James Gray were attached to the project like a decade ago. Maybe that would've been better than what we got.Anyway, it's NOT a recommend! It really reminds me more of a badly executed spoof. I rate it a 4/10; the only redeeming quality was the locations --I dig it when europe is considered somewhat 'exotic' for americans.PS: I'd definitely recommend reading Mark Greaney's book(s) instead!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Granted that almost all ""Spy movies"" have little or no relationship to reality, and James Bond has a long and lively fantasy life, still the level of violence, mayhem and murder in this is way over the top. For Ana to go from Bond Girl to this is a sad demotion, and the murderous Senior Villain should go back to light farce in Bridgerton where overacting and showing your butt is encouraged. Simply terrible. I am now informed that this review is too short, so let me count The Gray Man's transgressions:. Even Putin is a bit more subtle and discreet when he murders people, and when Kim Jung un murdered his half-brother live on TV, he still thought no one would notice. To suggest that the CIA would use Wagner Group thugs to blow up Prague, and then let the DDO off with a time-out is just plain silly. This movie is clearly aimed at sadistic teenage boys, and should the Network that produced the Crown and the Queen's Gambit be spending money on trash like this?

The accuracy of the shooting also seemed to vary between impossibly good to Storm Trooper bad, depending on who needed to die (or live).Predicable and lazy writing, with negligible character development, aside from possibly Gosling's character, who himself brings along his standard dead eyed and expressionless performance.Chris Evans was initially a bright spark in this completely forgettable waste of time, however his slightly comical attempts at playing a villain ultimately didn't work, and he is nowhere close to convincing me he is a hard man.Even Billy Bob Thornton failed to impress.A ridiculous number of filming locations, and I suspect the Russo Brothers are simply enjoying a European holiday on Netflix's dime....and don't get me started on the number of annoying shots utilising drones buzzing around the place.Avoid where possible.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ryan aka six was very believable as a cold and well trained defender of his life and the life of the few people he cared about. Chris aka Lloyd was reassuringly self centered and subtly too full of himself, Ana oh Ana aka Dani is like a poem in the making. Bob aka Fitzroy slips into any role like a samurai sword cutting through silk.Basically the acting fits the characters like a piston head fits a newly bored cylinder.

Too many people give 0/10 or 10/10 for films with no in between when usually nothing is that bad or good. But this film richly deserves to be completely panned.I don't blame the actors or the stunt people (who do top notch work here) but the writers and producers. This is film is cosmically stupid.There is so little resemblance to anything like reality in this movie that it might well have been a cartoon, and even that would be an insult to cartoons. No intelligence agency would do anything like in this movie. It's like they asked a 5-year old what they thought spies do and then filmed that.For example, the major action scene in the film where the agency chasing the hero stages an all out attack that kills dozens of police officers in an allied country. This would cause a diplomatic break between the USA and the ally and would be worldwide news. But it is shrugged off as just a mess that the agency will have to sweep under the rug.Anyways, you might as well watch random stunt scenes from random movies and guess what? You'd still end up with something more entertaining that made more sense than this abomination.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Basically anything other than this. I'm not sure I've seen such bad writing and acting in years. Total senseless garbage. Well done Russo.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Personally I really enjoyed my escape and break from the intellectual and deeply freshly plotted (yeah right where is that) that everyone seems to compare everything to. I loved him in this role and would love to see more of this character maybe more deeply written for all the so called intellectuals. The reason the plot lines on action are ie stale is because there are only so many reasons they could create for someone to turn dark, go in to the gray or to be good. Sorry I just saw these reviews saw how 90 % of non review writing rater'a loved it but these quasi critics all thought it mediocre and blah blah blah it's like the people who complain that indie novelist don't have degrees in English or write with English as their second language so they review truly enjoyable books lowly because they can't read between the lines between a few typos.

I think you will be disappointed in this film. Ryan Gosling is way too smooth, too pretty. He looks like he went to good private schools, never missed a meal in his life and got lots of toys at Christmas time. This is not like the character in Mark Greaney's books. Court Gentry is a rural Floridian who drove a Bronco and outwitted SWAT teams in paintball exercises as a teenager. He was a rough-hewn, gritty, simple boy. Clever as hell, though.And, aside from the PC insertion of a female cohort, the treatment is way too cute. Cheeky! The darkness of the books is turned in to a colorful world filled with music and cute one-liners.AND - they turned Claire (whose character in the book is wonderful: clever, smart, tough and resourceful) into a weak, helpless child.Hopefully, in the future, someone will produce a multi-episode series based on the Gray Man novels.

Chris Evans is a good actor, but in this film, he eats up the scenery with his characterisation. Have to add that Gosling is a little like the part he played in Blade Runner 2049.

Just lost interest half way through. Also, Regé-Jean Page's Bridgerton hype completely died down for me. Not a good actor for the role. 2 stars for Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans each I guess.Now I heard this is going to have a sequel? It doesn't deserve it.

Yes, it has all the things you'd expect; action, shoot-outs, a bad guy who is very nasty but despite all of that, it managed to be very lackluster. The movie doesn't all-out suck but it falls so very far short of where I think a movie with that cast, crew and budget should be that it sucks.This is topped off by something that is increasingly not just poor, but infuriating and, frankly starts to become insulting. In the same way Hollywood, even in 2022, portrays anything to do with computers as an army of monitors and complete gibberish flying over all the screens, Hollywood continues to think all European cities are a 20 minute drive away from all the other European cities. I am sorry to inform Hollywood of this, but Europe is geographically quite similarly sized as the USA and has about 50% more population. You don't drive much of anywhere in 20 minutes. Berlin to Vienna? 8 hours without traffic; it's the same as Boston to Washington DC.How hard is it really to portray every-day things more realistically?","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Has a good to very good plot with characters we care about. I want six to win. I want him to save the girl. Seems the girl deserves it.The bad guy comes across as a pompous azz (Denny) and it is not entirely clear he is competent but the plot allows for that. Seems he is one of those guys that got into power and nobody around him know how but also know it would be unwise to cross him.This installments actual bad guy, though I like Chris Evans, was effective enough, which is to say mediocre.Wife really liked the girl power character and she was well fleshed out and well acted. I liked her too and rooted for her which is a nice change from the eye rolling characters we usually get for heroines.Without doubt this is set to have another in a series and it works as a series. It is open ended and a lot of directions they could take.Interesting plot with a lot of action and sympathetic characters. I enjoyed the ride which is all I want from an action movie. Obviously comparable to 007 and a bit of MI and obviously, given these are American characters I see some Bourne in it, but not too bad. I see the Bourne mostly in the fight scenes.The only complaint I had was the sound seemed off at the beginning. Hard to understand at times what people were saying. Improved around the middle and stayed improved through the end.Enjoyable and I would want to see another adventure but I would want to see more value for my Netflix bucks. In 2022 I think of Netflix as a professional quasi crowd-source and they could do really well at that.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But then it got over-the-top, with massacres, tons of operatives being involved in the fights, bazookas blowing up vehicles, etc.. The only reason Ryan Gosling survived was plot armor. It ended up being rather ridiculous. And since the motivation for pursuing him was keeping certain underhanded goings-on under the radar, having everything made incredibly public ruined the logic of the characters' motivations, in my opinion. There were a lot of more logical ways characters could have handled situations; the movie prioritized what would make for the best action sequences over what actually made sense. The movie would have been better if they'd prioritized telling a good story over dramatic visuals.Also, there's no way this should have a PG-13 rating. Hundreds of people die, there are graphic injuries and graphic torture scenes, and children in serious peril.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The background scenario is not that great and some situations are just there to create an explosive action scene far from a possible reality or logic. It is not a bad movie just a serie of action scenes well executed except for some scenes where we can clearly see the video acceleration from scenes executed slowly by Ryan Gosling. In short the action scenes have more similarity with a John Wick movie but different enough. Because of the apparent acceleration the end result is not as good as a John Wick movie.

I really enjoyed it. Ryan, Chris, Ana, and Dhanush were all incredible and strong characters. Just remember that in every action movie, the hero triumphs in the end by easily defeating the villain, but in this case, the villain is just as strong as the hero. And Captain America was the main character. His movement, physique, appearance, and, most importantly, sense of humour.Overall, it is worthwhile to watch this film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I had seen the mixed reception but I didn't let that deter me. Having finished it I can attest that the mixed reviews have been more than fair. I like to lead with positives which would be Chris Evans delivering an entertaining performance and clearly reveling in his chance to be despicable. The other performances ranged from uninspired to bad. Gosling was really bland, Ana de Armas wasn't given much to work with, and Billy Bob Thornton was bad in his role. The writing didn't help matters. The plotting was straightforward which isn't always a bad thing but it just made watching the movie matter of fact. The dialogue wasn't very good either. Where it tried to be snappy and quick it didn't work, where it tried to introduce humor it didn't work, and where it tried to inspire emotion it fell flat. Finally, the direction and cinematography were not very good either. I felt like the film was trying to be stylish in how it used camera moves, transitions and different camera angles but it came off as empty because the film itself lacked depth. Lastly, the special effects looked great and the fight scenes were fine albeit overall unremarkable or memorable. Evans excelled in his role but there was little else to make The Gray Man stand out.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

What the #$%^ are people complaining about here?! This was an excellent, action-packed film from start to finish, this is Russo Brothers do Michael Bay. This film asks the question, how many kill teams does it take to take down one skilled assassin? Some of the fight scenes were actually watchable, since most these days are throw aways. And so much destructive capacity on display - in the air, on the ground, guess the budget didn't allow for ships/subs. And the answer to the kill teams question: more than the ten they threw at him. My only signif complaint is the final escape scene wraps up too quickly, not the satisfying ending it should've been.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

We're talking action, action, action and some over-the-top performances, such as from Chris Evans, that makes the hero (Ryan Gosling) look that much better.Ana de Armas from ""No Time To Die"" is a welcomed, kick-butt addition to this mostly male movie and her charm and believable skills as an assassin makes her perfect for her role. I hope to see her back in the sequel.What the haters don't seem to understand is that the movie-going public doesn't want Shakespeare for their summer-time fun, they want edge-of-your-seat thrills and adventures along the lines of Indiana Jones, which the critics loved back in the 80s. That's what we have in The Gray Man. I don't know how the novel went and frankly, I don't care. This movie had just enough storyline to justify all of the action sequences and that's enough for me.Thank you Netflix for writing the big check for this blockbuster. I'd say it was money well invested and I look forward to many more sequels.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This sounded like something I should've loved on paper, great cast, I love a spy story, but the execution was just terrible. The movie could've skipped an action scene or two to provide us more of a chance to get to know the characters. Amazing actors were cast, but got very little good material to work with. There were some really atrocious CGI shots that took me out of the scenes. It felt like the story was just never able to fully come together, there wasn't a solid plan and they decided to keep shooting scenes that looked cool while forgoing a cohesive vision for the story.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Gosling as an action star isn't tremendously new but in this fashion it seems fresh and he pulls it off albeit while showing minimal emotion. Evans as the bad guy is wonderful, almost too much fun, his performance highly entertaining despite the despicable nature of the character. Overall well written unless you force yourself to sit through the painfully cliché moments of cheesy character development and predictable exposition. Outside of this you have some of the best and most frequent action of the genre that we've seen in years, especially from a Netflix Original. That said these scenes are often plagued by unnecessarily jerky and over-stylized camerawork; the first two action sequences seemed intent on making it as difficult to see what was going on as possible. A major misstep, along with the slightly disappointing ending, but overall well worth the experience.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I coudn't finish this movie in one sitting, 'cause I would either get bored or distracted by an another (a bit too rediculous) action sequance. Every fight scene must include fire, explosions, fireworks or a sunrise, and overall cinematography and score feel like Thanos is about to pop around the corner every minute. As much as I loved the Russo's superhero movies, this is not it. It is not a superhero movie but it feels like it desperately wants to be.It is overall very bland and very badly written. The lines feel tacky most of the time, even coming from great actors. I love Ana de Armas and I pretty much adore Gosling, but the two have zero chemistry together and everything they say to each other comes out forced. Maybe that is because her character has zero character traits, while his has one and a half. Maybe these interactions were meant to be funny, however they never got to that.On top of all of that, as an architect and set design enthusiast from Croatia, I got to say Denis Grasser, what the hell were you thinking? Puting a very baroque, VERY french castle in island of Mljet, in the middle of the mediteranian?? Why tho? I get that filming in an actual cultural heritage, that Croatia has plenty of, might be too expensive (lol), but this is not where a baroque castle could ever sit on. Or float.

Everything between the explosions and gunfight is painfully dull and badly written. Major elements that drive the plot (aka - the mystery) are shown in the first 10% of the movie - then the story moves from place to place with just a hint of actual sense. The main hero is dragged from location to location (sometimes literally) without much of his influence and many things just... happen (like some characters almost magically and instantly crossing half of Europe in what seems like a blink of an eye).Every character interaction is almost a sketch, motivations are barely hinted and ... it's really hard to root for a hero as he's as blank as the void in Ryan Gosling's eyes. Maybe not as idiotic as the Red Note ... but still a miss from Netflix.If anyone has any fun coming from this movie - it must be Chris Evans - as he's looking like having the time of his life playing the villain... not that his character is manacing or much interesting... he just seems to have fun with playing someone different than the righteous wet sponge that the Captain America was.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The writing made this movie feel like it was written by an ai. If someone told me a twitter bit wrote this movie I wouldn't be surprised.We no time to get invested in any characters because there's a new one every scene.The first act felt like the third act of a different movie. The opening fight scene was well choreographed, but it didn't take music into account at all, so it also fell flat.Really disappointed by the Russos latest.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

A series, yes (see ""Reacher""), but a movie is tough. I'd say the Bourne movies did well, but this movie failed to capture on screen what Mark Greaney did on paper. The makers of this film changed so many things that I felt were a necessary part of what made Court Gentry who he was. They changed characters, added characters, totally erased some characters, and redid the storyline to follow a bizzaro version of the Gray Man narrative. I was not happy with some of the casting (Billy Bob Thornton being the most miscast member). Although a few of the action scenes were ok, all-in-all I have to give this a thumbs down. Maybe someone can come up with a well cast series down the road.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie SUCKS! Read the book.I get that a movie needs to condense things but the characterization of the Gray Man is just dense. The created-for-Hollywood final fight is so patently predictable it hurts, while also undermining any idea of who the Grey Man is and how he would act.If you haven't read the book and you want to watch a very average Hollywood 'B' movie, feel free to watch. But if you read the book and then watch the movie you'll be left asking yourself 'Why?!?'Imagine expecting James Bond and the character acts like Agent 86 in Get Smart. That's not a direct comparison but it is an example of the disappointment you will feel.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Weak, terrible writing and terrible directing. I get really insulted when a dozen bad guys and professional mercenaries all armed with automatic weapons shoot collectively over 500 rounds at our hero...and miss. Then he of course picks them off one by one with a single shot.This is one of those kinds of movies. Just a weak plot about crooked govt officials, double-crosses, hitmen, spies, and a lot of violence. If that floats your boat, fine, but this movie is bad from a filmmaking standpoint. But people who love a lot of stunts, explosions, and shooting, will love this. Not me.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

From the get go you can tell you are going to be in for another mediocre flick (hopefully) from Netflix that is filmed like a television show. The script feels like it was written by an amateur featuring a story & dialogue that leaves no impact and provides little character development. Not even cool Ryan Gosling, charismatic Chris Evans, the OG Billy Bob and the charming Ana de Armas can save this mess. What drew a lot of us in are these actors because we know how damn good they can be. It feels like arguably their worst work to date. A lot of the blame has to be put on Netflix and the putrid script.For a cast with such strong resumes its hard to buy them as their characters. Like a lot of people I'm a fan of Goslings work from early in his career (Blue Valentine, Drive, Half Nelson etc) but he is not very believable here as Six. The action scenes with him are chaotic, hectic and feel choreographed too much. His movements are far from fluid or smooth. Ryan doesn't look invested in this one like some of his other work. Chris Evans is another very strong actor but he has very little to work with here as well. Character of Lloyd is often too comical to take serious and you know he won't pull the trigger when he has the chance. If you give Evans the right lines with a strong character he can deliver well that is not in the cards here. He almost is so perfect at the good guy role he's hard to buy as the villain, wonder how this movie would have played out if Evans and Gosling switched roles? Just an idea but anything sounds like an improvement to me right now. We do see some fire from Billy Bob Thornton who can still deliver with the best of them but its nothing spectacular. Wish we would have learned more about Ana de Armas in this movie but we had to rush to some other random part of the globe every 7 minutes.Most of the performances are all just okay, fine - maybe that should be Netflix's motto. All border on okay, fine except Carmichael (Rege Jean Page) and Suzanne (Jessica Henwick) who come off as miscast and made me lost interest every time they popped up. The performances from those two were really really bad, not going to sugarcoat it.Highlight of the cast was Julia Butters who steals the show again from an A lister. Been wanting to see more from her since the killer performance in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. Wish the rest of the cast brought this kind of effort.The action is so ridiculously over the top it will take you right out of the movie. It also doesn't help that the CGI looks like something out of an old last generation video game. Theirs a sequence early on with Gosling on a plane that is so silly it made me question why in the hell am I still watching this? The low stake, video game looking lame by the numbers no threat action makes you appreciate movies with high quality real looking action like Top Gun : Maverick. Again for the budget why is the production value so low? A lot of us seem to believe the Russo brothers can do better than this - can they? This 5 hour energy fueled quick cut action style thats dimly lit just left me feeling pissed off. Was anyone on their A game here? It has become obvious actors know Netflix is an easy pay day requiring minimal work that usually leads to mediocre at best final projects.Its hard to notice this 200 million budget that Netflix is flexing about - did it all go to Evans, Gosling, Billy and Ana?Netflix can do better. They need to take a hard long look at how they make movies and reevaluate some things! These soulless, mediocre films with no energy are embarrassing when you think about the budgets. The studio executives, producers at Netflix need to step it up. If you put this film in the hands of a capable studio & tweaked the script it would undoubtedly be a better time.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

OK, the story not that original,but frankly, I'm not in there for the Shakespearean depths, I'm in for good, likeable (or hateable) characters and good action. We got these, in spades. Not a documentary, not by any means, but again, who cares, it is an action movie: of course some characters have 3-4 sets of skeletons and/or 9 lives. That's fine, because the movie works. It entertains, it made me care (and root for someone - nothing's worse when you couldn't care less if the main characters get eaten by aliens or not), and it made me forget about my current affairs for that 2 hours. I appreciate that, and that's what I expect of a film like this - thank you! Gosling, Evans and Armas all do a stellar job too, and I can only hope that the audience response would be something Netflix likes/expects/hopes, and we will see more like this in the future.

Starts off in China for no real reason other than to placate to the Chinese government. Then it moves on to over done gimmicks like jumping out of a plane with no parachute, and happy up bear music over violence and fight scene. The lines were pretty awful and them trying to quip back and forth got tired really quick. None of it landed. It was about as cliche as a rogue spy movie can expect to be.And all of that could have easily have been forgiven if it wasn't for the just terrible acting. Billy Bob Thornton and the girl who plays his niece did a good job, and Ryan Gosling was okay. However Ane de Amas who I'm a fan of was pretty bad and Chris Evan really hasn't done anything of merit since Captain America.

She was fearless, strong, skilled, fast, at sometimes funny. Of course, her performance was aided by great directing, editing, and a script that empowered women. Nonetheless, she was outstanding.As for the lead, Ryan Gosling, well done! I could never before imagine Mr. LaLa Land being a human-hero; throwing hands, grenades, and whatever else he can to win a fight. Yet, there he was in this film just that, and as believable to me as anyone. Add in the script that had the brilliant dialogue about the gods likely punishing someone by pushing a rock up a hill and there's definite meaning, purpose, and layers to Gosling's character.Then there's the talented Mrs. Woodard who just handles her few scenes with grace, power, and humility.For these reasons, along with the sequence of nonstop action that crumbled building falling around speeding cars that dodged bullets, this film gets a nine from me and a side-eye to anyone who views it less than an eight.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Six gets help from Dani (Ana De Armas) who will help to stop Lloyd and escape from his organization.The films action sequences are big. Action packed and loud. It has lots of shoot em up action and intense fight sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat. For a big budget film, the action does show it. The film is set in several different locations. The action set pieces are exciting. The Prague car chase with Six on top of a tram is insane with Lloyd sending countless paramilitary after him.Ryan Gosling did great as an unstoppable rogue agent. This may be the franchise for him. Chris Evans playing the villain was also good as the villain with the mustache that gave him that cheesy look. Ana De Armas is awesome and was given little more to do in the action spotlight.The Russo Brothers direction does set up for a new action franchise. They handled the action and thrills well. The film moved at a kinetic pace that never once slows down. The film is like a mixture of James Bond, Bourne movies, and a bit of John Wick all combined. I would love to see more sequels.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Actually surprised there was not one Chinese action star ha haI have not read the original novels yet the Russo brothers and writers script is so shallow and lacking in originality that it feels like an old 80s action film without any heart or soul.Netflix proves once again that they have no idea how to make an original John Wick, Jason Bourne or James Bond film and this is just a trite copycat with more CGI action then it warrants - to the point that you just laugh at it as if the Russo brothers developed amnesia and thought they were still on the set of avengers.In one scene they literally blow up the whole city while the main character is handcuffed to a bench and it just comes across so silly you just have to laugh at it.Hopefully they'll make another one that's more true to some type of storytelling instead of these cliché lines.Kudos to the actors for getting huge salaries and having to deal with regurgitating these stupid lines.5 stars for the actors.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

He doesn't understand that
'Only classical can exceed classical'Marvel's success is not only by his creativity but also by the teams!! People like the favor!!Recently Marvel is not marvel, to have some change. They use new directors with weird style, they try to create female movies, dark characters Terrible styles to become 'new', but they are not 'new' factors in this world.We need 'hero' with bright site to believe that the world is still with hope. That's why in the past ten years, we love Marvel. That's why ' top gun ' is so popular recently.I suggest Marvel in order to gain profit. You can terminate all dark style, Asian style movie in your pipeline. And concentrate your budget to real Marvel classical style movie, do not use new directors, use classical directors, classical roles, because' only Marvel classical can exceed Marvel classical'","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I mean, you have Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, Billy Bob Thornton, Alfre Woodard, Ana DeArmas, and Rege Jean Page in leading roles AAAAND you got $100 million dollars to make it. Did I mention the Russo Brothers agreed to direct it AND it's based on a popular book franchise? How did it all go so wrong?Look, I'm not going to say it's not generally entertaining. If you're into big fight scenes, huge armed confrontations (guns and missiles blazing) and stuff blowing up, this has all of that, literally every 5-10 minutes. I'd also say if you're into quippy one-liners and ""I'll be back"" and ""They were all bad"" type action movie lines, they're there too (sometimes several times in a single minute) but I can't say that's a plus as that's where things start to go bad.This is almost a parody of an American action film and in some cases Rege Jean Page and the young woman who plays his sidekick at the CIA are the worst offenders, delivering their lines like they are in a FunnyOrDie skit 100% of the time...with arched eyebrows, whispered growls, slamming tables and laughable ""YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!"" intensity a good half the time. Evans is clearly playing a character, so the campiness works for his character, and miraculously, Gosling and Thornton take the same script and some how ground it in invisible/unspoken backstory and foundations to make it feel believable (the actual backstories are so underdeveloped you don't care when they are called back to).By the end, when they give a completely undeveloped and unlikeable character a (if not 'the') completely unearned ""big victory"" in the film instead of the film's multiple primary protagonist leads, I was done.It's just not good, sadly, and I hate saying that.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

An assassin for off the book missions and he is very good at it.Six is given a microchip after he kills another agent like him. The chip has incriminating information on the project that Six belongs to.Now maniacal black ops mercenary Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans) has been sent to eliminate Six and find the microchip.Unfortunately Lloyd is like a bull in a china store. Causing even more chaos.Directed by the Russo Brothers. This is an expensive Netflix production but it is so derivative.The use of an old 1960s song in the opening reminded me of Guardians of the Galaxy.There are a lot of action scenes, unfortunately much of it is in the dark. The story is too absurd.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Some people just try to be so clever, its sad.Its not exactly original, but then I haven't seen anything even remotely original in years, at least its not a remake or a sequel or a prequel. So that already makes it more original then anything else going. I mean come on! We have Bezos trying to make Tolkien roll over in his grave with a warrior Galadriel, the purest of the elves.

They mixed their marketing with a watch company which made it incredibly confusing for me.Anyway to the film itself. The Gray Man is basically just another action movie with no real pulse to it. It's fun. It exciting. Lots of good scenes. Just lacked a story and a heartbeat in a way. I like Ryan Gosling but he felt flat in his role as Six. Chris Evans steals the movie as the main villain and I think the producers should have forced him to take the role of Six and let Gosling be the villain because that would have made more sense after Evans' performance. Other than that, The Gray Man is a fun, well, paced, action film filled with cool shoot outs, car chases, explosions. So, definitely something you can check out on a boring day. I've watched the film several times which for me always means I liked it a lot. The only thing it did lack was a good story, the acting was flat from everyone except Evans.Overall, The Gray Man was a cool action flick but lacked some heart. Still worth checking.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Chris Evans excels as a sociopathic killer and Ryan Gosling was amazing as the 'good killer'. Ryan reminded me of his role in Blade Runner 2047 with his dead-pan unemotional and controlled temperament. No woke rubbish and finally a teenage girl role that is like a teenager should be in a violent movie. It was great that the movie was not all about her - even though she centres everything. Excellent violent action movie. Maybe US movie makers are finally realising that Top Gun is what movie watchers want to see - not social messages and woke rubbish.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

What's the big advantage this one has? They focused a lot less on plot revelations and a lot more on showing us the action in a lot of places in the world, mostly still recorded in the Czech Republic, where the production designers did an amazing job making it look characteristic like a lot of places from Bankok to Vienna. We get the big budget Michael Bay style explosions, we get Ambulance's (2022) FPV drone shots throughout the movie. We get some Gosling x Evans jokes that were honestly quite witty. Cast played their roles quite well. No hard cringe moments in this one. And the ending is just wholesome.

Unfortunately the average person in the general public is lucky to have 2 IQ points to rub together. So the movies Hollywood comes up with these days are more of the same inane, unintelligent garbage, stuffed down our throat's with big-budget marketing campaigns. It's all about the bottom line. No creativity anymore. No real passion!How about making a movie where people actually don't just shoot each other. It's either movies about killers or about $#@% superheroes!

This is a funny movie at times from a non comedy, but also has a lot of heart, too. You can tell Chris Evans enjoyed every second of playing this character... it's worth watching just for his every scene. He often says and does things no villain in these types of movies would ever say, which catches you off guard. You'd have to watch it to understand.

""200 million bucks and the directors of my favorite Marvel films - what can go wrong?""Well, I don't know what exquisite catering and hotels they spent that 200 mil on, but I can tell you what they didn't spend it on:1. The script. Now I know Shakespeare is long dead and this is a basic action flick, but I SWEAR 80% of the dialogue is lifted from other basic action flicks verbatim. Add to that the hilarious PG-13 language and absurdly miscast actors, and every line comes across as a parody. ""Remove yourself from my personal space""? I agree, movie.2. The pacing. As I felt like the third act was coming to an end, I was quite surprised to see that I wasn't even halfway through this bizarrely rapid-fire-yet-boring explosion fest. The film barrels along from seizure-inducing scene to seizure-inducing scene with no sense of rhythm or flow. Imagine the concert scene from John Wick 2, stretched out for 2 hours.3. The acting. Ryan Gosling isn't a bad actor. But he sure is bad in this. Oooh, you can't feel pain? Cool. But does that prevent you from moving your face? Rege-Jean Page is a joke, attempting gravitas and failing hilariously. And the myriad side characters are a jumbled, interchangeable mess.4. The cinematography. Swoop! Shwing! Voom! The camera goes all over the place completely randomly, trying to make up for the fact that there really isn't much happening.5. The music. I can get better free stock music than this.All in all, I expected a stupid yet fun, expensive-looking, globe-trotting adventure. But all I got, is stupid.

But at the same time I get it. The movie seems to be trying to walk a tightrope between the seriousness of Bourne but the extravagance of Wick, but by the end it's basically all Wick style action. So I get why people would be turned off by the absurdity of some of the action sequences.That being said, guess what, I watch movies for entertainment and it had that in spades. If you're going into this expecting Bourne, you'll be disappointed. So that is me message and warning: expect Taken and John Wick, sit back and enjoy it. Is it relatively cliche? ...I guess so? It's a freaking action movie and it delivers. Just for comparison, I enjoyed Red Notice, but this is way better imo.Ana DeArmas was amazing and I could easily see this pushing her into her own lead action role. The bad guys were genuinely bad, and they really were pissing me off, I can't remember the last movie that did that.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Everybody is so super cool and the most important thing is to show that you are more cool than the next person. Six is this superhuman, one of a kind, absolutely the best assassin, yet there is a strong female character who is at least as good as him, and probably a bit better, because that is the way it has to be these days. For some reason, there is also one of the most annoying teen characters in the history of cinema. And we are supposed to root for them. There is no reason to feel connected to any of the protagonists, nor to wish for them to come out on top.Yet, of course, they will. Through all of the flashy and completely unrealistic action there is never a moment of doubt that the protagonists will survive and win. There is never any tension, just the tediousness of it all and you just wish for it to finally end.To quote Chris Evans' line from this movie, which sums it up perfectly: ""Boring.""","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The plot is quite flimsy and been done before. The motive behind 6 risking his life to save his former boss and his child is also weak. On one side you say 6 is a cold blooded operative and on the other he has deep ties to others that he's risking his life to save them. The Gray Man became a very cliché film with Gosling's character taking on an army of mercenaries and winning with barely a scratch. Their bullets always miss but his shots always hit the target. Also he apparently has 9 lives after being shot at, repeatedly stabbed and concussions. With all his injuries he still beat Lloyd in combat. The ending was underwhelming as there was no great twist or conclusion. Come on Netflix, I was really hoping for more. Take the time to explore stronger, creative and deeper scripts.

If you are a fan of witty quips and off the cuff one-liners... you'll need to look elsewhere. Far away elsewhere. And it's not merely that the words spoken are stupid, they're predictably stupid.And that's before we get to the acting. I'll only give a pass to AdA, as she was the only character even remotely relatable. All the others were alternately over the top, lethargic or manic. It's always dicey using child actors, but even by that standard, this performance was ludicrous, obviously egged on by director.Granted, I'm not an expert in this genre. It was not my choice to view this. And as related above, really nothing to recommend it. But above all else, the ridiculously simplistic moral universe created in this movie, is the result of lazy, undisciplined and unenlightened minds, and is an insult to audiences of critical thinkers.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Since that was Marvel, they were limited and had to keep things relatively tight.Watching some of this film, my brother and I turned it off and removed from Netflix after the military plane fight, because by this point it was even worse than the start; the special effects were over done and you couldn't see the action (of what there was, badly edited), the stylised action as usual had the typical start a move, cut, show a reaction, cut, cut back to end of move blah blah, which the majority of American film makers cannot seem to get over.Note; Hong Kong action movies from the early 70's through at least to the late 90's are still superior, because they usually use a wide angle and don't cut unnecessarily; they cut or show the move and edit without disrupting the flow of the action on film. There's huge film library potentially that can be used for inspiration. But instead, shaky cam, bad editing or quick cuts and in the above film's case zooming into a gun on the floor (military plane scene) and showing Ryan Gosling's arm and face while his shooting the enemy or target (during club filtration scene) is supposed to be good???Action wise specifically; it seems majority of Hollywood (e.g.. American style of film making) cannot shoot action for s***. Especially when there has been decent action from the likes of Tom Cruise in his niche area as a bigger action star now in his later years and big action set pieces and of course with the likes of Keanu Reeves with the John Wick films. However, people seem to think the actors make the film only, but where a director understands action it then becomes a team effort e.g. Christopher McQuarrie, Chad Stahelski, David Leitch & Christopher Nolan - these guys understand action and setup pieces and how to show it properly.They spent 200 million on this, what for? Just for the the Russo brothers name on Marvel films which they obviously ripped their own scenes and expanded from Winter Soldier, Black Panther (at least what I could see form the trailer and the minimal viewing of the film itself).Those who are praising the film's action clearly have not seen proper stylised action and well shot films (steady camerawork whether for story telling or action scenes and both).Shaking the camera around during the bail out of the military plane, was not exciting. The effects are overblown and over use of CGI/green screen.Netflix also, don't seem to get it - throwing stupid money at a production doesn't mean it's going to be good. Same applies to the running time, 2hrs plus, film should have been 1hr 40mins max no longer.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Not to be Missed, Especially Ryan Gosling !!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8398038/?ref_=tt_urv","cs_rahul_prasad","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104563194/?ref_=tt_urv","4 August 2022","As the title suggests, 'Gray Man' describes Ryan Gosling's Six - a good guy with a criminal past. His deeds aren't black or white. He is both right and wrong. He is pitted against out-and-out bad guy with comic undertones Lloyd. The battle between the good-bad guy and the bad guy rages when the bad guys in the CIA do bad things. In order to conceal the bad things, they resort to something worse. Read, use covert operations to settle personal scores. What unfolds is a fast and furious, excessive gunplay woven cat and mouse game between the good looking dude in tight pants (Chris Evans) and the good looking dude in a tracksuit (Ryan Gosling). Mind you, tracksuit has ethics, tight pants has none. In a bid to outdo the other, the two men go on a rampage destroying everything that stands in their way.The Russo Brothers (directors Anthony and Joe), widely known for their Marvel films are off the leash. Their heroes though still invincible, can now afford to cause collateral damage unlike the righteous superheroes that cannot harm a fly except for evil aliens. The duo clearly feels liberated and has decided to go as 'grey' as possible. Expect bombings, some more bombings, gunplay, fistfights, over the top chase sequences et cetera. They seem to be particularly obsessed with asset retrieval-kind mercenary themes. Their previous Netflix film, 'Extraction' starring Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda also had a hitman saving a kidnapped child while being chased around.They raise the stakes here by taking this 'grey vs evil' fight global. Though entertaining and even scarcely humorous, their action thrillers outside the superhero space feel a tad juvenile with little desire to build interesting characters. The focus is solely to bombard the viewer with back-to-back action set pieces. A spectacular tram sequence does get you on the edge of your seat and is the film's finest action scene. But after a while, the wafer-thin characters and them running around the world in circles, trying to be funny, gets a bit tiring. The rivalry-bromance between Lloyd and Six, intended to be the highlight of the film, feels more silly than dangerous. Despite having two very popular and good actors on board, the writing doesn't scratch the surface. Words like ethics, morals, values and corruption are casually thrown around without much emphasis on substance.A moustached Chris Evans mouthing flirty lines for other men is a funny sight. He addresses Gosling as 'Ken Doll, cute, cupcake' and refers to Dhanush as 'my sexy Tamil friend'. He works more as a comic relief than a psychopath on the loose. Dhanush is intense and stands out in a significant action sequence. His is a short but solid guest appearance. Killing Machine Ryan Gosling's steely gaze and sarcasm are a perfect ten. The film however, like his character is a Six. The Gray Man is Mission Impossible meets Bourne series minus their outstanding soundtrack and swag. If you don't mind a mechanical action thriller though, you could enjoy this one. While Netflix has poured a lot of money into it, a theatrical release would have been ideal for this film, given its scale, pace and genre.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's understandable why Gosling would sign up and Netflix would open not just their wallet but an entire bank vault for the Russos to adapt the book by Mark Greaney, with an eye to starting a new mega-franchise of their own. However, it's becoming clearer and clearer that Netflix has too little creative oversight over projects like these, just letting creators run off with their money and not really caring about what they deliver. The star of ""La La Land"" and ""Drive"" plays a spy named Sierra Six (""007 was taken""), who was recruited out of prison by a handler named Donald Fitzroy (Billy Bob Thornton). After that very brief set-up, ""The Gray Man"" hits the ground running with a mission gone very awry when Six is tasked by a new boss named Denny Carmichael (Regé-Jean Page) with taking out a target that turns out to be a fellow secret agent. The dying man tells Six that Denny is a bad guy before handing him the intel to prove it. Immediately, our stoic hero is on the run, before he's really had any time to develop a personality as a movie character. As Six goes on the run, Carmichael calls in Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans), a former CIA black ops mercenary who now works in the private sector where there are even fewer rules about things like torture and dumb mustaches. Hansen will do whatever it takes to get Six, including kidnapping Fitzroy's daughter Claire (Julia Butters) to get his attention. Like so much original entertainment in the streaming world, ""The Gray Man"" seems scared to take an actual risk. There have been many pieces written about the algorithms and templates that feel like they're driving creative decisions more than actual human beings. When will a company like Netflix throw $200 million at a movie and emerge with a ""John Wick,"" ""Mission: Impossible,"" ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" or even a ""Fast Five""? It might take an actual superhero for something like that to happen.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Despite lacking these two, we have all the perfect pieces to the action puzzle-a versatile star in Gosling, a fitting villain in Evans, and a directorial duo who have a penchant for action. What hurts the whole setup is fast-paced action rushing us into a story we've been bludgeoned over the head a million times before. But what peaks our interest is that it's actually Gosling who's kicking butt in a 007-like role, and it's Evans who we all dislike, including the rest of the cast. We like the corrupt government being corrupt, and we like the invincible action hero Gosling likens to be. Although far-fetched, I would likely tune-in for a sequel if they ever obliged us. A little bit of romance probably wouldn't hurt their second go-around.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

He was subtle but was kickass.Ana de Armas, Jessica Henwick done a decent job in their available space.Dhanush extended cameo appearance delivers nothing great.Overall, a one-time watchable movie wherein after watching, it will remind us of James Bond Series & some other CIA thriller jonor movies.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The visual effects were excellent, definitely not low budget. The movie featured a good selection of actors who all performed great.My one criticism is the torture scene; didn't need to see the detail.

They clearly wanted Ryan Reynolds and never re-wrote the role for whom they got.As a whole the movie is too long.And, and I cannot overstate how much this hurts the overall impression, the final fight is.. hilariously bad.

The nutcase guy was well done in his nastiness and the action sequences were superb especially the carnage in Prague. It was totally thrilling with some non-cheesy humour thrown in for good measure. Some people here are clearly taking it too seriously (as always) expecting certain things, but from the start you can see it's going to have some comedy value. I loved the length of the film too, just kept wanting more and more and it all ended really well apart from, will try not spoil anything, sorting out the main main big-wig bad guys.

Sheesh.From the get go, the technical aspects of the film drew ire. The intentional dullness buried action sequences to the point of being lackluster. Admittedly, there are some energetic camera work done by the Russo brothers, but when supposedly charismatic scenes & exotic locations are muted due to poor cinematography, it impedes visual appeal. The choice of music also felt random and headscratching, providing zero value to the viewing experience. What pulls the film to greater depths however, are its uninteresting characters & atrocious screenplay. The lack of character development was out in the open, focusing more on snacks of choice than providing depth. Questions then arise on character's motivations and actual relevance to the storyline. As for the script, dialogues were cringe-worthy due to overused cliche's, boring one liners & flat out senselessness. It was shockingly bad.Overall, The Grayman is a worrysome start to a franchise that finger crossed, does not materialize. It is an action flick that mirrors the out of control Fast & Furious films, a product of Netflix' propensity to throw money to film creators without creative oversight. It is then a film that is easy to dislike, due to its attempts to fool us with flare, but ultimately, lacks substance. 5/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's the very loose plot that hurts this movie so badly. The very thing that kept you wanting to read the next chapter of the book is what's absent here. There are HUGE plot holes in this movie. It just doesn't flow and the scenes move far too rapidly from one location to the next.And the standard set with the aforementioned blockbusters i.e. Minimal CGI, is another weak point with this movie, where CGI is used liberally - the Prague scene being the exceptional nugget of quality nestled within the remainder of the movie!Finally, the scoring is poor. It tries to ""Bond"" it - with atmospheric orchestral scoring - but misses the mark. It so seems so... muted! Possibly something lost in post-production?And can I have a finally finally?

Far from improving the film, the CGI and drone footage only makes things worse. You can't polish the proverbial, put simply the acting perfectly matches the plot. One to avoid... save yourself a couple of hours.Billy Bob Thornton's character is unbelievable and the casting is all wrong. Chris Evans is terrible as the protagonist but nowhere near as bad as Regé-Jean Page.Gosling's character Six has no substance at all, despite his backstory, and to add to it, there's no consistency in his character.I struggle to find any positives for film, it's hard to believe the money Netflix threw at this and what came out the other end. It really makes you realise just how good the Daniel Craig Bond films are... even Quantum of Solace is head and shoulders above The Grey Man. And while we're talking Quantum of Solace Ana de Armas character and performance in The Grey Man is very reminiscent of Olga Kurylenko's in Quantum of Solace.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

For the first time ever they did not gain new subscribers on the previous quarter. And that is bad news for the company. That is bad for a number of reasons, but mainly because they are spending more money than they are taking in each month. That is how many, if not all, these internet giants operate. You run your business at a loss and bet that you'll fill the gap with growth. It is a business strategy that made the Amazons, the Facebooks, the Youtubes successful.If there is something this movie achieves, it is reminding us that Netflix remains a tech company. Despite all the ambitions and claims that they are movie studio, they are still just a plain old silicon valley company. A giant sure, but a tech firm nonetheless. And this film is the ultimate evidence tech firms are not movie studios. Tech firms rely on selling a technology. Tech firms are engineering companies run by engineers (at worst by bean counters).Maybe I am nostalgic of a simpler time, or maybe it's a romantic construct that never existed, but it used to be cool to be an engineer. They would work to make the world a better place. They would build bridges, and dams and skyscrapers. They would design oil wells, hydropower plants and garment factories. They would put Man on the moon. Nowadays the engineers at the social media giants promote fascism, the ones at the rainforest named one (which own this marvel of a website) undercut your local mom and pop stores and the ones making phones use up all the rare earth minerals.The engineers at Netflix , I am not sure what they're doing. To be fair, I imagine there is a lot of effort and resources put into being able to stream whatever whenever on any internet network on the globe. And that is fine, yet is it really an advancement for the human race when it is in the service of the Gray Man?It is a 2 hour re-hash of every action movie ever made. During which, the CIA unabashedly destroys Prague and where every character's trait is that they all went to Harvard. Between this and Red Notice, for Netflix this is as good as it gets. Given how they are doing financially and how they're not the only game in town anymore, they will never make anything better, or different. It is the perfectly tailored appeal to the lowest common denominator. It is an excuse for an irresistible thumbnail.Netflix is an internet platform. A platform is a place where you wait for the bus, it is where delivery trucks unload, it is a surface you put on the water to drill oil. The Gray Man is this platform's commodity, an interchangeable resource that has to run through the pipeline.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This looks robotic.I guess that it is one of those films for people who like to believe that they can fight like this and be immortal, or something like that.And how much did they pay these actors? And how many people will see it? That's one of the problems, an easy job for them and going to the movies is worth a fortune! Doesn't make any sense to me.What a way to spend money please! A shame!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Action is great, scenery is beautiful, and Goslin, Armas & Evan's are all spot on. We were entertained the entire show and will likely watch again.I guess some of the action might be a little over the top for some people but I thought it was great. It felt like a fun modern action movie but had the charm of the action flicks I grew up on. And they didn't even feel the need to jackknife in a useless love interest or other cliche things every movie seems to have these days, which I appreciated.Overall just a great movie, highly recommend.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It does not have a plot, it changes continuously. Therefore, the viewers get lost. I think, this movie is more for children because there is nothing unpredictable. Everything is so simple and childish. The acting of Ana de Armas is mediocre. When we finished the movie my father was close to punch me because I made him waste 2 hours of his time. For being a movie of action there are good effects and scenes but nothing that makes the viewer get excited or surprise, although It is fast it is boring indeed.

The staging is close to perfection, but the script is too simple and built around too many clichés of the genre. The pace is frantic, the narrative is fluid, and the narration is linear. The photography is excellent with many action scenes, shootouts and explosions follow one another until the final outcome. The soundtrack is the perfect accompaniment and the editing allows the film to maintain a high level of tension and velocity. The distribution offers very good performance. Ryan Gosling is perfect as a casual professional killer while Chris Evans surprises in the role of a bloodthirsty psychopath. When it comes down to it, it might not be the smartest action movie Netflix has produced, but it's probably one of the most entertaining.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

That's all it missed, the superior emotional impact, and that's all. But it was great fun anyway. I'm heavily glad the sequel got already booked, I will look forward to it, hoping they'll add that extra bond developing further as Father - Daughter relation and guardian angel job. I barely recognized the sharp minded cutie from ""Once upon a time in hollywood"" that helped Leo Di'Caprio finding his way back to acting and believing in himself, damn she deserved more screen time, how can a flower unfold with such a little to work with? Hope she'll play much bigger part in sequel, anyway...Action and choreography is godlike except maybe parachute scene. I appreciate this spectacular action flick and great job well done and entertaining factor it delivered.I don't understand that criminal low ratings of the Gray Man movie but i don't want to even dig here in this graveyard of figgofaggo woke children that don't give 2 flying birds for the writting, screenplay, plot and execution of a movie.

However, if you leave out the action (and some of its Cinematographic imaginativeness) you've got yourself nothing.The Screenplay is so erratic, that it seems like the feeling of unrest and instability have been deliberately constructed to make way for the action to take the centre stage. And since the character developments are barely there, none of the personalities seemed to have any sort of depth. Now, their performances aren't horrible, but each member of the cast, irrespective of how much preference they might have got, didn't have much else to do other than kick random people's asses.Now, if any of it fits the description of your preference, you are more than welcome to check this visual razzle-dazzle! Or else, my suggestion would be to keep a safe distance.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The Gray Man pretty much just gathers together and shows the biggest problems with a lot of action movies today, such as how their very unoriginal and flat stories or ideas fit into an overlong mess that's built of too much boring dialogue and uninteresting characters, which usually results in the climatic action sequences not being worth anticipating for and the film just failing in the end.The only thing this action movie does a quarter-decent job at is designing and executing clear protagonists and antagonists. Well, Ryan Gosling's CIA operative character, the protagonist of the film, is a very average kind of skilled-guy you see in action movies all the time. He's extremely clever and he can take down a bunch of bad guys by himself. Chris Evans is the antagonist here, and he's a pretty intense villain, especially in the film's final face-off.It's usually action-comedy movies that feature more unique or just appealing stories and execute them well, which is why the leads in this film are capable of a good time at the movies but are just wasted instead. Ryan Gosling really fits well into roles he did like The Nice Guys and Chris Evans is such a memorable Captain America. But this film just chops up some violent action scenes and throws them along with the unbearably boring story with no thrills, other than the wincing from the violence and torture.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

This movie obliterates the backstory, removes the motivation and ethics that drive the character, and leaves no room to do any follow up that's remotely close to the actual story.Other than the names of the main characters being the same, and some massive additions/changes, it's just not a good adaptation on any level. The Russo's are good at what they do most of the time, but they butchered this and I'm not looking forward to any potential sequel. I would have settled for Bourne level changes to the story, but this was a muddled mess that accomplishes nothing more than tainting the series for the near future.3 stars for some solid action scenes, but that's it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Well he is the Gray man akin to John wick, James Bond.

They do bonkers things because that's the material they have been given.It's obviously giving a huge nod to spy movies (James Bond being one) but despite the explosions, gunplay, set pieces, action sequences....it all just seems.....so what.In fact, 6 Underground (a Ryan Reynolds film by Netflix) has the same feel to this but without the Michael Bay glossiness.It's a huge let down for the Russo Brothers. I enjoyed Extraction, another Russo Bros actioner, immensely. Some incredible action pieces that linger with you way after the movie finishes.The Gray Man, though, is completely forgettable.All the actors are fine, the plot is all over the place with a frankly unsatisfactory ending.It has none of the hallmarks of a classic action film. It's a B movie with an A list cast.You'll watch it but turn down your anticipation.It's perfectly fine to pass the time but that's it.Watch Extraction if you want to see a good Russo Brothers action film.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's not chopped up crazy like Jason Bourne. This feels like John wick but the russo brothers signature flair to it. Big set pieces with things blowing up all around the characters while Ryan gosling checks the bullets in his gun. It's little things amidst the bigger things going on around it.

For what type of film this is I'm rating it a 9/10 for the simple fact that I was engaged from beginning to end. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I really cared about all of the characters. There was plenty of character development, the acting was solid. I love Ryan Goslings acting. He's quiet, stoic, calculating, but also sensitive and not to mention really capable at the action sequences. He did a lot of his own stunts and that's really commendable. The same goes for Evans. He never fails to deliver on many of the same attributes. I was able to suspend the motion of him not being Steve Rogers. He played morally bankrupt really well, it was haunting because he was so polished but yet cunning and borderline evil. The ""trash-stache"" was on point as well. All in all, great action film all around. I didn't go into this assuming it was going to be high art worthy of being shown at Cannes or an ""Oscar Worthy"" film. I showed up to be entertained and honestly, I would pay to see this in theaters! That's saying something as I don't make it out much. Don't listen to the 4-6/10 reviewers.

Chris Evans has the psychotic killer part nailed. Throw in some Billy Bob, an adorable kid, an honorable lone wolf and I can't complain about the acting.Action is a little bit unbelievable, but then again, so is every James Bond, Jason Bourne, and Mission Impossible film. That being said, I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film even if I somehow knew the good guy was going to eventually win.Filming location was beautiful. Cinematography was crisp.The ending was just a bit disappointing, but only because I wanted ALL the bureaucratic weasels to get theirs as well.

It's got action that's not compelling, humor that's not funny in the least and an almost complete lack of charisma from any of the characters. Gosling is borderline robotic and Evans is trying so hard to chew scenery as the baddie and just face-planting it at every turn. I can't really blame his performance as much as the unbelievably awful dialogue he's throwing out every time he opens his mouth. It's bad. Really, really bad.Ana de Armas was the most interesting thing about the movie. She continues to prove her talent with every role I see her in. She's got the chops for just about anything. If she were the main character I think some of this thing would've worked better for me.As far as the Russos go, I credit them for making what I still think is the best Marvel film to date in Captain America: The Winter Soldier and for whatever contributions they made toward bringing Everything Everywhere All at Once to life.

Fantastically written, excellently acted, wonderfully scored, I enjoyed the film from start to end, even changing my mind on what I thought about a few of this film's actors. I have never been so invested in an action/spy/assassin movie, watching it twice in as many weeks. The only disappointment you will experience in watching this film is that the Russia didn't find a way of getting the young actress who plays Claire on the screen more, she delivers her lines with the confidence of a much older, more experienced actor.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Anything with Ryan gosling. And man, billybob? Eye catcher. The only action packed movies I've ever seen are James bond films with Daniel Craig, and mission impossible films. However, the directors of this film are right up that alley. I have to say, this movie deserves the 10 stars. Pure action. The movie was drawn out for an hour, trying to figure out the plot. It went right to business. And the cast was on point. Cinematography was perfect. Camera work, man.. absolutely loved it. Loved it so much, I started it again after I ended it. Definitely buying this movie, no matter the price. Can't wait to see more films directed by the brothers.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

In retrospect, I don't know what possessed us.After a bizarre scene-setting intro with the now obligatory mumbled dialogue, the film descends into an almost comical series of increasingly violent set-ups. All set in some sort of computer-generated futureworld which we are told is actually Bangkok (or was it Shanghai? Who cares?)During a brief interlude in the mayhem the two protagonists trade information, which I guess is supposed to entice the viewer into wondering what will happen next. What happened next for us was to hit the ""Exit"" button on the remote.There are no doubt those who like this sort of thing, and that's fine. If I can borrow a quotation, for me it's "" de trop and not enough"". Spare us the over the top effects and give me a believable story.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Not a James Bond killer? Sure! And that's because James Bond is one of the most boring action movies you could think of. Especially those of the last years where action scenes repeat forever, one after the other for hours, without a reason, without a meaning, in an epileptic filming style filled with unbelievable physics (on the verge of a fantasy movie), ridiculous dialogues and ridiculous villains whose motivations range from pathetic to nonsense. Quite the opposite here though. This is a very well acted (minor roles included), filmed, and wonderfully choreographed movie with brilliant dialogues that were missing from an action probably since the 90s. It's a pleasant surprise to watch fighting scenes that do not feel unmotivated and perfectly fit a credible and lean, even if not particularly original, script. And this is the only reason why I give a 9 to an otherwise perfectly packaged and really entertaining movie.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

BBT played his part well, but wasn't exactly eye catching or irreplaceable in his part. The kid actor had some corny lines but acted well enough. All of the characters were too cool... or they tried to be. It never quite reached the levels I think they were aiming for where the characters are cool but memorable - take the reboot of the man from uncle... similar type of movie, except the man from uncle played the characters as suave and cool in a way that was more genuine and believable/funny.

Although the film contains a loads of actions but its more like the piling with quantities instead of qualities.At the end you didn't feel excited about a new action instead just grew tired of it. Besides that, the poor lines and plots just made the flat characters even more unpleasant to watch. All things about the movie are commercial, I can smell the dollars behind the scenes and a genuine sense of 'nobody gives a .......'
The political ploy and conspiracy presented in the film are as childish as its character design.

It seems that the script only included action scenes, which are poorly done, they are clearly quite embarrassing due to their poor preparation, accompanied by a little committed direction that does not clearly show what happens in each scene, the constant movement of the camera deprives us of appreciating all the violence, the special effects don't help either, since they are quite mediocre and very false. There is even a moment where everything is completely ridiculous and implausible, it looks like a movie from the 'Fast and Furious' franchise, the few things that stand out are the performances, since it is the only thing that encouraged me to finish the movie, and maybe the beginning can be promising.It is a film with a poorly worked script, with action scenes that are embarrassing, with a ridiculous and boring narrative, where the effort of the directors is not noticeable, and the $200 million it cost is not noticeable either, it is unfortunate that they continue making films like this, where the creators do not strive to create something that is worthwhile, or that at least entertains a little more.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

And, truth be told, takes some of their best parts. And so you'd think this is a recipe for making a great film. And it might. But 'The Gray Man' is a nothing but a hodge-podge of action movie plot devices. Which is to say, It's no good.From The Bourne series it takes a government paid assassin being hunted by other paid assassins of the same government. From James Bond, we get assassins with numbers in lieu of names. From Die Hard and MI:3 we have a hero having to save the world, but at the same time having to save someone with whom he has a personal relationship. From John Witt: a bounty placed on our hero's head. From Jack Reacher and John Witt we grab a fighter who simply cannot be beaten hand-to-hand, even when facing fifty or more lethal hands. From anything with Bruce Willis we get the cracking-wise. From Borne the thumping music alerting us to a chase. We've got plane crashes, car crashes, street-car crashes. Like its predecessors it has international travel taking place in the blink of an eye. All this. All these. And more. But still, a hodge-podge.You might ask 'Why?'. And the answer? The story, the plot. It's somehow missing something. Perhaps urgency; as in, If the bad guys aren't brought down by midnight all is lost. An easy-to-understand evil is missing as well; the film's menace seems spread out between too many people (actually three) representing too many competing organizations. The 'evil-assassin' is played over-the-top; he's a screeching, screaming, off-the-wall crazy of a guy. I wanted more of a concentrated evil; think of Philip Seymour Hoffman in MI:3. Think of the original Die Hard's German Mercenary played by Alan Rickman.The Gray Man looks good. It's well shot and well-paced. The fight scenes are excellent. And I particularly liked the fact that Ryan Gosling's Gray Man actually gets to have some hand-to-hand combat with his nemesis. Ana De Armas is somehow easy to believe as a fellow (good guy) agent, Billy Bob Thornton is fine as The Gray Man's mentor. Chris Evans is, as noted earlier, over the top as the evil assassin.One final point. The good job of showing the fight scenes is all but undone by this: the final two combat scenes take place ..... off camera.And that's a no-no is anyone's book.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Forget about a plot, backstory or character development of any kind.

The action is near constant, which is a plus and minus as it doesn't allow time for too much plot or character development but it looks awesome. On the surface it's a spy versus spy movie, but at the core it's about a morally questionable man on a mission to save a little girl. Personally, for me, nothing will beat Léon: The Professional (1994) when it comes to that particular trope, but Six's interactions with Claire are good enough. Regé-Jean Page is absolutely wasted in this in his role as the CIA office man orchestrating things mostly behind the scenes. Chris, though, always has the most fun as a bad guy and that comes through here in his character of Lloyd Hansen. Lloyd's line ""Extra ten million to the first guy to put a bullet in the Ken doll's brain"" wins the whole movie for me. I have seen images of Ryan as Ken in the upcoming Barbie movie and I was thinking about the contrast in these roles early on in this movie so when Lloyd said that, I did a spit-take. Loved that line and would have loved more Lloyd. There were a few other good moments of humor, nice touches of heart with Six and Fitzroy and overall good cast chemistry. There are some issues, like the Michael Bay levels of wanton destruction in some scenes, but it's highly watchable and a good effort for Netflix's take on an action blockbuster for the summer.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought it would be a stylized spy thriller, but nope.I wanted to like the characters (or at least the lead), but there's one dialogue with the niece and two flashbacks of the Six's past. Guess that's all the development I need.Some action scenes were incredible, but the story wasn't strong enough to back them up.One hundred minutes into the film, it started to feel like it was trying to end but couldn't.

What is annoying and without spoilers the ending is open ended, as the bad guys do not all fade away, a cheap ploy from the producers who probably intend to do a sequel, sorry but it's not worth an extension.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Exotic locations are hinted at, but beyond a quick drone flyover are never used, except for a couple backdrops.

But on the other hand, I wonder where did all the money go and I also wonder
if it was ever necessary such a large spending into a popcorn flick with many problematic going against it when better films can achieve marvelous results without the same
amount. I know those things (money and quality) don't usually go hand in hand but in critical economical times it sure would be an über-bingo"" when it comes to presenting an
entertaining film.I liked the movie. Sure did. But I was expecting a lot more considering the names involved; some of them deliver all the goods but other less known names really bothered me
and it's mostly related to the technical craftsmen involved than the actual actors and I'll go deeper with that thought but first I'm all for the goods that we had here. ""The
Gray Man"" had a cliched yet cool humored story about an ex-convict (Ryan Gosling, effective as always) turned into an obscure CIA agent perfectly trained to kill without questioning who gets into a lot of trouble after
finding out some dirt on his employees and they hire a psychotic agent (Chris Evans) to chase him down, get a stolen oject from him and terminate his career. Your typical spy game story with plenty of action and thrills,
and I'm fair to say almost everything works without much damage. But be ready for a rumble adventure with lots of over-the-top moments that can leave you either excited with
everything you're about to see or shaking his head in disbelief or annoyance. One unbelievable sequence after another, but that's what movies are for...to make us dream sometimes.Sometimes those moments work very fine - like the sqaure shooting when Evans crew wildly attack everyone just to get Gosling - and other times it's painfully exaggerated like the fight in the plane and its aftermath.However, the bumps along the way related with the directors and the crew involved made me think less of this film almost to a nauseating point. Famous for the ""Captain America"" flicks, the Russo brothers
sure know how to deliver a visual spectacle with great actors involved (but they're a lot better when the actors are the main point of attraction rather than the big budget effects). But with ""The Gray Man"" there were
so many bothering things that disappointed the heck out of me such as the gross editing which doesn't allow viewers to see the film, specially in the action sequences where it's hard to understand what's happening and who's
beating who; the visual effects are too fake for its own sake - had it been in the 1990's they'd look a lot more realistic; but the worst that got me was the cinematography. I'm yet to see an action film dark, so dark you can't
see anything happening. I know this is a film about special agents and their dark worlds but this thing was impossible to look at it time and again and I kept forcing my sight through it all. Fights in the dark, shots in the dark,
conversation in the dark and then the girl spy just blow up the power to enter a veterinarean lab. A movie is made to be seen, not to obscured by weird with some aesthetic that reflects the characters.On a conversation about deeper themes as the story, it's a mashup of overseen things put together that somehow manage to work except for some bits in the final minutes which was a complete turn-off for me. It almost angered me.As said once, I liked the film. The acting is quite good but almost no one gets the chance to make a great use of humor in a film with plenty of dark humored moments (minor laughter effect and we know this could get a lot higher).Gosling is the usual hero we root for, pretty good; Evans with his porn-stache and frightening ways is almost hilarious but he steals the show playing the antagonist; but Billy Bob Thornton and Angela Bassett who get the highlights
with the best scenes in the movie. And we have Wagner Moura stealing the show as the talkative helpful tech-guy. They're all fun to watch and made of this something worth remembering just to have some kicks, and make audiences
indulgence themselves in the extravagance of the moment.But to close it down as I begin while questioning budget and result, it's a disappointing thing to see. But Hollywood has done a lot worse, higher values and higher mistakes from which we never recovered, neither some careers.To be fair, this is not a career-killer, neither a disaster of epic proportions - you just get the vibes of that. But was it worth the risk of delivering a lot less than we'd expect? In a movie where it's impossible to see with countless
technical problems that get nearly close to ruin the enjoyment? You be the judge. I've seen worse and I've seen better, and this one gets some credit and respect because they tried. 8/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I don't usually write reviews but I felt like I had to!The cast/acting, soundtrack, story, directing etc. Is great, as with all great films.I've already watched it about 6 times, and I only discovered The Gray Man just over a week ago :)
My favourite film of all time is Fight Club, but this is a close second.All the actors have a great presence. I'd first watched Ryan Gosling in Blade Runner 2049, another really good film, and was very impressed; Chris Evans is a great villian and it's funny when he yells when hurt in a couple of scenes, which makes things more realistic. I think generally violence/war can be romanticised in films but the reality of actually being in a fight/war is very different. All of the other actors who I haven't mentioned were great too.I have to add, it also shows that a film doesn't have to have romance/nudity in order to be great, which I really appreciate.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

On a mission to eliminate a target, Six discovers he is one of theirs, Four. Just before Four dies, he gives Six a locket containing information on corrupt officials. (Now, why does this premise sound so familiar...?).Sociopathic Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans) is sent to retrieve the information and eliminate Six. With a big bounty on Six's head, everyone is after him resulting in full throttle action. Yup, the action sequences are well done and brutal. The flowing photography is insane!'The Gray Man' is an action-driven movie - whether it makes sense or not, and this is where I had several issues with the film. To call it over the top, would be euphemistically speaking. When Hansen takes the matter personally, he turns the city into a war zone. While it looks amazing and its a good adrenaline rush, its not realistic for this kind of movie. Had it been a fantasy superhero movie it would have been a different story.CIA operatives would never do - or allow Hansen to do - what they do in this movie, regardless of how corrupt an agent might be. The events are implausible and only to create impressive action sequences - in typical Hollywood style. I also found Chris Evans miscast as the antagonist. He does not possess a menacing enough demeanor to portray the ruthless Hansen, and I quite honestly found him a bit theatrical. Ryan Gosling, on the other hand, was well cast as Six. Then again, Gosling is a much better actor than Evans (no offense!).The film's first half dragged a bit, and the second half was definitely much better than the first. Still, with an incoherent script, an unconvincing antagonist and way too unbelievable in general, this was a once only watch for me.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Great fun and I would definitely recommend it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas: each possess enough charisma and acting talent to carry a film. The directors, Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, we know for their contributions to the wonderful and much loved TV series, 'Community'. The photography in this movie is first rate and the direction slick. A few good wisecracks here and there. I watched 'No Time to Die' recently and both films share a great deal, not least an incomprehensible plot, and gratuitous action sequences that seem to have been shoved into the film willy-nilly.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It starts off with intricate-looking global undercover stuff, but in the process all the intricacy dies down and the events are effectively a repetition of the main character's past. This method was surprisingly efficient at creating a comprehensive and tactile arc, as the past and the present unfold simultaneously.The second strength of the writing of this movie lies in the action sequences. Not only there are a LOT of them, but they are also long and, crucially, we are clearly informed as to what each side is thinking or trying to achieve at any given point in time. Oftentimes however, the main character is just half a step ahead, which then shifts the attention from the mayhem to his actions, allowing the crucial character-building cues to be noted. And all this while the audience is enjoying a big-budgeted stunt showoff. Really cool.Lastly, the visual interest of this movie is something truly commendable. There is a great variety of locations, weather, and lighting conditions, keeping us refreshed. Some will say, maybe we shouldn't be blowing up a historical building for the sake of a 3-second shot of the dust and the smoke settling down behind a low aperture lens? But it's just those little moments that your eyes can rest on something beautiful, that truly complete the cinematic experience.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I've seen a lot of negativity written about this film so l just want to redress that. I wish this had been the next 007 film. Or the last. Or the three or so before that. 'The Gray Man' was way more entertaining than 'No Time To Die' & l mention this mainly because it felt a lot like Ana de Armas had somewhat reprised her role of Paloma, who brought the Bond film to life yet was so madly underused. This is what could've been. The sets are luscious, the action sequences are riveting, the humour is bang on, (l liked Six's interest in shoe sizes & 'you don't throw a loaded gun' - not 'in your face' funny, but it cracked me up) & there was a lot of heart in there too. Now, I'm not particularly a fan of action films but l do hope there's a sequel to this, if there's a way to re-fire again with all three leading actors. Ryan Gosling isn't everyone's flavour of the month, but l'm a fan of his (often) onscreen laconic demeanor.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's one of those that isn't going to blow your mind or anything, but it's just plain entertaining.Well written plot with some clever dialogue. Some awesome visual elements.

It's impossible to distinguish his character in this film from others. He does not sell the ""deranged psychopath"" motif at all. Just the same old winking frat boy as always.But if not for him, this movie would be really enjoyable.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It has a simple storyline, but a movie doesn't need massive twists, deep character studies or complex plots to do a good job. The Gray Man's main villains are not complicated - they're jerks, plain and simple - and as such, Chris Evans gets to have a lot of fun with his character (I loved him hamming it up). Gosling is a fantastic action lead who manages to straddle cool stoicism with dry wit, making him far more watchable and endearing than many of the old-school movie secret-agents I've seen. The kid character is also well executed, which is pretty rare for these kinds of movies. As for the women, De Armas, Woodard and Jessica Henwick have as much personality as their male co-stars (which isn't a massive amount, but this *is* an action movie, and what they show is enough for the audience to understand their characters' personalities and motivations). They certainly hold their own in terms of the action sequences.And that brings me to film's best feature: the action. It's definitely edge of your seat, creative, high octane entertainment - it does make up about 70% of the film but I'm good with that because it was so much fun to watch. Car chases, explosions, banter, hand to hand combat, knives, guns, jumping out of buildings, daring escapes... what was there not to like?This isn't an intellectual film, but the stars and the high-budget action sequences make it fun. And at the end of the day, isn't that what an action movie is supposed to be?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Incredibly swoopy camera movement that i think might give someone motion sickness honestlyThere is very stupid lines in this movie and a lot of explosionsThe main character is a blank slate who is essentially a terminator and is running faster than the speed of sound and getting beaten up all the time its really funnyTheres lots of choices that are made just for the sake of extra drama that is very funny, I'm not joking when i say that this film is genuinely very funny if you have a bunch of people around to make fun of itThe plotline is generic, like I feel I've seen it a million times, but its not really about the plot its about the super epic action yahoo pow powScript feels like it was written by a sophomore but there are some seriously hilarious lines
""Hit this meatball like a freight train"" I'm gonna use that oneMovie is epic cheese its super cheesy oh lorty, also the movie's ending is seriously unsatisfying and there were something between Ana de Armas and another character that was really really really stupid and unsatisfying.Overall, please watch this with people, like at a party or something. It is fun with people to riff on. Otherwise maybe I guess if you're with like your dad or something ya know. Its just a mindless blockbuster spy movieMid 5/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

That issue being that they really don't have a recognizable style. Infinity War and Endgame are good for reasons other than their filmmaking but looking back on The Winter Soldier and Civil War, the filmmaking really takes those movies down for me. This film is incredibly boring to look at. All the technical aspects of it are just so bland. The cinematography is lame, the color grading is lame, the lighting is lame and the VFX are lame. Hell even the music is lame and music is something I can usually latch on to in the movie but for the life of me I can't remember a single track from it. The performances are all fine although Billy Bob Thornton's performance was really bad. I wish this wasn't Gosling's big return to movies since 2018 because you could honestly replace him with any other actor in this movie and it really wouldn't make a difference which sucks because I like Gosling. Ana De Armas is good but it feels like she has absolutely nothing to do here. Their respective characters are incredibly lame too. I don't know what their personalities are or what their goals are other than stop the bad guy. Speaking of bad guy, Chris Evans is the one really great thing about this movie. His character is better than everyone else's but still weak but it's Evans performance that sells it for me. You can tell he's having a great time here crappy mustache and all. It feels like a fun performance that really stands out in a boring film. The story itself is forgettable and lame. Like I said, you really don't get a sense of who these characters are and what they want. I can honestly barely remember what the actual story of the film was because I couldn't care about the characters enough to follow along. It ends up feeling like every stereotypical action movie but instead even those action set pieces are bland. Nothing about the action actually stands out to me. It's all just so boring which sucks because the film does have a good roster of actors with nothing of substance to work with. I'd avoid watching this. You're not gonna miss anything by avoiding this plus you won't be bored to death.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Because that's how Greaney writes them. Solid three-act structure, cliffhangers, simple dialogue, growing suspense, lots of action.If anything was confusing about the Gray Man lore at all, it was him having three codenames - Gray Man, Sierra Six and Violator. Everything else was instantly producible, painlessly convertible to a movie or TV-show.For some reason, Russo brothers didn't even care to read the books. For some reason, they thought that ""perfect for screen"" is still somehow too much for average, braindead movie audience. So they took what was perfect story and mangled it to appeal to... not really sure, who. Primates? Deep ocean lifeforms?In this disaster of ""Gray Man"" by Russo brothers, CIA isn't a bureaucratic, strict and boring government agency, but a secret undersea volcano base of a James Bond villain, existing only to destroy capitols of Europe. Or in other words, ""Evil Genius"" videogame, the movie.Court Gentry, the Gray Man (according to this disaster of a movie) is a robot with zero moral compass, existing only to catch minigun fire and break necks, while also - unlike the book - is far from singleton operator with their own methods and lack of communication.All the important points from the novel are mangled beyond recognition. The story of an assassin trying to stay alive is changed to a Marvel superhero trying to destroy as many landmarks as possible.If Netflix gave me just 10% of the money wasted on this piece of trash, I'd produce a 1000% better movie.This is garbage. Entertaining one, but still a garbage. While Amazon could produce gems like ""Hanna"" and redeem trainwrecks of similar crap - like reverting Tom Cruise's terrible movies with ""Reacher"", Netflix has proven itself to be totally clueless.Unless you want to see another well-established and written franchise to die, avoid this movie. Or even better, say a prayer for Amazon to buy the rights and redeem this trainwreck. Because Gray Man books are actually pretty damn good.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Somebody literally sat down with a bunch of 'cool' set pieces and then stitched a narrative together which vaguely linked things blowing up or people dying horribly. At no time in this mess is there a semblance of a real plot, a narrative that works and has some level of believability and any character development. Gosling is basically playing the Drive character on steroids but without any of the nuance, Evans has fun with the psychopath assassin but it gets boring after a while, de Armas and Thornton are just empty vessels designed to provide plot exposition at the points when it has just got too ridiculous and why someone of Alfre Woodards talent is involved is beyond me, times must be tough I guess. The ot, such as it is, is thetired old cliché of super assassin botches job, has crisis of faith, goes on the run with the whole world of assassins out to kill him - sound familiar yet? He of course defeats everyone despite wounds that would have put him in the ground two thirds of the way through the film only to get betrayed by the morally corrupt 'company men' at the end. The embracing of nihilism by the film maker's at the end leaves a really bad taste and despite the second fluffy ending which all modern films seem to have these days it's the bad taste that lingers. Ultimately this stands as proof that the Russo brothers destroyed the MCU and that Hollywood 'stars' will appear in any crap just to get a pay cheque.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Cardboard characters, wooden acting, paper-thin story, messy action and visuals and bad direction. Worst of all: the action sucks big time.From the get-go I knew this was gonna be bad one. In a lazily written opening scene Billy Bob-Thornton recruits Ryan Gosling (both actors surprisingly wooden and under-motivated) for some shady CIA programs that turns hopeless convicts into killer-machines. He literally says: ""We're gonna train you to kill bad guys."" 16 years of mindless killing for the government later, the movie's main plot starts.For the life of me, a couple of days after watching the film, I can't even remember the ""plot"" - as generic as it was. It involves some compromising information about a high-ranking CIA bloke on some modern form of what used to be a micro chip that ends up in Gosling's character Six's hand. As Six goes rogue, his former boss sends - literally - endless waves of disposable killers after him who chase him - literally - all over the world and blow up more stuff than can ever be accounted for.There is also Ana de Armas' character who kind of helps Six for unconvincing reasons I can't care to remember. And then there is Chris Evans' wannabe sociopath who kills, tortures and shoots his way through the film like there is no tomorrow. At least, Evans seems to try to bring some life to his character, looked like he was having fun playing the roll. Still, it was not very convincing, but that is more to blame on the writing. Unfortunately, there was zero chemistry between Ryan and Ana. I had the impression that both phoned in their roles only for the paycheck. Ryan Gosling was particularly dull and rocks only one facial expression. (Has he always been this bad of an actor or this to blame on this material and direction?) The worst of them all was the CIA baddy Carmichael, played by the complete total failure Regé-Jean Page). This guy was one of the worst miscasts in the history of cinema. I didn't buy him as the bad guy for a minute and his line delivery was more wooden than Pinocchio. All this had me not care about anyone in the film.The film is all over the place. Not only with regards to its tone and its visuals (and hell, they're both confusing) but literally with its locations. There is a change of location every 5 minutes with some giant title card announcing a new city in another foreign country, it seemed like they were purposefully parodying the secret agent film. Only, they were not. This film - in spite of cracking the occasional misfiring joke and one-liner - takes itself way too seriously.Now, this is an action film, you might say, what am I complaining about? Just sit back, turn off your brain and enjoy the mindless action! Well, the action is one of the most annoying parts of the movie. Most of it is very hectic and way to shaky. The set-pieces are so over-engineered that often times you cannot see the characters as they are obstructed by some object or fireworks or what have you. Plus, the majority is filmed in extremely underlit locations. Most of the time, it is so murky (or should I say GRAY?) that you can't even see what is happening. When it takes place in daylight, they use SO MUCH CGI (!!!) that it takes you right out of what is happening. The worst part is that considering they had a 200 million $ budget, the CGI is cringeworthily bad, like straight out of a Playstation 1 game. On top of all this, everything is so unrealistic that I was laughing out loud many times. Don't get me wrong, I came to this film for unrealistic action á la James Bond. Still, these films need to be grounded in reality to make you believe you are still watching humans. If you turn them into absolutely bullet-proof, invincible superheroes who can survive everything and anything without a scratch while performing the most ludicrous moves, it turns right into a superhero-movie. And that is exactly what happens here. The Russo brothers seem to have forgotten that they are NOT ON A FREAKING MARVEL SET. The hand-to-hand-combat and the shootouts (95 lbs Ana de Armas against any trained super mercenary, no problem!) were staged in such an over-the-top-manner that there was seemingly no risk.

"5","/10","OK, but a little disappointing for fans of the books","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8378255/?ref_=tt_urv","andykb-33414","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur88883664/?ref_=tt_urv","28 July 2022","The Gray Man movie is a decent enough popcorn action/thriller - but it's nothing special. It's largely a by-the-numbers actioner with some good humour and mostly above-average visuals and action sequences (though there are some very dodgy effects in there too). Gosling and Evans are great when together on screen, but that doesn't happen much - which seems to be a wasted opportunity to me.The issue for me is that the movie strays too far from the novels on which it's based - to such an extent that I don't see how the sequels can follow the books particularly closely.This is an odd decision, since Netflix apparently want Gray Man to become a whole universe, and the changes mean any future movies won't have the rich range of characters that the books do, and will inevitably stray even further away.I've listed a few differences below, but been intentionally vague to avoid spoilers.The biggest issue for me is that a whole section of Gentry's past in the books simply doesn't happen in the movie (and the Sierra program of the movie is fundamentally different to the book version) - this is fundamental to the book-Gentry character (as well as many of the story-lines), and also means that other key characters in the books don't exist in the movie universeA reasonably important character who appears in most of the books dies in the movie (and his back story is fundamentally changed).The background to Gentry's exceptional skills isn't really explained in the movie, but is clear in the books (as part of this change, his family backstory has also been changed, but that doesn't make too much practical difference)Ana de Armas character in the movie doesn't exist in the booksThe Director of Operations of the CIA is changed quite a lot from book to movie. His actions and motivations relating to the Gray Man are quite different, as are his motivations for orders he give the CIA.If it wasn't for the fact that it's a Gray Man adaptation and I enjoy the books I think I would have liked the movie a little more - but as it is I was quite disappointed by it, and am really not bothered by the recent confirmation of a sequel and a spin-off.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So what the hell happened here? This is a rushed, underconceived, underinvolving flat mess. It's like a SYFY channel movie but with a budget big enough to attract big stars and location shoots, but not enough to pay for good editing or decent CGI. The blink-and-you-miss-it moments of humor, which threaten to make the lead character interesting, are far too rare. The plot, a mishmash of beats from other action movies (including MY SPY, of all things), makes no sense. Ryan Gosling, while charming, once again looks like he smelled a fart and can't be bothered. Chris Evans, the best thing in this, is fun to watch, but ultimately his character makes no sense and comes to nothing. Jessica Henwick can't act, Regé-Jean Page overacts, Billy Bob Thornton's hairpiece (once again) generates more interest in scenes than he does, I hope Alfre Woodard enjoyed her vacation to Europe. Only watchable as background filler, which seems to be a new Hollywood trend.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

It just comes down to bad writing, the scenes never make sense, you're always left asking questions - why is it the bad guy one moments wants our protagonist dead, the next moment he doesn't kill him because he needs to know where the McGuffin is, then back to killing him, then back to the McGuffin, and so it keeps switching with no rhyme or reason? And just so many completely unrealistic things happen, decisions by CIA agents that make no sense whatsoever, a few poor cartoon-like performances in the non lead roles, action scenes that are sometimes too blurry to make sense and a pretty cheesy musical score, and what you get, despite so much money put into this movie and such great stars in the lead roles, an utterly mediocre film.

There's twists, turns, great CGI composites, plenty of adrenaline, and the shoot-'em-up scenes imperative to pushing a story like this one. But that's ultimately what dooms it. Gray Man does nothing original. It's a paint-by-numbers flick. And that's okay if our characters are interesting - we don't need a re-invented wheel to appreciate arcs and development in its protagonists - but from the drop there's just no emotional investment, and thus no payoff when anything happens.Perhaps the producers would do well to scrape some of that Scrooge McDuck sized pile of cash earmarked for production into a bucket to spread around the writing room - perhaps they'd end up with a more colorful film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Everything is executed with maximum bravado, which makes lines like, ""if you enjoy breathing, you'll take care of it,"" all the more obnoxious. There's about as much emotional depth and character building as your mother's favorite soap opera, and It sort of trudges along like a personality-less Dior commercial for much of its runtime. But you don't watch this movie if you're looking for Citizen Kane, and what it does do well makes it impossible to hate. Gosling of course just stands there, moving his face less than any actor has ever done before, and yet somehow exudes a natural charisma (a paradox that's made him the star he is). Chris Evan's adds another psychotic narcissist to his reel (Knives Out, Not Another Teen Movie), proving that he's better at character work than he is at playing it straight. The set pieces elevate the fight scenes and make the action more enjoyable than the typical beat 'em up, providing much needed respite from the film's attempts at dialogue. While It's hard to believe that this latest could-have-lived-without-it Russo flic will bring consumers back to Netflix, it's better than the streaming platform's usual drone of culture deflating nonsense.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I appreciated the drone shots which gave that extra spark, making the movie even more intense. Many great names were involved in this project and cast members did a nice job. Even though the plot is pretty average, it kept me glued to the screen, because I wanted to know more about the secret CIA project and their agents. All the ingredients for an enjoyable film were there. Unfortunately in the second half Russo brothers went full Michael Bay mode and started to overdo it. Impossible explosions that basically destroy half of a city, like a disaster movie, protagonists surviving to the deadliest situations and interactions between characters that become ridiculous. There are a few pretty decent jokes, but most of the comedic moments are just cringey and completely uncalled for. This for me was just lazy writing. ""The Gray Man"" is a big production, so obviously the photography was on point, CGI looks great and action scenes are well coordinated. In the end Netflix here really missed the opportunity to release something slightly different than the usual action flick, throwing away an interesting screenplay and wasting the talent of many people.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I also love Ryan Gosling - who often makes me question my sexuality as he is just so damn handsome lol! Fortunately he seems to be the only man to elicit such thoughts from me and it is a common joke I've seen as well so at least I know I am not alone in this.But yeah, big fan of Chris Evans, big fan of Ryan Gosling and a big fan of the MCU films that the Russos have done.So obviously I went into this with high expectations but this film not only fails to achieve the expectations I had for it, but it falls far far below it and is perhaps among the worst films of 2022 and the worst films of the past 10-20 years that I have seen.2022 has brought some pretty mediocre films, mostly due to the negative impact of COVID on the production of those projects but many of those were at least enjoyable experiences that I am at least glad to have seen once.The Gray Man however is so bad that I even wonder if the 5/10 I've given it is a fair rating or if it deserves even lower. I regret wasting 2 hours of my time watching it and I genuinely worry this film could seriously harm Chris Evans and even Ryan Gosling's careers. Ryan Gosling already has other projects coming soon so those should be able to make Hollywood forget about this disaster but Chris Evans on the other hand only has two projects in pre-production so this film will have more time to in people's minds to ruin his future career.So what is so bad about this film? Well pretty much everything;The acting ---
Acting was just all over the place but in general it came across as bland and uninspired. Ryan Gosling pretty much seems to be playing himself as in the Ryan Gosling we see in interviews, this despite the fact he has a massive range. The Ryan we see in La La Land is completely different from the one we see in Blade Runner, Drive, First Man, The Nice Guys, etc... Each of those performances don't come across as it being Ryan Gosling instead we see the character he is playing not just Ryan Gosling as generic character x. It is unclear if it is bad writing of the character, bad directing or what the root cause is, but in any case a very poor performance from an actor who clearly can and has done far better performances.Chris Evans meanwhile completely overacts his evil villain character, and it is painful to watch as someone who wanted to see Evans show just how well he can portray a villain. Again unclear if bad writing or bad directing or simply poor casting choice.The writing + story ---
The script is basically a generic action flick only the story is even far more superficial and shallow than even the story of a film like Fast Furious, or Expendables which had far more depth to them than The Gray Man does. None of the characters in Gray Man really get any proper backstory or any kind of character arc. Their personalities are the same as we see them from the start to the end of the film and all characters fit in to generic action flick archetypes.There isn't all that much dialogue in the film but the dialogue that is there comes across as very unnatural and as simple filler. There are a few catchy lines here and there but because the rest is bad they feel out of place and forced.The action ---
So this you'd expect to be good for an action flick, but the cinematography doesn't do the great choreography justice. There are some pretty great close quarter combat on display in this film, combat that is nearly as good, if not as good as that what we see in John Wick. But the issue is we don't actually get to see it. The camera is either too shaky to actually see what is going on, or doing fast pans, or fast cuts in editing. So we rarely get to see the choreography properly despite how great it is.Yet then in contrast to this we get CGI shots that are absolutely horrific with some of the worst CGI I have ever seen in a big budget film (perhaps even worse than the CGI in Black Widow) and those shots are shown very slowly, often in slow motion or with slow cuts, slow CG camera movements. They really want you to soak in the crappy CGI on display in this film....With a show time of 2 hours, this film could have easily been as good as Casino Royale, Skyfall, Bourne trilogy, etc... especially with the talent they pulled into this film. Yet it is absolutely wasted with bad writing, bad directing, bad acting, bad editing, and horrific CGI.Save 2 hours of your life, like I wish I did, skip this film at all costs....","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Really DIRE stuff. Amazed that so many audience members seem to like it. Usually if the audience likes a film, and the critics hate it, I will like it, but NOT THIS TIME! This time the critics's low ratings are right.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm not the biggest fan of these types of movies but this should be the 2 or 3 movie I see of the Russo brothers and I was imagining everything would be perfect.To be honest, the biggest ""flaw"" was the role of Ryan Gosling. I just can't get into his character and I think it was a mistake that he took this role. I really enjoy his career and will always be a fan, but this movie didn't work.Also the story wasn't the worst I've seen but at the same time I feel it was a bit random and a bit cliché. This was the part I was kind of looking forward to but I feel like it was even worse than that.There were a few moments that I liked, for example, the fighting moments I liked and that was the part where I kind of managed to get into the movie.The movie isn't bad, but it's not good either, it's standard and I just recommend it as a movie to pass the time for most people.As a final comment, I don't know how Netflix will recover from a movie with such a high budget that this movie cost and I also don't think it will be nominated for an Oscar.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The absolutely sickening audacity to pull two world class talents in Gosling and Evans, sucker them into a by the numbers cia/clancy/cruise stock action movie while running up an over 200 million dollar bill for Netflix. You would have to garner such unbelievable amounts of goodwill from the industry to make this nearsighted conception of an action film come to life, and the Russo's have.After single handily enabling marvel/disney to wreak havoc on the entire medium for unprecedented amounts of money, they cashed in said goodwill to make a sleek star studded action blockbuster for the behemoth streaming service. What is presented, is an erratic trope marinated affair that skates by almost entirely on Gosling and Evans alone.Between gratuitous drone shots that perplex instead of thrill, and VFX that match the scene about as well as the average rushed marvel effects, the viewer is left with a hollow experience. Where its well established contemporaries in ""Mission Impossible"" and ""John Wick"" ride on its lead while shuffling you through plot points between globe trotting adventures all in the service of completing some main goal, ""The Gray Man"" convulses every time it has to be reminded of a plot, or that its a movie at all. Only a compelling action film of the highest calibre would stop dead in its tracks manga/anime style to produce a ""2 years earlier"" flashback to explain character motivation that should have been presupposed. The difference here is that a mangaka can't unrelease a chapter and go back to fix a plothole or heighten drama. Yet a massive film of this scale should have the writing foresight to explain how a man with zero attachments to humanity, would suddenly care about a child with a literal plot device strapped to it.There in lies the problem. This movie is so concerned with its globe hopping, cutty action and nauseating drone shots it forgot it had (expletive) RYAN (expletive) GOSLING AND (expletive) CHRIS (expletive) EVANS. Two modern action and acting tent poles, who ooze charisma every second they're on screen. Dying to have a showdown against the other. What saves this otherwise pathetic attempt at copying the bond/MI/wick formula is the (somehow not irritating) quip layered dialogue and stellar scene chewing. One can't help but imagine what this movie could have been if you just put these two in the middle of a mall and gave them enough firepower to invade a small country and just left the camera rolling. Doesn't that sound like a better use of 2 hours?What ""The Gray Man"" ultimately serves up is a gray burger with a side of gray fries. At some point the fatigue of Gosling and the wickedness of Evans is just dripping off the screen. But the movie almost goes out of its way to ignore it. Going so far as to turn a final confrontation into a cop-out which, even by this movie's braindead standards, stretches the security of an underground military prison to incredible lengths of disbelief.Its honestly too bad because there is enjoyment to be had, but the Russo's malpractice is enough to warrant this film getting grayed out on my netflix list.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Before the rant the action sequence is one of the best shootout action scenes I've seen. In fact there are a couple of great action sequences and settings.Ryan gosling plays the leading action hero well. Same character he does every movie really, man of few words etc. Chris Evans tries something different and plays a by the numbers psychopath. I didn't find it that good. Chris Evans should have retired after avengers or at least got rid of his Twitter. The rest of the cast vary. Ana de Armas is the least convincing action heroine I've ever seen, she couldn't beat up the guy at the fish and chip shop, let alone anyone else in this film. The rest of the cast are solid except Rege Jean Page who's quite excellent as a conniving CIA riser. However his character represents one of the films biggest flaws - because this is 2022 with current political context we know how this will go.Firstly ofcourse as an evil black man he has to be super smart at least -in fact all people of colour are represented ridiculously. MINOR SPOILERS ALERT - in fact the only characters who you see die in this film are white guys. I'm not even kidding -watch it. It's a bit ridiculous. It even gets more ridiculous when a hired Tamil killer, who shoots cops without hesitation all of a sudden has a problem when a girl is going to be killed. Come on. Coloured and female characters can be pure evil too. By Hollywood trying atone for the sins of the past it becomes predictable because you know what will happen.And finally I have to mention one of my great annoyances in the modern day cinema. The action montage over some old classic pop song. This has been done over and over again and it's sucks. Stop it Hollywood.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It tries to add complexity to the story but it just dilutes the entire experience. Less is more, Russo brothers, less is more.In addition to that, since the movie tries to take itself seriously, it is undercut by the movie's cheesy dialogue. Each character (including a secluded young girl) has quippy one-liners.With all that being said, one must appreciate the effort they put into the action scenes. Although they require a heavy suspension of disbelief, the scenes are creative. Especially obvious within the opening sequence, they try to make the action scenes pretty with lighting.Unfortunately though, I just do not care for what's going on. I'm certain people will enjoy the movie especially if they're looking for something to enjoy without thinking much about. This movie just isn't for me.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Because it didn't feel like that at all cuz of the very basic and simple plot and characterization.While this wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen, it wasn't that memorable or great either, but you will have a decent time for 2 hours nonetheless.So I was semi-optimistic about this movie before the trailer dropped because the two writers of my top 4 favorite MCU movies were working with the Russo brothers again. I didn't watch Cherry because of the horrible reviews and I thought ""Well, seems like Russos are not that great of directors and they should stick to superhero movies"". Then the trailer dropped and it didn't impress me at all. And now that I watched it, it looks like the writers too should stick to writing for MCU movies, because A: This wasn't that great at all, and B: They were the most decent writers of MCU, and maybe they could save phase 4 from what it is now.This movie just didn't have that much of a good plot or characters and characterization and pretty much everything was cliché. The dialogue might be the worst thing about this movie for me. I understand now why people think MCU dialogue is awful and written for children. I don't know if the intention with all the quippy dialogue in this movie was for comedy or not, because I didn't smile once at those weird out-of-place ""marvel-y"" dialogue which made the movie less serious and mature than it tried to be.The camerawork and cinematography for the most part, aside from the action scenes that are the most important part of this movie, were decent, albeit a little dramatic with the drone shots. The worst offender of the bad hand-to-hand action cinematography was the free fall scene. I didn't know what was happening, everything was dark and the camerawork was awful. Same with most of the hand-to-hand fight scenes of the movie aside from the last part. It was just uninspired and uninteresting. John Wick's director and cinematographer know how to shoot an action scene where the audience actually sees what's happening, but apparently, and surprisingly, Russos didn't really put much thought into it, and I say surprisingly because their Captain America movies had good action choreography and cinematography.The acting from everyone is pretty decent for what they're given to work with, and Ryan Gosling is Ryan Gosling in this movie. His character would've benefited a lot from not having all the quippy and stupid and childish dialogue.The plot is really really basic and there's not much nuance and layers into it and it's not something you haven't seen before. They just throw you into the middle of it with not much of establishing the characters, character relationship (between Six and Fitzroy), and the organization that much, which worked in The Bourne Identity (it was the literal plot), but doesn't work here.They also try to give some - very clichéd - backstory and characterization to The Gray Man in just 2 or 3 very brief flashbacks, but imagine my shock when it didn't work, and pretty much every characterization in this movie is just subpar. His relationship with the girl is developed pretty decently but it's not that good and after 2 hours of watching this movie, you don't care about pretty much anyone.Chris Evans has a pretty fresh and new kind of role, that is if you haven't seen other movies of him other than his Captain America ones. I gotta say I'm disappointed with this one too because his character is just another psychopath murderer with a lot of manpower and there's not much more into him. Maybe if another director, say Cohens or Tarantino made this movie, his character would've become an iconic villain, but as it is, he is another clichéd bad guy and that's it.The music was also mediocre as I don't even remember one beat from it after the movie, just your average generic action movie music.So pretty much every aspect of this movie is mediocre and clichéd, I've seen worse and this review might look like all complaints and no praise, but the movie is not that bad and it is really well-made, the directors and the writers are not amateurs and they are decent, I just wish they had done more than this.I also haven't read the book, and I'm assuming the book has a better characterization and plot development, but I'm sure if I had read the book and liked it, I would've given this a lower rating, but without reading the book, it's a 5 for me.This movie would've benefited from good action choreography and Especially, with a capital E, good action cinematography which it, unfortunately, didn't have. John Wick also had a really simple revenge story, but it was the great action, choreography, and cinematography that made it what it is now. Everyone in the world knows who John Wick is, nobody will remember who The Gray Man and Six was next week.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I expected ""Black Hawk Down"" but got ""Get Smart"" instead. I've read all of Mark Greaney's Court Gentry novels. I can't believe anyone affiliated with this film read a single one, as it bears no resemblance to the author's stellar work.The actual Gray Man - Court Gentry of Greaney's novels - is a stoic, hard-ass operator, working to overcome realistic challenges. That story could be told on film in an exciting and captivating way, but for some reason, this movie sets out to spin an altogether different tale. The lead character in the film is a bumbling, smart-ass ""spy"" who lucks his way into prevailing over a variety of fantastic and increasingly unbelievable scenarios. The dialogue and action scenes are peppered with throwaway humor and slapstick which aren't characteristic of Gentry. The limited plot/backstory introduced in the film doesn't align with the Gray Man story: Six wasn't in prison for the reason depicted; ""Sierra"" doesn't exist as the film portrays it; etc.I almost wonder if the screenwriter accidentally read Gregg Hurwitz's ""Orphan X"" novels and adapted that to cinema by mistake. The movie has more in common with that series of novels than with Greaney's.This film would be fine as a stand-alone goofy action movie with any other title. But it's not The Gray Man, and its use of that title does a huge disservice to Greaney's readers. If you're looking for a realistic thriller to match the novels, don't waste your time here.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Who would work for such a person?)There's a special bonus for people familiar with Europe at least a bit. It's pretty usual that one city is used to represent others (Prague in this one), and I'm ok with this, although I had no problems to recognize this, but why did the director think cities are located next to each other. You can't just hop in a car in Berlin and be in Vienna in an hour, you would not complete the journey from Prague to Croatia in the same evening. The bonus is 'croatian' castle being French and guards speaking French there, does it mean that Americans think French sounds like Croatian or what was the point.By noticing these kind of details you can see how interested I was in the whole story.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Littered with explosions, sneak attacks, gun (and knife) fights, car chases, narrow escapes and vengeful CIA agents, the movie feels like an homage to the spy-action genre from the early 2000s (Jason Bourne, looking at you).While 'Gray' should be entertaining on paper, it's a colossal mess on screen. The story feels a quarter-baked, if that, with lots of room for stage-setting and character development. Just because you have two bankable leads and pit them against each other doesn't mean everything else will fall into place. At times, it feels like the writers wanted viewers to play a drinking game every time a scene took place in another city, which very much gives 'Fast and Furious' vibes. It's so hard to keep score of what's going on at any given point.Aside from the Gosling and Evans show, supporting performances from Ana de Armas, Jessica Henwick and Julia Butters are mostly good, but are lost in the chaos that they're trapped in. There are also plenty of one liners that are painfully cheesy (most of which come from Evans), and his character feels completely out of place in the context of the film's events.Yes, it's a wild adrenaline rush, but 'The Gray Man' feels as unoriginal as it does unwieldy.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

With the kind of talent on-board both on screen and behind it, one just anticipates better plotting, characters worth caring for, and set-pieces necessitated by the script. What holds the film up to some extent is the charisma of its ensemble. Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans are having fun, while Ana de Armas once again proves that she can hold her own in action-spy-thrillers, and Dhanush in a sort of extended cameo, is tremendous.The wafer-thin plot and characterization struggle to make us get behind the success (and survival) of its leads, and it almost feels like the Russos gave up on the emotional front and strictly focused on making the film seem like it warranted its $200 million budget. The Gray Man falls into the lower tier of action thrillers that are loud, over-the-top, and messy, leaving little in the way of original storytelling. I'm tired of mercenary/assassin plots where the agency turns on one of their own and it's a sorry excuse to just blow buildings (and even entire cities) up. The Russos and their writers (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) can do infinitely better. I mean, these are the guys who made the MCU unmissable in the 2010s.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Because even an action file might stand up from the simply mindless formulaic entertainment and explosions. And I'm always ready to applaud a movie for good music alone. Things that even low budget movies can pull off you know. This time the movie budget was apparently spent on something complete else: when the gear shift changes to action we've simply got more and more of uninteresting explosions, car crashes, ridiculous escape jumps, and mind numbing shooting and boring hand to hand fights that make decades old Bond movies look cultural heritage status worthy.Perhaps, with only a 25% of the budget, the director could've been been forced to concentrate on something more original and interesting.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The gray man confirms this trend and shows impressively what went wrong with Netflix's approach to providing the content at all costs - regardless of the project's creative potential. Besides terrible CGI, missing scene geography in the action elements, and a ridiculous plot, we can spot another missed chance for the Russo brothers to show and confirm what we saw in Avengers: Infinity War. An organizational masterpiece and the establishment of the MCU's first and only interesting villain. The only silver lining was Ryan Gosling, who brought a little gravity to the actors' performances.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plot is wafer thin, the characters cardboard cut-outs from the 'lone agent' shop, and the action shots are a mish-mash of dubious CGI, distracting flash bangs and loud sound effects. There is obviously an audience for this nonsense - I'm guessing those who like to play shoot-em-up video games.

Not Billy Bob Thornton's or Ryan Gosling's finest moment - but one assumes they have to eat like everyone else.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

We all know the stories for action movies, they're not original, we're there for the adrenaline fuelled car chases, explosions, and gun fights, so make them at least.A seen-it-all-before story elevated by hot-right-now cast, leaves a typically bland after taste with zero rewatchability. Apparently there is a R-rated version which Netflix chopped down to make it accessible! Why?! As is typical of studios, they tried to be brave and bottled it at the last hurdle.

Those three actors in an action spy thriller. What could go wrong? Everything. Ana de Armas undercuts Gosling with her best Rambo impression. She's too short, petite and delicate for action films. I loved her in Bladerunner2049 and Knock Knock. I didn't like her here. Charlize Theron (Atomic Blonde), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Kate Beckinsale (Underworld), Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) off the top of my head, are believable in action roles. They look strong enough to handle themselves and they have weaknesses and strengths. In the Gray Man, Ana de Armas is invincible and unconvincing as anything action. An irritating 12-year old who doesn't talk, act, or react like a 12-year old undercuts Billy Bob Thornton and Gosling scenes. I saved the worst for last - Jessica Henwick or Hendrick or the actress that ruined Iron Fist for me. She is painfully unlikable and her acting is lacking. She's one-note for me: Angry. She undercuts what would have been an enjoyable Chris Evans' performance. When is Hollywood's disdain for all things masculine going to stop? It's ruining the movie experience. Two men can't even fight to the death without a strong female character stopping it. And don't get me started on how men are portrayed since about 2016 - weak or goofy or pathetic or apologetic or inferior. It's played out, predictable and boring like The Gray Man.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The set up was interesting (though bringing in the little girl from American Housewife, moved the movie into the schlock category cause you could see the plot from 10 miles away), but by the third act, I didn't care anymore since the movie devolved into the formulaic action movie wrap-up.Gosling broods, Evans is a cartoon character of a villain. I can't believe Netflix spent $200 mil on this. Maybe they should consult Amazon on how they knock it out of the park with Jack Reacher or The Boys.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","5.5 Interesting Story, Mehhhhh acting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8414572/?ref_=tt_urv","racheldennae","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur130399889/?ref_=tt_urv","8 August 2022","The reason I give this the extra .5 is because I adore Ryan Gosling's dry sense of humor. The sad thing about this film is the same thing I seem to be saying about most movies these days, sooo much potential with very little return. Ryan Gosling was wonderful as the still-tender-hearted-yet-hardened-criminal-turned-government-pawn and his relationship with his mentor's niece, Claire, is endearing and added to the story for me. Billy Bob is sort of who he always is, and we like him that way: just tough enough, smart enough, and clever enough to be a great co-star. Alfre Woodard makes a nice, albeit brief, appearance and rounds out our veteran list of spies. To be honest, I think I would have preferred the movie being based on these three characters instead of the atrocious b-list cast they had in the main part of the story. The head ""bad guy"" is a TERRIBLE actor and has no notable traits. So forgettable, I won't remember his face in a week. His cohort, the Elizabeth Olsen lookalike with the BAD haircut and mediocre emotional range is a small step up, but barely. Chris Evans is sleezy and predictable, and his character has zero depth. He is predictably vulgar and much like his character's favorite line in the movie: ""Boring!""The action was almost non-stop, and while some movies require this sort of continuous build, I felt like every action scene had the same tone: bigger, louder, faster. There weren't many breaks to digest what just happened or to feel the story actually developing in a cerebral way. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of cult classic action hits like Die Hard, but when you're telling a story, you have to slow down every so often to include a little bit of story development, and I feel this movie just had very little of that. I found myself just wanting more of the character interactions with the good characters such as Ryan, Billy Bob, and Ana De Armas. I haven't mentioned her until now because when all is said and done, her character played a very small part. I think she's an excellent actress and her and Ryan Gosling were the main draw for me in this film. I just feel as though so much more could have been done. If you counted up her lines, there are realistically probably very few. Throw out Denny Carmichael (barf), and Suzanne-whatever-her-name-is (yawn), come up with a better villain than Captain America goes vulgarevil, add a few more character development and plot enrichening moments and I felt like it would have been an 8 out of 10. Oh, and give it a rest with the ""Boss"" that's so terrifying he never shows his face. Gimme a break, sooo lazy.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The casting is all wrong. For starters, Ryan Gosling doesn't look tough at all with a poker face. It just seems like he is struggling to remember his lines. Chris Evans makes a laughable villain, especially with his moustache. Half way through the movie he transforms into shot-caller from a CIA assassin. You can't help but wonder if the director forgot what Evans' role was supposed to be. Regé-Jean Page is anything but a menacing CIA shot-caller. Billy Bob Thornton is the only saving grace in this movie. The dialogues are laughable: Evans childishly orders his team ""kill him dead"". After his team spectacularly fails to catch Gosling, he says, ""what I can do can't be taught."" The action sequences will make you yawn despite the numerous explosions packed into one movie. All this makes you ask the $200 mil question: where exactly was the money spent?Without the wittiness, Gray Man doesn't even pass off as a parody of Jason Bourne movies. It is just a B-grade movie with A-List actors.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

In a film that generally keeps it light, there is an unnecessarily graphic torture scene, and unpleasant scenes of the physical abuse of children. The highly unsatisfying ending gives the impression the producers, with considerable hubris, are hoping for a sequel. I hope that Netflix exercise some quality control and ensure this over long, over wrought mishap of a movie is never repeated.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It felt like they heard of the project half a year before shooting and somehow managed to get this done and over with. They are for sure not taking this as serious as their other major films they have played in and which made them superstars.BTW: the fighting scenes with Ryan G. Were horrible to watch, the movements were slow and it looked like a seasoned actor was allowed to give his best shots again.The Plot: Weak, too hectic (jumping from one exotic place to another), lack of details for proper character development and empathy, trying to copy things from other movies, boring - unless you are 7 years old and this is the fifth action movie you have seen in your life.Cinematography: Good.Overall: This $200mio production is beefed up with top cast (most likely consuming 50% of the costs) and just shows how easy it is to sell some names to Netflix. This would have flopped in the cinemas. It's a money grab for the actors involved, but not something they should be proud....even though, often you cannot blame the actors but rather the producers and director for how things turned out- yet given the experience of Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans alone, they could have steered this at least into a cooler flick with some nice moments that were not as dull as every single second of this film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Maybe this time I'll finally feel like I'm getting my money's worth from a Netflix Original action flick!"", and then it's just more braindead coreography, utter suspension of disbelief, and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of absolutely TERRIBLE ideas for sequences that fall directly into the ""far-fetched and ridiculous"" category that only appeases the super-braindead who literally don't give a crap what they watch whatsoever. It's garbage. Avoid it unless you just want to see one shot of Ryan Gosling's abs. There's literally nothing else worth seeing, particularly that you haven't already seen several times already in other Netflix Original action flicks. R. I.

It's just action for the sake of action. In the case of The Gray Man, less is certainly more. I never felt any attachment or fear for 6 because we literally know nothing about him except that he's being hunted.The book this movie is based off of goes deeper into each character and we should've had more of that and a lot less fighting.

The story features all the classic tropes that have been done hundreds of times before. Secret Agent that his hired to do off the book government assignments. But there is a betrayal and now the CIA is after him. Some loved one is kidnapped. A flash drive containing top secret information about the government conspiracy must be recovered. All the usual stuff for this type of action movie. But to the movie's credit, the Russo's seem to be aware that people know these story beats already, so they do their best to fast forward through a lot of the set up, so we can get to the fun stuff.The action is well helmed. Most actions scenes have a lot of perilous stuff going on, and the camera work balances all these elements well without giving their audience a headache. There are two action scenes that go beyond my suspension of disbelief and become Fast and Furious type nonsense. There is also one scene on a plane that becomes impossible to follow. But other than that, the Russo's still show their natural flair for action.Ryan Gosling as the titular Gray Man does a good job. I typically prefer my heroes to be a bit more human and vulnerable compared to the flawless super spy. But there is a charm to seeing someone who is just really good at their job. Chris Evans as the villain steals every scene he is in. He dials his performance to the right level of over the top. He is the type of guy that you love to hate. Ana de Amas continues do great, showing us what she could have done in the last Bond movie. There's also a kid in the movie, played by Julia Butters, she does fine as well. She does not overstay her welcome.Admittedly I am an easy mark for these spy action movies, so perhaps I am more forgiving than most. I thought the action comedy blend was handled better than recent Netflix projects like ""the Adam Project"". The dialogue felt natural and witty. The movie is well paced. All the actors do a good job in their role. Just some of the action is too over the top, the story is formulaic and the ending very unsatisfying.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Ethan Hunt / Tom Cruise? Whoever he's trying to one up, he missed the mark. The movie has almost no plot, no true characterization, nothing really at stake and worth the viewers empathy. They must have known that because they used a child to try and generate some oh! Dear! Please save the poor girl!! Gosling tries to play a tough character, smooth, suave, has a set of skills to rival-oh! Maybe Gosling is trying to imitate Brian Mills of Taken and HIS set of skills! Yeah!Nothing new here folks, or even remotely entertaining. Just more guns, explosives, chases, fights, lotta bad guys who are trying to be bad, really bad, but just don't pull it off. The psychopath bad guy is laughable-a real smart aleck. He's got a mouth all right, but I don't think anyone in the movie is really afraid of him.Well, if you're looking for something mindless that you can lull yourself to sleep with, give this a watch.

As an Indian, I was a little bit excited about Dhanush's role in the movie but even that wasn't considerable enough due to his less screen time. He hardly speaks 3 dialogues in this film. So to my fellow Indians, if you are watching this movie to relish Dhanush's performance, don't watch it. You don't wanna waste your time here like I did. Inspite of Netflix's extravagant expenditure on this movie and promotions, the plot didn't quite impress me.

Forget about reality needed for this genre to be suitable here. The same nonsense though, lifts this movie above avarege (in a good way) when it comes to the ""action"" part - as an action movie this one is better than most. Quite good, sharp dialogues, likable and quite interesting characters (as for the action movie, remember) brought to some life by Gosling, Evans, and de Armas, light and fun direction, nice locations, mediocre but passable CGI, bit of humour, quite intense editing, meticulous action inscenisation bringing to mind a bit gamedev way of thinking about camera movement.... aaaand completely absurd story (which, to be honest, COULD HAVE BEEN not so absurd, if done more seriously in the tone, without so much of the ""action"" ingredient).One thing I don't get though: who the hell green-lited the outro pre end credits animation stylised as a stillframe fly-trough between some kind of iron sculptures, statues of main characters. I mean... this is so horribly ugly - as for the concept itself (lame as lamest dumb moronic piece of crap) and for the realisation (vomit-provoking aesthetics here are quite frankly unprecedented even on the level of medicine simulation animations from the ugliest tv commercials) - that it just blows my mind how on earth somebody in production could have watched it and say ""yeah, I like it, done, thank you."" This. Is. Just. Unbelievably. Ugly. And nothing, I mean nothing can possibly explain the reason for choosing this garbage to be aired, while in reality it should not be shown to anybody besides mom of this 14 year old boy who must have made that. And if it's done not by him, but by a group of adults - welll... in that case their permission to TOUCH a computer should be revoked for life under the treath of instant death by a shark attack, detonation and hanging.

This film had a very basic concept, and was painfully average. It had some good elements but the story was very weak and unfortunately couldn't be saved by a brilliant cast.This film was mainly pretty impressive in terms of cinematography, it was a visually pleasing watch. There were some nice shots with a broad range of colours that caught my eye. However, some of the camerawork was a little goofy. The visual effects were unfortunately poor and the CGI was very disappointing considering this film's high budget.In terms of audio, this film was very basic and really lacked in a lot of areas. The score was nothing special and I feel no effort went into the sound design. The music used for the soundtrack was odd too, and very unfitting.The characters weren't well written and felt very dull, which was a shame because there were so many big and talented names. Ryan Gosling was likeable, however just felt like a rip-off John Wick with no originality. Also, I found Chris Evan's character to be incredibly unrealistic and goofy, I wasn't intimidated by him at all. This is a shame because Evans has proved himself to play a great villain, see Knives Out (2019). Alongside this, the dialogue was poor.The film was fast paced but structured in a confusing way with some unclear time jumps. Until the last 20 minutes, the tension wasn't effective and there was no driving force for the film making it drag. In addition, the fight scenes were basic too. However, I did really like the final fight scene and the very ending of the film, no matter how cheesy it was.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It should, if you have seen Jason Bourne, or for that matter, any other spy movie. This movie has plenty of action, but Ryan Gosling doesn't seem to up to the challenge. Also, the action scenes are poorly directed and criminally underlit. And there are misplaced flashbacks which ruin the flow of the movie. As for Chris Evans, he seems to be enjoying playing against type as the psychopathic ex-agent hired to get Ryan Gosling. Billy Bob Thornton is wasted as Gosling's superior.

Unfortunately the movie felt mostly like just another action film that was, at best, bits and pieces picked from several of the books. Many of the characters are here in name only, like Fitz, Denny or Suzanne, but not much more.And Court, in the books, is in the shadows, but not so much here. I'll agree that in the books he has some very impressive, almost unbelievable, acts of physical strength or stealth, but sadly it felt over the top here. I really wanted to like this more, and it was fun and fast paced, but if you're looking for the books, don't bother.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Not a second from the movie's whole duration would make you wanna nap. Action sequences are top-notch. Undoubtedly, Ryan Goslings and Chris Evans have given their all in playing out the characters and really getting into it. Wouldn't call it the best nor the most horrendously awful, it stands some in the middle between. The activities were stunning however the storyline has been somewhat immaculate. Despite the fact that I concur with the way that the closure was not fulfilling wherein we anticipated that the miscreant should be killed or in jail yet my own gut says that it was deliberately changed to something which no one would anticipate. Although Dhanush was there for 15 minutes in The Gray Man, it's all's the effect he left both as an entertainer and how his personality was outlined in the Netflix movie, coordinated by the Russo siblings, that made the biggest difference, holding his both in screen presence and activity before Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans and Ana de Armas.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Other standouts included CIA agent
Ana de Armas as Dani Miranda and assassin Dhanush as Avik San who was a pleasant surprise with his classy skills. Influences me to check out more work from Dhanush. While Billy Bob Thornton as Fitzroy and Alfre Woodard as Margaret Cahill were underutilized but provided great cameos. Development was sorely lacking and so many plot holes were skipped it made it hard to invest in the central characters which makes truly memorable action flicks.

As far as Chris Evans is concerned, his presence in a movie is an indication to avoid it. He confirmed this and shines in The Gray Man.The rest is an action sequence.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And love the Gray Man. Great idea for a franchise. Ryan Gosling is outstanding and fine to look at. Editing was seamless. Story held- weakest link but there is something to build on. I like it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","I enjoyed it...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9632898/?ref_=tt_urv","Racie-94284","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur177684673/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2024","I enjoyed it, I'll admit, despite the fact that a lot of it is up-itself violence. There isn't a great deal of meaningful character development, but I do think it is largely what it aims to be. Chris Evans' character is a good, creepy, probably more comical than intended villain.The characters are as a whole well-developed enough for the film this aims to be. The plot is interesting enough, albeit overdone and nothing novel, much of it is predictable, and nothing unexpected really happens. However, as a casual watch, it works fine, just don't expect too much from it. I went in hearing it was an amazing film, and it wasn't really, I wouldn't call it awful, but you should know what kind of thing you're watching.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Millions on SFX and 0,01 on the screenplay.Top Gun II was a great success not because if it's actions scenes, but because it touches your heart and moves you. To tears.We feel Mavericks remorse over the death of his buddy Goose, and we feel his wish to make it up to Gooses son. THAT is the center of the movie. That is what cinema is about. Emotions. Not action scenes for little children. Blow up half of prague, blow up all of it, we don't care.We are human beings and we want to see stories about other human beings, human beings that we care for. Yes, even in an action movie. In every genre. For this you need professional writers and not the Russo brothers.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

LOL....Fighting and bad ass Ana was good to..And Regé as a sociopath bad guy was also good...

"","","I would recommend those who love action sequences a lot.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8415685/?ref_=tt_urv","rubbersoul-26239","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur152371020/?ref_=tt_urv","8 August 2022","You might feel bad for what I will write but I enjoyed this film a lot and what I will write can be good points and bad points.I would say the story doesn't exist in this film in a good way and a bad way. Quite similar taste to the old spy action film ex. 'OO7' series. There're good people and bad people, they scramble for a mcGuffine.This film is directed by Russo brothers who had directed three films of MCU. They're quite good at the camera works of action scenes and I never got confused even this confusing actions.This film is an assortment of those actions. There were so many types of actions. Never ending action scenes constantly make your dopamine out. It was quite interesting to watch various actions but there wasn't excitement at the climax. I didn't like the story stops during those actions. I think 90 minutes is enough for this kind of entertainment/ amusement film.I like Chris Evans acting a bad guy rather than Captain America, Ana de Armas was cool and beautiful, and Ryan Gosling was machoer than I thought and was so cool. He never dies even stuck thousand of times. All casts were doing great job.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
