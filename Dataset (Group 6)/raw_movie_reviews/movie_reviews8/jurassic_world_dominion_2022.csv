"6","/10","They forgot why we loved Jurassic Park","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8229362/?ref_=tt_urv","josiahliljequist","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61114145/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2022","When I go to a Jurassic Park movie, I want something above all else-hyper realistic dinosaurs in cool environments, seeing them frolic in natural habitat, defend territory, battle other dinos for dominance, hunt humans, and the like. From the opening island scene with the brachiosaurus to the T-Rex reveal in the rainstorm, dinosaurs were front and center in the original Jurassic Park, inspiring a sense of grandeur and awe. The dinosaurs were what mattered, and everything else was peripheral-even the plot to get off the island. We all wanted another glimpse of the T-Rex, or were anxious to discover where the raptors were lurking.So that was the first one. Now in this sixth installment, not only are dinosaurs relegated to a commercialized product that's seen on every tv screen in the movie, but they're demoted below the humans, genetics, and even mutated locusts in terms of importance. In a two and a half hour movie, one would expect dinosaurs to fill almost half that time, and yet they pale in screen time comparison to all the human characters. Instead, the director tried to insert cameos of the legacy characters in forced interactions and honestly cringey dialogue, shifting the focus away from the real meaning in the Jurassic Park franchise-awe for dinosaurs. The wonder is now gone.I have given it six stars in respect for the franchise and the limited appearances of some of my favorite dinosaurs, but I'm sad to see that the director forgot what made Jurassic Park so special in the first place.","704 out of 826 found this helpful.

It wasn't glowing, but it was positive. Unfortunately, this is a mess. Others have already talked about the issues I have. Granted, this is an empty headed summer movie, it could still have been done with some serious thought. I was hanging in there throughout with a new dinosaur attack every three minutes, and velociraptors going at fifty miles per hour and not getting tired. Humans being assaulted time after time and yet showing no fatigue. I also didn't see a scratch on any of them. But the best of all was the promise made to a baby dinosaur and his mother that precluded saving the world from famine. Not to mentioned the coincidences of everyone showing up in just the right places. I still don't understand how they got into that facility so easily. The return of the original cast was not helpful other than Jeff Goldblum's sarcasm. Anyway, it's all been said. This is a poor movie.","398 out of 506 found this helpful.

"","","80% revisiting old characters and scenes, no real story, predictable action...it feels spiritless","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8207383/?ref_=tt_urv","sumtim3s00n","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6890624/?ref_=tt_urv","5 June 2022","This movie consists mostly of us watching previously known characters doing whatever theyre doing now, meandering nowhere plot wise, while getting in random tight spots . For some reason they believed fans want to see a repeat of 1st movie and its characters instead of a new quality story and interesting content. Also EVERY SINGLE tight spot they find themselves in with dinosaurs is same formula.Its always exactly as it has been in every Jurassic film. Big problem all of a sudden, slow moving dino watching someone or breathing around them, then dino gives chase, uff! They barely escaped but escape they did!It is so dull and predicatable.Meanwhile we meet two new types of characters, a) those who are just inherently evil b) those who do evil stuff but are really good and moral. You can tell them apart easily by looking at what theyre wearing and whether its a rich straight white guy.The story is dumb and their evil plan so on the nose it is humorous. Zero imagination when writing the script. The length of it fits on half a napkin.After 80% of the movie is finished and we have gone over the revisiting our ""favourite"" Jurassic characters and our classic Jurassic scenes phase, the predictable ending occurs.And you realize the movie was as a wonderful and full of quality content as a dino fart.","1,568 out of 1,848 found this helpful.

A Gigilomopoloposaurus??? - they just keep getting bigger (the dinosaurs AND the names).

Luckily the nostalgia nods were sprinkled throughout and mostly not forced. You can tell they tried to have some funny one-liners which fell flat a lot of the time. They need to take some notes from Marvel on those. The CGI and action was as good as you'd expect and offered favorable intensity. The story itself was somewhat lazy IMO.

Get your hat, Grant! Oh look, Nedry's old Barbasol can!).I'm betting that if the great Pete Postlethwaite had not passed away we would have gotten Roland Tembo rappelling from a helicopter to shoot an Oviraptor in the face.The movie is at least twenty minutes too long - Hollywood seems incapable to make a non-bloated blockbuster today, even Bond movies have the running time of The Thin Red Line - and it doesn't have a shred of the wit and intelligence of my beloved first Jurassic Park, but I did like a few set-pieces (the Therizinosaurus, the frozen lake...) and it's always nice to see the awesome Sam Neill back, so I guess the fan bait worked to an extent.6/10.","224 out of 333 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Flawed but lots of FUN","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8225895/?ref_=tt_urv","parksiet","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur73501762/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2022","""Jurassic World Dominion"" is a movie I genuinely don't know how to feel about. Parts of me really liked it, and other parts were very critical and disappointed in it. It's one I might have to see again to really firm up my opinion. Regardless... I had fun with this movie. I just want to make it clear it is nowhere near as bad as some people say it is; it's not perfect, but it is still lots of fun! However this is definitely the weakest in the ""Jurassic World"" trilogy, but I am someone who loved ""Jurassic World"" and for the most part really liked ""Fallen Kingdom"". I have to say, I did like this more than the original sequels to ""Jurassic Park"", and I thought this did serve as a nice finale to the series, even if it has changed substantially.I think my biggest issue here was how different it was from what I wanted and expected to see coming off the ending of ""Fallen Kingdom"", but I can't blame the movie for that. I feel like there were many more interesting stories that could've been told here, but what we got was okay. It just makes me want to see more from this world at this time, with the dinosaurs being out in the world it leaves a lot of potential stories open to be told! This story, however, was very poorly told. It was exceptionally weakly written, and was not compelling or interesting for much of the film. I normally get into films pretty easily, but it took me a good 45 minutes to get into this one. The script even felt like fan-fiction at times, and never really sold me on what was going on. The script has no emotion to it, the audience has no emotional connection to the characters (even the old ones) and I felt like I didn't really care what happened in multiple instances. The cloning problem... the locusts... Biosyn... it's just all sort of there... and the film is very much an overstuffed jumble of characters and plotlines.The most heinous crime however: the fact that this film normalizes dinosaurs being in the world. Because of this, we lose the awe and wonder of seeing dinosaurs alongside the characters, a feeling that has been present in every ""Jurassic"" film until now. Not only that, but we also lose the scare factor that makes these films so great. There's no suspense, no tension, just straight action. Every dinosaur scene doesn't feel as threatening as it should... and there's a moment in the finale that is a prime example of this. I also did not love the locusts plot... took way too much away from the dinosaurs. Like... this is a dinosaur movie right? In the (paraphrased) words of Ian Malcolm: Do you plan to have dinosaurs in your dinosaur movie? The script does not balance itself well either, the characters have no compelling drama or story and the dinosaurs don't either... it just feels hollow. Where are all the big ideas about genetic experimentation and natural consequences? I also found the film to be both too long and not long enough. There are way too many characters, and half are unnecessary, they just take up screen time. And one other thing... WHY WASN'T THE PROLOGUE IN THE FILM?! They released this great 5 minute sequence as advertising last year, saying it was the prologue to the film, and yet the movie instead starts with an abysmally executed ""last time on Jurassic World..."" kind of recap. Having the prologue in solves a whole ton of the issues I have with the film; it mirrors the end in interesting ways and sets up some conflicts, as well as shows an interesting scene that is mentioned multiple times throughout the film. Plus it's a much more entertaining way to begin the film.Okay... one more bad to go. Colin Trevorrow's direction. He genuinely did a terrible job here. It was so bland and had no style, it lost all Spielbergian charm he may have had when doing the first ""Jurassic World"". JA Bayona at least brought excellent gothic horror stylings to ""Fallen Kingdom"" which really made it feel horrific... and then we go to this bland, generic stuff. Nothing sticks out, it's just generic blockbuster filmmaking. Sure there are a few interesting visuals and a final montage that I love, but I'm sure under a different direction they would be even better.Now, you might be wondering: after all those criticisms, how did you still enjoy it? Well, despite it not being what I wanted and being a very flawed film, it was at least fun! I was entertained, there was some cool Dino stuff, some fun action set-pieces, and I loved that the production team committed to using more animatronics for the dinosaurs. It just helped make them feel more authentic! I also LOVED the return of the original cast, and was so happy to see they actually played major roles in the plot. Plus, the new cast from the current films wasn't half-bad either. I also loved how the human villain is technically from the first film, and there were some many great nods to the original ""Jurassic Park""! Speaking of the villain... Biosyn is literally an evil Apple, and Dodgson is literally an evil Tim Cook... right down to the look! I loved this sly critique of modern capitalist culture, and how many companies (especially in the tech sector) behave. There were also some really cool visual sequences, and the sound in this movie was great! I also loved Michael Giacchino's score! He did a lot of the heavy lifting for the emotion of the film, trying his best to make it resonate with music where the screenplay couldn't. And by god it worked! This score really did elevate so many moments for me, and used themes from all over!So while I do think this film is deeply flawed, I enjoyed it! I'm still not 100% sure how I feel about it, but I do know I liked it better than ""Jurassic Park 3""! I would definitely recommend seeing it, especially if you have enjoyed the rest of this franchise. I wouldn't even mind seeing more! There's still a ton of potential for future stories, and I think I would enjoy this even more knowing this is just the beginning of something new. While it is no ""Jurassic Park"", and definitely doesn't have suspense... it is a really fun action blockbuster! If you can get through the 1st act... the last 2/3 are a great time! I loved parts, but some didn't work for me, and yet I would still recommend checking it out! How could you say no to dinosaurs?","184 out of 296 found this helpful.

"3","/10","A generic, lifeless adventure movie that happens to have dinosaurs","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8222042/?ref_=tt_urv","FeastMode","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104603847/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2022","If I were to list out all the things this movie focuses on, dinosaurs would be fifth or sixth, behind multiple storylines that range from bland to useless. I'm baffled by how little focus is on dinosaurs. And I don't just mean they are barely onscreen. The original Jurassic Park barely had any for the first hour. But everything leading up to that, the story, dialogue and themes, were all focused on dinosaurs.That's not the case with Dominion. The majority of the storylines are tangentially related at best, completely unrelated at worst. Imagine watching Taken but Liam Neeson has to watch out for dinosaurs... that's one storyline. You could replace dinosaurs with any scary creatures and it would make little difference to the plot.On top of that, they did a poor job of balancing so many storylines with different characters. Or maybe it's because every single one is uninteresting. And the moment when the different characters come together falls completely flat. I compare it to Stranger Things, when the stories converge and the crew is finally together, those moments are so impactful and exciting. They feel earned and elevate everything after. In Dominion, you don't feel any kind of magic.Some parts were so bad they made me cringe or roll my eyes. But that wasn't the case for the majority of the movie. So why such a harsh score? Because this movie, which is the definition of a popcorn flick here to entertain us, is unbelievably boring. I had 8 hours of sleep last night and drank a Red Bull, yet I was struggling to stay awake. I had to un-recline.All of the action scenes are forgettable. Literally. It's only been a few hours and I can remember maybe a couple cool moments. And one thing I couldn't believe, the climax action sequence is straight-up copied from one of the previous movies. I won't say which one, but I'm baffled they went this route. It's even sadder when you realize it's worse than what it copied in every way.As for the dinosaur effects, at times the animatronic dinosaurs look like toys. And the CGI dinosaurs look a bit off. I don't think it's poor CGI but something about it doesn't feel right.I am so disappointed this is what they gave us for their self-proclaimed ""epic conclusion of the Jurassic era."" Especially after Fallen Kingdom left us with such an exciting cliffhanger, the chaos that awaits the people of the world when dinosaurs are unleashed upon them. That's not at all what we get.I loved the first Jurassic World. And while the second is highly flawed, it's still entertaining and filled with tension and suspense. I felt none of that with Dominion.

For every reason imaginable, I believed him. Where Fallen Kingdom ended, you had endless opportunity to explore the world with dinosaurs running amok and causing mayhem. Final shots of Fallen Kingdom included the T-Rex at a zoo, the Mosasaurus attacking surfers, a velociraptor overlooking a suburban California, and pterodactyls towering above a tourist-populated Las Vegas. It was all there; think The Lost World's San Diego epilogue but on a grander scale with more dinosaurs. Throw in the military, philosophical conversations regarding their eradication versus their survival, advance some more characters, and you have a bona fide fun summer blockbuster.This didn't happen.No matter what my actual opinion is of the film hereon out, I can't help but be letdown with disappointment that Trevorrow either deluded himself into believing this was the kind of conclusion that fans yearned for ala War for the Planet of the Apes (which has a much more compelling protagonist that makes it work despite its story misdirection) or J. A. Bayona pulled a Rian Johnson and put him in a corner with the concluding chapter that he had to rectify and had no actual written plan of his own. And it's not that there isn't a medium where this story doesn't work just fine. I can imagine the main plot elements being adapted from, say, a novelization or a comic series. Hell, there was even that Battle at Big Rock short that was done which could have told these elements on their own, or at the very least introduced them. Instead, they threw in extremely disjointed story bits for this final chapter that seemed to have no source of origin. They felt like they were the contrivance meant to unite our two character groups, and nothing more.Dominion starts off very okay. It shows that it can slow down, have a genuine heartbeat, provide pathos for the existence of our reptilian brethren, trot the globe to see how they have integrated (or not) with our species, and reintroduce characters new and old (with possible internal conflicts) to show how they would pave their globetrotting paths. They even fix some of the poorly written aspects of Fallen Kingdom such as maturing Franklin's character, giving better use to the laser-targeting attack system, and giving Maisie a more believable backstory. All of this is supported with fantastic animatronic work and much improved CGI blending with it. I thought the visuals were mostly a knockout and supported the onscreen setups.Not only that, but Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum kindled a similar flame to their interactions in JP1 and you sat forward to watch those moments. I caught myself smiling quite a few times during those exchanges. Jeff Goldblum was especially used well as he was able to inject entertainment and comedy through his dialogue where the film otherwise was flat with on its attempts. They were not small cameo appearances and served crucial roles to the film. You buy where they are in their lives, and even though TLW and JP3 are retconned the actors clearly tapped into those experiences for their performances to accentuate their statuses.Speaking of buy-in, I would have given this film a long leash on a lot of things they could have done or did with this movie. We hit the point where we can embrace the ridiculous in several places. Want to make Blue become Owen's pet and attack guard? Go right on ahead. Want to modernize the action and give our protagonists more ability and skill that you might see in the Fast & Furious franchise or with our human Marvel heroes? If the dinosaurs get their large share of the action as well, I'm on board (the Malta scene is a perfect example of this). Want to pay homage to the previous films as you conclude your franchise? That is what I expect. I also expect them to diversify this on a tonal level where need be as to not become too stale, and I think I was feeling that here. Hell, there is nearly a half-hour duration where not a single dinosaur is shown or brought up, and if it's in anticipation for what is to come while building character or story then I will let it play out.The problem really arose both when the movie decided to abandon the broad, peregrinating experience and confine its setting. Dominion is the saga's epic conclusion and did not need to put on this hat. This was a major rug pull from what was anticipated, and soured itself spending an excruciatingly long time on something that left little entertainment, tension, or dinosaurs. When they do show up, the moments become a little one-note. Our good guys have plot armor such as raptors that can run at vehicle speeds but can't catch up to running characters, or when they are cornered they just get roared at or ran/flown/swam past until they find their way out of the situation, or when they know they can stand around and trust that a carnivore won't eat them because reasons. Bryce Dallas Howard got the best/most suspenseful dino encounters at this stage of the film and they actually work extremely well, but for a near 150-minute movie these are few and far between, and for this franchise you really have to sit and ask yourself if there is a chance that she won't survive any of these instances.A lot of this could have been made better if our Rexy got some great moments, but even she was backdropped and upstaged too often to matter, or when she does come on screen it seems to be a rehashed occurrence from something of old. She looked and sounded good, though. I want to restate how good the dinosaurs actually looked here, and I want to commend the visual effects departments for what they were able to do in that department. If there was a niggle I'd have here, it would probably be in the weight of the raptor movement which felt too light and jittery. That probably only makes sense in my head, but the rest looked really good. If knowing that I would have to wait 21 years after 2001's Jurassic Park III to finally get the sequel with visuals that really soar, I would gladly take it. I just wish it was with a better film, or at least with a film that I would want to rewatch over and again. Instead, this left an aftertaste that makes me want to instead go and watch Top Gun: Maverick for a fourth time. Outside of demo material, I don't even know if I will be a completionist and get this on UHD a few months down the line. Normally one shouldn't fault a film for letting their own speculation become expectation, but in this particular instance I very much believe that you can. All signs and promotions hinted toward a different kind of movie and story, but despite the good parts it did have, this was too much of a misguided, ineffectual whimper.","591 out of 765 found this helpful.

Dinosaurs now roam the modern world and people have somewhat adjusted to that fact. For the most part, the apex predators have been rounded up and kept contained by special organizations. However, there has been quite the demand in the black market for dinosaurs of all kinds. Illegal breeding sites are everywhere.One of the organizations that prioritized rounding up the apex predator dinosaurs is Biosyn, a global leader in most every industry, from biological science, to engineering, to improving food crops. Biosyn has set up a sanctuary research facility (in the middle nowhere) where they house most every species of dinosaur on earth. There they study dinosaur dna in hopes of finding uses for all kinds of human diseases and deficiencies.Throughout the heartland of the U. S., an anomaly has begun to occur. Something has begun destroying crops everywhere,, with the exception of very specific crops (or shall I say,, specific crop producers). It has the scientific world baffled, and worried that if this continues the entire world's food supply
will disappear within a generation.One scientist in particular concerned with this anomaly is Ellie Settler, who is en route to visit the Biosyn research center and get some answers on what they are doing to combat these problems. Her only problem is needing someone that she trusts to back her up. So who can she call on but her old flame and partner in the game of science Alan Grant!Owen and Claire have retreated to Owen's cabin in hopes of keeping Maisie hidden from the world, knowing that certain people would do anything to get to her, study her, etc. Now 14 yrs old, Maisie is very much at odds with how she came to be in the world, and wonders who her mother (Christine Lockwood) really was. She's also very tired of being kept hidden from the world, and has a habit of wondering away from their homestead.Also,, Blue has set up a nest not too far from the cabin,, and has given birth,,,I don't want to say much more,, I will say
that I think the negative reviews are not completely deserved. Is the movie a groundbreaking, perfect example of a film? Well, no. Neither were the last two! Imo, it's fun, and I didn't see the direction they went in coming (at least not most of it). It's a straight 7 rating imo. I will also say that this needs to be the last (but we know how that goes).","45 out of 74 found this helpful.

There is no resolution for what the main question raised in the ending of the last movie- whether mankind can coexist with dinosaurs.Most of the sequences such as the Malta one, Claire ejecting from the plane thinking that wud be safer when they show her to be in more danger than the other two together, dodgson stopping their escape in the train and exposing his asset to dinosaurs in the mines, and Grant, Sattler and Malcolm acting so secretive to steal the DNA when you can't understand what wud happen if Dodgson caught them.Finally, apart from seeing Blue in the wild, none of the dinosaurs made any impact other than being props. It cud have been any creatures other than dinosaurs chasing these guys, and it would have made no difference.Finally, there was no scope for Chris Pratt in the movie to shine through.Disappointing script and useless antagonist- everything seemed contrived and unnatural; I still don't get why Claire fell into a rainforest while the other two fell on a frozen lake and still found Claire later.

And then the two new characters that nobody even knows basicly end up saving the day *puke* The ending, with the ""epic fight"" was really just epic cringe!.

The direction that was made by Colin Trevorrow, the same director ""Jurassic World"" of 2015, was also predictable and a bit boring at some moments, it was lacking that spark that the original Jurassic Park had. The interpretations of Sam Neill who played as Alan Grant, Laura Dern who played as Ellie Sattler and Jeff Goldblum who played as Ian Malcolm were good since there were plenty of nostalgic moments but not good enough to save this movie.

It completely abandons the theme and mood of the original trilogy, far worse than it's two predecessors. It just simply follows the same 60% to 40% action-comedy split that every major box office hit now has to follow. It's all written for the exact same audience and at this point I'd honestly rather have something genuinely awful than generic as long as it was original. That being said, I am just talking about the dialogue for the most part. The plot definitely exceeds expectations of failure and laziness, but honestly after the 146 minute run time I truly lack the energy to express my feelings towards it fully.

Probably the people that scored this film low, confused it with something else. It's a Jurassic World film, so go there to enjoy the cinematic experience, not with some unrealistic expectation of a complex story-telling and character development.Remember Michael Bay's Transformers movies? It's that much fun! It's got lots of dinosaurs (old and new ones), lots of fights/chases, lots of action, hell yeah! What more could you wish for?

Unfortunately, every entry after is never as good or even downright bad. Jurassic World Dominion is the final entry in the Jurassic World trilogy and the one that unites the cast of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World together. To see the return of the main trio from Jurassic Park was the biggest reason I was looking forward to this film. Does Jurassic World Dominion stick the landing or is it just a big pile of s#*%?One thing that the Jurassic World franchise has done better and better is the visuals. Jurassic World Dominion has no doubt the best visuals and cinematography of all the films so far. There are some pretty great shots of dinosaurs without a doubt. There are also some pretty fun action sequences. For example, in Malta where dinosaurs are chasing Chris Pratt and Bryce throughout the city. The part in Malta also explores the black market of Dinosaurs and that was pretty interesting. One pretty annoying issue with the Jurassic World franchise is the lack of animatronics but Dominion uses a lot of animatronics. I appreciated it as it made the Dinosaurs feel a bit more real when they were being interacted with.My biggest reason for watching was the OG cast and it was great seeing all of them together again. Laura Dern and Sam Neill are great together as Ellie Satler and Alan Grant respectively. Both of them don't phone it in and it feels like the same characters we last saw 21 years ago. My favourite is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm and he just steals every scene he is in. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard also return and they are fine. The movie introduces some new characters and one of them is Kayla played by DeWanda Wise. DeWanda is great and a real standout in the film thanks to her charismatic performance. Kayla ends up being a fun character to watch thanks to her coolness and natural reaction to all the craziness happening.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is very difficult to like. My biggest annoyance is the plot. There are two plot lines, one with Chris Pratt involving a kidnapping of Maisie (the clone daughter from the previous film) and another with the OG cast which just features them snooping around a big corporation. One of the plotlines is more exciting and interesting while also resulting in thrilling dinosaur action. The OG cast plotline is just so boring, goofy and just dumb. It's a shame that the OG cast was done dirty like that. The movie feels like two different movies shoved into one leading to two different stories with different tones. The main story also features this plot device concerning locusts and it's just really stupid.The movie also features a sort of new human villain in Dodgson played by Campbell Scott. I say sort of new because he is technically playing the same character that was briefly in the first Jurassic Park film albeit it's a different actor now. He is just a very underwhelming villain. He is just not that interesting or threatening. They also have a new dinosaur villain in the Giganotosaurus and it also sucks. It barely has any screen time and is not even as scary as any of the previous dinosaur villains. There is also another new character introduced called Ramsay played by Mamoudou Athie who I think does a good job in the role. What makes his character is his supposed relationship with Dodgson which is mentioned a couple of times. However, it is barely explored yet for some reason is put into the film like it is an emotional or important element and it was just baffling.Maisie returns from the previous film and has become incredibly unlikeable. I'm not a big fan of bratty kid characters, especially ones that cause the deaths of dozens of innocent people. Her character is written poorly and I do think the actress gives a pretty weak performance which doesn't help. The movie is also way too long with its runtime being 146 minutes. A majority of the runtime is just boring human stuff with maybe 15-20 minutes of some dinosaur stuff. The original Jurassic Park cast and the new Jurassic World cast don't even meet until the final act. Once they meet, it feels very anti-climatic and unnatural, it just sort of happens. I'm gutted that the movie wastes an interesting idea in exploring the consequences of dinosaurs being released into the world and how the world deals with it. Instead, this idea is just brushed over within the first 5 minutes. The film doesn't do anything original and just does dinosaurs on an island again! The movie doesn't even spend time dealing with the message that the film starts with which is can humans and dinosaurs coexist? The film just ends with this magically being answered and resolved with no explanation how?Overall, what a massive disappointment. While I didn't particularly enjoy Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), the movie ends on a fascinating note that could've made for an amazing 3rd film. Regrettably, Jurassic World Dominion ends up being more interested in being a cheap, cheesy, B movie action thrill and even then it doesn't do that great either. I'm devastated that the so-called Avengers of the Jurassic franchise is just a very mediocre and underwhelming dinosaur movie. I ended up feeling like it was time for this franchise to go extinct. As Ian once said, ""that's one big pile of s#*%"".","193 out of 267 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, both sets of actors are split up in two completely different stories that combine towards the climax and one of the stories ( The one with Neil, Dern and Goldblum) is ten times more interesting than the other one ( The one with Pratt and Howard). In fact, with a heavy rewrite and a better director at the helm, the story involving the original Jurassic Park characters would have a been a very good Jurassic Sequel on its own right. Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world, so we are stuck with a another bad Jurassic World sequel that does not know on what it wants to be .The story involving the original Jurassic Park cast is actual a very interesting one that involves corporate espionage and genetic engineering. A story on which if it had a stronger screenplay, a better director and a direct focus on what this series is really about , it would have been a great continuation of Michael Crichton's work and a great bookend to Steven Spielberg's first two Jurassic Park films (The original and it's only true and worthy sequel ""The Lost World""). Unfortunately under Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly dimwitted screenplay, the story only scratches the surface of the subject matter and is shoehorned to run parallel with the other story in this movie, which is not very thought out and is really pretty bad . Fortunately for the audience, the characters of Alan Grant , Ellie Sattler and Ian Malcolm are as endearing as ever and the actors are having a fun. Jeff Goldblum can read a phone book and make it interesting, intelligent, funny and entertaining. His character's sarcastic wit is so on point in certain scenes that you end up thinking that Jeff is trying to break the 4th wall to let the audience know on how he really feels about this movie. Sam Neill is great as well, making a welcome return to his character and he actually looks happy to be in this film ( A far cry from the tired performance he gave in the horrible ""Jurassic Park 3"" but who can blame him) and Lara Dern is as intelligent, spunky and sassy as ever. The charisma and chemistry of all three of the returning Jurassic Park actors more than make up for the half baked plot line they are working with.The same can't be said for the returning Jurassic World actors, whose plot line is a direct sequel to the events of the horrible ""Fallen Kingdom"" and it does not help that both Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard look disinterested in their roles. Pratt, who was a welcome addition in ""Jurassic World"" just looks tired and bored here and Howard, (who in my opinion had a harder character to play and that reason being is the fact that her character changes personalities from one film to the next ) looks ready to move on from this franchise. Their story involving the kidnapping of the clone child of ""Fallen Kingdom"" and Blue's own baby raptor is so bad that it's an anchor over the neck of this movie. Their story ends up as a bad rip off of the Jason Bourne series. You have shady bad guys, bad stereotypes, a unbelievable plane crash and a fight with dinosaurs in a city (Anybody who still crying over the T-Rex in San Diego in ""The Lost World"" should keep their mouths shut after they see this terrible sequence in this film). Not to mention the characters striking super hero poses in certain scenes, which makes this story impossible to take seriously. Fortunately or unfortunately if you think about it, the two parallel stories connect towards the climax and our heroes meet for the first time. Which is also eye opening because you can see how shallow the characters from ""Jurassic World"" are compared to the characters of ""Jurassic Park"". Not to mention the fact that the ""Park"" actors are making an effort to bring something to this mess while the ""World"" actors are just going through the motions.Which is a shame because Neil, Dern and Goldblum remind the audience on why the original Jurassic Park is such a class act and that was because it had great characters and great actors behind them. Unfortunately, not even their Herculean efforts can stop this film for being crushed by the weight of its own stupidity.","248 out of 348 found this helpful.

Absolutely horrible on ever level and a fundamental misunderstanding at what makes this saga so interesting. Trevorrow had no clue what he was doing with this movie. He was told to make the final film in a six movie saga and said to himself ""Hmm let's not focus on the dinosaurs in this FINAL FILM"". How do you not understand what people want to see these movies for. You need to actually focus on the dinosaurs or you are not gonna keep peoples attention and I feel that is what happened here. Instead the film focuses on giant locusts? Why is this so interesting that you need to sideline the dinosaurs for it. I didn't want to see an espionage story about kidnapping, locusts, and clones. I just want to see what the world would be like if dinosaurs took over which we don't see either. The main issue that happened in the previous film that CHANGED THE STATUS QUO is barely focused on besides a few scenes. It's baffling why they would do this. Not even the original cast can save this. Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill seem like they are having fun but the dialogue they are given is horrendous. The dialogue in general is bad but they got it the worst. The whole cast generally doesn't seem to be trying besides Neill and Goldblum. Everyone felt very low energy and if they didn't want to be there. The villain gave the worst performance in the film. They just let that guy spitball all these awkward lines and just didn't know when to say cut. The film feels relatively low stakes as well. It doesn't feel like a finale at all but more like a bad epilogue. Fallen Kingdom feels more like a finale than this and that movie is BAD. There isn't any build up to the final dinosaur battle as well. Apparently it was set up in the prologue that they released a year ago but they decided to cut it from the movie. They decide to cut the scene that shows the conflict between different species of dinosaur. Yeah great job guys. It doesn't help that this film is mindlessly boring as well and it doesn't deserve its 2 and a half hour runtime. This is a train wreck of a film that you shouldn't watch even if you like the original film. It's a waste of your money.","234 out of 329 found this helpful.

Jurassic World: Dominion is a soulless film, without a shred of understanding of the magic of the original. This made-for-its-own-good movie has no originality on its own terms, no respect for the fans of this once-grand dinosaur movie series, and not an ounce of artistic merit to the film genre. On top of that, this film is also dumb from start to finish and full of holes in the story. It's a good thing Trevorrow is also responsible for the screenplay and apparently spent years looking forward to this finale, because according to his own statements, he knew from the start to which end he wanted to lead the Jurassic World trilogy.The film begins by leaving out its own story plots from the last two films. For example, how the dinosaurs were able to spread across the planet is left out, or it is assumed that you accept that this is explained via the illegal and legalized trade in the animals. The dinosaur scenes at the beginning are quite nice, but ultimately just a two-minute montage of big dinosaur scenes. The animal rescue comes across as a naive idea in the context of the film and additionally as a silly attempt at a cross-reference to the actually problematic treatment of animals in our society. The character development of Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is just thrown at you, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is so on the mark in his already shallow and cliché-laden development that as a viewer you can definitely handle the fact that he is now foolishly riding horses, severing individual dinosaurs from their herd for ""rescue"". Secondary characters are introduced, only to be used as vehicles for the unfolding silly story without any depth of their own. The story surrounding the characters in the Jurassic World series quickly devolves into a globe-trotting, bad James Bond knock-off with a focus on the use of firearms, car chases and silly, superficial short cons. It goes to some Arabian countries, to a stupidly hidden black market for dinosaur goods, to a reservation of the company of ""Dogson!"". We've got Dodgson here"" - Dodgson (Campbell Scott), who for reasons not told somehow managed to become one of the biggest tech moguls in the world. Just as somehow, by the way, he has also managed to recover the nostalgic cream can of Dennis Nedry's dinosaur DNA theft and keep it on his shelf. Their story then just jumps from action scene to action scene, where the ""heroes"" of the story, staged in a very modern way, survive every adversity. Apart from gunshots and dinosaur attacks, they survive a plane crash, numerous accidents and explosions unharmed. This plot, which undercuts any suspense, also leads to no fear or adrenaline buildup at all around the characters, which should actually serve to help viewers identify with them. Trevorrow makes himself the king of despondency here and destroys the legacy of the original film and its two original and respectful sequels.By the way, the motivation for the cloned girl Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) is simply thrown overboard. Yes, that's how this trilogy was planned by the would-be visionary Trevorrow. Instead of the comprehensible cloning of the lost daughter, it is now the daughter herself who clones herself. The motivation, of course, is to save the world from disease and natural disasters. Oh, no, the motivation was the desire to save one's own new self from a deadly disease from which one suffers. Or was it? Didn't Trevorrow write a scene in which it's made clear that Lockwood didn't know about her disease when she cloned herself? Well, at least Trevorrow is so self-convinced that he doesn't care about consistency in the plot even in the context of just one film. The director and filmmaker never seems to have read an ethics book either, because the cloning action is consensually presented as a moral heroic act. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) would have to perceive this as a slap in the face, but what do the philosophical underpinnings of the original matter if a film is just poured on with cool sayings and action scenes without paying attention to the plot or the development of individual highlights in the film.The plot around the characters of the original resembles chicanery for the fans of the franchise. The dream team of Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), which worked so well, is suddenly a group consisting only of references to the grandiose start of the series, which becomes more insufferable, shallow and uninteresting by the minute. Their plot around the locust plague, which at least at the beginning seems like an interesting idea before it too is told into the barrel, is at least a tad better than the action movie scenes around Pratt and Howard. But again, it's overflowing with plot holes, dumb lines, and a dynamic between Grant and Sattler so unpleasant it could make you sick. Laura Dern, by the way, plays her role so badly that she makes Ellie Sattler the most unpleasant character in the film, but since her Star Wars appearance, she's been practiced at helping destroy classic franchises.BD Wong's character development, by the way, is among the dumbest in film history. From an over-motivated and morally disinterested character in Jurassic Park, to the self-convinced and morally still subterranean leader in Jurassic World, to the morally now completely disintegrated dinosaur trader from Fallen Kingdom, we now witness here a Henry Wu who at the beginning of the film is still responsible for a biblical-capitalist plague of locusts, but at the end of the film is sneaking through a cornfield like a reformed science hippie, enjoying the redemptive feeling of moral poise. Incredibly stupid.Unbelievably stupid is much else in this film as well. The overpopulation of different dinosaurs that you get to see for a few seconds attests to a lack of understanding of the magic of the original and a lack of appreciation for the genius of how the dino scenes were handled there. The sprinkling of modern wokeness is still within limits, but where it does appear it is, as you might expect, just plain silly. The waste of potential from the old films is obvious here. The Dilophosaurs are wasted, the Carnosaurs are so scary that a couple of betting-addicted dino-fight viewers just keep watching a dino-human fight while a few feet behind them the Carnosaurs wreak havoc. The Dimetrodon, which by the way are not dinosaurs, are barely shown, just as no dinosaur can be viewed even once with enough time and calm, instead they become animal horror creatures with nothing on them but brutal aggressiveness. In the end, there is yet another stupid dinosaur fight that seems like an even dumber copy of the stupid finale of the otherwise watchable first part of the Jurassic World trilogy. The T-Rex pretending to be dead is perhaps the dumbest dino scene in the entire franchise. Let's not forget that Dearing and Grady's love for their adopted daughter is so strong that they simply make the girl stand very, very close to a velociraptor at the end of the film, because Grady is, after all, friends with this primeval predator. In order to shoot such nonsense, one must have a completely narcissistic alienation from reality....
One could go on for a long time listing the numerous plotholes, stupidities and the impudent lack of understanding of what made the original so fantastic, but that would probably take readers of this review just as long as this bloated action nonsense has running time. But one thing needs to be mentioned: The recap of the plot and the outcome for the planet presented at the end of the film is over-politicized, naive, unscientific garbage that you can either laugh your head off at in cynical fashion or cry yourself to sleep in lonely despair over humanity. Dinosaurs coexisting in harmony with the rest of nature, triceratops performing their savannah march with elephants, geese flying fearlessly with pterodactyls, blue whales swimming in peace alongside a mosasaur, and herds of wild horses, mingling with other racing dinosaur herds are certainly realistic and the ultimate goal that a human race should have in the context of a specially created species extinction by genetically manipulating the evolutionary rhythm of Earth's history.As a conclusion, it remains to mention once again that Trevorrow could impressively prove his complete lack of cinematic understanding with this film and that Star Wars: The Last Jedi now has to share the Olympus of destroyed franchises with Jurassic World: Dominion. Nothing short of a disgrace to cinema history. Tragic.","324 out of 486 found this helpful.

But you should enjoy the movie for what it is it still had great characters and great dinosaur sequences so this movie is not bad you should have a fun time at the theater.","13 out of 20 found this helpful.

I love visual effect CGI Dinosaurs they make it super gorgeous but some of the Dinosaurs looks like a robot, kinda remind me of Star Wars monster. I love the cinematography looks super great and make the visual of the movie more beautiful, the story umm.. at the beginning of the movie the plot story was kinda weird but going to ending the story was getting better and better, some of the acting was like overacting? Idk it just look like not natural, and the pace to sometimes fine sometimes no. But ya this movie is still fun to watch.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

I do like the funny iconic trex walk, i find lots of scene here funny and laugh a lot because of this movie. Its done its purpose of recreation. The plot is so dramatic its amusing and funny.

Apparently the writers, producers and director think you can just stick any animal in any environment and it will thrive.They also think evolution works in months and a couple years and not tens and even hundreds of millions of years.I understand this is Sci first, but they're trying to make it believable, you CAN NOT have it both ways, pick a lane!Then you have the incredibly boring and dragged out plot. They literally might aswell just flipped us the finger at this point.Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life and the original cast should be ashamed of themselves for selling out dignity for a quick pay check.The reviews on this piece of trash are definitely accurate, I mean, how did they direct, edit and produce this, see the end result and be like ""yup, this is how a trilogy is supposed to end""?

The impossible notion that dinosuars are something that can be introduced to everyday life is what makes the film truly unique. Aswell as this, it removes the thrill of seeing the dinosaurs because we've become accustomed to them after multiple movies. It is difficult to keep the enthusiasm everyone held for the first film once you repeat the same formula again and again. As far as I'm concerned, they just about pulled it off. The only reason I managed to find a little enjoyment out of the movie was because I was surrounded by friends who were genuine cowards. Personally I wouldn't watch again, but I'm glad I did with the people I did.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

Sure it's nice that they're referencing the past movies in kind, but the lapses in logic, the annoying deus-ex machinas at play, the apparent brainlessness of some of the characters and the dinosaurs becoming part of Earth's everyday socioeconomic hemisphere: it was a wasted opportunity and felt like a misleading tease from Fallen Kingdom.There was potential here: uniting two generations of Jurassic Park casts, uniting the dinosaurs in their fight for survival, and maybe even showing the fallout of such a situation where dinosaurs now actually co-exist alongside people.The Jurassic franchise has definitely exhausted all possibilities at this point in time: but I think we KNOW Universal's are least considering another sequel to this 'conclusion'.What next? Jurassic Stars? Where they take the dinosaurs literally to outer-space or something? At least that'd provide some more ironic entertainment and become a midnight movie phenomenon.","208 out of 310 found this helpful.

I think they really twisted the nostalgia knife. Fallen kingdom was a mess. My mom asked me to go to this with her and I was hesident because it honestly looked pretty bad from the trailers and recent history. I went in with super low expectations and half way through this movie I wanted out. It was that bad. Lots of movies are subpar but I still usually want to see where it goes. It was obvious the writers and directors didn't care at all so why should I? Dumb, unrealistic and instead of one or two really well thought out and executed concepts it felt like they just tried 10-15 different movie ideas and just smashed them all into one hot mess of a film. I feel dirty to even have paid money to see this film. While I could name specific issues, you and I both don't have all day so I'll just leave it at that. 1 star.

The visuals are good, with the dinosaurs looking fantastic, and it's a real visual feast. The action, while maybe not the absolute best in the series, is still a blast and keeps things exciting. The performances are solid, with Isabella Sermon stepping up her game from the last film, and Jeff Goldblum adding a dose of humor. Plus, the nostalgia factor is pretty sweet, and the movie keeps a good pace to keep you entertained.However, the weak link here is the story. It's not terrible, but it doesn't quite live up to the potential set by the previous film. The villains are a letdown; they lack any real threat and are easily forgettable. The narrative can feel all over the place as it jumps around from one place to another. So, overall, it might be the most disappointing entry in the series, but it's definitely not the worst thanks to its strong visuals, fun action, solid performances, and that touch of nostalgia from the series.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Worst of all, in addition to being sloppily put together, is it's beyond derivitive. I honestly feel like I've seen the majority of these story tropes used in a vast catalog of other, much better films. Also, it has one of the worst villians I've seen put to screen. His acting and the dialogue for his character was about the equivilant of a 3 year old throwing a tantrum. Beyond annoying and even more unrealistic. The special FX weren't even anything awesome, just more of the same. However, I do have to give it up to the team that did the creature designs for the practical FX, those were more impressive.

"10","/10","🚨Genuine Review From A Long Time Fan🚨","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8224194/?ref_=tt_urv","zendoss","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66190056/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2022","I am just going to start this review off by stating this film is getting beyond too much hate. In fact a huge amount of the critiques are unfounded, inaccurate or hyprocritical. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it great? Maybe not. Is it bad or terrible, or as offensive as these 1/10 reviews would have you believe? No. It's good. Sure it has flaws, it definitely ain't perfect.However from a die hard super fan, who's seen all the films countless times, and the original Jurassic Park being my all time favourite, what I can say is that it was not anywhere close to what the critics or reviews would have you believe.Before I get into the rest, let me state this. The Rise of Skywalker has lines like ""They fly now!"" and somehow Palpatine has returned! IMDb rating? 6.5/10. Furious 7 has Dwayne Johnson rip a minigun off a drone and use it manually after driving a ambulance off a bridge to crash it. Paul Walker also drives a car through three sky scrapers. IMDB rating? 7.3/10. Black Panther, Shang Chi and numerous other MCU films have legit PS2 level CGI...did anyone see the opening sequence to Doctor Strange 2? Yep, 7.3/10, 7.4/10 & 7.3/10 respectively for those films.This film is currently sitting at 6/10 with only 10k votes, and IMDb tends to see things only drop. So my point is, does this film deserve all this hate, especially when you compare it to other films rated here? Well, no, it quite frankly is just unfair how many vague, brainless and cynical 1/10, 2/10 and 3/10 reviews are here. You don't have to like the film, but review fairly. This film, is at worst, mediocre. But I believe it's far more than that, both as a JP fan but also just as a crafted film.No Way Home, let's use that for comparison. Decent acting? Check. A long run time, fairly messy, yet fun script and story? Check. Some humor? Check. References and callbacks? Check. Return of some iconic characters, fan service and world building? Check. A decent score that probably uses a lot of old tracks from prior films? Check. Good cinematography? Check. Good CGI and practical effects?No, I'd say NWH is lacking there. And you know what? Dominion is near identical in every single category! Yet...NWH has 8.3/10 and Dominion has 6/10. You see the pattern here? This film is copping ridiculous amounts of hate. You don't have to be an award winning classic, an indie film or a Comic Book movie to be good.Jurassic World Dominion is completely faithful and respectful to the legacy of all the films, the franchise itself and Michael Critchon's work.It has beautiful cinematography, amazing CGI and awesome use of practical effects. It builds on the world and lore, and Giacchion's score is awesome as always. Grant feels like Grant. Ellie feels like Ellie. Malcolm feels like Malcolm. Owen and Claire are better than they've been, and Maisie (clone girl) is handled really well. The discourse around human cloning and the locust are straight out of Michael Critchon's work - Timeline, Micro, Westworld, Jurassic Park. Man playing god, manipulating nature and corporate greed.Dominion puts the dinosaurs back a seat and focuses on the humans - yet people complain? Everyone praises the minimal use of the dinosaurs in the original, and states it's about man's misuse of technology and character arcs, whether it be Alan or Hammond. This film does the same. Heck they even got Dogdson back, just like the novels!Does this film feature some wonky dialogue, some cheesy moments and plot conveniance? Sure. But it's not pure garbage.It's staggering how many people use the word ""dumb"". Yet...where is this film dumb? Like where, seriously? I LOVE the other films, but they for sure have dumb moments or moments where logic gone. But this film surprisingly doesn't! Every decision, whether it be by Owen, or Claire or Grant or whoever, is the logical choice. There's not even any suspend your belief stunts or plot armor. The characters just genuinely navigate the locations well. No dumb dino prices, no militarised hybrids, no stupid decisions leading to chaos.Heck people said they want less trained raptors and Blue, less ""Fast & Furious over the top action"", less Rexy saving the day, and more human content/character work.Well guess what? They gave us that. It's funny we have people saying too much dinosaurs then people saying not enough dinosaurs.What happened to being able to enjoy a summer block buster? This film is fun, enjoyable, nostalgic and true to it's roots. Half the negative reviews here don't even state any examples or evidence, they're just the typical ""Hollywood bad"" or ""sequel bad"". Don't get me wrong, I've hated plenty of films, but this film surely isn't any bit close to the current rating.My only real major gripes is despite the long run time and a huge cast, there weren't enough casualties (even for side characters) and that the prologue should've been kept to open the film.So in conclusion, please rate fairly, please don't be discouraged by reviews, and please form your own opinion. Love it? Great! Meh? Great! Hate it? Great! But don't just jump on the band wagon and don't straight up lie or pretend there's issues without evidence.My final score is, as a fan 9/10, as a film 7.5/10.","24 out of 35 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A bit too long, a bit too tired, yet a bit better than most people say.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8247191/?ref_=tt_urv","u3210","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30311416/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2022","If you watched this movie, then that probably means that you saw the two prequels, and most likely the original Jurassic Park trilogy. If this is the case, and you still hated this movie, then I have only one question: were your expectations on the appropriate level for this movie?There is plenty to hate and there is plenty to love too. Out of respect for the director, I gave this movie a 7, because as I saw, he clearly did his best, and attempted to improve on the previous movies. Of course, this didn't always work out...First, let's see what I thought was missing from the movie, or what I wish was missing. I think by far the biggest mistake the movie makes is that despite all the attempts to refresh the classic JP/JW formula, the movie sticks to most of the same beats from those movies, which really gives it a tired, samey feel. Even though there are some changes, it really is just more of the same most of the time, which could not be portrayed any better, than the obligatory last, big fight at the end. Yes, the fight is spiced up with some new stuff, but overall, it is just the one you've seen in the last movie... or the movie before that, or the movie before that, etc.Aside from these ""unskippable"" beats, there are a lot of jokes, that fall flat - the film must have had at least 50 jokes in it, and I remember laughing at three of those (I guess there were some chuckles too, but you are not going to the movies for chuckles).Throughout the movie some characters acted like they were pretty dumb, which took me out of the setting, and lastly, while most of the movie was technically sound, I did have a problem with the pacing here and there. Some scenes took way too long to build up to their climaxes, which weren't even that strong, and this made the movie kind of overstay its welcome.However, there were also plenty of good things, and I believe a lot of people just hate this movie for never being as good as the original JP trilogy. And while I think that's true, I can also appreciate the JW trilogy as it is - as a different trilogy, that takes place in the same world as JP. This is a more action-packed, less serious trilogy, but on its own it is fine (as far as blockbusters go).Now, that we accepted it as a different set of movies than the first three, let's see what was good about it!For one, everything you would expect was just as good, or even better than before. The visual effects, the sound design, the music (although it was too much sometimes, but I actually liked how it was not trying to nostalgia-bait me every second), these were all great. I also think they were at their most creative, when it came to the set pieces, places and action scenes. There was some real variety in here, which I really appreciate, and contrary to what most say, I didn't think they left the set pieces too quickly, because the movie did a great job at showing us (with aerial shots, for example), that they were connected.Another good thing, that you might not expect, was the characters and their interactions (aside from a new side character, who did nothing but drive and make bad jokes throughout the whole movie, which became boring, fast). The old and new crew all performed very well, and every single one of them had something to do, without it feeling forced, disconnected, or contrived. Well, aside from a certain scene, that didn't really had to happen like that, and most probably was just the way it was for nostalgia. This one scene didn't ruin it all for me though, and I liked how the characters behaved like themselves, without it becoming exhaustingly similar to the previous films, and without them being someone who barely resembles them (looking at you, Star Wars).Okay, now take a deep breath and bear with me, because what I'm about to say might shock you... I actually liked where they took the story. I know, crazy! But to me it matters a lot, that the story stepped out of the boundaries of being ""just another Jurassic Park episode"". This is one of the things I meant, when I wrote that they did their best to create something that's not just mimicing a popular franchise. And while yes, it had a lot of the same story beats, it was still different enough, that I have to give credit for it. Of course the viewer has to keep in mind, that in the end this IS a new Jurassic World movie, and that there are some boundaries that it simply can not step out of. Still, the story of the girl, made the whole movie a little more personal, than just another ""big dino goes roar"" movie. It's certainly not groundbraking, but I think it added some depth to it, which was mostly missing from the previous two films. This accompanied with the good acting, fun character interactions and great sets, action and visuals, made for a very enjoyable experience for me.In short, my takeaway is that if you go into this movie with the right expectations, you can have a good time. This is not Jurassic Park, this is Jurassic World. It's bigger, prettier, shallow, but can be just as fun. It has several shortcomings, but this movie (not the previous ones) makes up for it with some extra care and creativity, which ultimately helps it become the best of the three JW movies. It's not great, but certainly a very enjoyable, slightly better than average blockbuster popcorn movie - but only if YOU allow it to be.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

This is a decent and amusing sequel , following the original premises of the Franchise created by Michael Chricton and Steven Spielberg , being written by Derek Connolly, Emily Carmichael and director Colin Trevorrow himself . As usual, here appears the ordinary monsters such as Brontosaurius , Triceratops , Gigantosaurius , the smaller but more intelligent flesh-eaters Velociraptors , Tyrannosaurus Rex, and other new astonishing creatures with special bloody skills . Basically, the plot is a pretext to allow the roles to be pursued through lush jungles in the fantastic location , as well as a breathtaking confrontation in the Byosin company .

As well as vibrant and rousing musical score by Michael Giacchino , including the classic Jurassic sounds from John Williams .The picture was professionally written and directed by filmmaker Colin Trevorrow .

From the opening few minutes the scene is set for a dumb, unimaginative, tension-free, forgettable and utterly wasteful film.The dinosaurs are either upstaged by insects or relegated to jump-scare caricatures constantly popping out of every dark corner when the movie needs them to.There is no attempt to build up tension, as exemplified in the very opening sequence when the sea monster from the previous film pops up again to zero effect. That opening lasts less than a minute but probably amounted to more than many indie films entire budget.Chris Pratt completes his journey from promising new screen presence to bland franchise prop and together with Bryce Dallas Howard, achieves some sort of record as least amount of on-screen chemistry between a couple.The old crew return but only to prove that decent actors capable of creating interesting on-screen relationships can be totally undermined by a terrible script and poor direction. Meanwhile, new additions to the cast such as Dewanda Wise, Mamoudie Athie and Campbell Scott are devoid of screen charisma, acting ability or anything interesting to contribute. Scott in particular is probably one of the most ineffectual and dull on-screen 'villians' I've ever seen.Every single minute contained something stupid, irritating or unintentionally funny.As just one example, the film begins with the cliche of an exposition News item - designed to get the viewer up to speed - in which the presenter informs the populace that dinosaurs are now a global phenonmenon and have been for quite some time.Stop for a moment and consider if a single dinosaur had really been resurrected in our world, does anybody think that in a 24 hour news culture combined with ubiquitous social media and internet access - that anybody capable of watching the news would be unaware of that fact?On top of this, we are informed that the global death toll attributed to dinosaurs is 37. A minute, you ask? No, 37 in a year. Presumably that's not including the entire ship that just got destroyed by our aforementioned jaws stand-in?In the past fifteen years, 74 people have been killed by cows - in the UK alone. Cows.Allosaurs, pterodactyls and T. Rex are roaming our natural habitat and less people are killed than by accidents with butter knives.Shame on you, Mr Spielberg, for endorsing this trash.","13 out of 16 found this helpful.

But now that I have seen it I can proudly say it was a good movie and ending to a franchise.But I will say this there is so much plot holes in this film so if your going to see it just for the plot you will come out really disappointed.

Ruining towns, attempts at domesticating, things like that. But no. Instead we get like a spy movie?Is it nice to see the old characters? Sure but because there are two groups on two completely separate ""missions"", it can feel lob sided and underdeveloped. Crisp Rat and BDH literally spend the whole movie journeying to their destination. That is there plot. ""Take plane....arrive at climax"". They may as well have not been there.Also the CGI just looked bad. It looks like cartoons. Like Dinosaur King.

Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Deering (Bryce Dallas Howard) are hiding Maisie from the world. Dinosaurs are roaming the world. Biosyn is a genetics company run by Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) and given the legal rights over them. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) suspects them of reviving an ancient locust which threatens the world food supply. She recruits a reluctant Alan Grant (Sam Neill) to help. They have Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) as their inside man.The franchise is trying to bring together the newer iteration with the original three. Filmmaker Colin Trevorrow seems to be in charge. His success rate is mixed. He has a tendency not to recognize when his films get into awkward positions. In this one, there is a lot of convenient coincidences. There is one section when I'm yelling at the characters to shoot. They have guns and I don't think dinosaurs are bulletproof. I question the world building exercise here. Some of it is silly. I don't mind bringing back the original three. I like continuing their stories and visiting old friends. There is a lot going on with the two sides and I wouldn't mind if they could be connected more smoothly. They only run into the other group because they are both coming after the company. Instead of turning Chris Pratt into Bourne Identity, they could identify Biosyn early on and zero in on Ian Malcolm as their way in. They could be the people to recruit Ellie and Alan. It's a more natural way to connect the two groups. While I love the idea of the locust, I don't understand why they got released. It's a messy movie. This is a lot. It's overloaded. Some of it is fun and I can hold on to that.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

In the first 10 minutes seeing Chris Pratt drag down a dinosaur by hand....when filming/editing don't they consider basic physics? It looked ridiculous and from then on I couldn't take the film seriously.2. Watching Laura Dern (an icon!) recreate the sunglasses removal from JP1 - just why?! Poorly thought out and executed.3. Bringing back the villain Dodgson from JP1 was genius...until you learn it is played by a different actor...who obviously didn't get the part from his acting skills.4. Making the film NOT about dinosaurs in the wild and more about rogue company BioSyn and giant bugs was a mistake...even Ellie Satler and Alan Grant could not inject interest into this boring spectacle.Overall not a good film and a poor addition to the JP franchise.A lot of Chris Pratt scenes against the green screens look very poorly executed (ie standing in front of Blue the velociraptor) and I didn't believe his character. His daughter in the film is poorly acted and annoying...Overall 2/10. Very disappointing. Just shows how hard it is so make an iconic film like the original JP and even the JP2 Lost World. Spielberg is incredibly talented and I hope he can share his filmmaking secrets so the future of cinema doesn't end up like the poorly acted, badly written, unnecessary movie Dominion. Had so much potential - very sad.","5 out of 5 found this helpful.

Dinos. The first hour had so many non-stop chases, that it was actually exhausting to watch. I'd have to stop and go do something. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Then back to the chase. If it had a motorcycle in it, it was Chris Pratt.There was one scene that was very much like the bar scene in Star Wars. So all the big movies now are ""borrowing"" from Star Wars. If Tom Cruise in Top Gun 2 could do it, then so could they. It'll be interesting to see how many more movies copy Star Wars.That said, one can only hope that if enough of us point out that we actually see their plagiarisms and call them on it, maybe we can get some original movies out of Hollywood.

Universal is claiming that Jurassic World: Dominion will be the last of the franchise, and that's probably for the best. They took the extra measure, as most franchises have done this day, of bringing back the original cast - Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum - for this last movie. Well, they credit at least for treating them well, unlike a certain other sci-fi franchise. This aside, Dominion is a thoroughly mediocre blockbuster that contains virtually nothing you've never seen before. Oddly enough, it really wasn't what I expected it to be, for better or for worse.Dominion is essentially two movies in one, with a common link. There's the OG cast going undercover at the BioSyn lab, and there's Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard trying to save Maisie from the corporation. The story with the originals isn't too special, but it was nice to see them, and they still acted like themselves. The plot with the new characters was something completely different. For a while, the movie essentially becomes Taken with dinosaurs. On one hand, it is a fun action scene. On the other hand, this is so far removed from the previous films that it's glaring. When they come together at the end and escape from dinos the old-fashioned way, it's entertaining.One thing this movie does really wrong is that it fails to deliver on the premise set up by Fallen Kingdom's ending. The ending of Fallen Kingdom has it that dinosaurs roam the entire world, not just Isla Nublar. Aside from the beginning and end of Dominion, you'd never know. The writing is bad. The characters don't feel like people, they feel more like tools to get the story going. On the other hand, there are some good things. The visual effects are noticeably improved from the first film, and Michael Giacchino delivered another solid score. Wu got a nice redemption arc. Dominion does have some interesting attributes, but it doesn't necessarily make it a good film. If this really is the end for this franchise, then it's been quite a run. Nothing comes close to the original in the end.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

So every sequel I have expected certain things or the story to explain more in the past park and characters. This film delivered on some of them but opened more questions. As an adult I wished the film was longer and certain things could be explained more but it felt like the studio made the director cut alot out for timing purposes to get more showing in the theatre. However this is still a good movie and I am lucky to have been a child when the first one game out and now being a father watched this with my two sons. They loved this movie saying it was the best. They loved the Dino action, they loved all the character returning and they wanted more and hoping for more jurassic films. This is a Dino movie and children love them. Ignore what the critics are saying and if you've got kids, go and see this movie. It's enjoyable and worth a watch.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

You can tell they tried really hard to make reference to the original movie here, which I appreciated and I enjoyed picking out Easter egg after Easter egg. Are there certain parts that don't make sense, yes, but it's Jurassic World, does any of it really make sense? Who cares, just bury the logic and enjoy the ride and have fun with it.With some great callbacks and final resolutions for some story arcs, it's worth a watch for any Jurassic fan!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Not the best Jurassic movie, but yet I liked it. I'm a big fan of Jurassic park and I was really happy when they announced the Jurassic world. My childhood came to life.For this movie, I knew it wasn't going to surprise me, but I wanted the end, I wanted to say goodbye to my beloved dinos. And even it wasn't the best, I was pretty satisfied. I think we got a lot of closures. Maisie's origin, much more dinos than ever, old actors back together and their own ""moment"" :D and I was really glad for Henry, he always wanted to do something incredible and most of time it didn't work, but this time he gets his redemption. Overall it's not the best but it did make my heart flutter one last time. Still loves the franchise and I hope for those who loved the original trilogy will find the same satisfactory like I did...Life always finds a way.... this time we were given coexisting world, when dinos live with us.

Now, I hope it loses itself.Jurassic World Dominion has its positives, namely the fantastic Legacy character's wonderful return and, well, that's it. I enjoyed their presence, especially Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum - the latter who had the best lines, as always. The rest...yeah, I sincerely hope this is the last Jurassic Anything.All throughout this movie, the word ""Dumb"" just kept popping up in my head. Dumb script. Dumb dialogue. Dumb luck with all the hilariously impossible coincidences. Too many Dumb references to this series and other Steven Spielberg classics. And the two Dumbest characters in the franchise are back: Clone Girl Maisie who hates all mankind for her decision in the last entry and that screaming boy, Franklin, though, THANK GOD, he doesn't scream in this one like all the scenes he ruined in the last one.With a huge missed opportunity to expand on the actual title of Jurassic World, this hopefully last chapter just has society dealing with dinos killing people and the economy while debating if they should be extinguished. But, never mind that, this series has always been around greed and the ineptest baddie of the franchise with the most hilariously bad security detail is up to no good and only our 1,500 heroes in this movie can stop him!While the second half is monstrously better than the first half, I still couldn't wait for this movie to be over. Sure, it's better than the two worst sequels: III and Fallen Kingdom, but not by much. Like the Terminator, this franchise should've stopped at #2 in The Lost World.The movie's absolutely boring, even with multiple action scenes and there are literally no stakes. In fact, I was always hoping throughout the first two acts, they'd have the balls to kill off any of the characters. As much as I would love to see the Legacy characters make it - forgetting about the new Jurassic World characters, never liked them much - at least the movie would've taken chances.I'm done with this series. Like Transformers 4 and Pirates of the Caribbean 4, even if they make another one (like they did with those franchises,) I won't be watching another one. This was just crap.***Final Thoughts: Easy listing of the Series. Hint: Only watch the 1st three listed below.1. Jurassic Park2. The Lost World: Jurassic Park3. Jurassic World97. Jurassic World Dominion98. Jurassic Park III99. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom.","172 out of 283 found this helpful.

Sure, I was thrilled to sit down and watch the 2022 movie ""Jurassic World Dominion"", as a conclusion to the movies. And I will say that the movie definitely was off with a bang.The storyline in ""Jurassic World Dominion"", as written by Emily Carmichael, Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly was a bit weak. And by that I mean it wasn't a rather wholesome or particularly profound and deep storyline here. It was essentially just taking the protagonists of the movie, which now included members of the original ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy, members of the ""Jurassic World"" trilogy and some new ones, and having them move from A to B while intercepted by a dangerous dinosaur, then move from B to C while intercepted by a dangerous dinosaur, and moving from C to D while intercepted by, and you guessed it, a dangerous dinosaur but also by oversized mutated locusts this time.The writers cater a lot to viewers of the original trilogy with lots of props and events that you can recognize if you have watched and enjoyed the first trilogy. And sure, it does work, but it just becomes a little bit tacky as the movie progresses. But at the same time it was also somewhat enjoyable to watch things again on the screen that was seen or done in other movies in the franchise, sort of the circling being completed in a way.Visually then ""Jurassic World Dominion"" was phenomenal. The special effects and CGI team really are working magic to brink the dinosaurs and the world to life. I enjoyed this CGI extravagance, and it is actually a major part of the movie. If a movie like ""Jurassic World Dominion"" had dubious CGI, it just wouldn't work. But luckily the CGI here is amazing to look at; pure eye-candy.The movie does have a good cast ensemble. It is a cast ensemble that unites the members of the original trilogy with those of the new trilogy; so you have Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum teaming up with Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Isabella Sermon. And the movie also have a wonderful appearance by BD Wong, and also by DeWanda Wise. I am not sure about whether or not I really liked Campbell Scott's part in the movie, sure I liked his performance, but the character was just too much something resembling Steve Jobs.""Jurassic World Dominion"" is a movie that is worth watching if you have enjoyed the five previous movies, of course it is. And it is entertaining enough for what it turns out to be. Sure, I wasn't expecting director Colin Trevorrow to re-invent the wheel here with this 2022 action adventure. If for nothing else, then watch ""Jurassic World Dominion"" for the special effects and CGI.The whole concept of humans and the wildlife of today's world coexisting with dinosaurs was just a bit far fetched for my liking. But hey, it looked good - and sappy - on the screen.My rating of ""Jurassic World Dominion"" lands on a solid six out of ten stars. It is definitely well worth the time.","14 out of 31 found this helpful.

Some of the visuals are great, epic, some scenes though....did they run out of time?Chris Pratt, didn't do it for me, the old cast tried, but it felt hollow.Like the dinosaurs themselves, this franchise should have been left in the past. 3/10.","93 out of 150 found this helpful.

The story is also not accurate in time. And the dolomites is a huge area. And yet the beasts can get inside in a short time. In short, the film has to rely on the dinosaurs, locations, humor, scary moments and good film images. The film survives that. Especially the scene with the water is beautifully filmed. But the bad guy isn't a bad guy and it won't work out. But it's like transformers. Dinosaurs save the movie.

Steven Spielberg created a sense of wonder with his great direction and some very good CGI and practical effects. It was very sispenful at times but mostly audiences lived the dinosaurs. The scene when we see the T-Rex is one of the great sequences in cinema. Since that first film in 1993 I have gone from not.liking the sequels to ultimately thinking that the franchise never could recreate what made the first film so special...None of the Jurassic Park or Jurassic World films are terrible but none of them hold a candle to the original film.When Jurassic World came out I liked it but it just seemed it wasn't that memorable. Fallen Kingdom came next and I just didn't like it.This new film is being sold as an epic conclusion and they brought back three of the main characters from the first film. So obviously they are selling nostalgia, which is fine and it's been done incessantly since The Force Awakens was so successful. If done right? It works. If not it seems like desperation. Here it is pretty flat. The inclusion of Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler, and Ian Malcolm is to me anti-climactic. Sam Neil, Laura Deen and Jeff Gold Blum are ok as these characters and but it just seems they were brought in for nostalgia and it doesn't work as much as it should. Even though the first film is beloved I don't consider these characters as beloved so it's nice to see them but it's like seeing Harrison Ford as Han in Episode 7. It's of course a fusing of the new characters from the old franchise and the new ones. Chris Pratt is fine as Owen and Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire are is ok too but nothing new happens with these characters.The dinosaurs of course are the reason to see these films and some scenes are really well done but again the sense of wonder is gone. The story is just the standard science for profit yarn mixed in with the kidnapping of the cloned girl from Fallen Kingdom. As with so many 3rd parts of a trilogy it is very overstuffed and feels unfocused fur the first half of the running time but once it gets going it does get fun. But like so many blockbusters these days you pretty much forget it by the time you leave the theater.Just average....Grade: C.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The threat from them was also non existent. I wanted to love this movie but simply could not.

I think the best action sequence was the scene in Malta. Well edited and amazing camera work. I loved DeWanda Wise, she gave a lot of flair to her performance. Absolutely loved to see the original 3 have a big part in the movie (Laura Dern cracks me up!). And Bryce Dallas Howard always puts on a great, scary performance.

It has been years since seeing the two 'Jurassic Park' sequels, but do remember not caring for them all that much at all (especially the third film). The first 'Jurassic World' was a lot of fun, though with flaws, and actually liked 'Fallen Kingdom' more than most while acknowledging that it had a lot of issues and that it wasn't great.'Jurassic World: Dominion' did sound interesting and was over the moon to see the original cast reuniting. Despite all of that, 'Jurassic World: Dominion' turned out to be a big disappointment and was something of an uncomfortable experience seeing it in the cinema. To me, it wasn't terrible and not as bad as has been said by some with some good things. But there are also a lot of faults that cannot be overlooked, even when taking the film for what it is and what it was aiming for.Beginning with the good, the scenery is absolutely beautiful and shot with a lot of slick style and atmosphere. There are some good action sequences here and some inventive stunt work, the whole Malta sequence is exhilarating and when the film finally shows some degree of energy. Also standing out in a good way is Claire's very tense horror film-like encounter with the dinosaur. The dinosaurs look absolutely great and show a lot of personality, the predatory ones being very creepy.Some of the performances are good, a wonderfully sarcastic Jeff Goldblum and DeWanda Wise stealing all their scenes. Also really enjoyed the chemistry between quietly charismatic Sam Neill and perky Laura Dern, that evoked a lot of nostalgia. The music score is suitably rousing.However, a lot is wrong here. The script is far too exposition heavy and tends to over-explain, shining only with Goldblum's sarcastic quips. Plus everything with ByoSen is incredibly heavy handed and says nothing illuminating or insightful about corruption. The film is much too long, half an hour could easily have been trimmed which would have been achieved if the story got going sooner and if the climax was shorter. It also drags quite badly, especially the very slight and dully paced first act and the climax does lack tension and felt dragged out, was actually feeling the minutes rather than being enthralled. The whole ByoSen subplot feels like a different film and a marginally more interesting but still heavy handed and convoluted one at that, a lot of the second half does not make sense and left more questions than answers. Wu's part could have been left out completely.Did feel overall that 'Jurassic World: Dominion' could have done with a lot more tension and suspense and quite frankly the later action sequences did leave me feel exhausted and felt too much visually and audibly. There is no heart, charm or soul here, neither are there any brains, which play completely second fiddle to the big and loud approach taken through. The other performances do not convince, Bryce Dallas Howard does her best but has too little to do while Chris Pratt's frequently out stretched do all the emoting. Isabella Ferman came over as annoying and BD Wong is too much in Dr George Huang mode which doesn't gel with the rest of the film.

It is a sixth installment. Those are usually terrible and enjoyed mostly by people who enjoy repetitiveness. We didn't get that vibe here. It felt like closing the circle with the iconic first movie. Perhaps people keep expecting another experience like in 1993, but that's impossible because that was the only time we were able to be vowed by a very first seemingly realistic look at dinosaurs. It was mind blowing. But that can never be recreated.Of course, this installment has no unexpected plot. If it did, THAT would actually kill the vibe. This movie is based on nostalgia, on the joy of getting the old trio of Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum back together and them meeting the Jurassic World leads.We were very pleasantly surprised and liked 6 better than 4 and 5.

The dinosaurs are barely in it and have little to no effect on the narrative, instead simply used for a few entertaining set pieces and then quickly forgotten.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are somehow given less depth the third time round, making their characters even more forgettable and bland. However, the original cast are obviously great and elevate the extremely weak material given to them.The music by Michael Giacchino is a huge letdown. It does nothing new and is simply content in repeating all the familiar tunes from previous ones but they're not even integrated well, almost always feeling random and out of place.However, the film looks nice overall with visuals that are a league above the average blockbuster. There is a lot of satisfying practicality when it comes to the dinosaurs which is really nice to see, even if some look cheap.","62 out of 104 found this helpful.

Bad acting, terrible script, bad CGI and stupid decisions (on and off the screen) cannot rely on nostalgia for a good film.1. Ellie is not as stupid as the film makes her out to be, as one of the characters signposts the fact that he is a double agent and she apparently doesn't pick up on it.2. Everyone seems to be phoning in their parts. They know the film will make money, so in their minds why bother I guess? The absolute worst culprit Campbell Scott who plays Dogson- I have no words. He's terrible and I can't tell if it's due to the script or he wasn't right for this part. It might be both. The original cast are awful- they don't seem enthusiastic to be there and I don't blame them.3. The plot makes no sense. After lengthy exposition opening the film we dive headfirst into one bad and nonsensical decision after another. For example, despite knowing that everyone is looking for her Maisie goes into town, despite being told not to, sees a dinosaur at a construction site then comes back. What was the point of this?! And this is just in the first 10 minutes- there are plenty more. Also, Owen is catching Parasaurolophus with a lasso on a horse, despite the fact that if the dinosaur spooks for any reason it will drag both him and the horse along for the ride? He was dragged from the horse already- surely he's learned his lesson?4. The callbacks to the original film take you out of the story. Instead of being subtle they practically scream ""notice me!""5. The CGI is bad and doesn't blend well with the puppets they clearly used in some scenes. I applaud the fact that they are going back to puppetry, but it needs to be seamless with the CGI.6. The script. Wow. Some of the lines are so cringeworthy I can't believe they made it into a Hollywood blockbuster. Just... wow.Do yourself a favour and watch the original Jurassic Park- pretend this one and Fallen Kingdom don't exist.","58 out of 98 found this helpful.

I could go into them and discuss them but that would mean I was putting more effort in than the screenwriters did.Since it's Hollywood in the 2020s, you know the good guys and bad guys based on facial hair and skin tone.

I readily admit that I have been a huge fan of this dinosaur franchise since the very beginning. Not all of the movies in the series have been as good as others, but I've still enjoyed each one. From Jurassic World architect and director Colin Trevorrow, Dominion takes place four years after Isla Nublar has been destroyed. Dinosaurs now live-and hunt-alongside humans all over the world. This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history's most fearsome creatures.Movie Review Mom GRADE: BTHINGS I LIKED:
I absolutely loved, loved, seeing the original cast members blend with the newer ones from the final trilogy. So fun! When Chris Pratt found out the old cast was returning, he excitedly claimed, ""Just in case you hadn't seen the news. It's finally happening. Get ready for what is absolutely, without a doubt going to be the biggest, baddest and best, movie of the franchise."" He also described this final episode like the Marvel ""Endgame"" of the Jurassic franchise.The cast includes Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Lauren Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill, BD Wong, Campbell Scott, Mamoudou Athie, Omar Sy, among others.There are plenty of action sequences. Chris Pratt dropped weight and gained muscles to be in sharp form and is still absolutely believable as the action hero in the movie.I loved that there was a plausible reason for bringing back a biologist and dinosaur expert in this movie.We're also introduced to some new characters.As filmmaking technology improves, the CGI of these movies gets more and more incredible. Even still, this addition to the franchise has even more animatronics than the last 2.There are a lot of respectful nods to the first movie, which made me so happy. Easter eggs abound in visual and spoken forms.We get to see a new kind of dinosaur called a ""Pyroraptor."" Fun! It was a real dinosaur recently discovered, but its size was supposedly smaller than a turkey.We get to travel to destinations around the world.It cracked me up when Jeff Goldblum's shirt was open and he said, ""Oh!"" ha ha He had some of the best lines of the movie, as always. There are a few moments worthy of a chuckle.Every dinosaur we know and love from the previous movies gets a decent amount of screen time.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The last time we saw Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant, they were good friends, so I was surprised when they didn't even hug each other when they were first reunited in this movie.I was surprised by the high number of bad editing moments.I'm sure I'm not the only Jeff Goldblum fan who wanted a more epic moment when we first saw him on screen in this movie.There has been some criticism about the believability of the plot. Agreed.It has been stated that this will NOT be the last film in the Jurassic Park franchise. Did you want this to be? Are you ready for more?It's not really well explained how the land dinosaurs migrated to all of the continents around the world, just that they did.Some of the new characters just aren't very compelling. Some are even annoying.The plot and scenes are pretty chaotic and scattered.I admit that the tension seemed fairly low simply because our favorite characters never seem to die. I wasn't really worried about them and didn't feel as emotionally invested in them as I was in the very first movie. SPOILER: Who knew just holding your hand out in front of a dinosaur was all it took?Soooo many lines are repeated word for word from previous movies in the franchise. The first few times, it was charming, but then it kind of seemed manipulative and even lazy. A lot of the dialogue is clunky. Because of that, some of the acting suffers.Is it terrible and crazy to admit that I was a little bit bored at times?The villains are definitely underwhelming.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

I would not pay money for it. I feel for those that did.I won't offer spoiler alerts. There's not much of a plot anyway. I will share, however, what I learned.If this evers come to life, we need to have and do some things. One, hold our hands up and palms out. Apparently this is effective and is understood by dinos. Two, have a taser and knife. These are apparently way more effective than guns. Dinos try to eat people in the movie, but they should not be harmed, right. Three, guns are bad, mm-kay? What a stupid, asinine place to put an agenda. It's a dino movie.Poorly done, Hollywood. I understand contractual obligations, but man, Pratt should apologize for this one, and the legacy stars deserve an apology.Burt Macklin would have done better especially without open hands, tasers, and knives.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

What a ridiculous way to end the Jurassic Park legacy. Coexisting with a planet of dinosaurs?? I can't imagine anyone being in a theater subjected to that mess. Cocaine is alive and well amongst the writers.As I watched it all I could do was try to relate to it as a Hollywood cartoon or animated fantasy just to give myself a reason to keep watching it. The level of melodrama was astounding. At least in the original Jurassic Park there was an air of possibility. Michael Crichton's story.

It's apparently going against the general grain, seeing the many negative reviews here on IMDb, but to me it had everything to make watching this movie a rewarding and entertaining experience: apart from a few more talkative sequences the pace is mostly high, with many very exciting pursuits, the CGI of the dinosaurs is great (so I don't agree with the negative reports on that either), and the acting of all concerned is as adequate as could be expected.That doesn't mean that I didn't have some reservations too. Especially in the first half hour the number of different characters is too high, with a hard-to-follow and a bit chaotic story as a consequence. The music is at times so roaringly epic that it at some point became almost preposterous. I guess the oldies (Laura Dern, Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum) had a ball being together again, but it felt a bit too easy, as if the makers primarily brought them in as a guarantee to skyrocket the box office earnings. Of those three, the only one that did add something substantial to the movie was Goldblum, with his priceless ironic ad-libs. But on the other hand Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard both were great again, and I absolutely loved DeWanda Wise!In short, maybe not the best movie ever, but still a nice and entertaining watch!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

(Planet of the dinosaurs anyone?) . Of the pair of storylines running in this movie, the mutant locus one, (while it has nothing to do with dinosaurs at all) is the better of the two and the reason why because despite it being still dumb and having nothing to with dinosaurs, it's actually more interesting and better acted. The Jurassic Park characters which includes a rejuvenated and game Sam Neill (who redeems his terrible performance from Jurassic Park 3 ) Laura Dern (Who was barley in Jurassic Park 3, thank god) and a top of his game Jeff Goldblum ( who was in this franchise's only fairly good and solid sequel ""The Lost World"" and mercifully only had few minutes of screen times in its second worst sequel ""Fallen Kingdom"") all try their best with the hooky yet brainless material they are working with and for the most part they succeed. Both Sam Neill and Laura Dern pick up seamlessly their natural chemistry from the original Jurassic Park and it's sweet and compelling while Jeff Goldblum naturally picks up Ian Malcolm's sense of self righteous bitting wit and disarming charm. While the script has some of the worst dialogue all three actors have had to work with, only Goldblum manages to turn the tables on the terrible screenplay he was had to work with some quick witted improvisation that gotten the biggest laughs in the entire movie which has him almost breaking what they call the 4th wall and making fun of most of things that are happening in this film, which is a god sent because Jeff is really telling the audience that he knows this movies sinks and he understands what the audience is going through. A brilliant master stroke that only a great actor like Goldblum can pull off undetected from the director and producers of a film they are working on that they think stinks.The second of the storylines while more action oriented, is not only more dimwitted but lacks focus and is barely even acted at all. It's a continuation of the plot threads that was left over from the last movie and it's tries to recon certain revelations but still ends up worthless and uninspired. Chris Pratt phones in his performance and you can sense he knows this film is not very good. Bryce Dallas Howard tried her best but her character still is as underdeveloped as ever and the only actor who comes out of this storyline with her head high is Dewanda Wise, manages to not only steal the spotlight from Pratt and Howard but her character manages to be a hell of a lot more interesting . Unfortunately, not even her great acting talent can overcome the terrible script that does no one any favors and rips off several action sequences from ""The Borne Ultimatum"" which involves a roof top and motorcycle chase in a foreign city. In this film, those rip off sequences added raptors and James Bond bad guys to chase our heroes in the city of ""Malta"" and even with those added elements, they lacked the kinetic energy and intensity that ""Borne"" movie had in spades.In conclusion, the movie while better than the brain dead ""Fallen Kingdom"", it's still a bloated mess. And despite the game efforts by the returning Jurassic Park cast (Especially a great self aware performance by Jeff Goldblum) and a scene stealing, star making turn by Dewanda Wise, it's probably time to end this franchise before they turn out a movie that is ""Jurassic Park 3"" bad.","18 out of 27 found this helpful.

Stick to the original flavour. Don't spoil the Franchise with any unrealistic experiments.

It's a fun popcorn movie.. and the effect look good (though not further improved from the last two). It's worth seeing on the big screen!It does seem like they really chopped it at the last minute, almost haphazardly as a blonde villain character was on the scene, made a big presence, than just seemed to vanish.I'd give it about a 6.0 out of 10.

It was fun and great to see a mix of the original and sequel casts coming together. I look forward to seeing it again when released on blu ray/iTunes. There were alot of special dinosaur scenes which I loved, but the fact that the films story stretched too so many areas.

How could you turn one of the most popular franchise into disaster?Everytime I think they can they can't do any worse, yet they find a way to prove me wrong. Speaking without spoilers, this film have got almost everything wrong. Starting from the storytelling to the execution, even the background musics are bad. The first half of the film felt like rushed. Even the old cast members could not make it any better. Grant, Sattler, Malcom everyone is here just for the sake of being in the movie and they do nothing but crack disney jokes. Sometime I got confused whether I am watching a Jurassic film or comedy film made by disney.Finally, if we talk about dinosaurs, they had cool designs no doubt yet were looking so fake just like in every Jurassic World film. They main antagonist Giganotosaurus had almost close to zero screentime whatsoever. What was the point of making him the so called "" The largest carnivore world has ever seen,"" if you can't give him a proper role? He did not have any sort of impact on the story.I won't go for other parts as it will make it too long. Just gonna put it right there.

Now, please take leave and never ever come back again.","13 out of 19 found this helpful.

May he Rest In Peace, but it's probably good that Michael Crichton wasn't alive to see this abomination of a film. The only reason I'm even giving an extra star is because the dinosaurs looked good and some of the cinematography was on point, but my god this was unbearable to watch.My biggest problem with this film is how predictable the story was and how shallow of a character its antagonist was. Nothing against Campbell Scott, I'm sure he's a swell guy, but watching him play this character was like watching a lifeless Dave Wallace from The Office. He had no depth, no angle, and every choice he made could be seen from 100 miles away.Another reason I couldn't stand this movie was how many times Chris Pratt got everyone out of trouble by putting his hand up to the dinosaurs. I can't tell you how badly I wanted him to try it just to have one of them take a couple fingers off. It might've added some excitement to the movie.I really wish I could keep going and tell you about how bad the whole thing was; but since I fell asleep for fifteen minutes of the movie, I guess it wouldn't be very honest of me to say I saw the entire thing. This is supposed to be the last movie of the series, so I was expecting some crazy things to be happening. I wanted to see dinosaurs fighting in the city, knocking into buildings, and stepping on cars. Instead, we were served a recycled plot with generic action and storytelling.Give me a job, Universal, and I'll write a better script with my eyes closed. Or go outside your doors and find the nearest crackhead because I'd guarantee you 100% they could write a better movie, too.","26 out of 43 found this helpful.

These films have never made sense so when you apply realism to this franchise resort it to the dinosaurs. I loved the animatronics which made it feel like the first film allot.

It primarily follows Owen (Pratt), Claire (Howard) & their adopted daughter Maisie (Sermon), as she's hunted/kidnapped by bad guys that think she's a clone. Then they throw in the original team of Ellie (Dern), Alan (Neill, struggling to find his accent from the original film) and Ian (Goldblum) who are working to bring down Biosyn Corp and their GE locusts, led by Dodgson (Scott). They have help from Kayla (Wise), Ramsay (Athie) and Barry (Sy), and BD Wong is also back as Dr Wu.While the premise of dinosaurs roaming wild is an interesting concept, it's not fully explored and only hinted at in parts. Where it is shown, such as Owen wrangling the Parasaurolophus, there's more questions as to the potential realness of it, i.e. Reptiles living in the snow, horses being as fast as them, their calmness. There's a lot of ""really?!"" moments in this film. There's some funny moments and some good action scenes, but it all seems to have too many chefs and lack focus/seems rushed.This is nowhere near the quality of the original film - probably slightly better than 'Jurassic Park III' and 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom', not that that means much. Oddly, while we see a few dinosaurs, including some new ones, but mostly the tried & tested favourites - there seems to be not that many scenes where dinosaurs are the main focus. While not horribly slow, it doesn't feel like it all comes together and starts working until the final 40min, which isn't much of the 2 hour 20min running time.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Commercialisation of the Isla Nublar's live stock might have been a good card to play or at least a militarisation gone wrong would have succeeded as a spin-off. Also there's certainly a good amount of documenting the magnificent giants but some bits don't really add up a significant value to the succession. These end up carving craters in which the hype gets lost. All this clumsiness directs at the lack of originality to the story; a common singular nemesis this time even without known origins and ending up exactly the same way as indominus is more like a gut punch to the hopeful viewer. Dominion may age soon despite being the flashy new instalment but for all it's carefully arranged encounters of new kinds it's worth a watch.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

And people thought Jurassic Park III was horrible. Jeez, this one here takes the cake. The plot has nothing to do with dinosaurs.You don't miss anything by not watching it. Personally, Jurassic Park is the best film, followed by Lost World, Jurassic Park III, Jurassic World, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, and Dominion. Yes, the films got worse with every new entry. I was least entertained by the previous two entries.I can't help but feel this inconsistent, out-of-place trilogy deserves a quick comparison to the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Jurassic World hits the same beats as The Force Awakens. Rehash anyone? While the setup is there and you can build off it, originality is nonexistent.Then came The Last Jedi, which derailed the Star Wars saga. Fallen Kingdom was just boring. I can't consider it anything better than average. Its plot was nonsensical, and viewers begin to care less about our Jurassic World characters by the end of Act 3. That's never a good thing.Now, Dominion is on par with Rise of Skywalker for being so fast paced, poorly edited, introducing new things (species) every couple of minutes, bringing back dead or old characters for nostalgia bait, abusing special effects and letting action scenes carry the film, etc.Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) lost his charisma in this one. The only times I felt genuinely entertained was seeing Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) make subtle quips. If you want to see Pratt's potential, watch the Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers films.You can skip Fallen Kingdom and Dominion and not miss anything. The story does not make a positive impact on prior films nor does it add substance to the overarching narrative, which is the study of dinosaurs. There's nothing of value here. Give it a few years for the die-hard fans to wake up. The Jurassic World trilogy offers very little re-watchability.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

But it thankfully ramps up the fun the more the movie gets going. But seriously, lets never do that cringeworthy introduction video of a modern day news feed again, it genuinely felt like a parody or comedy but no-one in the theater was laughing. This type of start obviously gave me a hard time to get into the movie. The dialog is under-par, the characters are meh, and people are sitting around a too much for what is a world filled with dinosaurs. Also, realistically speaking, no current day government would ever allow these dinosaurs to just roam around. So you really do need to allow some fantasy, even though this show tries to be real (like that news feed segment).But then, the trip to Malta happens and imo this is where the movie kicks off and pretty much does. Not. Let. Go. It's almost action piece after action piece. First off the Malta scenes reminded me a ton of a watching a James Bond movie. The action directing is absolutely excellent here and really engaging. It genuinely caught me off guard how good it was and I was finally hooked into the movie. Then a bit later then reintroduce the original characters, now I already knew this before hand, so no surprises for me, but it was nice seeing them and they at least had something to do, except for Ian Malcolm who was a bit more absent. Regarding the original characters, there are a few but imo not excessive amount of call backs/nostalgia hooks. The only one I thought was a bit much was having Malcolm distract the dino with a torch again, oh well, you know what you are getting into. Also the Barbasol can had no place whatsoever in this movie, felt really random.There are enough dinosaurs here to satisfy your needs, at least mine were met well enough. If I'd had to guess we've had more encounters than any previous movie. And with the disappointment that was Fallen Kingdom and it's awful auction plot this was a return to form imo. The types of dinosaurs are also fantastic, loved that they tried to do some new stuff and also bring in some new development in how some dinosaurs might have looked (feathers). What is a running theme though is that the dinosaurs a lot of the times just ''appear'' out of thin air it seems, they might have a short announcement of a yell or something but they pop up everywhere. That does in turn make encounters less impactful.Directing overall was good, though the action directing being the standout. Acting was all good, didn't really expect anything surprising from these actors and their characters didn't require much range besides Bryce which did great.Characters, I only have a gripe with the main ''villain'' who they made a current day awkward billionaire CEO, he looked like he walked straight out of the Apple building. Imo, this didn't really work for me. He wasn't annoying enough to be funny, nor evil enough to be hated and feel the satisfaction when he is down on his luck. His decisions are weird, and overall it just felt like a character that wasn't real. The clone girl storyline was improved, it was basic but it needed to be done for her to have any meaning in the movie, though her scenes still felt like ''get it over with''.Music was pretty good, they brought back some of the Williams stuff but kept it subtle, which I think was a tasteful decision not to go overboard. But it shows that the JW trilogy lacks a good score. The music for action scenes once again was good too, and they opted for some action scenes to not use any music which I can appreciate, it just adds that bit more intensity when the music is gone.The movie ends again sadly with a bit of that cringe worthy writing that it started with, so...wish they didn't do that. Character storylines are wrapped up vaguely, guess they keep them open for whatever comes next.All in all I had more fun here than I expected.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story is generic, it serves as a pretext to go from action scene to action scene, with dinosaurs, explosions, bar fights, impossible pursuits with vehicles on land and in the air.However, it still has some well-crafted nostalgia factor. I really enjoyed seeing Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum together once again. And to the film's credit, these characters are more than glorified appearances, taking up quite a bit of space in the film.Conclusion: It's a brainless action movie with plenty of nostalgia, good character moments, and a corny b-plot narrative that is very bland and shallow.I enjoyed this movie more than the previous one. If you don't expect much from it, it might be fun.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The contrast is staggering on how stupid and Hollywood these movies have become. It feels like they are trying to capture the same stupidity of the Fast & the Furious franchise's latest entries. The movie has high production value and decent acting but like many Hollywood turds the script is just unbelievably stupid. I absolutely hated Fallen Kingdom for that very reason and this movie is no different. Watch the movie to see how stupid it is for yourself if you don't believe me.","24 out of 40 found this helpful.

If you are a fan of suspenseful moments where dinosaurs are hunting humans and the humans are trying to escape death, boy, you're in for a real treat. I was in awe by the action scenes in this movie and how realistic the graphics of the dinosaurs were. The last section of the movie is packed with dinosaur fighting scenes, you'll love it. There were a few notable scenes, especially the ones with the baby raptor dinosaur, where it looked TOO fake with too much CGI because it didn't blend well with the forest background. It didn't detract too much from the immersion of the movie but it was definitely noticeable.The story was decent. It does a decent job of recapping the previous movie story a little bit. You will greatly benefit if you remember what happened in the earlier movies because they pretty much get into the story and continue it. The relationship between the characters will make much more sense if you remember what they did in the past. I didn't like how the movie just drops newly introduced characters. Especially in the first half, there are times where they introduce a new actor and then the story changes locations and you never see that actor again. They introduce dinosaurs that react to lazer pointers but you never see them again after that.I'm not a big fan of the middle part since it drags on a little bit. The part where people are sneaking into the lab and there's heavy dialog wasn't presented interesting enough to me..The acting is superb from all the actors. The way they acted terrified from these fake CGI dinosaurs were very believable. Jeff Goldblum was funny and talked eloquently as he always does. The audience at my movie theatre laughed at some of his dialog. I didn't see the other jurassic park movies from the 90's with the original actors. But i still felt like i this was going to be epic when the original actors and the new actors from the jurassic world story arc joined together.I'm not a huge fan of the villain, he was evil but his motivation other than greed money was kinda shallow. He was also kind of weak, depending totally on his workers to just blindly follow him.All in all, come for the action and suspense. You'll appreciate this movie so much more if you remember the previous movies and if you know the actors from their other movies.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was amazing seeing the original cast come back to this film, but it felt like some other things returned from the original jurassic park. There were multiple times this movie where it felt like it was nabbed straight from the original jurassic park, which felt more like lazy writing which did not really do the movie any good.The plot in short was not too good, there were a lot of 'but why?' moments, but then who really goes to a jurassic park/world movie for the amazing plot. The main attraction is, of course, the dinosaurs. The CGI on the dinosaurs was really well done and the action scenes are a thrill to watch! But it does feel like, after five movies, the 'magic' of seeing these dinosaurs on screen is a bit gone. Especially when there is not a big bad evil dinosaur this movie focusses on, like there was in the other jurassic world movies (indominus rex and indoraptor).The acting in this movie was fine, but not outstanding and the plot was, as mentioned, okay at best. The great action scenes and the beautiful scenery and cgi make up for that a bit, though, and I'd say the movie is fun to watch.","26 out of 44 found this helpful.

Forget that the controls for the mainframe that needs to be turned off is in the same room where they kept the experimental grasshoppers and which had been soaked in lighter fluid and set on fire earlier. Forget that restarting the mainframe also brought the grasshoppers who were burned to a crisp hours earlier back to life.

Even the title ""Dominion"" suggests some victorious claimant of Terra Firma as we expect to be the ones cast back into evolutionary obscurity in a battle which humans haven't a chance of winning. Well, that's what it suggested anyway, the trailer, the title, that we'd see the world overrun. But instead, the writers seem to have shuffled through all of the prior films and screenplays and then finally picked up Michael Crichton's first book and said, ""eh I've bright idea ... let's set it in a park for Dinosaurs like l, eh I dunno ... Jurassic Park maybe, huh?"" Duh!And that's precisely what we get, Jurassic Park again, only worse, way worse. Couple that with rubber animatronics, bad CGI, wooden acting and we're left with a giant pile of Dino-dung that stinks. Any menace one might have expected from the world being the dominion of these creatures dissappears when they decided to concentrate on an environmental disaster caused by locusts the size of rats and forget that there are flocks of Pterosaurs on high that just might eat the kids for lunch, but they won't because we've decided that we can all hold a hand up in a staying manner and control every single one of them, and if that doesn't work we'll just get Chris Pratt to talk to them, he's great at that and they seem to like his voice. He even teaches Dr Grant how to hold a hand up to a Velociraptor, unaware that Dr Grant perfected the staying hand in JP III.And the decision to have the Pilot for hire explain to the dinosaur trainer and the former head of Jurassic World the names and characteristics of certain dinosaurs seems so lazy and ill-thought out as to be ridiculous. It is an obvious attempt to give the character lines, but simply isn't believable.If only the writers of this rubbish would embrace prehistory, for their work certainly needs somewhere to go to, preferably into obscurity.Instead they brush over the fact that the thing which was to avoided at all costs throughout all of the prior movies, that these animals shouldn't ever be set free, really isn't that bad and we'll all have to learn to share. It's an insulting side-step, insulting to fans, and to concentrate the majority of the film in yet another Dinosaur park, left me dumbfounded, I still can't believe they went there.The return of the original cast was largely wasted and there was no intelligent integration of their roles with the Jurassic World cast, it was a wasted opportunity and the promise of the trailers and excitement at this merging was squandered. The one sure thing to create atmosphere, John William's renowned score was also wasted and the music at times was so bad, it sounded like a score for any generic TV action show. Only hints of the original score surfaced and were so clipped as to be annoying and pointless.If they had crowd-sourced ideas from the fans and thrown it all in the air and grabbed what they could, they could have done way better than what was written here. And, I can only say that the opening to this film is one of the most crappy wasted opportunities of all the franchise, opening with some ridiculous newsreader monologue segment as a mechanism to get the story into our heads. It was terrible and some of the worst writing I've seen across a franchise known for enticing, exciting openings. It seems the old saying, too many cooks spoil the broth, is appropriate to the writing here.The acting seems rushed, unfocused, and unrehearsed and a lot of that is down to the director, who is ultimately responsible for shouting cut. Overall, it's a huge disjointed, disappointment that even the cast seem perplexed by.If looking for wonder, rewatch the original, if you do so after watching this mess, then you'll realise exactly how bad it is.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

I remember watching the original as a little boy in the theaters being blown away at the ground breaking effects and breakthrough in filmmaking. I was excited to watch this movie with my own children, hoping it would somehow be a repeat of the magic I experienced watching the first one. I also thought thought that this was going to be some sort of homage to the magic of the first movie since they brought back the original cast. When the movie starts, there is no build up to seeing the dinosaurs all of a sudden they just live amongst everyone and the magic of seeing a dinosaur is completely null. I thought there was going to be a very emotional sentiment by seeing the original cast however, it didn't bring any added value other than viewers who remember the original to say oh hey, there they are. The action feels generic, and there was never any points during the movie that gave you the suspense we all experienced during the first one.

Compared to the first 2 jurassic world movies, this was an improvement. But by all means, this movie was good, but not great. I didn't enjoy jurassic world because it felt like a bad attempt at a remake of jurassic park. And don't get me started on fallen kingdom, I don't know how I sat through that movie when it was in theaters. It was just so awful, the worst jurassic movie of them all. So my expectations for this movie were pretty low. This is what the first jurassic world movie should have been. It reminded me of the rise of the planet of the apes series. But, If you're looking for a realistic interpretation of how dinosaurs would live among humans, this movie isn't for you. This movie is purely entertainment. If it were realistic the main characters would've been dead a long time ago. The action can be cheesy and predictable, but it's fun, and some of the action sequences had me ready to jump, something i haven't felt since the first jurassic park. This movie was definitely carried by the return of the original jurassic park cast, i would not have enjoyed it as much as i did if they weren't in it. This movie actually felt like it had somewhat of a plot. And somehow still doesn't feel like the end of the series. I would not be mad if they made another jurassic world movie, as long as they continue to expand the world of the story.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I don't watch Jurassic Park for perfect plot lines or complexities, I do it for the majestic Dino recreation. This one just works.There are also some very uniquely terrifying situations and I've seen every which genre of thriller/horror so that was kinda nice.

But it's definitely miles better than Forbidden Kingdom.Having the original trio of Neill, Dern and Goldblum reprising their classic roles, did bring more nostalgia than I anticipated. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, the hero's of the new trilogy, were definitely pushed into the backseat for this new film.But it was fun popcorn entertainment with some stunning visuals and action packed set pieces laced with tension.Sure, the whole ""locust"" subplot felt out of place and stupid, but it didn't impact my enjoyment one bit.It's a fine addition to the franchise.

It felt more like Fast & Furious plus dinosaurs with sappy dialogue and non-sensical plot points, one after another. And even though we have an army of characters that barely got any development, the story insisted on introducing more, which were boring additions.Clearly this story also was pushing some agendas, and its painful philosophical discussions make the OG movie sound like Socrates and Plato compared to this rubbish.Just look at the ridiculous outfits Emily Carmichael wears to premieres, and tell me this person should be writing the Jurassic Park franchise...If you're going to make another Jurassic Park film, get a writer who lives and breathes this franchise, who knows the book by heart and is bursting with creativity - not the hot writer agents tell you to work with.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

When the movie came out in theaters, I was only 1 years old. I remember owning Jurassic Park years later on vhs, and it becoming one of my most prized possessions. The story, characters, pacing, special effects, and music are pitch perfect. When the Lost World: Jurassic Park came out, I was 5 years old, and I did not see it in theaters either. While it was a flawed sequel, I enjoyed watching it on vhs. The music, set pieces, and the inclusion of more dinosaurs made it a fun addition to the series. Jurassic Park III was the first film in the franchise that I actually saw in theaters in 2001. I remember loving it when I was 9 years old, but now it is my least favorite of the sequels. The runtime is too short, and I'm not just referring to humans running away from dinosaurs. The dialogue and characters and poorly written, and the quality of the cgi was downgraded. With that being said, the animatronic work still mostly holds up, except the Spinosaurus. Fast forward 14 and 17 years later, and I finally saw both Jurassic World and Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom in theaters. The experience of seeing the park finally open in Jurassic World was such an en incredible feeling. It was the closest to capturing the magic of the original Jurassic Park. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom, like Jurassic Park III, tends to get better when repeat watches, but it is a lesser sequel in almost every way. This brings me to Jurassic World Dominion. While the film does have tonal issues and missteps, seeing the original trio together is worth the price of admission alone. While I think the current reviews are a bit harsh, the film is flawed. I would summarize the biggest issue as missed opportunities for the characters and story. The movie wraps up all six films in an interesting enough way, but doesn't completely satisfy or answer every question that you may have. Visually, the movie is gorgeous, and it has the most animatronics of any film in the franchise, with the cgi mixing well with the practical effects. Overall, Jurassic World Dominion is a nostalgic rollercoaster ride that thrilled me, slightly disappointed me, but never bored me.","9 out of 12 found this helpful.

The trailers showed dinosaurs around the world and a rescue mission, again. But I was so delusional and thought it was gonna be pretty good. And I walk into the theater, on my birthday, and I'm still sort of shocked. We got a film about genetically modified locusts, cooperate espionage, CIA missions to save a annoying girl and a raptor apparently? You made a promise to a dinosaur? Oh yeah, and there's the hamd. Wanna see a 7 inch hand to calm every dinosaur in this entire FILM?! Well, here you go, it works on wild parasaurs, 20 feet tall carnivore dinosaurs, laser guided raptors, and on a mindless baby raptor and blue. The pacing is dogwater, screenplay/ dialogue is absolutely awful, and there is too many locusts to fill up the conspiracy theories. But I did like the Freddy Krueger dinosaur scene with Claire, best scene in the movie. Like the cowboy dinosaur scene, just ignore the stupid hand, it adds emotion. I love the old cast returning. Jeff Goldblum steals the show. Ramsay Cole is a ok Jeff Goldblum, Kayla Watts is a decent character, apart from being a LGBTQ. The swimming dinosaur in the frozen lake scene is good, just isn't Owen gonna freeze from it. I love Biosyn valley, I just hate the Biosyn building. I love the CGI in this film and the cinematography is good and real enough. The extended cut is a slightly better than the film, but still a bit disappointed by this Jurassic film. But as a fun movie to turn your brain off, it's perfect to get the nonsense away from you.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I give it a 7/10 only because of the Jurassic franchise as I've always been a fan. Just feels like they could have done better.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","One Of The Worst Films Of The Year So Far","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8378820/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","28 July 2022","Continuing the Jurassic Park franchise tradition of every subsequent sequel being weaker than the previous one, Jurassic World Dominion is as embarrassing & incompetent as any blockbuster can get. An insipid, moronic & lacklustre entry with nonsensical plot, soulless characters & dull action, this sixth & final instalment is possibly the weakest of all entries in the series and is one of the worst films of the year so far.Directed by Colin Trevorrow (Jurassic World), the film picks what Fallen Kingdom had setup with its ending and discards it for a much safer, less ambitious & far more idiotic premise. And then it fails at executing that properly too. The new characters are cringe, reprising ones remain just as uninteresting as they were before and they also make the original trio return to pander fans, pick an easy paycheck & add nothing to the saga.The film suffers from not having a clearly defined set of priorities. It wants to be too many things yet ends up being nothing but a waste of time & money. For a plot set in a world now run over by dinosaurs, the possibilities were endless yet it spends too much time on characters investigating a conspiracy and narrates it with such ineptitude that we are never invested in it. And if that isn't enough, the editing on display is an absolute horror show.Overall, Jurassic Park Dominion doesn't have an ounce of magic, wonder or sense of adventure that the series once basked in and is a bland, generic, emotionally vacant & creatively bankrupt conclusion to a franchise that should've remained a duology at best. Blockbuster filmmaking at its most hollow, this film not only makes the same mistakes as before but also several new ones and despite few crowd-pleasing dino set pieces, it remains a forgettable ride.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The first film I had been on of my favorite film was my entire life. And for the most part, I've enjoyed the Jurassic World films up until now. This movie was just ridiculous. It starts with Chris Pratt Lassoing dinosaur and just quickly goes downhill from there. This film was closer to her fast and furious movie (and not one of the good ones). It was contrived, it was predictable, and it was ultimately boring. The whole movie felt like they were just trying to remind you of the great movie. Jurassic Park that they had once made it was gratuitous. Well, I wouldn't see the last two movies were great films.

"7","/10","The Dominion of the Jurassic Franchise Is Slightly Disappointing.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8225145/?ref_=tt_urv","epiclyyep","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur150489110/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2022","There are no spoilers in this review.Jurassic World Dominion take its setting four years after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Dominion is the grand, spectacular, finale of the Jurassic World trilogy, and the Jurassic Park franchise as a whole. At least... that's what it was supposed to be.First off, I did not hate the film. It's not a film that I would never watch again in my life. The reason for my slight disappointment, I state below.CONS:
There are absolutely no character arcs in this film, besides one character, which I won't spoil here. Maisie Lockwood may also have a small arc from her behavior... but that's it. Second off, I thought that this film was too focused on demonstrating action sequences. Rather than exploring the scientific narrative behind the story, it chose to have a jam-packed film filled with action. Sometimes, that's not bad. Colin Trevorrow, the Director of this and the first Jurassic World film, had to please both the action-seeking audience AND the story-seeking audience. I am part of the latter half. So, I understand the action sequences, but it gets overwhelming at points. Focus less on biking/escaping/running/fighting scenes, and concoct a better story! That leads me to my next point. The story feels very hollow and rushed. For a 2-and-a-half-hour-long film, you'd expect the ending to have a magnitude that's different from the ending of the previous film. However, nothing changes. Dinosaurs still roam across the world. Maybe there are two character arcs, but other than that, there's no change from the ending of JW:FK.PROS:
There is a well-written plot twist midway through the film that I enjoyed watching. It gives some more expansion to the JW ""lore"". Some moments in JWD gave me some seriously intense moments, where I felt like I was going to sweat. Mr. Trevorrow did fantastic on that sweet, sweet, tension. The addition of a few new characters is nice to see. Now, we have the classic characters, the classic JW characters, and the newer characters. Jeff Goldblum is phenomenal in this film and had some humor that made me laugh out loud. A lot of people disliked the locust side story, but personally, I saw it as a way to connect the two stories into one. It was a way to bring the classic characters into the story. I liked that there were also multiple plot lines to follow. Some say that this should have been split into two parts, but these stories happen at the same time, so it would be confusing to have two parts.Overall, JWD had some major flaws in its production, but I respect and admire the crew's work and struggle through COVID-19. They did the best they could. This movie may not be the best installment, but it's certainly better that JPIII.Also, this movie doesn't deserve the rotten tomatoes score it has. It's really not THAT bad...","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, Dominion fell short on so many things. Yes, the original cast was reunited and that would normally make the film better, but the movie just felt rushed and the actors just didn't have that spark that they did in previous movies. I would have liked to see much more dinosaur action, though. I mean, if you're going to give us a confusing enough storyline to follow that branches off into so many directions in Dominion, at least include the animal that made the franchise so popular. Maisie was really annoying and just not a likable character, and her storyline was very stupid, in my opinion. She was just another character, easily forgettable. I ended up almost falling asleep because Dominion was just so boring and the storyline was hard to catch up with. Watched it with my grandparents in the theater and was very underwhelmed, and watched it with my parents and they said it was garbage. It's a shame, because the movie had so much potential, but they didn't plan it out right and it was just another forgettable film of 2022. Very disappointed in the movie.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ironic it might sound since its fiction but still the main point of my argument is that people would not survive in the world full of dinosaurs. Allegedly the dinos spread the entire world, yeah that means humans would either extinct or be in survival mode.One time they say how living with dinos is a struggle (especially pointed out in the intro) the next we are shown places and events like dinos don't exist at all and somehow the locusts are the only problem...
No other problems, no dinos to make a mess etc. Like make up your mind.The events in the movie are completely off, all the characters would pretty much die off in their 1st crashes and especially their 1st encounters with dinos but they somehow always survive and find their way to a secure place, or secure enough. Magically only the villians get killed almost instant, like magically dinos know who is ''good'' or ''bad''. When a good character is attacked the dinos basically more often just toy around they don't attack for a kill.In the real world, we don't need locusts and dinosaurs to be a problem, we are the biggest problem and we are our own enemy ... the movie seems like a metaphor for a typical brainwashed human behavior, blame everything else but us.This movie is such a mishmash of things, it's like trying hard to please every fanbase there is. Campy horror, JP3 fans (do they even exist...) bringing back old characters and putting lots of nods to old JP1 and 2 but still manage to middle finger it too... this movie seriously doesn't know what it wants to be at all.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Since this was presumed to mark the denouement of this decade-long franchise, this was rather an obvious decision from their end to bank upon the element of nostalgia for one last time.Not that I'm complaining though; as a fan of Jurassic Park and these wondrous critters in general, I couldn't have asked for more to be honest. Yet, my biggest complaint is that amid all this flashiness and showboating, the makers for whatever reason forgot to look after the core storyline. The plot is quite unstable, it is indeed inconsistent and is certainly plagued with an awful lot of expositions and pointless maneuvers. Most importantly, it doesn't seem to provide any of the thrill or the suspense a film of this stature requires or rather insists upon!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I could tell they were running out of ideas and didn't know what to do. One problem I had was the pacing. Unlike it's 2018 counterpart (Jurassic World fallen Kingdom). This movie is just to slow and incredibly boring when action is not going on. The introduction of the new characters's were not as likable as I wanted them to be and to me should have been fleshed out more. But when the action scenes happened, those were the best parts of the movie. The sequence in Malta was very cool and entertaining and what I thought Dominion was gonna be like. Another thing that I liked were the resurrection of old characters. Without giving too much away Ellie, Allen and Malcom we're by far the best part of this movie. The old and new characters did blend well and I thought they fit together enough to create a good cast of characters. As a diehard fan of the series, I thought the movie was mediocre. But, it did what it was supposed to and had nice callbacks to the original Jurassic Park and was good enough to end mine, and others, childhood movie series.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Pratt and Howard reprise their decent onscreen chemistry. The special effects are bigger than ever, the casting is fairly solid, the audience only expects a mindless popcorn movie anyway. What could go wrong? How about a screenplay so convoluted, loud, and boring that the whole thing falls apart?Jurassic World: Dominion (JWD) is yet another example of how Hollywood is handing multibillion-dollar franchises to inept, unqualified screenwriters. Like so many other high-profile, big-budget theatrical releases and streaming series from about 2017-2022, the screenwriters don't seem to understand how real people interact with each other or form sentences. JWD is a collection of digital set pieces in which human actors spout one-liners while jumping away from CG monsters. Dialogue is on the nose and frequently describes what we already see onscreen. Stock villains from sci-fi, westerns, 80s action flicks, and spy capers abound. None of it matches up coherently.This nonsense can be fun when an overall story doesn't take itself too seriously (I actually enjoyed the incredibly goofy take on Kong-versus-Godzilla in 2021); but JWD takes on heavy-hitting subjects such as global warming, the worldwide food chain, a child's life, an important baby dinosaur, black-market weapons dealers, and -wait, did I lose you?Everything is loud! And important! Right now! Immediately! And just like a loud storm can eventually lull you to sleep, about 45 minutes into the movie, you won't care what happens; and you'll realize there's still 1-1/2 hours to slog through to the end.I gave it two stars for a handful of animatronic/puppet dinosaurs (always nice to see a real prop when the other dinosaurs look like cartoons), plus a clever throwaway gag involving the original cast and a loud espresso machine.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

But like everything other facet of life, this principle also has its exceptions - I cannot help but be biased about the Jurassic Park films and there are several factors contributing to that bias:
1. My love for films kick-started with ""Jurassic Park"" (the first film I had watched at a theatre, way back in 1994) and that film and most of its scenes have become iconic over the years - a feat unmatched by any monster film of the past and the present.2. Having watched the original in 1994, the child has ever since been fascinated by the jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring dinosaurs. They had occupied a world of fantasy for the kid who was by nature an introvert. From collecting dino toys to owning dino t-shirts, I have done it all and continue to do it now, when given a chance, as I am still preoccupied by these mighty beasts.3. The sequels and the spin-offs to the original have had hits and misses in them, never touching the iconic moments of the original but have always continued to be watchable even now. I didn't like ""Jurassic Park III"" but I have never overlooked it, having watched it multiple times as well. Despite the flaws, they define an integral part of my childhood and every new film is a stroll down the lanes of nostalgia for this 31-year old guy. They are special to me, no matter what.Jurassic World: Dominion takes place four years after the cataclysmic events of the previous film and the dinosaurs are out in the human world. They are colliding into one another and learning to live together as well. Metaphor for COVID-19? Yes, could be. The film also touches on issues like food scarcity and plagues and the side effects of bioengineering in agriculture. It is in some of these moments in the first half that the film suffers from pacing issues and from lack of being in a tight knot. But once the pre-interval scene comes up, the film changes track. The scene changes to the park and the essence of Jurassic Park is back. There are numerous dinosaurs, scene after scene, some new (like the Therizinosaurus, the Pyroraptor, the Atrociraptor, and the big daddy of them all - the Giganatosaurus) and some old (like the Velociraptors, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the venom-spitting Dilophosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, among many others) - a dream world for a dino lover like me. The cinematography is jaw-dropping and the mixture of special effects and animatronics seal the deal effectively well. Despite the flaws in the screenplay, the film is salvaged by the breathtaking second half. Among the actors, Bryce Dallas Howard gets the best character arc and newcomer DeWanda Wise turns in a commendable performance. But it was great fun to watch the OG cast - the dynamics between the trio of Alan, Ellie, and Ian can beat any newcomer, after all they are the heart of the franchise and it was worth having them to close the chapters on dinosaurs forever.","45 out of 80 found this helpful.

The bright spots in the cast were DeWanda Wise as Kayla and Isabella Sermon as Maisie who brought freshness and some multi-dimensionality to their characters.The story seemed to have been patchworked together from a series of unrelated set pieces and the whole of the Malta segment could have been missed out without impacting the story, saving about 15-30 minutes of the running time.Plot lines seem to have been cobbled together from a random selection of films, leaning heavily on Schwarzenegger's Commando and Predator, but with a bit of Alien thrown in and a major homage to Indiana Jones, plus a bit of the James Bond Tomorrow Never Dies with the motor cycling segment.However, saying all that the film was unadulterated dinosaur fun despite it's predictability and lack of story telling. It finished off the franchise much as the Rise of Skywalker did to Star Wars, but does not leave you wanting more.As a final comment, I saw Jurassic Park in Reykjavik with Icelandic subtitles in 1993, and this is the only other one I've seen in a cinema. If was on a small screen I would not have survived to the end.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Not because of the storyline, but because it is genuinely all over the place.There is good: the original and new teams in the same film. A different premise, which sort of makes sense. Some heart stopping action sequences (with caveats). Certainly not boring.The negatives. Even more preposterous than it should be. Yes, it obviously IS preposterous, but some of the occurrences are laughable. Some of the action is painful. Claire doing Jason Bourne over the rooftops? Oh well, no high heels. Some great CGI, some not so much. Tbh the ORIGINAL cgi was more believable.Perhaps just too much, all in all. 7 May be generous, but the excitement just about makes it worthwhile. The original Spielberg is still by far the best, by a big margin.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The environmentalistic message is even more on the nose and mispresented than in the last one.This movie believes in nothing, it stands for nothing and the worst part: It entertains no one.

I was surprised with how the director and writers of the movie were gathering most of the past Jurassic park characters together. That was fun to watch. However, what I was disinterested about was the fact that the movie took nearly an hour to build up its action, which was half of its timing. However, that wasn't much of a bug for me.

One of the few movies that unfortunately made it in the 1 billion dollar club. Jurassic World was fun despite its flaws, Fallen Kingdom was just kind of eh, but this is an absolute disaster. It's just sunk down a downward spiral that leads to hell. It's bad enough to the point I'm pretty convinced it was made more for money than it was for an actually good movie, and that's sad. I don't care for this movie or this franchise anymore; the creative team leaders certainly didn't so why should I? One year later and nobody talks or cares about it. But sadly people will take advantage of the money they made and make some more Jurassic Park garbage. Why did people flock to see it, WHY?!? Everybody I've talked to who watched it instantly regretted buying tickets for this and not some other movie. What a piece of garbage.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Lost of cameos and lore that tie even more things together. Got to see alot of new things to enjoy. I especially enjoyed how the very end was because I wasn't sure how they would go about it.I feel the biggest reason the movie(s) are disliked is young people today think they are all movie critics and follow the Oscars. Thus they think the only good movie is something that is Oscar worthy. Movies exist to entertain us, not just win awards.JP/JW were never super deep movies with deep stories, deep lines and deep everything. They were your normal summer fun films. The kind you just shut off your brain for and enjoy. If you liked all the movies so far, you will also enjoy this one. That simple.Again, ignore the very bad reviews since they obviously are not able to just enjoy a movie and have fun. And to note, actually read the popular negative reviews, they all mention the hated the movies are predictable, ignore issues with plotholes...etc. Then they say the only good things about the movies are ""they are fun"". See? The movies are about fun and they don't like they are fun, to them fun is not enough. Hence the reviews are so bad, people lost the ability to have fun.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

Part 2 was a bit boring.I've read the reviews before we watched this film and think they don't do this movie any justice. Neither is the 6th Jurassic film boring nor is there a dinosaur attack every 3 minutes. People tend to exaggerate. Don't take them serious.Part 6 has Laura Dern, Ed Neill, Jeff Goldblum, and the two major actors from the previous films reunited and we also see Blue, the cute raptor. She now has a baby and the scenes with Blue and the baby are particularly touching.What I also enjoyed about this 6th part was for one thing the filming locations (Malta) and lots of new dinosaur types in close up scenes.Forget about all these lousy reviews, simply give it a chance and enjoy this truly entertaining movie!","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Maybe, it could have been better with less character lines. I know, I know, it had a great feeling that everyone came back again, and we had new faces, but because of that it became superficial.CGI itself, good as always. The dinosaurs were great, their movement, fight scenes and the landscapes as well where we could find them. However I could not understood, why they had to finish the movie with that fight scene. I don't really see the point in it, but it is my problem.2,5 hours of playing time. Too much, definitely. You get so many boredom parts in the movie, which scenes are not neccessary in my opinion. I was anticipated a little more fights with that screen time.Overall, it was not the worst movie ever, but definitely the worst, out of the 3 movies. I don't regret that I spent money on it, but it is not going to become my favourite.

""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" may have been a bad movie, but it was doing the leg work so that we'd finally get the movie where dinosaurs are loose and running amuck around the world. That is what the series had been teasing since ""Lost World"". That is what all the advertising for this movie promised. Those promos that Colin Trevorrow directed where dinosaurs were attacking at campgrounds and weddings. Finally, dinosaurs loose in the cities, not just confined to an island or reserve. So, what does this movie do? Start with most of the dinosaurs captured and put onto islands and reserves. The main villains of this movie aren't dinosaurs, they're locus. Why do you do this movie? Why do you lie to us?The movie follows Owen and Claire from the previous movies. Tagging along with them this time is the clone girl from the end of the last one. The movie makes the bold choice to make this clone girl an obnoxious brat that the audience actively roots against.The three ""legacy characters"" played by Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern and Sam Neil feel like they are in a completely different movie. They are in a corporate espionage movie and Chris Pratt and them, are in a jungle survival movie. Despite what the marketing may imply the two groups don't spend much time together.This ""Jurassic World"" franchise has been a mess. Characters act completely different from movie to movie. The plots don't seem to have any coherent narrative through line. The dumb rules they make up for these dinosaurs change from movie to movie. But the dinosaurs look pretty cool.At this point the movies are passed the bad of being funny bad, they're just depressing bad.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Only the product design team and the CGI crew showed their bests. The actors knew what they were getting into, and this shows. It's slow, full of cliches and self-repeats. Nobody is trying. The message the film solidifies in the end was already solidified in 5 previous movies.I don't want to dig deeper into this. There is no point. It bored me to death, and all the shots of the old cast with nostalgic music made me feel angry and manipulated. I can't rate this either. Rating this film a 1/10 would offend everyone who worked on it, but I can't give it more.The best thing about this film was that it created jobs and paid people for their work.

I thought that it replayed the various facets of the series that we'd seen before, just in a remixed fashion. I did say that I though that the ending might tease a possibility of something a bit different for the next film. It did, a bit, and whilst I wouldn't say Dominion was a good film, I don't think it's as bad as the last one, or as the critics have generally suggested.With the technology of dino genes now in the hands of Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) and his company Biosyn, the world has come to an uneasy alliance with the escaped dinosaurs now forming part of everyday life. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) is investigating a swarm of giant locusts, that are threatening the very ecostructure of the planet and believes that Biosyn are involved. She convinces Alan Grant (Sam Neill) to join her on a visit. Biosyn have never stopped looking for Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) and when one of their spies kidnaps her, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) undertake a rescue mission.I mean, just to reiterate, I didn't think that this was great - but I went in with expectations so low that when it turned out to be alright I was pleasantly surprised. The dinosaurs in unusual environment sections are interesting, particularly the scenes in Malta. Towards the end we settle back into more familiar environment, a ""lost world"" jungle setting and science labs. I thought the integration of the two-story strands was OK, and it was nice - if not particularly thrilling - to see the old cast and new interacting. The look of the film is good, with nice camera work and CGI creatures.There are aspects that I didn't like, particularly from the ending, without spoilers when the Dinosaurs of different species teamed up in the finale of ""Jurassic World"" I thought it was a bit stilly - and I still think that now. I felt it was a bit disappointing when, given the freedom of the whole world, to go to a laboratory near a remote jungle. It's another organisation that thinks they can control nature but whose shiny facility is quickly torn to bits when things go wrong. I also cannot make myself care about the clone human storyline, sorry.Again, I don't think it's bad - just a bit too much stuff that you've seen before.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I wasn't expecting to like it, but I actually like it so much that I want to see it again on the big screen.Sure, the return of old characters are in place to give fan service to those of us who love the original movie. And ok, the story line is a little light. But if you can get past these 2 minor issues, you will really enjoy the movie. Laura Dern and the rest of the cast all look great, and Jeff Goldblum plays his best Jeff Goldblum since Thor: Ragnarok. Everyone clearly had alot of fun making this movie.The stars of the movie are of course, the Dinosaurs, and wow the artists and wizards behind the scenes really went all out this time. At a time where we are all used to VFX and where they can all seem kind of bland, Dominion really takes things to the next level. I don't quite understand what I am seeing, but the level of realism has been turned up to 1000. I wish I could describe it better.There are a few scenes which really stood out. A scene with Bryce Dallas Howard's ""Clair Dearing"" being chased though city streets and buildings by a Dinosaur, all seemingly shot with hand-held cameras, was especially well done.Anyway, ignore the haters and treat yourself.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A satisfactory conclusion to both the ""Park"" and ""World"" stories that should hold fans over until the inevitable future installments","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8220188/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","9 June 2022","""Jurassic World: Dominion"" is the third ""Jurassic World"" film and the sixth film in the ""Jurassic Park"" series. Directed and co-written by Colin Trevorrow (""Safety Not Guaranteed"", ""The Book of Henry""), it is a satisfactory conclusion to both the ""Park"" and ""World"" stories that should hold fans over until the inevitable future installments.Four years after the events of ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"", Isla Nublar has been destroyed by a volcano and dinosaurs have now escaped into the real world. As a result, the future of the planet is in doubt since these once extinct creatures are reclaiming the Earth, making life increasingly difficult for all the other human beings and animals who are forced to co-exist alongside them. In an effort to curb this problem, a secret experiment involving more genetic engineering is underway in a secluded location, which, if successful, will allow humanity to regain its place at the top of the food chain and keep these ancient beasts under control.Since the release of the first film back in 1993, the ""Jurassic Park/World"" series has had an interesting run among filmgoers. The original featured groundbreaking special effects, a great cast of memorable characters, and that iconic John Williams musical score to help cement it as one of the most iconic films of the 90s. On the other hand, all of the sequels have yielded less favourable results in terms of entertainment value, ranging from decent popcorn flicks to downright insulting to longtime fans. It seems the one that started it all has simply set the bar so high that everything else following it looks so poor in comparison. After almost three decades, the story that began so long ago finally draws to a close here in ""Jurassic World Dominion"", which ends things on a fairly acceptable note.I've never been one to take the ""Jurassic Park/World"" films too seriously considering their entire premise is pretty farfetched. I mean, how seriously can you really take the concept of bringing dinosaurs back to life using mosquito blood and frog DNA? But despite that, I still find them highly entertaining for what they are, and that is watching dinosaurs wreaking havoc and exposing the hubris of humanity. I still remember being wowed by the original film as a kid and rewatching it as an adult made me realise how well it holds up today. ""Jurassic World Dominion"", which is intended to be the final film in the franchise to focus around the initial story set up in 1993, features all of this and then some, so if that's what you're craving, the film delivers just that.For the most part, this film's effects look pretty good but still not as good as how they did back in the 1993 film. This is because that one used animatronics for whenever the filmmakers showed the dinosaurs up close and CGI only for when they were seen at a distance. However, since the first ""Jurassic World"" film back in 2015, the animatronics appear to have been completely discarded in favour of entirely CGI dinosaurs, which I have mixed feelings about. Sure, some of the computer-generated dinosaurs seem naturally integrated into a shot but others look so obviously added in during post-production that they stick out like a sore thumb. I understand that it's cheaper to use CGI nowadays but if these modern filmmakers truly wanted to leave an impression on viewers, then they should have at least used some animatronics wherever possible.One major problem I had with this film was its bloated second act. Without giving away spoilers, all I will say is that there are three different stories going on at once, each with a different emotional feeling. For example, one moment we might see characters being chased by dinosaurs through a busy city street and then immediately after we'll see a slow paced scene of expository dialogue that feels shoehorned in there for storytelling purposes. These parts would have worked out better if they each had some kind of overarching link to one another but instead these weird shifts in tone causes the film drag at the most inopportune times. This is where I started to lose interest in the human side of the story and wished everyone would just meet up with one another already just to get things over with.I do think the film made good use of the idea of humans and dinosaurs being made to co-exist with one another. Some people are shown trying to rescue the dinosaurs to take care of them while others trade them on the black market as exotic pets. There are also a number of brief but well-shot scenes of a group of triceratops and elephants walking side-by-side along the African Serengeti as well as some large pterosaurs patrolling the skies of New York City, with some even settling nests on the tops of skyscrapers. I guess I just like seeing such a jarring juxtaposition of the old and new inhabitants of the world being forced to live in the same eco-system, but at the same time being reminded that this is not the natural order of things. It's like what Dr. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) said at the end of ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" in that ""...these creatures require our absence to survive, not our help"".As a pair, both Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were fun dual protagonists as Owen and Claire, but they are rarely shown doing anything solo in this film. Though I liked that the two were a loving couple at first, I would have preferred if we could have seen them do things on their own to allow for their characters to develop individually, instead of being two inseparable halves throughout most of the film. Additionally, the young Isabella Sermon felt like she was going to waste as Maisie Lockwood, the pair's adoptive daughter. Maisie never felt like an actual fleshed-out character but rather a plot device used to advance the film forward until the climax. It's a shame because I saw potential in her back in the conclusion of ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"", but I suppose that was never meant to be.It was also nice to see the original trio of Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum return after almost 30 years as Dr. Alan Grant, Dr. Ellie Sattler, and Dr. Ian Malcolm, respectively. Though their reunion here is based entirely on nostalgia, their presence at least helped elevate the film above what could have been a forgettable conclusion to this long-running series. Again, like with the dinosaurs and humans, I liked the juxtaposition of the three characters from the ""Park"" films with the new ""World"" ones of Owen and Claire. There was something satisfying about watching the five of them work together to outsmart the dinosaurs with their different levels of general knowledge in their respective fields, whether it be Dr. Grant's palaeontology or Owen's ability to communicate with Velociraptors.Although it's clear by now the series has run its course, I will admit that for all intents and purposes, I've enjoyed watching all six of these ""Jurassic"" films for the popcorn entertainment they are. Through the good and bad, I have nonetheless loved seeing how the filmmakers made dinosaurs live again and had them roar their deafening roars. But if you ask me, the series needs to go on a lengthy hiatus before we ever see these cretaceous creatures on the big screen again. Though knowing what a cash cow the franchise has become (like a certain sci-fi series set in a galaxy far, far away), it's only a matter of time before Universal Studios decides to milk it even further with spin-offs, prequels, video games, etc. Until then, let's just appreciate what we've got for now.I rate it 6.5/10.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

While Jurassic Park 3 certainly has its flaws, it still felt like a ""Jurassic Park"" movie to me. I grew up watching these movies.Let's go back to the year 2015, after 14 years of rumors of another JP movie with the most bizarre concepts (Google them, they're out there) being tossed around, they finally landed on Jurassic World. I couldn't believe they finally figured out a script and production had actually happened. The movie was done. Finally!Well, after waiting all those years I went to see Jurassic World opening night, I couldn't have been more excited to finally see it. Was it good? Eh. There some moments that were good, but the overuse of CGI watered it down. Training raptors to follow commands? What happened to the blood thirsty raptors from the first 2 movies? Now they take orders from humans?Then we have Fallen Kinngdom. I really enjoyed the tension of the opening scene. The flash of lightning that shows Rexy sneak up behind the guy trying to close the gates was chilling. I thought I was in for a treat. Goldblum is wasted in a 4 minute scene... It turned into some convoluted hybrid mess with a terrible subplot to set up for Dominion.Now, we finally get this supposed ""epic conclusion"" to the franchise that brings back Grant, Sattler and Malcom combined with our new ""heroes"" and it all sounds good on paper. What we have instead is a giant mess of way too many CGI dinosaur action sequences. I thought Owen riding along side the raptors in the first World movie was bad.... Jeez. There are no great or epic moments, hardly any tension., it's just a bunch of computer animated dinosaurs thrown together on screen just for the sake of it. Unfortunately these movies get worse with each entry, and this is no exception. While we do get a couple nods and homages to the original movie, it just felt forced. Nothing about this movie felt genuine. Even the actors from the original trilogy felt like they were just bored.... And how many times are we going to have raptors encounter people just to have them stop immediately cause they someone put their hand up in front of them.I don't know, go see the movie for yourself, but don't expect any of the magic or charisma that first trilogy brought to the table. What we have is another watered down, CGI fest with no real emotion or thought put behind it. It just felt really stale.

Eventually, it wasn't as good as I had imagined and it's probably the worst movie of the trilogy. The plot of the 3rd movie was very interesting, mysterious and kinda different then the two previous movies of the franchise. The storyline was kinda well-written and some parts were well-explained, but it wasn't as good as the previous movies. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and really likeable. The filming locations of the movie was the real world, because now the dinosaurs coexist with the humans. Also, it was a very intense movie and full of dinosaur attack scenes, but not as action-filled as the previous ones. The dinosaur's design was as good as the previous movies, the CGI effects were very well edited and they were kinda terrifying. Moreover, the duration of the movie was too long and it was kinda slow paced. In my opinion, it wasn't a nice conclusion of the trilogy, because I expected something way better. The killcount of the movie wasn't bloody, at all and most kills were done off-screen, so nothing explicit was shown. Overall, ""Jurassic World Dominion"" was just an average sequel, kinda adventurous and I would probably recommend it to my friends. Last but not least, I really hope they're gonna make a 4th movie!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The same has happened to many classics like Starwars. Matrix and others.

They couldn't even keep it in the same genre. 'Dominion' is a straight up action movie, just with dinosaurs. It's more reminiscent of a 'Mission Impossible' movie than a 'Jurassic Park' film. The original was actually full of suspense and terror, even a bit of gore. In this there is really none of that.Grant, Sattler, and Malcolm's return was the saving grace. And actually making Dodgson the antagonist was pretty cool as well. It was a showcase for some new dinosaurs, but otherwise not much else going for it.I will always love this franchise based on the original and how revolutionary it was in filmmaking. I've enjoyed the other films, they look amazing, and they have thoroughly entertained, including this one. But, I'm glad this is the end (for now), because the story telling has run its course, and you can tell it's exhausted. Possibly in 20 years they could look at continuing it in some way, but a very long break is needed.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

We not only lack dominion over nature, we're subordinate to it."" Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum)Jurassic World Dominion may arguably be almost as good as the original. Anyway, it's quite entertaining summer adventure fare with the CGI dinosaurs more realistic than ever, including the biggest carnivore in the world, yes more fearsome than T Rex. The real dinosaurs are the returning veterans Laura Dern, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Neill, and the inimitable Jeff Goldblum. You just can't put them down even with the failure of at least two other theme parks.In order to fulfill the rigid requirements of the adventure genre, there must be a serious bad guy, and this Jurassic has Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott). He runs a sanctuary lab that houses homeless dinos but really serves as a platform for world dominion.You got it-the four heroes go through innumerable dino encounters to stop the maniac genius. But enough plot, of which there is nary a nuance, because the relationships of good people throughout are pleasantly emphasized so that we care about each one.We saw this Jurassic in a Phoenix Theater's Dolby Atmos, a splendid screening venue that titillates with sound moving your seat ever so slightly. When the dino stomps, our seats respond with a tingle. So, our Jurassic joy is watching and feeling the best motion pictures have to offer. Together with the most comfortable seats in town, it's a pleasant safari with monstrous animals, some over 60 million years old.The larger point writer/director Colin Trevorrow and writer Emily Carmichael make is about cooperation-be it among family and co-workers or dinos and humans, we have no choice but to work in harmony. Or otherwise, damnation it is or total annihilation. Having lived in the last three years with a microscopic monster, it's nice to see ones big as buildings with the hope that we will survive together, if only in the salutary world of Hollywood dreams.Jurassic World Dominion is a most pleasant way to enjoy a summer night out, even when it hints of extinction:""The doomsday clock might be out of time.""

Remember the sense of wonder and excitement you felt? How about the horror and anxiety you felt when the Velociraptors were stalking the children in the kitchen? There is nothing like that in this corporate, bland piece of uninspired trash they call a movie. Somehow they managed to make dinosaurs uninteresting and boring, while completely squandering the talent of Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill and Laura Dern. It really is a remarkable feat. The film feels like it was designed by an AI. It is a vacuous, empty, soulless experience that absolutely defecates all over the legacy of Jurassic Park and why people loved it in the first place.The writing is abysmal. Locusts and genetically modified children take center stage while the dinosaurs are reduced to flashy CGI showpieces that occasionally pop out to eat somebody or menacingly stalk the main characters before they are tamed by Chris Pratt's magic hands. The entire Malta scene was basically a Mission Impossible knockoff complete with some snazzy British villainess and a car chase. It felt so utterly out of place. Unfortunately once all the main characters get to Apple HQ... I mean Biosyn, the film gets even worse. The entire film feels weightless and empty. There are no stakes, the audience doesn't care about any of the two dimensional characters that are introduced and nothing feels earned. There is no sense of urgency or danger because the movie is too cowardly to kill anyone or put anyone in actual peril. Trevorrow then desperately tries to cram mindless nostalgia down your throat in an effort to mask his horrible film making and complete lack of originality.Some of the dinosaur scenes are cool, but this film just feels like a celebration of mediocrity. The original cast are reduced to parodies of themselves while all the interesting and thought provoking ideas from the first film are thrown out the window in exchange for some mindless plot about GMOs and giant insect swarms. Jurassic Park was good because it was intelligent. It was thought provoking. The dinosaurs were shown sparingly, and the scenes with the human characters were equally as important and interesting. In comparison, Dominion is stupid, bland and unoriginal, and makes Jurassic World look like a masterpiece. And what a waste. The Jurassic World Series had so much potential and it was utterly squandered.I can't even recommend this film as a 'turn off your brain and enjoy the special effects' kind of movie like Transformers or Fast and Furious. This movie is utterly uninteresting, and no amount of CGI dinosaurs can save it from being a total waste of your time and money. It is a Frankenstein Jurassic Park drained of all the magic, warmth and charm of the original. Skip it, and watch the dinosaur scenes on YouTube.","17 out of 28 found this helpful.

I must say it was good to see the original gang together again, and cool to see both generations finally come together towards the end, however by that time it felt like too many characters having to share the scenes.I'm so happy that they used practical effects and animatronics as well as the usual cgi and digital effects. The dinosaurs look just as real as anything else in the film. Great set design too.The big issue I had with this film is the overall lack of dinosaurs. In parts the film felt more like a Mission Impossible film or another generic action movie. Overall they reduced the dinosaurs to background characters.The acting isn't great, and Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's characters don't have the same chemistry as they did in previous films which is disappointing. The addition of new characters in the final film felt pointless when they had characters from the previous film who weren't used in this one, that could have taken the place of these new additions.There was no real conclusion and this film ended in a similar way to how the previous one did. Some fun Easter eggs to please the fans but overall disappointing for what's meant to be the end of the era.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I am so proud of them.Can I just say stupid, predictable, self-centered kid as usual. One minute on screen and she's complaining, yelling, doesn't care about anyone, etc. Doesn't any of the Hollywood script writers have nice, polite, courteous kids??Is this movie worth watching for all you adults with kids out there. NO. The dinasaur action is great. After that, it is dumb, a poor example for what you want your kid to be, at every corner, it is so predictable AND unrealistic in almost all the action sceens. There is absolutey nothing new in this movie, nothing unexpected (one example; plain crashes into solid ice, buried in the ice, totally destroyed, the two actors jump out unharmed, not a scratch, all makeup intact.

It's been almost 30 years since Steve Spielberg captivated us, and John Hammond (the late Sir Richard Attenborough) ""spared no expense"" in stunning Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) with our first look at dinosaurs in JURASSIC PARK (1993). Best-selling author Michael Crichton's original characters and ideas have since spun off into THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (1997), JURASSIC PARK III (2001), JURASSIC WORLD (2015), and JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM (2018). We now have this latest franchise entry to cap off the second dinosaur trilogy, and it finds director Colin Trevorrow back at the helm. He also wrote the story and screenplay with Derek Connolly and Emily Carmichael.The big news here (other than the dinosaurs) is the 4-doctor reunion of Dr. Alan Grant (Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), and Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong). It's the first time all of these characters have reunited since the original, and those of us who hold a special place in our movie heart for the transformative 1993 film, are most appreciative of the nostalgic touch. However, the hopes for a magical finale to conclude the franchise are dashed in the film's opening segment ... a cringe-worthy ""news"" report designed to catch us up four years after the destruction of Isla Numbar, and set the stage for what's to come.You might assume that dinosaurs roaming our planet would be the headliner, but somehow locusts get the nod. Well, they are genetically modified locusts threatening the world's non-Biosyn food supply. See, Biosyn is the evil corporation run by twitchy CEO Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) that is attempting to control dinosaurs, the food supply, and even human cloning via DNA manipulation. It's that last part that brings Maisie Lockwood (an excellent Isabella Sermon) into the fold, and the DNA-mix also provides an easy punchline to Trevorrow's approach to this final film (blending DNA from the two trilogies). Maisie has been living deep in the Sierra Nevada forest with Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard). When poachers nab both the offspring of Owen's favorite raptor and his quasi-offspring Maisie, the hunt is on. The only question remaining is how are they going to finesse this so that the old crew (Grant and Ellie) collides with the new crew (Owen and Claire)?A stop in Malta to confront smuggler Santos (an impeccably dressed Dichen Lachman) results in the film's most frenetic action sequence. As Owen eludes trained killer-raptors while zipping his motorcycle across streets, alleys, and stairwells, Claire is sprinting (not in high heels) across rooftops like she's Jason Bourne or James Bond. While Owen and Claire deliver the heart-pounding action, Ellie has tracked down Grant on a dig in New Mexico, where he's ""educating"" a group of teenagers who remain glued to their mobile devices. Ellie convinces Grant to help in her mission to expose Biosyn, but we get the feeling he's making the trip for her, not to save humanity. With an assist from ice-cold pilot-for-hire Kayla Watts (DeWanda Wise), everyone ends in Italy's Dolomite Mountains at Biosyn's stunning headquarters. Slowly the connections become apparent, as it's Malcolm (Goldblum) who is the resident philosopher (all evil corps need one), and the one who has been feeding intel to Ellie.The rest of the movie exists so that all of these characters, along with Biosyn whistleblower Ramsay (Mamoudou Athie) can get in and out of trouble and dodge various stages of peril. The callbacks and nods to previous 'Jurassic' films are numerous. Some work and some don't. Malcolm's sardonic quips are mostly in tune, Grant's grumping and knowledge are spot on, and Ellie has remarkably little to do for someone who is responsible for one of the two main plot lines. Owen and Claire spend the bulk of their non-Malta time consistently recreating the facial expressions that have become all too familiar, though of course, Owen does get to hold out his palm in an attempt at controlling dinosaurs. There is a well-timed small dose of John Williams' iconic score from 1993, but it's the musical work of composer Michael Giacchino who mostly guides us along the way.Credit goes to director Trevorrow for the multiple location shoots around the globe, which helps minimize the set pieces ... most of which disappoint. Especially surprising was the weak CGI effort in the mines as some of the characters end up where they shouldn't be. DNA manipulation run amok is perhaps the underlying theme, but we have to ask why this is ... all we really desire are cool dinosaurs and a story that makes sense. Despite the film's best shot coming at the end - a Mosasaurus underwater - we do hope that, in regards to continuing the franchise, Hollywood doesn't find a way.Opens in theaters on June 10, 2022.","7 out of 25 found this helpful.

First half of it, is wasted between boring teenage angst situations and useless scenes in some underground bazaar, where we are introduced to characters that we will never hear from again in the movie and that fulfil no useful role.When the movie finally picks up and we go to the company facilities, where we should have gone much earlier, the movie is again wasted in meaningless heroics, plane crashes without a scratch, swimming through freezing water and such goodies.In the meantime, everything comes too fast and too easy. Everything is there at the moment that is needed and every bad guy, and gal, immediately tell the truth about their purposes at the first question as if we just wanna move quickly to the next scene without adding any depth.This movie has too many characters. They try to give a significant part to each one of them and of course in the end this falls short, as expected when you stretch a script so thin.Maybe they could have saved it if they spent more time in the jungle as we all hoped, but no.This better be the last Jurassic park, before they go the fast and furious way.5/10 and that's generous.","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Far better than Fallen Kingdom and a worthy conclusion","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8223383/?ref_=tt_urv","ryanthomasmitchell","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25049614/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2022","I don't know what people were expecting with this movie and why many seem to be up in arms about it. I am a big fan of the first film and saw it in theaters as a child upon its release. For many, including myself, the magic of that first movie is never going to be topped and it's impossible to think it could be.That said, the second film has always been dull to me (and Jeff Goldblum seemed to be playing a different character than Ian Malcolm altogether). The third has solid moments but some silly ones as well. Jurassic World seemed to rejuvenate the franchise and was a good movie overall, but nothing mind-blowing in my opinion.Then we have Fallen Kingdom, which I believe is easily the worst in the series. Strange plot, terrible pacing, weird directorial choices left and right. The main characters and their motivations seemed completely different than what you would have expected from their portrayal in Jurassic World.That movie also ended with the concept of a world filled with dinosaurs - a point which people seem to be rolling their eyes about, now that Dominion has to address it.This is unfair. Dominion is a movie that must take the plot threads that are limply presented in Fallen Kingdom and then spin a sequel out of them. On top of that, it must weave in the cast of the beloved first film and make a satisfying conclusion out of both stories.And guess what? I think it accomplishes this, and much better than I expected it would. The movie is exciting, well-paced, well-acted, and has far fewer eyeroll moments than the critics would have you believe.At this point, I think you're either along for the ride or you aren't. If you're only casually aware of Jurassic Park and you go into this movie somewhat blind, it would probably seem like a mess of convoluted plot points. But if you're coming off of Fallen Kingdom, this feels like a breath of fresh air and a fun ride.I would honestly rank this movie as the second best Jurassic Park movie, behind the original. And Ian Malcolm's portrayal in this film is perfect, unlike what we got in Lost World. It's a joy to see.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

There were kids in the theater and even they were bored.The whole point of Jurassic Park is the fear that the ancient predators are SUPPOSED to invoke. The terror from the original for me came when chars did everything logical and still got eaten. In this, you can out run raptors on foot, hide barely a inch underwater, slowly walk away from a dino as long as there's a car between you, and if you do get cornered without a weapon... just hold out your hand. WTF?! The writers have been watching too much How to Train Your Dragon. Why was the whole movie about locusts and not the dinosaurs?! They could've at least made them carnivorous locusts and had a scene where they stripped a bronto to bones in minutes. At least there's be some real threat in this pointless movie. I'm joking but it might've been a better movie if they took half the human leads out and had Blue the raptor fight her way through all the new species herself.Save your money. Gas, food, and tickets are too expensive now to be wasted on this movie.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

And the legacy and current cast blending is somewhat outstanding. This movie gave me so many memories in many scenes with how the scenes played out. The issue is dont take someone to see a film if they dont understand the story arc. Just dont take anyone with you who lacks interest. Otherwise the experience for you will get ruined. Ive seen all the jurassic films going way back to the first film in 93. The hype for me was worth it and if your in the UK for 4.99 a ticket at VUE cinemas is so worth it.

The storyline follows a world that is trying to adjust to dinosaurs being a regular part of every day life. Meanwhile an evil organization looks to exploit circumstances by creating genetically engineered locusts to destroy the Earths food so you need to rely on them to survive...oh, and they want to steal Hammond's cloned niece. It will take the heroes from every movie of the Jurassic Park series to save the day.This movie is directed by Colin Trevorrow (Jurassic World) and stars Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy), Jeff Goldblum (The Fly), Sam Neill (Event Horizon), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Mamoudou Athie (Uncorked) and Laura Dern (Blue Velvet).This movie, unfortunately, it's about the same as Jurassic World: Kingdom. The dinosaurs and special effects are awesome. There's some tremendous species of dinosaurs and dinosaur battles, especially the last one. Unfortunately for the storyline, it reminded me of John Wick 3, just an excuse for dinosaur scenes like that John Wick was just an excuse for action scenes with a flimsy cliché storyline. There were also too many subplots going on in here - some were fun and entertaining (black market and underground trade was well done, locusts and cloned child not so much). The acting was fine but the cast could have been way better utilized with better writing.Overall this was a fun popcorn flick as long as you go in with the right mind set. Think of it like watching Fast and Furious, Transformers and John Wick; no it's not going to be a good movie, but the dinosaurs are cool. I would score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The Comedy: The Jurassic Park series has always had some string of comedy sprinkled in the darker world of the survival pictures. Dominion goes a little more into this realm, working to make it very funny and sometimes in the modern style of more is better. Pratt and Goldblum are the primary haulers of the comedy, while the other characters sneak their own levels of laughs into the mix. Yet my favorite styles were some of the dinosaur moments and how the managed to make several of them have a little more human side and deliver that comedic punch to rock our worlds. Though forced a bit at times, the comedy really is decently done and feels back to being natural and well-placed like the first movies.Lots of Dinosaurs: It's a movie about dinosaurs and well you get dinosaurs... where others have shown their cards and given you a few species to enjoy and get glimpses of, Dominion really makes this supposed final act, have all the dinosaurs that you could want in this short run time. While some of them are the classic monsters you remember, there are other species from various eras that arise from the shadows and most of them feel just as sinister and destructive as you hope for in this series. So for those tired of the typical thunder lizards, you'll be in for a treat at the variety the movie brought with it.The Musical Score: Hands down another great lineage to this movie, the musical score is certainly one that still gives me goosebumps when I hear it boom over the speakers. Like the sound editing that brings the roars to life, the sixth part of the saga has the powerful orchestra work to add emotion to the scene and pull you into the full experience. Softer tones accompany or proceed the pounding orchestra blast that this series does super well. It's part of the movie theater experience worthy tone of this movie series and one of my favorite parts of the movie.The Pace: While certainly not the target pace of the first film, Dominion manages to still keep the action going and keep things moving. For all the story elements this movie juggled, it did not do a half-bad job for me in them working it to remain entertaining. From the opening moments that sum up the events before to getting into the Dinosaur action and solutions, it really just keeps a steady pace without dawdling too much on the truth. Again, the result is an entertaining adventure for fans of the series to enjoy and just get more Dinosaur carnage and rampaging on the screen.The Acting: While certainly not the most unique or Oscar worthy in terms of roles and performances, the movie's repertoire of actors and actresses accomplishes the fun I like to see in these movies. Pratt is Pratt, he's goofy, but action hero epic, as he does his best to tame the primitive and fearsome beasts that are on the screen. He's the typical hero role we've come to love in him, and he has some great moves to finish this series off. Howard is probably the one with the most dynamic range in this film, her character getting a lot more time and scenarios than other characters at this time. As a result, she accomplished much in her character's growth and ability, really selling the emotions for the most part and giving me more to like about Claire while avoiding going too far down the stoic warrior path. As for Dern, she's a master of her trade, and I liked the new Ellie that was still the same quality components we got in number one, but still adding some new qualities that shows what she has been doing for the last three decades. As for the rest of the group, they do a great job with the parts handed and there are too many to go through given how loaded the film is. However, the summary is: Neal is great if a bit underutilized, Sermon is funny and replays the role quite well, Wise is tough, funny, and reminiscent of the American pilot trope from Spielberg films, while Goldblum accomplishes much in that same steal the show moment you love.The Character Use: While nowhere near perfect, Dominion does a better job than I intended of keeping the cast involved in the entire film, at least the human cast. With all sorts of characters to try and pull into one final act, you have a lot of stories, actors, and teams to try and keep ingrained in the tale. Old cast may not be the most involved at times, but hit at the moments that matter and give the loyal fans everything they need to wrap up this portion of the Jurassic World series, including laughs and a few tropes that you might be wanting to see. As for the new ones this part of the series, they get a lot more of the time and again accomplish the goal of expanding the story, whilst still being fun avatars to live through in this world.The Chase Scene/Action At Times: The trailers showed an exciting scene of dinosaurs and bikes, and you know what... it accomplished it big time. I loved the race through the streets, a feeling of Mission Impossible meeting Dinos as they raced for survival in this CGI world. I absolutely loved this moment and felt it was the highlight of the action for this movie and the true climactic experience, if not a little cheesy at times. Other action scenes felt very part of the world, and there is a few big beast fights that you'll be wanting to see that really have some fun qualities to them, including one epic finish. As such, the action does accomplish its role for this series and should have the extreme fanatics stomping their feet in delight.The Graphics: By far, the ability of studios to make dinosaurs come to life is still something that, to quote Laura Dern, ""you never get used to!"". For me, I love seeing the beasts come to life, finding the balance between computer graphic use and animatronics to bring these ancient creatures back to life. With modern technology, the computer work has never looked better in textures and stationary shots, while the robots are still impressive, but a little more artificial at times, though still doing a fantastic job of making them pop off the screen.The Action At Times: Again, more beasts and humans, means a bit more of other qualities being scattered and the action is again one of those moments. Prior to the new trilogy, Jurassic Park's action was mostly about survival in the world of the largest carnivores. While some of that does exist, Dominion seems to have diluted most of it to the modern day action, leading to some great moments mentioned above, but also weaker elements you had hoped would be a bit more intense in the long run. The result is less intense action moments and feel like there are less stakes to be had.The Subplots: Characters have to have arcs and backgrounds to be engaging right? Well, Jurassic World: Dominion does have that, only with so many characters in the mix they are a little diluted and bland. Both old and new have things they can certainly pursue, but sadly don't do well with everybody on the screen. The new pilot who lives life dangerously, Malcolm's story over the last two decades of what's happened with him, even Ellie to an extent all feel very simplistic given what it could have been. It's not horrible, and checks the box for complete, but for those invested in the characters, don't expect the most thought out character plots for others.The Main Story: By far the weaker of the tales, was indeed the story of Jurassic World Dominion. Painting a very broad stroke and keeping all the characters in it, this movie is not quite the focused feature the others have been. While most merely just want a survival film filled with dinosaurs and more dinosaurs, others again want to be engaged with the film. Again, for me, this film diluted both and the great overarching story is a little more political story than actually engaging feature. The villain is simplified and boring, the solutions to the problems almost as dry and uncreative, as they simply work through things. Throw in the predictability, the lack of suspense, and the statistical probability of what is going to happen and the plot becomes less impressive in favor of the flash in a pan gimmick.The Lack of Suspense and Terror: By far, the lack of suspense and terror is what I was missing in this film. Jurassic World has lost so much of the thing that drew us into the first series, the intensity of surviving the next encounter and how they got out, racking us with terror as the fake monsters tried to tear their way to food. For me, that feeling has been gone since number three, replaced with an almost action/drama feel that while it has it's good parts, is still not the same edge it once had. I did not find myself talking to the screen encouraging them to go, go, go like I once did and that was a bit sad for me really. It was this lack of intensity that II think was the weakest component of the movie and the lack of intensity is the component that really made the movie drawl in my case.The VERDICT:The supposed last installment of the great dinosaur movie was entertaining and fun, with the effects being the main thing to experience in theater. It juggles the cast well, makes for a fun use of multiple dinosaur species, and breaks open the music and technology to craft the world. It handles the cast decently well and keeps that engaging pace you want in a movie like this, devoid of any complex plot of processing. However, even the simple adventure like that lacks the bite of the original series, putting almost too much in one film that it spreads the quality across the two-hours unevenly and in many ways less than the potential it had. The biggest disappointment with me was in fact the lack of terror and suspense, this component almost washed out entirely given the predictability of the tale. So, factoring that in my scores of the movie are:Action/Adventure/sci-fi: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

They aren't terribly new plots, but they aren't necessarily the traditional Jurassic park plots. I am pretty sure they took inspiration from Christons other book Prey (this is a wild leap because I haven't read the book just heard the synopsis).They had action, they had humor, they had moral dilemma, they had philosophy, they had romance, they had familial love, they had science fiction and most importantly, they had loads and loads of dinosaurs. They even had updated ones using the most recent knowledge from paleontology.I get it was a lot of ""fanporn"" so some people are upset, but that's why I am giving it a good review.

I wouldn't say it's too long; they crammed a lot into 2 and half hours, it only felt long for the first 50min because it wasn't until then that any actual action occurred. We do get to see plenty of dinosaurs in that time, though, a lot in fact, as they had accumulated across the world and been processed/handled appropriately by the government. This they did really well on writing and execution. The whole Maisie situation was eyeroll heavy but not as bad as Fallen Kingdom in my opinion. Some of my biggest gripes were dinosaur behavior (a herbivore killing deer and challenging apex predators), characters not using their guns during standoffs with raptors, and the inaccurate design of the Giga. But hey, all in good fun, right? The action was abundant, even if the characters were invincible, Grant and Sattler had a lot of screentime, Malcolm too, Pratt was great and my favorite, Claire, possibly had all of the best scenes. New raptor designs were immensely appreciated, I just wish they had been involved in more than a predictable chase scene. The amount of animatronics and practical effects were shocking, I give major props to that; the dimetrodon sequence was amazing! Sure, the flick has its flaws and hiccups, but what JW doesn't? It felt like a sound conclusion to the series to me, though I still yearn for more.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It is the highly anticipated sixth installment in the Jurassic Park franchise. In Dominion, we find out whether the dinosaurs, who were released into the world at the end of Fallen Kingdom, have been integrated into the greater society and what effect their presence has on the broader ecosystem. It's been almost 30 years since we were first introduced to dinosaurs in modern times; but, six films later, are we still in awe of the scientific feats of DNA splicing and cloning? Here's whether going back to Jurassic World is worth all of that anticipation.Jurassic World: Dominion brings back Owen Grady (Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Howard), who are raising the teenage clone, Maisie Lockwood (Sermon). They are protecting her from evil corporate interests who seek to capture and study her for their own nefarious reasons. Also, Elli Sattler (Dern) and Alan Grant (Neill) are back to investigate a potential ecological disaster brought on by genetically modified locusts rabidly devouring the world's crops. Then, there is Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) and Ramsay Cole (Athie) as fixtures of the corporation, Biosyn, which is at the center of all of these machinations. There's also a dynamic pilot, Kayla Watts (Wise), and a manipulative CEO of Biosyn, Lewis Dodgson (Scott). Oh man, did I forget anything? Um... prehistoric ravenous hijinks ensue.Okay, as you can see, there is a lot going on in Jurassic World: Dominion. It's not necessarily complicated, but it is a lot to follow. These Jurassic Park movies always have a bit of an issue getting bogged down explaining the science of this all. In Dominion, they have to talk about genetic splicing and cloning and ecology, and it just goes on and on. Sattler and Grant are focused on stealing the DNA of these destructive locusts to prove that Biosyn is evil. Owen and Claire are focused on protecting Maisie from Biosyn. In a sense, it feels like so much is going on that there is not enough time for the characters to run and scream from the dinosaurs. That's the unfortunate part if you really like that aspect from the original.Despite these reservations of the plot, the movie does have its exciting parts. There are dinosaur chases through the streets, through the jungle and through the Biosyn facilities. DeWanda Wise plays a tough-as-nails, wisecracking pilot, who seems to be the most competent of all of our characters. She gets good one-liners and has a magnetic personality. Her presence adds a lot of energy to what could become stale. I'll also note that the legacy characters of Sattler, Grant and Malcolm give exactly what you want. It's like no time has passed at all. The nostalgia is very high and they effectively scratch that Jurassic Park itch.Ultimately, Jurassic World: Dominion is an enjoyable, escapist summer blockbuster. The problem here is that there is too much going on and it doesn't exactly all come together. There are probably too many characters that distract from the main attraction - the dinosaurs. Nevertheless, there are good dinosaur chases and exciting moments with a great new character played by DeWanda Wise. While I wouldn't call Jurassic World: Dominion essential, it certainly is good enough for a matinee viewing, so get your bowl of popcorn.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It has come in many shapes and sizes. Different life forms have been around for different amounts of time. They have also occupied different corners of the world depending on temperature, terrain and other circumstances. We, humans, have been around for a very short time yet. Right now, though, we are dominant. The planet is ours. There is no telling for how much longer, considering how we, humanity, tend to handle the world around us and each other. But there was once, let's say, a group of creatures that are well-known for two reasons, at least. Their ""once"" lasted for around one and a half hundred million years. During that ""once"", they absolutely dominated pretty much every corner of the planet. No other group of life forms has ever dominated the planet as long. That's ""one"". They were also the largest creatures that have ever walked. Possibly, so big nothing will ever beat them. Gravity and air conditions limit the size of animals. Dinosaurs were both the biggest herbivore and carnivore creatures ever to inhabit the dry-land. That's ""two"". They had, let's say, relatives both in the water and in the air. Both were also huge. Sixty-five million years ago, all of them went extinct, dinosaurs, water and air reptiles, all of them. Since we discovered them, we've been fascinated by them. How numerous they were, how various they were, and how enormous some of them were. ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" is the sixth one in the biggest dinosaur related film series. Like most old and famous ones, this film series hasn't been feeling so good lately. How is ""Dominion"" doing?Whoever watches these movies because of dinosaurs only, will probably see it as the weakest in the series. The dinosaur visual effects that these movies use were once groundbreaking. Since then, however, they haven't gone anywhere new. They no longer surprise audiences. And some of them may have even degraded. Also, cinematography in general could have been better. If that doesn't bother dinosaur fans, then a complication in the plot of the film can do that. ""Dominion"" isn't exactly a dinosaur movie. Rather, it is a movie about a possible end of the world. What's good about it, though, is the movie uses no miracle to solve the problem, it relies on science. This isn't ""Interstellar"". Whoever watches these movies because of picturesque locations will see something new, rather than yet another tropical island. Seriously, it's nice to see familiar dinosaurs in new environments. What's even nicer is how the film shows the dinosaurs disoriented and scared. They are not your typical ""movie monsters"" here. Unless they have been caged and treated in ways that would turn any living thing into a monster. Whoever watches these movies because of characters will see the old heroes and the new heroes going on dangerous missions and joining forces to take down the bad guys. By the way, the old heroes do not return for a handful of minutes and they do not return to be humiliated by the plot. They return because of their experience and the authority they have gained previously on this series. This is not ""Disney Star Wars"".In conclusion, the movie could have focused more on dinosaurs. The visuals could have been better. The story could have been simpler. Or it could have been enough for two movies, two big parts of one story, like some big budget movies do sometimes. But even with all the weak spots, ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" isn't pointless. Nor is it heartless.

Take risks, hire people based on talent, START with an excellent story. Anyway do not watch this movie is you care about good story and good film making. This movie was just sad and hard to watch. It was all just pointless. It was all just boring. You didnt care. Colin Trevor needs to stop being allowed to make movies.

It's basically the same movie as the last one with a weaker and more tedious plot. But it just has more big action, dinosaurs, and previous as well as new characters. I honestly don't understand why they made this, the story doesn't even have a connection to the finale. Because it's about a genetics corporation called Biosyn who genetically made a big grasshopper (or whatever they're called) to snuff out humanity's main food chain across the globe. The dinosaurs don't even have a big part in the movie or the plot. It's just like they give these characters one last adventure before they can finally rest and coexist with the dinosaurs which they already did like four years ago. But overall, it was really a fun and exciting adventure, the actions are the best in the trilogy.The cinematography, production design, and camera work are definitely the best as well. It's so aesthetic and eye-pleasing, especially when every time they introduce a new dinosaur and in the final minutes.(NOTE: the movie can be too loud at some point, so brace yourself)","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Beyond that though, this installment just didn't do it for me, which is a shame because I love Jurassic Park and thought the first Jurassic World was actually very decent. But this one is way too long and drawn out, cringe writing at times, annoying characters, and strange pacing. The ""villain"" aka the guy who looks eerily identical to Apple CEO Tim Cook (did they do that on purpose?) was terribly written and completely useless.

And another trope of the big bad corporation that was so predictable the whole time. Throw in a black lady with attitude, and it just seems like the goal was less telling a story and more appealing to constituents. And people are right. 2.5 hours is way too long for this simple story when nothing of significance warranted it.I think the final problem form me was the now common story element: telling us our elected government officials can or will take care of a major problem such as corporate malfeasance.

The actors were not all there and their interactions with their environment and dinosaur counterparts were so uneven unnatural and inharmonious.The attempt at reunion of two generations of actors was too on the nose to have any impact. Most of the screen play was just a rehearsal of what has been seen before. There was also too many overly convenient set pieces to push forward an already absent plot. Too easy for the characters to get out of seemingly dangerous situations and all attempts at any tension fell flat. Also, no character development what so ever. Agreed, these are characters we are already familiar with but not a single character can have a progression, come on. The villain also is a joke as are the locusts and their pointless involvement in the story.It's not all bad because there's is outstanding visuals and some world building that was left unexplored.

I've loved this franchise since I saw the original at 10 years old and being able to take my son to his first movie might make me a little biased, but I loved it more than him. That has everything you want in a summer block buster. Great set pieces, mediocre acting, and dinosaurs fighting each other. Of course it's stupid. Of course it's campy. Of course it's cheesy. Have you not seen any of the other ones for the past 30 years?I made the mistake of looking at the reviews before hand and thought I was going to be wasting 2 hours. Not only would I have loved it solo, but I made a core memory for me and my kid. I'm sure if I spent hours afterwards analyzing the plot and the character arcs I would feel the same way, but I don't do that with movies starring Chris Pratt. If you like dinosaurs or any of the Jurassic Parks/Worlds, see this. There are a few throwback jokes to the original which make it all worth it for the old crowd and my five-year-old was at the edge of his seat the whole time - probably because he had to pee, but more likely because of the Giganotosaurus and Quetzalcoatlus. See the movie. Enjoy yourself. And for 2 1/2 hours try not to think about the chaos that we are actually living in.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I enjoyed seeing the dinosaurs that was probably my favourite part of the movie, that and Alan Grant of course, that's when they were on screen anyway and not giant locus. It definitely lacked that feel of dinosaurs being everywhere overall as they decided to make it cricket focused instead for some reason and to have a big bad be the science corporations and not the dinosaurs running around which is what I would have preferred. The movie was also kind of messy with many plots going on all at once with some cheesy dialogue thrown in. I wanted to love this movie but they made a really uninteresting plot that still could've been better. The dinosaurs were great though I loved seeing all the unique species to this movie and even got some surprises in there too. I loved seeing the dinosaurs around the real world and co existing or at least trying to, I thought that made for a really unique couple of scenes. I definitely enjoyed the movie but if I wanted to watch it again I'd probably skip to the scenes with the dinosaurs I liked as the plot was all over the place. To be fair I only come to see dinosaurs in these movies and action scenes of sorts and I definitely got them but overall it was only brief moments in the entirety of the movie. I hope they do more and make a movie about the dinosaurs living among the humans more. I do have to say the cinematography with the dinosaurs was really beautiful on the screen and the music was great which I found out at the end to be the same person who did the Batman music. Anyway for now I'll stick to the original trilogy.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The script for ""Jurassic World Dominion"" couldn't possibly get a passing grade in a college screenwriting class. No chance.Seven minutes in, I thought, ""With all that money, they couldn't get a director?"" It's really as if there was no director, just a cinematographer who said, ""Start acting.""Around minute 33:00, I thought, ""They could have hired actors who can act, for the smaller roles, but for some reason they chose not to."" (Sentiment reconfirmed in the helicopter scenes and then, perhaps even more brutally, if such a thing is possible, in the scenes after the helicopter landed.)I'm a screenwriter and a playwright, and I work really hard on my scripts. It is an interesting fact that Hollywood consistently produces scripts that are, at best, notes for a screenplay. It's as if the script is of no consequence at all to Hollywood execs. Does this seem odd to anyone?The world needs great stories and great scripts . . . And we have neither in the film, ""Jurassic World Dominion."" Imagine the wonderful independent films, based on great stories, that could have been produced for the $160 million price-tag of this absurd ""blockbuster.""Who allowed this script? Where was the director? Can someone tell me?I know where the audience members are. They are back home, thinking, ""What did I just waste my money on?""","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

Yes, the storyline is not great and the first 25 minute or so were less than exciting. It did however, get better as it went on and it was great to see Drs. Grant, Sattler and Malcolm from the original three films and if one can put the plot weakness out of mind for a time, there are some genuinely thrilling and exciting moments in the movie. Above all, there are the dinosaurs, the real stars of the show - and don't they know it. We get to see new ones like Baryonyx, Allosaurus and Atrociraptor, as well as old favourites such as Brachiosaurus, Velociraptor and of course, T-Rex, without which no Jurassic movie would be complete. (Yes, T-Rex was from the Upper Cretaceous, as were most animals in these movies, but just go with it.) So, if you love dinosaurs, it's worth watching just to see them in action once more, especially T-Rex who never disappoints!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm not sure why people are bashing this film so much. Are they paid trolls? Is it as good and original as the first film? No, but relative to what films are being produced currently this is a good effort and holds its own. You can tell they put a lot of effort into filming all of these scenes, even if there is a lot of CGI, it looks pretty good. Honestly the first couple minutes of the film were the worst, which is odd, why that didn't look better. I will rate this film a 7/10. Is it slightly long and unoriginal? Yes, but still worth watching. They respect the characters and universe well enough and provide decent entertainment for 2+ hours. Don't be a hater, 1,2, or 3 rating is too harsh, and I gave the previous installment a 2, but this film is better, hence this review.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

JW: Dominion, the sixth film of the Jurassic franchise, takes the idea of co-existence to the next level, where dinosaurs roam freely in this world like any other animal species. Believe me, it's dumber than it sounds, but somehow, I managed to trick my mind to get along with the idea (like we had any other choice). Anyways, following the events of JW: Fallen Kingdom, dinosaurs are being illegally exported to different parts of the world and Maisie Lockwood now lives with Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). Also Blue have a baby now. Two different storylines lead our Jurassic World team to meet the Jurassic Park team in the third act of the film.It won't be wrong to say that there are as many reasons to dislike this film as we have to like it. Let's first talk about the likeable aspects of the film. The visuals of this film are unlike any other film in the franchise and the production value is much higher. Without any doubt, with the advancement of CGI and VFX technology, from a design perspective Dominion is far better than most of its predecessor films. There are lots of new dinosaurs we get to see throughout the film and for those who just want to see cool dinosaurs on the big screen, it's a treat. The cinematography is brilliant. As mentioned earlier it was a one-time kind of experience to watch the original cast back all together and also they have a proper role to play and contribute to the story with balanced screentime. Jeff Goldblum stands out with his skilful performance and humorous dialogues. The film expands Maisie's story and reveals more about her past. The opening sequence might end up being one of my favourite opening sequences of this franchise and the first 10-12 mins were very satisfying.All this looks great when we see them as individual set pieces but director Colin Trevorrow in establishing his vision forgot what we the audience wanted from him. The thrill, the tension and the horror. Dominion lacks all of these. Even Jurassic Park III is more thrilling compared to this film. The core idea of co-existence itself was flawed but nothing was more painful and disappointing than seeing dinosaurs being sidelined as they aren't much of a threat now. The trailer was too revealing. A few scenes seem extremely fake and the stakes were too low because we already know that nothing can happen to our protagonist. Campbell Scott as the main villain was not at all compelling and in an overly-crowded film, no one demanded his presence either. Trevorrow co-wrote this with Derek Connolly, but still, it seems heavily inspired by countless movies. Dominion feels more like a Tom Cruise spy film than a science-fiction adventure. Writing is not only unpleasant but depends heavily on coincidences.Dominion lacks the awesomeness of Spielberg's OG nail-biting horror adventure and the terror of Trevorrow's own Jurassic World. Jurassic Park (I, II and III) were all about dinosaurs and Dominion should have kept itself confined inside that predefined boundary. No matter how rich and lavish Dominion looks from the outside, from inside it's completely hollow. There is no doubt that fans of this franchise (including myself) won't be relying on any reviews and hence like all films of the franchise, this one too is going to be a massive success no matter what. Looking forward to your thoughts on this film in the comments (Letterboxd: m_movie_reviews) if you have watched it.Rating: 6.2/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this film for its entertainment purposes but for the end of the trilogy it needed more. Where fallen kingdom left of I thought now some of the dinosaurs would have caused so much destruction that earth turned into the planet of the apes style world. But no for the most part everyone is getting on. Owen and claire have their adopted daughter and live in a cabin but when a threat of mutated locusts appears for some reason that becomes the focal point of everything. The strongest thing here was bringing back legacy characters, which in my opinion they did well. Neil,durn and goldbloom brought charm that we needed and really them being in this film made it so much better. Of course though the dinosaur threat could have been better but still an enjoyable film for what it is.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I mean, he's not wrong. Spielberg's film is a perfect blend of practical effects that helped bring the horror of rampaging dinosaurs to life. I'd forgive any of the sequels if they actually did anything interesting with the concept past what the original did. As it stands, even bringing back three members of the original cast for Jurassic World: Dominion (2022) just highlighted how repetitive this franchise has become.At the end of Fallen Kingdom (2018), there was a whole wide world of dinosaurs to explore, but the Park and World crews instead team up to go to yet another island filled with resurrected dinosaurs. Sure, some of them have feathers this time around, and we get a few ""new"" dinosaurs fighting old favorites, but it's literally the same plot as ever. Even Jeff Goldblum's character is literally lecturing this fact to the residents of knock-off Apple island. Also, the irony of literal man-eating dinosaurs roaming the world and the human population being more concerned about ""rEtUrNiNg tO tHe bEaCh"" had such strong Jaws (1975) vibes that echo true today.Now, in my opinion, Dominion isn't terrible. It has its fun moments and wraps up some storylines from previous films in the World franchise. The bits in the ""real world"" were a great way to show some moments of potential peaceful human/dinosaur scenarios-which is rare in this franchise. I also found the new character of Kayla Watts (DeWandaWise) to be an extremely interesting individual, both in her background and in sheer awesome character design. More of her, please.More of the same, starring more of the same, I give Jurassic World: Dominion 3.0 stars out of 5.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie takes inspiration from modern day kaiju movies where the characters are secondary to the primary monster duels which has greatly affected the orginal franchise's plot and character based storyline. The movie could have been directed better by Michael Bay with more explosions and no dinosaurs. The movie makes dinosaur lovers grind their teeths in frustration.

All of those in a movie are distracting and not enjoyable.The only good things were Sam Neill at 74 looked AMAZING and I loved this black lady who was a pilot (yet she only had about 8-minutes of screen time).Also, I absolutely hate it when a movie preaches to me and then ends the movie with what they THINK is an original, profound statement that you've seen and heard a 1,000,000 times before which was - ""we can all get along and live in harmony no matter how different we are"".

No problem with the suspension of disbelief there, especially with the added details of feathers, and other such anatomically precise renderings.But the story and acting, well, more than a bit disappointing.It seems they were trying too hard to play up the nostalgia and humorous dialogue woven into this. As for generic family viewing, this really is more of a movie for kids, with the parents and adults getting their layers of content almost as more of an afterthought.The one character that really stood out was DeWanda Wise's ""Kayla"", the gritty, been around the block a few times pilot who loves her flying machinery, and takes life as it comes.The usual suspect crew from the previous films in the series gave the story continuity, but the ""magic"" just wasn't there. Not sure how to put this exactly, but it just seemed canned, forced, clicheic, to the point where you could tell what their next line was going to be long before they said it.Isabella Sermon did as good a job as can be expected being the young ""Maisie"", trying to discover the real truth about who she is, where did she come from and so on.The most unfortunate was Jeff Goldblum, who could have been given much better material to work with, but was cast in this very narrow caricature that he had to be confined to.The actual story itself was a bit odd, not so much about dinosaurs living in a human world, but about the evil BioSyn corporation and swarms of giant locusts wreaking havoc upon the civilized world. I get the implications suggested, but it was more than a bit preachy, depicting the popular ""woke"" notion of evil biotech saturated with corruption and ill intent. The ending was Pollyannaish to an extreme, but again, aimed at kids for the most part.This could have been so much more than what it turned out to be, but then again it could have also been worse.If there is a next one of these, maybe they'll get it closer to what it could become.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Also, the movie was a bit too long. I was expecting more of an ""End of the World"" vibe and it was certainly lacking in that department. That being said it doesn't deserve less than a six rating. I give it a seven. I love that they brought back so many actors from the original Jurassic Park and the urban scenes were really cool.

The plot is the only thing that kind of doesn't work, but even so it's not bad, it's just passable. The action scenes are amazing, and the adventurous globetrotting feel of this movie makes it stand out from the others.

Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern. (If you grew up with the first Jurassic Park movie and liked the old cast, it definitely is worth seeing it.)The plot has some holes and it isn't perfect, but I went there to see some dinosaurs and it serves some dinosaurs. Also it has some references to the old Jurassic Park movies with some scenes and some quotes to it. I liked it for what it was, the plot could have been a bit better and not so predictable, but what should you expect after already 5 Jurassic Park/Jurassic World movies. We got some new dinosaurs to see, the CGI is great, the sounds that they created for it were nice and unique. I'd have wanted a little bit more dinosaurs, more Spinosaurus and more raptors and less subplot, but I still enjoyed it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history's most fearsome creatures.The movie is driven by action and visual effects, with little care given to things like character development or a well-written plot. The pace is fast, and the movie is exciting, but it's forgettable. The dialogue is often cheesy, and the acting is just okay with Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, and Chris Pratt phoning it in. There are a few themes that pop up such as the dangers of messing with nature, but they are quickly abandoned in favour of more action.Jurassic World Dominion is a movie that is best enjoyed as a mindless popcorn flick. It's not going to win any awards, but it's entertaining enough. If you're a fan of the franchise, you'll enjoy it.

The movie flipped and flopped between multiple locations and had a ton of action scenes and it felt overwhelming at times. The movie (at times) felt like it didn't follow a singular storyline and it made it hard to follow sometimes. I thought the actors did a great job, but the movie felt like it relied on a bunch of cgi dinosaur scenes to keep it going. The movie also brought in characters from the original movies and it relied on you kind of knowing who they are to really care about them. Thus it's a little hard to care about a quarter of the cast if you haven't seen the original movies. Don't get me wrong, I love all of these movies for different reasons and this movie is not excluded from that. The movie was really well made and I really enjoyed the combination of old and new characters. I was not expecting to see the original characters throughout pretty much the whole movie and I felt it was a little awkward to throw them into this already established story and character connections in this Jurassic world storyline. I think this would be a good bookend to this movie franchise. No matter, this movie was a pretty good movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie clearly to lit our nostalgic memories about that hype! All the cast from the old movies to the latest movies are perfectly aligned in this movie. Also, rumors said this is the last movie for Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard to be cast.There are 2 main plots: a) the special kid of brilliant dinosaurs scientist, Maisie Lockwood accidentally hunted down coz she have special DNA; and b) Biosyn company that secretly develops illegal research about dinosaurs, their crop product, and gonna create unintentional global disaster. Ofc, both plots brought us to all the old cast and the new cast.Nostalgia seems vividly can be felt. The screenplay looks like purposively creates nostalgia, especially the scene and the moment. The great cast also supports the greatness of this movie blockbuster. They are well-performed to give specific char personality.However, the main cons are the ordinary storyline. Nothin great or amusing enough. Thrillin sensation or emotional moment? Nah-uh! Besides, every char seems just standard quality or nothing prominent enough. Maybe because they're trying to be fair to give equal screen time for a lot of great actors. Nevertheless, the visuals and music are just fine.In conclusion, it's a good movie to lit our nostalgia for dinosaur phenomenon. It makes us more soothed as if we've passed a long-life journey coz we barely realized how long have been passed since the 1st movie of these came to us. Watch it or missed it, nothin' special but it is still good.6/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Forced and fabricated character developments, or no change at all. New, seemingly exciting, charismatic, but pretty much expected characters along with old, returning characters, who have acted as 'reminders' of the original concept of the movie. The story is still unfinished, could be continued with some new twist, what can be said about this - and the two previous - movies. The acting was average, neither horrible, nor astounding, as expected from a movie like this. Overall, it was exciting and fun to watch, but looking at it more closely, the movie didn't really have a point, it has a strong message though - the same message that appeared in every 'Jurassic Park' movie: do not interfere with nature's laws. The sensible outcome - according to this movie - is symbiosis and peaceful cohabitating. Humanity's greed and curiousity will never change, but it can be 'cured'.

They all looked so real. This movie also had THE MOST scenes with the live action puppet versions of the DINO's... and all together the most scenes with dinosaurs than any other previous movie.I see many reviews complaining about the ""lack of"" story about dinosaurs... that's completely not true in any fashion. They do have a few storylines consisting of several non important stories that bring ALL the characters together in the final act. But how much more could the story tellers teach us about these dinosaurs we've seen and studied since the original Jurassic Park in 1993??!!?? We know how they were made and how they've evolved the past 29 years.In closing... THIS MOVIE WAS VISUALLY STUNNING, SCARY, & BEAUTIFULLY PUT TOGETHER. The story was great for each and every character. A beautiful ending to an amazing franchise that has spanned over almost 30 years.I'm very excited where they will take this franchise next??!! I hope they continue with a new storyline and new characters in the next 5 years!If you're a fan of any Jurassic movie... you will definitely love this action filled, dinosaur packed finale! Trust me, you'll be glad you got to see this in the theater and on the big screen! We went to IMAX to see the film this evening.","48 out of 89 found this helpful.

Seeing the old and new cast and characters interact was just awesome, but the many plotpoints get overwhelming at times, and make it hard to follow along with the story. The dinosaurs don't really get the spotlight, as the movie has a Political Theme going on with life living with the Dinosaurs. The size and scope is the biggest we've ever gotten from a Jurassic Movie, spanning to different continents and locations, which makes for some fun scenes with Dinosaur Chases and Dinosaur. Overall, not what I had in mind to be the epic conclusion to the saga, but still enjoyable. So, as the tagline for this review I have to call it fun but really flawed. It didn't bore me in any way, and I was still able to enjoy the movie and have fun with it.. but it had a HECK TON of Problems.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It shows dinosaurs all over, including in cities, and there's some fun shots like one of a jungle cat chasing a dog sized dinosaur. It's actually what a lot of the trailer for the movie is pulled from, which is why I was expecting a neat movie about dinosaurs in the cities and countryside instead of what I got, which is another movie with dinosaurs mainly in a big Park type place. (It's a shame the people who made the movie didn't understand what the person who made the trailer did, that a dinosaurs in the city movie would be a really cool thing.)After that enjoyable opening, nothing worth watching happens for about another 45 minutes. It's just tedious dreck and I almost gave up on the movie all together. But at around the 50 minute mark the movie actually starts getting fun. I would recommend skipping forward until you find the place where they're fighting dinosaurs in a skeezy club, which puts you right before a fun chase scene. From there on the movie is actually pretty enjoyable.If you're worried that the movie won't make any sense if you skip the first third don't worry about it because the movie really doesn't make much sense anyway. Just go to Wikipedia and read the first part of the plot summary if you want to feel oriented.Overall this movie is less terrible than the one before it. If they had simply turned the first third of it into like maybe 10 minutes this might actually be a movie that verged on genuinely good.If you've watched all the other movies I'd say go ahead and watch this one too. It's deeply flawed but it has its moments, the cast is good, and the special effects are terrific.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"3","/10","The Rise of Skywalker of the Jurassic Park saga","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8361739/?ref_=tt_urv","darkalo84","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22702953/?ref_=tt_urv","23 July 2022","JW Dominion felt overlong, somewhat emotionless, mildly boring, utterly silly and at odds with all previous 5 movies. This is as disheartening to see as The Rise of Skywalker. Something you wish never happened and saddens you because they used beloved characters just to keep churning out green milk from a now dying cow.First of all I want to point out how stupid Chris Pratt's character has become. A reflection of how blatantly stupid this movie is. Somebody help me understand why he is not worried at all about having a killing machine (Blue) roaming in the nearby forest. I mean, he might start caring once hikers, workers from the wood company, children and the like start appearing dead and severely mutilated all along the area. Not to mention the ecological disaster that means letting the world's apex predator freely roam in the wild. One that would quickly and eventually trigger the extinction of any other carnivore mammals living in the area like wolves, foxes, bears, lynx or pumas.The same goes for the herbivore mammals. Much bigger and more dangerous herbivores
like the Pachycephalosaurus or the Triceratops would eventually displace too the former from their habitats.No one seems to bother.So for me this movie turned Owen and Claire into idiotic and dislikeable characters because of them acting just like 'dinoaddict' morons.Dinosaurs in this movie are just a complement. Every scene they pop up on the screen they remind me of the rides in theme parks. They are there just for the shock value like in ""oh a Carnotaurus... oh look there, a Quetzalcosaurus... oh over there! A feathered Velociraptor... oh wow! Look a Therizinosaurus... oh cute, the Dilophosaurus... oh over there, finally! Dimetrodons....."". And so on and on.I could go on with how senseless and unjustified Alan Grant's role in the movie is. I don't think he himself has a clue about what he is actually doing in the movie apart from delivering some fan-service.The issue of the locusts... It's like going to see The Exorcist and instead of the plot revolving around the girl's possession, it revolved around solving the murder of the butler with a candlestick. For example.Another issue. Hispanic people make up 20% of the US population. Where on Earth do you have Latin Americans in this movie? Because the character of Zia Rodriguez has just 10 or less seconds of screen-time. For a 2 hour and 27 minute long movie. Talking about diversity...Roles in JW Dominion:White males: just either evil or mildly stupid.White females: evil, mildly stupid or heroines.Black guys: all heroes.Black girls: heroine (there's only one).Asian guy: he is the smartest among them all but since he is a man he is forced to spend the whole movie in a sad mood saying sorry and acknowledging he is just garbage compared to almighty Virgin Maisie.Latin Americans: Oh I guess they were all working in the fields devastated by the giant locusts. Right?And by the way, this movie 'retcons' the previous movie that had already 'retconned' the previous four installments of the saga. What the h...?So John Hammond was a greedy evil man for trying to create an electrically-fenced theme park with dinosaurs in a remote island, but Dr. Virgin Maisie who magically gave birth to a perfect clone of herself (no need for a man, either father or donor) is the final heroine and savior of the world and the most gracious, brave and brilliant among them all.And just at the eleventh hour we get to know all this..... Oh you cheap hack Trevorrow. You spent way too much time listening to Jar Jar Abrams's ludicrous tricks: 'Mystery boxes! Mystery boxes!!'.After so many decades discussing the moral, ethical and legal implications of cloning perfect human beings... And it just so happens to be the blessing of this world... and of a saga about dinosaurs. Yep.And little Maise, not only is it impossible to connect with her since she behaves like a know-it-all brat, but she has spent four full years living with an all-American couple and she still speaks with the thickest of British accents. The one you only get by attending an Oxford school day in, day out. Just like Rey in Star Wars.... Oh don't get me started on that.And what about the ending. Sweet baby Jesus... it's the same one as in the first Jurassic World but they just changed two of the three dinosaurs...
Wow Colin Trevorrow. You have 'rianjohnsoned' the Jurassic Park saga. Good job.I cannot go on with this.All in all, this movie left me with the same bad taste in the mouth as after one of those long naps when you drool all over your pillow and feel damp and disgusted.Now I hope more people can re-appreciate the likes of The Lost World and Jurassic Park III. Multiple Academy award-winning films compared with this chock-full CGI (I doubt Chris Pratt ever really set foot in Malta) pile of Triceratops manure.","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

Overall not near as good as the previous two JW films but still it was above average and on the plus u get to see also dr alan grant and his love affair from the original 1993 film and of course jeff was back as well.

Lots of silly references to the earlier movies, crowbarred in, often leaving gaping plot holes. The movie also seems to try and cram in lots of additional species missed from the earlier films, presumably in a bid to please fans, but instead it interferes with the story or leads to poor action scenes (the final Dino fight for instance).Ultimately disjointed, it feels like half of the movie is on the cutting room floor. It surely would've worked better in 2 parts, with more story building. There are also just too many 'dumb' moments (characters teleporting to the same place, extras ignoring giant.theropods eating people right behind them, characters forgetting that guns kill dinos, I could go on).As a huge JP fan this is a sad ending to the reboot. Sadly all mindless action and reminiscing. If you turn your brain off, it's fun enough, but ultimately the worst film of them all by some margin.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I typically start my movie reviews with a very brief description of how the movie opens plot-wise, and I'm going to skip that in this instance, as the plot of ""Jurassic Park Dominion"" strains credibility in every which way. So let me get to my main comments instead.""Jurassic Park Dominion"" is written and directed by Colin Trevorrow, who also did the honors on the first Jurassic World, and co-wrote the second one. I, and millions of viewers, primarily come to watch this in order to get really good action scenes, and at that level, the movie delivers, primarily in the second half. It's as if this brings all of the best action scenes of the previous Jurassic franchise into a single film. The casting, which combines the stars of the original movies with the stars of the Jurassic World movies, reminded me immediately of ""Star Trek Generations"" where they combine the original Star Trek stars with the Star Trek The Next Generation stars. But in the end, the REAL stars of Jurassic World Dominion are of course the dinosaurs, looking more real than ever before. There is no reason that this movie needs to last 2 1/2 hours. Cut out 20-30 minutes of meaningless ""plot"" and you'd still have the same blockbuster summer movie smash.""Jurassic Park Dominion"" opened 2 weekends ago to mega-size box office (although not quite as high as ""Top Gun Maverick""). The Tuesday early evening (discount) screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great (about 10 people), and that was quite alright with me. If you are a fan of the Jurassic franchise, you'll want to keep expectations in line, and then enjoy if for the action scenes. Nothing more, nothing less.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The nostalgia! I watched the original Jurassic Park the night before watching this movie and I'm so glad I did because there are a lot of nods to the original film! It was really fun seeing the original cast back again for the first time in 30 years!Visual and sound. The sound editing and mixing as well as the visual effects I thought were really great, I didn't see it in XD/IMAX but I wish I did because that's the way it was meant to be seen. Especially the sound.Strong family vibes & morals. I love the relationship that all the characters have with each other. I love the role they all take in being such good parents, friends, romantic partners, etc. There were parts that were very sweet and I appreciated it, even in a dinosaur movie they don't overlook how important it is to have these bonds with other people. When the original cast meets the new cast it's almost like watching different avengers meet each other for the first time, I loved that.Cons:Kinda confusing. There are parts that are kind of confusing and you definitely need subtitles for if you are used to watching subtitles at home. If you remember Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom there are some scenes where they talk about clones and people that are clones which honestly is annoying and I wish they would've just taken all that out because it makes the science and technology of this movie more complicated.Parts that are boring. The movie doesn't take off for a while as soon as they are all in the jungle and then they all meet each other is when the movie really gets going and gets good. But you have to get past some boring scenes.Some bad acting. The villain in this movie has horrible acting. I'm not sure what the actors name is but he is Peter Parker's dad on the Amazing Spider-Man. I thought he would be great since he's great in that movie but in this one he is really really bad. It's almost like he forgot all of his lines or something. Maybe should of recast.Too long. The movie is pretty long it's 2 1/2 hours. This is the longest Jurassic movie ever done and it could of been shortened, especially during the first half part of the film.All in all I would rate it a 7/10. Purely because the original characters are so great.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Better and smarter than the average blockbuster","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8650045/?ref_=tt_urv","I_Ailurophile","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1964495/?ref_=tt_urv","1 November 2022","In 1993 Steven Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park' was an awe-inspiring spectacle like relatively few pictures can claim. For however well made subsequent films were made, in retrospect it's not wrong to say that the franchise kind of feels like B-movies writ large, like what SyFy original movies might look like if they had the largest of budgets and best of all resources. When the first trailer dropped for 'Jurassic World Dominion,' whatever else might end up being true of the picture, at least in concept it struck me as the dinosaur movie we've been waiting thirty years to see. To have read more about the production, and to have finally watched the finished product, this is even more true than I could have hoped. This isn't to say that JWD is perfect by any means, but of course it's incredibly well made, and acted, and for the most part very well written. It's smarter and more thoughtful than the average blockbuster, and if it falters along the way, it's not for lack of effort, but maybe just too much.What's most notable is how very different this picture feels compared to its predecessors - obviously part and parcel with the scenario. Substantial portions of the narrative would fit neatly into any big-budget thriller, with flavors of Action, Political, and Sci-Fi at varying points. In these facets and as well in quieter moments of exposition or reflection, major themes emerge which are painfully true and relevant to real life. 'Dominion' explores balance in the natural world; humanity's quarrelsome relationship with nature, and our attempts to coexist with it or bend it to our will; the abuse, destruction, and mismanagement of wildlife; science without ethics; idealism confronted with lack of control, leading to profound regret (something I can readily identify with); extreme, egregious corporate malfeasance and dodging of responsibility; man-made ecological calamity and impending extinction level events; and more. It's very noteworthy and very important that the plot also broaches the topic of GMOs - and not the nonsensically alarmist tripe about genetically modified food being bad for people and animals (news alart: all crops and livestock since the advent of agriculture has been genetically modified), but the real harm of GMOs, which is corporate monopolization of the food supply. These are all notions which have been touched upon in other stories, only in this instance, each and every one has been twisted together with dinosaurs.There's so very much that filmmaker Colin Trevorrow and co-writer Emily Carmichael have tried to let this feature say, be, and do. To their credit, for as towering and arguably bloated as the narrative is, it is cohesive, coherent, and complete; engaging, and satisfying. Every aspect of the screenplay is filled with gratifying intelligence, blending together the inflated genre romp sensibilities of the most highfalutin sci-fi adventure bombast with stark, gnawing themes; fantasy violence with realist human drama (or maybe one should say terrestrial drama); action sequences with garnishes of scientific fact, theory, and jargon; ham-handedness, sincere humor, thrills, and emotional investment with, yes, awe and wonder. Such grand ambition is, ultimately, also the chief weakness of the film. There's so very much that 'Dominion' wants to say, be, and do, and it may well have been to the benefit of the story, and the themes, to split this almost three-hour extravaganza into multiple pictures. The amalgamation as we see it is better than one could have hoped for, and done very well, yet there's unquestionably a sense that everything is jam-packed too tightly, disallowing every component part to receive the treatment it fully deserves. There's not one idea herein that itself couldn't have been expanded into a full-length film.Still, if that's the most significant criticism to lay at the feet of a hulking monstrosity like a sixth Jurassic Something movie, then I'd say it's doing pretty well for itself. Yes, there are instances when the scene writing or dialogue borrows from previous entries, 1993's progenitor especially. (In the spirit of generosity, one might say such moments are an homage.) There are also instances when the intended thrills become so over the top that SyFy might after all be the best point of reference, and the employment herein of Owen's trademark training gesture is 100% gauche. None of this is anything we wouldn't expect from the average blockbuster, however, so one can only take such matters with a grain of salt, or a stiff upper lip, or whatever other colloquialism one prefers. And meanwhile, in every other way, 'Dominion' is just as well made as one would assume of such a major motion picture event. The cast is great, bringing to tremendous life the parts they have with all the skill and sincerity they can muster. Whether animatronics or CGI, all the creatures look outstanding, and so do all the other effects, and the stunt work. The production design and art direction are downright exemplary. I admire Michael Giacchino's score, despite those places where it too blithely imps John Williams' pre-established themes. Lighting, direction, John Schwartzman's cinematography - all exquisite. This is the result of all the accumulated knowledge and experience of how to create a movie of this nature, on this level.At length, I do very much enjoy 'Jurassic World Dominion.' Whatever one's impetus for watching, I think it's well worth it, including simply the silly, baseline popcorn-chomping entertainment and satisfaction of the climax, and even the entirely all too easy resolution the ending represents. Its strengths and its faults are equally clear, I think, but by all means, on the balance this is a highly enjoyable sci-fi adventure flick. In fact, I'd love to say that I like it even more than I do, but the rational part of my brain tells me that the feature's favor of Most Blockbuster Fun over Best Storytelling Judiciousness decrees a measure of reservation. Even at that - though imperfect, I had a fantastic time watching. Second only to 'Jurassic Park,' this is almost certainly the best installment in the franchise. Even at its worst and most self-indulgent there's a lot to love here, and I'd have no qualms about recommending it to just about anyone, but especially those with an especial fondness for the '93 film. What else is there to say? If you have the chance to watch, 'Jurassic World Dominion' is worth three hours of your time.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I enjoyed seeing Neil and Dern along side Dallas and Pratt as well as the newcomers, Wise and Athie. However, a lot didn't work, like the storyline. It's generic and I expected much more. The dinosaurs are almost an after thought in this storyline, placed second to gigantic locusts (yes, silly, I know). Not horrible, but wasted opportunity. I would have preferred the movie expanding on humans living with dinosaurs in a modern world and exploring the moral and ethical debates that go along with it. It briefly touched on that but didn't dive in before creating some bogus plot about a corporation out to disrupt the food chain. Could have had some thought provoking yet terrifying and majestic scenes instead of the over utilized ""evil corporation tries to take over the world"" plot.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

You don't know whether to laugh or cry, but the Jurassic finale is
probably the saddest waste and demystification of dinosaurs imaginable.Not even the nostalgia bubbling OGs Neil, Dern and Goldblum could save this sinking ship of a movie, but they at least made it more bearable. Plot convenience and embarrassingly bad dialogue across the board. Chris Pratt delivers the most bored performance of his career. And worst of all, you can't even blame him.Praise is due to the visuals. The dinosaurs look great, the perfect balance of VFX and special effects. There is one action sequence that stands out. Other than that, Jurassic World: Dominion is a soulless conclusion to a trilogy that actually started solidly, but in retrospect we never needed.Respect to director Trevorrow, to be involved in wrecking 2 multi-billion dollar franchises within 3 years - that's a hard act to follow.P.

The story go sometime a bit too far with a first act i felt a bit long and boring and the good thing come in the second act because i was a bit scare in the 30 first minutes - acting and editing are sometime very bad and cheesy but in somes moments , it shine specialy in the scene with Grant Malcom or Ellie from the first trilogy , you get nice nostalgia moments between them with amazing actions sequence and special effects. I can describe it like the action in Fast and furious. Its epic in some way but very unrealistic in some scenes still enjoyable most of the time if u forget this. Yes!! There is good moments, very good moments . CGI are good i think except for few scenes because let say , designs for new dinosaures are particuliar and make the blend between CGi and reality more difficult to hide. Its not a step up from the last two last films . Im still impress with the first film that still hold up even today. This film bring no real surprise on the story side and the pacing his very fast , i wish we had more time despite being the longest film in the franchise.I hope we get a extended cut to answers some elements and directions the story go because there is a lots of characters, new plots , new dinosaures and sometime it seem i miss the attachements or the emotions form previous entry or simplicity . At the end we can say this is a big mashup for fan service . Not to spoil! If u go see the movie for the utimate ending like i did , u wil be surprise actually that it open many doors to more questions or another films maybe.But if u want to see big action moments with dinos and there is a lots old and news . It delivers ! I think it try too much to please to everyone from the last 5 movies in a complexe story so its a big kraft diner of good and bad thing still a very moving film to watch in Imax.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

And by that I mean the next trilogy. Maybe this time around they will do a reboot - stop laughing. Although I guess that pun is worth at least a chuckle.Now for those who have not seen a Jurassic Park/World movie ... I am not sure, you want to start with this movie right here to be honest. It does make sense to at least watch the first Park and World movies. Just so you understand why the linger on some shots - or why you should go wow or aw at certain moments.Of course the movie is filled with amazing visual moments. And while I credit this for not being the first movie with slight changes ... it isn't too different from it either. The trailer and the buzz did suggest that this time this would go worldwide. But apart from one action scene outside the Park/World - we again go back mostly to the enclosed space where most of the dinosaurs are being held.We do have the uber-villain once again. Those rich people who can't get enough ... money? But he says it isn't about money ... what is it about then? You better not start with questions is my advice. Whether it is about motive or about logic (characters being superheroes and not feeling pain - though you have that in other movies too) or the story ... just enjoy the madness. And some interesting moments. Most of best ones coming from something Jeff Goldblum delivers - not sure if those were all written in the script or he improvised ... but they do work.That being said, we should not expect much more from this franchise. Now lay them to rest - please.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

And there have been worse. I was hoping 'Dominion' would stop trying to take this whole ""dinosaurs in modern society"" schtick too seriously. I mean, seriously, this plotline is taken way too seriously. With this silly plotline, at least make it a comedic movie or something. I cringed every time I saw one of the characters in imminent danger of being attacked by a dinosaur simply raise their hand as if magically all dinosaurs will obey that gesture and not eat them.Dinosaurs that hunt and eat people are everywhere, and the film's ending message is that we'll just have to learn to co-exist. Seriously??? That's never going to work when every facet of life is disrupted by dinosaurs that can hunt you down at kill you at any moment without warning. Their impact on the global food chain would not bode well for the planet's well-being either. And the constant threat of flying pterodactyl's on the aviation industry?? Need I go on??...The only realistic ending to save the planet would be to exterminate each and every dinosaur. As Jeff Goldblum's character said in the first JP film, ""dinosaurs had their shot already"". But hey, killing all the dino's would make for a boring movie. So, insert old JP actors with the new ones for nostalgia, then turn off your brain and watch CGI dinosaurs happily co-exist with humans in the end.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

It came at the climax of this fantastic movie, bookending the Jurassic Park saga that started 30 years ago. What a phenomenal summer blockbuster bonanza this has been for people of my demographic! First, we were brought back to our need for speed, and now, within weeks, we were being brought back to the magic of our love for dinosaurs. Having Sam Neil, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum coming together for this (possible) one last outing was an excellent peach of a decision by the production team. This movie captured exactly the sense of wonder, thrill, excitement and adrenaline rush many of us experienced back in 1993, and it also gave today's audience what they wanted, ie, that big feast of dinosaurs from different historical timelines and geography coming together. It even managed to bring a nod to the original in a crucial scene at the end, where, just like in 1993, the greedy bad guy tried to escape with a container of dinosaur DNA, got stuck, tried to get away, but eventually was confronted and killed by a group of Dilophosaurus. That is the charm of this movie, and I was still trying to catch my breath when the credits were rolling.This is going to be a movie summer many will remember!","37 out of 68 found this helpful.

There are too many characters, even main characters with the original trio and the newer duo both involved equally. With that said, I do like 'em. It's pleasant to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are a good pairing.Still, I wouldn't say any one character stands out here. They all make their presence known, though I'm struggling to remember any great moments individually - that's due to the aforementioned surplus. The rest of the cast, fwiw, are all fine - Mamoudou Athie sticks out most in that regard.The run time is overlong, in my opinion. I personally could've done without 30 or so minutes and I wouldn't have felt it was missing anything. The story itself isn't all that fresh, as in I feel like I've seen this sorta thing before (I mean, Biosyn... how creative!), but the barrage of dinosaur-centric action probably just abouts tips it over into a positive rating for yours truly. Could easily be lower, though.I'd love for this to be the end of the Jurassic franchise (is there much more to tell?) but there ain't no way Amblin/Universal are leaving this IP to collect dust, let's be honest.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But I don't understand why so many are dead set on this being the worst one of the franchise. (Come on guys, is it really worse than JP3 or Fallen Kingdom?) Most of the reviews from popular critics like to call out Dominion's length and how it ""is a soulless imitation banking on nostalgia."" However, of the six Jurassic Park movies, this is not the worst by a long shot.While the length at 2 1/2 hours is a bit of a detriment, ""soulless"" is not the word I would use. Dominion pays off to many of the themes that have been set up by Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom. None of the characters are obnoxious to the point of unlikable. The cinematography and especially the sound design are very well done. The plot, though a bit chaotic, can still be followed easily enough.However, the film still has its flaws. Some of the side plots don't get enough attention, and the villain is a little sub-par. The second half follows the humans a lot more than the dinosaurs, and that could be a turn off for fans of the franchise. The aforementioned length does make it difficult for those with short attention spans to sit through. By the 2/3rd point I was staring to notice it hadn't wrapped up yet, but the pacing was well done and at no point was I ever bored.So why are so many big-name critics so willing to throw Dominion under the bus? I have a theory. After so many sequels that failed to capture the magic of the original, encluding Dominion, these critics take their anger of a franchise as a whole and apply it to the latest film. The problem is that the original was truly one-of-a-kind, and very few movies can hold a candle to it. It would take nothing short of a miracle to surpass the original Jurassic Park.The other thing I have noticed it that there has been an increasing disconnect between critics and audiences. Many review websites, YouTube channels, and social media outlets like posting negative reviews because that's what gets the clicks. I get it; it's fun to write and to read slander about something you disagree with, but if you only focus on the bad then that is all you'll ever find.Overall, by no means perfect, it is a decent and effective conclusion to the Jurassic World trilogy.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Watched the Extended Cut which included scenes involving dinosaurs, all cut theatrically. Including T-Rex drive-in attack.A Jurassic movie about dinosaurs and it's painfully boring. People criticized Lucas for having a lot of walking and talking in the SW prequels, but the prequels are no where near as boring as this one Jurassic World film. If you watched the extended cut, you'll get a few more dinosaurs scenes. Not many, but it's something.""There have never been more dinosaurs, than there are in Dominion. Maximum amount"" -Bryce Dallas Howard.Was there anything good in this? They finally brought back the Dilophosaurus. That's it. Now, for everything else...Since 1993, I have seen every Jurassic film in theaters. However, because of how bad Fallen Kingdom was and how poorly received Dominion was, this marked this first Jurassic film I skipped seeing in the theater. I have no regrets about this decision. The Jurassic World trilogy goes the same route as the sequel trilogy. Started off decent, but was then followed up with two painfully bad sequels. Almost like there was no roadmap throughout the JW trilogy. However, I actually think they had one planned after the first JW film. If so, they should've hired better writers. Colin was probably one of the worst filmmakers in re-sparking Spielberg and Crichton's Jurassic series. Those who think Colin's Episode 9 ""Duel of The Fates"" would've been good or better than TROS, look no further than his JW trilogy for that answer.Another big issue with the film. I did not care about anything going on, or for the Jurassic World characters. Colin ran out of ideas and ended up recreating the T-Rex battle from the first JW as the finale, and it's completely pointless just like this film. In the dumbest way possible, they even gave life to the Jurassic logo. Dinosaurs are roaming the earth and it's treated in a ""just live with it"" approach, I was actually wishing this world would get destroyed from its stupidity. The threat of dinosaurs escaping to the mainland in Michael Crichton's books was a real nightmarish threat that he captured in the most terrifying ways. I have tremendous love and respect for life without a human voice, but Dominion's acceptance of a world with dinosaurs which wasn't the result of nature's intention but instead human/clone girl error is treated similar to the story in a children's pop-up book.The main conflict is about...locus. That's right! Not dinosaurs, but locus and farm crops. What is a plot about locus and the world's food supply doing in the Jurassic film where dinosaurs are physically roaming the earth? The Jurassic series is science fiction, and maybe a central conflict of a company releasing giant locus to threaten the world's food supplies might work in another story. To have a locus conflict this late in the series as the final built-up conflict was tragic. The build-up and cliffhanger in JW2 was dinosaurs are free to roam and terrorize the mainland. This should be the focusing conflict of your trilogy's finale. What were these filmmakers thinking?Lewis Dodgson is the character I always wished would return in the Jurassic sequels. A key sideline villain in Crichton's JP novel, and the main villain in Crichton's The Lost World novel. Dodgson finally returns, only he now looks like the CEO of Apple which is ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL.Was I suppose to picture Skyfall and The Bourne Ultimatum in the action sequences of a Jurassic film? No, but I was because the chase scene in the middle of the film was riddled with James Bond and Jason Bourne material. Remember how Pratt could hold up his hand with the raptors and it would trigger something in them? A move he'd been doing since they were babies. Let's call it, the Force, because now anyone can do it on any random dinosaur and it will hold them off, just like the Force. The film's stupidity has gone interstellar.Riddled with action cliches, excessive contrivances, conflict cliches, predictable outcomes, repeating visuals which no longer dazzle us, a complete lack of tension and terror, zero excitement, call backs to better films which have already been done in the previous Jurassic World films. Nothing is fresh, and what remains is stale. The film even damages its own trilogy by acknowledging characters and events in JP3, while forgetting there is another island called Site B with lots of dinosaurs roaming it.Remember the magic, the wonder, the awe, the thrills, the horrors, the excitement of Jurassic Park? All of this gone. Lost to a bunch of filmmakers who think bigger and more dinosaurs is all that matters rather than script and characters. The Lost World recaptured these elements the best. Even JP3 got some elements right when none of JW sequels did. I actually thought Fallen Kingdom was the lowest these Jurassic World films could go. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Dominion falls on the same level of bad as Fallen Kingdom did, but it might actually be worse. Dominion, just like The Last Jedi and Indy 5, is a franchise killer.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Of course there's a black market, trading in the creatures. In some places there's a modus vivendi, wonderful to watch brontosauri proceeding stately, respected by loggers. But other outfits illegally trap, breed and export the dinosaurs. Clair Dearing is back combating these trappers, Owen Grady (on horseback) rounds up the animals to be transported to reserves. They both live in a remote cabin in the Sierra Nevada mountains with the cloned Maisie Lockwood. But Maisie is kidnapped along with the baby raptor Beta. A parallel story-line involves Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant trying to solve the riddle of what has caused a plague of giant locusts which is devouring crops and causing famine. They link up with Ian Malcolm. There's also the sinister BioSyn company which runs a dinosaur reserve in a temperate rain forest in the the Dolomite Mountains. The two narratives eventually merge in that valley.Great scenes of battling dinosaurs but also TV News shows about the problems the creatures cause. Small flying dinosaurs devouring doves released at a wedding, a trawler being dragged under by a sea dinosaur. Planes are brought down by flocks of Quetzalcoatlus and a Giganotosaurus combats a T-Rex. The screenplay won't win an Oscar but there are frightening, amusing and thrilling scenes. Also some excellent scenes of raptors pursuing motorbikes and and chasing people across rooftops. My favourite scene was an escooter rider being plucked up and devoured! A chase movie, an action thriller and a conspiracy involving a Bond style villain. Just enjoy it! Directed by Colin Trevorrow, written by Trevorrow and Emily Carmichael. 7/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It would not be wrong if I say that a movie with weak music is doomed to be bad. The action and chase scenes were really weak due to the music, they didn't even need to put music in some scenes, this really upset me. Another issue is the bad character, even though our bad character seems like a cold-blooded person, it was a little weak in my opinion and the ending was a cliché. I couldn't see any problems in the visual effects, but the dinosaur fight in the final scene didn't interest me and I couldn't get excited. Again, the happy ending event in the final scene was really boring to me. My rating for the movie is 6/10 🙌🙌","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Locusts on fire that looks like a few dozen that escape sufdenly seeming to be in more of a hundreds causing a wildfire.

It would've been funny tough.But some dinosaurs looked terrible. In the end shot where the Dilophosaurus are at the Hyperloop and their fan was open, one of them looked like it was a broken umbrella. Not to mention some atrocities at the dinosaur market.Thank God for Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill to save this movie with their acting.

Skip to a reboot where the vicious velociraptors are turned into trained monkeys making puppy sounds. Where there are more commercials wrapped in a movie than there are menacing or engaging dinos. The second instalment of the reboot was a bit better -though nearly not as good as the imo underrated sequel to the original- but my hopes of a somewhat decent end to the World-trilogy with the return of beloved characters/actors were smashed. Although lulled into boredom would be more accurate a description. A plot wherein giant insects are used to ensure world ""dominion"", I mean the whole thing has just become convoluted af. And the big budget making the movie pander to audiences all over the world, painfully shaving off any modicum of edge. The whole thing turned out more generic than melted cheese in a can imo.

Especially the coexist part and dinos getting out of hand, which I would have loved to see more of and of a more bigger and threatening scale. The movie took a while to get interesting, as the beginning and it's character acting was weak. It was a bit all over the place too with it's scale and story and took a bit to actually intertwine. But when it finally set together, it was starting to get quite interesting with the usual good dino action. Seeing the old cast was nice and actually made the movie better than it would have been. A nice treat for the old fans. Some plot parts may have been a silly again and the combined generations may feel a little weird too at times. But it still was entertaining, as we got usual jokes and references every now and then. Effects were quite good and the subtle use of the main theme was nice too. I wish the threat on the world scale would have been better, as it was quite interesting to see how things go when dinos taking back the land and go into human territory. Maybe in a possible future movie, who knows. Hollywood tends to do many sequels of old movies after all. While the movie was not that much needed, it was still nice and worth a watch. Be it as a fan or maybe even as a newcomer.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's so simple, just show us the dinosaurs, have the dinosaurs battle the humans, have the dinosaurs battle each other for a bit, have the humans overcome their differences and team up to save the day. Boom, blockbuster done.Instead this movie mostly separates the humans from the dinosaurs, gives us a bunch of disparate human-centric plot lines that never seem to meet up or gel with each other played by too many improperly introduced characters with bit parts. Throw in some no-depth characters like the bratty teen girl that doesn't listen to anyone and makes dumb decisions that get her kidnapped, villains that are evil just for the sake of being evil, and a 'rough and tumble' bush pilot that looks like she just spent 6 hours in the salon chair getting her hair and colored contact lenses just right.When we do see dinosaurs it's too often not the big and fearsome ones we want. Instead we get a lot of little baby robo-dinosaurs where I can practically see someone holding a remote off screen to move the head of a marble-eyed, unblinking dino-doll, and then to top it off we get...dino-locusts? Gee, how thrilling.I gave it a 3 for the sake of classy Sam Neil who was about the only person who didn't make me cringe, but versus what this should have been and pretty easily could have been, it's more like a minus three. What a shameful way to end a series that started with one of the greatest action movies of the 1990s.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Sure, it seems to be bothered more with callbacks to the original film than it does in really pushing things forward (and doesn't make quite enough sense in some areas, like how a few dozen dinos let loose on the west coast, in the last film, are suddenly endemic the world over after only a few years), but if you're in a few more hours of hectic dino action (which I felt was elevated by the use of 3D) it's still a fun ride.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is an unnecessarily long and embarrassing cashgrab with bad set designs, mediocre cgi, bad sound design and editing, bad editing, terrible acting from otherwise good actors, forgettable soundtrack, clunky dialogue, unnecessary exposition, and more plot convenience than I have seen in quite some time.Everyone sucks at acting in this movie holy moly. Chris Pratt sucks, Bryce Dallas Howard is atrocious, the child acting was wooden, all of the original actors for some reason cannot perform to save their lives barring Jeff goldblum who is just playing Jeff goldblum. Laura Dern was particularly bad and that's very peculiar because I haven't seen a bad performance from her yet, but wooo boy did she not try. Campbell Scott was also absolutely awful, but I did find a scene with him kinda funny when it was meant to be funny (good job Trevorrow!)... Everyone feels like they came here for a paycheck and that's it, they all don't careThe sound design was horrendous and choppy, the music was overbearing and forgettable, it doesn't even feel like the same essence of a Jurassic park soundtrack. The sound effects feel so clunky and don't feel like they're in the same realm of the film. It's all just so bad.The writing is messy and disorganized with the structure being like it's own elaborate puzzle to figure out what the heck is going on. They throw in an extremely convenient plot armor on characters and there's not a single bit of tension, everything everybody wants is right there and it takes no real struggle for the characters to do anything.Honestly, I really blame a lot of this on the director. I've seen these actors do well before and Trevorrow has yet to show me a single film that I would even call alright.. This film is horrendous. He wrote it and directed it, there's no reason it should be this sloppy and boring.There is little life in this dead horse they keep trying to poke at, this movie sucks, there's very little to grab onto and I do not recommend in the slightest.Low 3/10.","19 out of 36 found this helpful.

Chris Pratt teamed up with someone later/midway through the film to get back together with his wife who was separated from him on the Dinosaur island or whatever. They give them a a tracker like it's a video game, ""here you can use this to find her location"". Chris Pratt basically just nods... other character then goes ""you really love her huh?""
what?... I've only heard this line sixty times in various films, however, it didn't really make much sense in the context and scene that it was placed in. It's like they just opened the generic Hollywood play by play handbook, ""ah yeah this is a good one, shove this line in there somewhere... you really love her huh?.. brilliant""
...Yeah he loves his wife so he's trying to save her... his love was already established for this woman. It's not a coming of age film where some kid has some undecided or secret feelings for someone that someone else has to notice and point out. It just was dumb generic lazy cliche writing that didn't make any sense.Some of the action scenes were ok but obviously due to the rating of the movie could have been much more intense and satisfying if it were given a mature ratings.If we are going to revamp the series, can we just go a different direction. Can we take a risk? Go full on borderline horror movie, make it rated R. I want to see some gore, All the intense scenes with the dinosaurs could actually have some impact and some bite (pun intended), giving that character's fear some real contextual depth through brutal consequence of getting caught by a predator much more formidable than ourselves. It could almost be reminisce of a movie like Alien or something.Also I didn't have much of an opinion of Chris Prat before this movie, thought he was funny in parks and rec and I realize he lost weight and gained muscle and started taking on more serious roles. I will say for this film, He looked VERY satisfied with himself through his facial expressions in most scenes, It looked unnatural to me the way he was acting was like ""yea that was awesome, I looked really concerned there"". ""oh yea I'm having a heart to heart moment here with my wife or daughter""
I don't know.. I just didn't buy his acting at all. It wasn't terrible, but it was immersion breaking to me, essentially the third wall was knocked down and I saw him as an actor acting in his scenes as opposed to a character responding to things in the film.I Enjoyed the chase scene for what it was, the black market scene was ok, the Ice scene was ok, and some of the raptor and giant dinosaur scenes were decent although I still think they would have been a lot more exciting with a more mature rating.","23 out of 45 found this helpful.

And that's what really matters in the end. I'm sorry for rating your movie a 3 because, after all, I know you're only 100 monkeys, so what did I expect? The thing is, even for 100 monkeys, I feel the ineptitude on display here is really alarming and I wonder if maybe fewer monkeys, maybe a dozen or so, could have come up with something more cohesive. I'm not even really sure where to start, if I'm honest with you monkeys. For one thing, just the entire framework is insane. In a film that is predicated on the idea that there are dinosaurs all over the place, it seems fairly obvious to me that the film should follow that rather than focus primarily on an entirely tangential evil corporation and their plot to control the food chain that has very little to do with dinosaurs. Indeed, it is as if only a handful of you 100 monkeys were even informed that you were supposed to be writing a Jurassic World movie, so few the dinosaurs are, though perhaps this is a concern best taken up with the 1000 monkeys at Universal. The dinosaurs do appear in infrequent doses, though oddly most of the dinosaurs are still captive dinosaurs that manage to escape captivity rather than the supposedly plentiful free-roaming dinosaurs. Doesn't make much sense now does it monkeys? No matter. The dialogue is awful in equal measure; I would suggest sticking to ""Ooh ooh aah ahh,"" from now on. Now, to change my tune a bit here monkeys, one area I think you might have been able to actually to contribute to would have been in the acting department. You couldn't have done worse than the humans did and you certainly would have been more lively. You probably also would have been better in the director's chair than Colin Trevorrow, though I suppose I don't where you would find 100 director's chairs. All in all monkeys, not your best work. But don't let this one failure stop you from writing more terrible movies. You've got the entire MCU to keep afloat as well, after all. Best of luck.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

With JURASSIC WORLD DOMINION, we end the Jurassic World trilogy (after having the Jurassic Park trilogy) and it is high time we do so.A retro-film (as I've been calling these nostalgia-flicks that bring back old actors/characters from previously beloved properties), JURARSSIC WORLD DOMINION is entertaining enough - but the creative brains behind this franchise is just running out of clever ways to put the same group of characters in danger of being eaten by a dinosaur.Written by Emily Carmichael based on a story by Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow and Directed by Trevorrow (returning to helm this franchise after Directing the first Jurassic World flick, but not the 2nd), JURASSIC WORLD DOMINION follows our favorite bickering couple, Clare (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen (Chris Pratt) and their pseudo-pet Velociraptor, Blue as they, once again, go into the Jurassic World fighting a money-grubbing Corporate Billionaire who wants the genetic technology for his own, greedy purposes and not what might be for the good of all - the Earth, the Humans and the Dinosaurs. Along the way good ol' Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (the always quirky Jeff Goldblum) are, somehow, shoe-horned into this story.And that, ultimately, is the issue with Dominion, the script feels like an amalgam of characters that needed to be serviced and set-pieces that needed to be shown, but the overall story-line and character development (not that there is much here) is shoved to the side, so at the end the emotional connection to this film - and it's characters - is negligible.What little character interest there is here is based solely on the charisma of the actors and they are...good enough. Pratt, of course, is able to carry the center of this flick as Owen Grady - but he doesn't seem to be occupying the center square with the twinkle in his eye that he had in the first Jurassic World film. Bryce Dallas Howard is plucky enough as Clare, but this actress has been gaining traction lately as a ""go-to"" Director (like her father, Ron Howard) and that is probably a better career trajectory for her. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are ""game enough"" in what they are asked to do, but they both look just a bit tired of running around in front of green screen dinosaurs. Only Jeff Goldblum shines as Ian Malcolm and that's because Trevorrow, wisely, decides to let Goldblum be Goldblum - odd and quirky.Of the other actors in this film, DeWanda Wise (FATHERHOOD) really shines as a pilot who helps out the gang. On the other hand, Dichen Lachman (SEVERENCE) is completely wasted as a ""top-notch"" henchman that is pretty inept. However, it was good to see Omar Sy (who was in the first JURASSIC WORLD movie and then became a star thanks to his work on the French TV show LUPINE - which is terrific, by the way) back in the fold as it was good to see Campbell Scott back up on the big screen as the villain of the piece - a role that he brings an interesting twist to but, ultimately, the role leads to nowhere.And that's the issue with this film, the characterizations lead to nowhere, for Trevorrow focuses most of his attention on the battle scenes and the scares - and while not all of them are exciting and unusual, I did find myself jumping in my seat on more than one occasion and there is one scene with Bryce Dallas Howard escaping a dino in a swamp that was pretty intense.Go see JURASSIC WORLD DOMINION if you've seen the other 5 - you've already invested this much time, you might as well complete the series. But, this film really brings nothing new and is, ultimately, less than what one hopes for in this type of film.Letter Grade: B-6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

The graphics were good, the sets exciting, the dinosaurs plentiful. But the good ends there. The actual movie; the dialogue was laughable, it was like they used the first draft and didn't revise or put thought into anything spoken in this movie, the plot was cheap and overly convenient, the sequence of events didn't make any sense.For example, two people are hanging onto a platform while a dinosaur tears and tosses it around and the characters are sliding down and losing grip and just before the dinosaur tears it off along with the characters thankfully there's a cut right then and next you see the characters jumping to the safety of the room conveniently.Another scene when one character lands in a parachute in the jungle and another set of characters land on a lake across the jungle. Literally miles and miles away. And it the next scene the set of characters just happens to walk upon the sight of where the parachute landed. You're telling me that they, not having the slightest idea where this person could have landed, just happened to traverse miles upon miles through a dense and dinosaur filled forest and come across the exact location of their lost friend. How pathetically convenient. This is one of dozens of examples of how ridiculous this entire film was. I'm offended that the production team thinks I am as stupid as that.Other than that I am at a loss for words. What a horrible way to ruin this trilogy. Hopefully the next reboot will be better, but let's let this movie air out for a few years before we try to get back into this universe.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

And if you are a fan of an action packed Jurassic World movie than this film is for you. With many easter eggs and hints towards the original Jurassic Park film, this movie ties everything together perfectly.The Acting preformed in this movie was more traditional to the original Jurassic Park films. With a lower focus on witty humor and a higher focus on the task at hand with the occasional hint of humor, each characters personality fits them.Having two different story lines going at once also helps add more action. Especially because at the ending half of the film these two story lines get tied together, which then forces everyone to work together.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

BUT. The second time around, i loved it!This time around I did watch all the others again in a marathon, so I definitely think that Dominion relies on the nostalgia factor and the trust that fans will remember small details from the franchise. It's very worthwhile once you're familiar with the rest. While I agree that it's not 100% perfection, I do think it's very wrong to go into it with sky high expectations - the sixth installment to any franchise is never going to be as groundbreaking as the first. I do think part of its bad reception is that it's formula doesn't give the same 'feel' as it's predecessors. Personally I think it's necessary for the growth of the story that it doesn't remain totally the same.I'm definitely disappointed to see so many negative reviews because fan perception affects chances of sequels. (And I love this franchise far too much to part with it just yet!!)Overall, I don't blame my past self for being so appalled by this movie the first watch. If you feel the same way, don't be afraid to give it the second chance it deserves! Maybe this time have a little marathon, enjoy the films as they're meant to be loved. It makes the world of a difference. Happy watching <3.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

The first and second Jurassic World films ranged from the first one being barely tolerable to the second one being plain bad and now with this last film... Two words to describe this closure sequel film in the Jurassic World trilogy: hot garbage! Dominion's film aspects are horrendous and forgettable: plot, script (I was rolling my eyes that they still were trying to train dinosaurs LOL), acting, cinematography, sound design, visual effects; a mix of practical effects and CGI would achieve realism in the dinosaurs presented on screen just like the Jurassic Park trilogy achieved well, which this film and the entire Jurassic World trilogy poorly failed time and time and time again to accomplish. Good riddance to a cash grab trilogy trying to capitalize on nostalgia from the original Jurassic Park (which is overall a better trilogy) while disrespecting it and demeaning the quality of dinosaurs, predictable storyline, and creating one-dimensional characters I don't care about.The three OG characters played by Laura Dern, Sam Neill, and Jeff Goldblum looked so tired and bored in their roles. They probably signed on for this film looking to make a quick paycheck and to contribute to fan service (totally understandable), but by inserting these OG characters and callback scenarios to the original, it's not going to improve anything about this awful film that also is too PC (all bad guys are again white) and is stuffed with Mary Sue characters (Kayla and Maisie) resulting in an insufferable, shoddy ending to an already terrible, dumpster fire trilogy.Not recommended even if you're a die-hard fan or semi-fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy, unless you want to waste 2 hours and 27 minutes of your time like I did. I regret watching this and will vehemently never watch Dominion ever again.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Nothing rings true in zero plot film that drags for over 2 hrs & 40 minutes, Dr Alan Grant, world's leading dinosaur expert is no longer an expert. Instead, the Dino expert is young black female pilot who works for criminals in well-known ""underground"" dinosaur black market. She nows dino scientific names, behaviors & how to fight them off more than anyone else, & despite being a mercenary, she suddenly does everything for free for complete desperate strangers.MSome scenes are utterly comedic, i.e. Chris Pratt herding huge dinosaurs on horseback and wrangling them with 1 horse & regular rope, like a cow, instead of being rammed or crushed to death. Dr. Henry Wu who throughout the first 5 films consistently states his meticulous DNA innovations is the ""foundation of all things jurassic,"" is now a hapless regretful hippie, and supposedly did nothing, all dino research is credited to the long deceased, Lockwood daughter, who cloned herself while curing an incurable disease in her clone, yet failed to cure herself despite having identical genes.Fallen Kingdom is ridiculous because the clone daughter released all vicious flesh eating dinosaurs into the world after personally escaping death multiple times. She frees all dinos into SF, right after escaping being eaten alive, yet displays no remorse for the certain countless gruesome deaths she inflicts onto N California area, in both ppl & non ppl. Yrs later she stands by her decision as globally all ppl & animals become Dino food.This last Dominion film is much worse than Fallen Kingdom if one can stay awake after 20 minutes. Complete waste of time & humiliating end to what started as one of the greatest film franchises, 1st trilogy still entertains today, esp the 1st film.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

The film is about showing how humanity has not learned its lesson, and that large corporations are more about profit than the well-being of life on Earth. None of this prevents us from seeing many dinosaur scenes on the movie screen, bringing not only ""new"" creatures, but also some that stood out in previous films. The fights between animals, the pursuit of humans, the attacks, among other details, are all there. The production features much more exciting action and adventure scenes than in the first two films, leaving the park setting aside and bringing it to more urban areas. The protagonists, Claire and Owen, prove to be great heroes motivated by feelings of affection for dinosaurs, and as Maisie's parents.Anyone who expected Jurassic World: Dominion to be something like ""The Planet of the Apes"", with the creatures basically dominating the planet and justifying why they didn't coexist with humans, may be disappointed. Although there are some scenes in cities and reports of stories involving the ""new world"", in the end it actually returns to its origins, with events in an isolated space, with Ellie once again having to restart the company's facilities system, and the infamous clash between dinosaurs. These are left aside by the rescue plot and giant insects, but at least they didn't decide to present dinosaurs that didn't exist, like Domino Rex, although they did give space to unseen specimens like the giganotosaurus (said in the film to be the largest carnivore existing, although there are studies that talk about the spinosaurus), the pyroraptor (which roams Malta after Owen and Claire), the clawed therizinosaurus (despite being herbivorous, it brings a tense scene on the ice), the flying quetzalcoatlus (replacing the pterosaurs) and the friendly dimetrodon. Some of these presented with feathers, in reference to the theory that animals of the time were covered in this way.This difference in approach brings a new breath to the production, which looks at the creatures beyond the threat. Of course, there are still chases and moments of tension, but they are packed with a passionate vision that expands the connection with the Jurassic creatures. Unfortunately, this is not enough to prevent Dominion from falling into the traps of the previous two films. To fit so many elements into the same story, the script is filled with facilitations to the point of deliberately avoiding answering questions that arise throughout the plot. In itself, shortcuts are not a problem, as the franchise itself has already shown this by resolving the climax of the first with a Deus Ex Machina in the form of a T-Rex. The point is that the lack of whimsy is evident when everything is based solely on chance and luck to move the plot forward as quickly as possible. The lack of interest in development affects different parts of the project, from the absolutely ridiculous villains that border on caricatural, to the motivation of central figures. This undermines the viewer's involvement and takes away the flavor of the victories of heroes who have already managed to get through much more challenging things in the past.The film hits the nail on the head in bringing back the ""legacy cast"", the stars of the original film. Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are back as Ellie Sattler, Dr. Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm... and amazingly, they don't just have cameos and are the main protagonists of the plot, alongside Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard. Fans will go crazy seeing the old protagonists meeting the new generation, in an organic way that fits brilliantly into the film's plot. Dern and Neill have the most important narrative arc in the film, exploring the company behind the film's greatest threat and also resolving their relationship that began back in 1993, when they separated because she wanted to have children and he didn't. But with the exception of the ""Jurassic Park"" trio, who get all the attention to shine in delivering exactly what fans expect, everything else is watched with an almost listless distance. There are several moments in which Colin Trevorrow's uninspired direction wastes genuinely exciting moments to try to force them further with cheesy dialogue. The action is also marred by questionable decisions. The filmmaker bets on closed shots and a shaky handheld camera to cause claustrophobia, but ends up losing his hand because he doesn't know how to measure it. As a result, the tension ends up being reduced into a bewildering cacophony. The biggest proof that this approach doesn't work is in the way the film grows when it is put aside. Some of the most exciting or distressing moments in ""Dominion"" arise precisely when the plans open up and seek more creative ways to bring urgency and dynamism without becoming unnecessarily confusing.It is clear that throughout the films, especially the new ""Jurassic World"" saga, the absurdity of the situations only escalated more and more. Even leaving the suspension of disbelief turned on to the maximum, it is difficult to conceive and accept some situations played on the screen just as a script device to move the story from point A to point B or even to invalidate the laws of physics and logic. Here we have, more than ever, dinosaurs that when filmed in a static scene demonstrate weight and physical grandeur in their movement, but when involved in an action scene, they move at an astonishing speed, demonstrating above-normal agility, even the most large and heavy. But that's not even the worst thing, considering that animals would need to be involved in several of the production's action scenes. As an audience, we have to witness other feats that are difficult to swallow, such as characters surviving without a single scratch from a plane crash (which miraculously does not explode), as well as the endless rollover of a car from a cliff without, again, any scratch being noticed. On other characters. Not to mention the countless script facilitations and narrative conveniences to unite the two generations of ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Jurassic World"" in the final stretch, in order to create some jokes (""I'm not a fan of Jurassic World"" - says an important character at one point). At least, in this final stretch, we have some of the best scenes of the production, when the tone of the narrative returns to flirting with the horror introduced in the previous film in the franchise.To top it all off, we have to have fulfilled the production diversity quota, as most Hollywood films have been imposing in recent years. The character Ramsey Cole, by Mamoudou Athie, is the intelligent and good-hearted black man who discovers the evil plan of the capitalist company led by a white, middle-aged Caucasian CEO, obviously created to be the great villain of the story. There is also the character Kayla Watts, played by DeWanda Wise, who enters the story without any reason strong enough to justify her presence there (just the desire to help the parents in search of their daughter?), but who serves the progressive purposes of the narrative as the black, gay woman - who is also very attracted to redheads, by the way -, empowered and good at fighting, capable of flying a plane like few others - even saving herself and another important passenger from certain death thanks to her dexterity and skill - , facing dinosaurs with his gun looking tough, serving as indispensable support to participate in the chases and joining our protagonists to save the day once again.But perhaps what irritates the most is the ""training hand"" of Chris Pratt's character. If in the first film in the franchise the use of his hand in training dinosaurs was justified, especially Blue, who we saw had a closer relationship with his trainer, now this resource is used indiscriminately. Before any dinosaur that appears in front of Owen, he raises his hands in a lazy narrative solution to the script, causing the animal to promptly cease the threat and leave Owen and his friends free to move on to the next stage of their adventure. And to make matters worse, in the final third of the film, we see other characters making the same gesture and, you guessed it, it works.""Dominion"" will divide the public precisely because it takes a risk and brings something different, using the old franchise formula and expanding into directions never explored before, which will bring opportunities for the franchise to reach new heights - after all, since the canceled ""Jurassic Park 4 ""The producers have the idea of using dinosaurs as a military weapon, and after this film this possibility has never been more possible. Between new and old acquaintances (the Tyrannosaurus Rex always finds a way to appear), scenes of action, escape and redemption - especially that of Henry Wu -, ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" entertains in its long length. Still, the highest points of ""Domain"" do not compensate for the fragile structure that surrounds them. Even nostalgia works as a double-edged sword by pleasing fans with nostalgia while revealing that the ""Jurassic World"" trilogy would hardly reach a satisfying end without resorting to the past. There is a certain dose of irony in this negative observation, since the original Jurassic Park became so great precisely by exploring the past with such creativity. It's a shame that almost 30 years later, its structure has become so repetitive and worn out that perhaps a new period of preservation would do some good. With luck, the next explorer to touch this treasure preserved in amber will be more successful and bring new ideas to this universe.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's just that cringy. The CGI isn't even that great.The dialogue, story, everything was just an abomination and disrespectful to the original Jurassic Park.I read all the bad reviews, and thinking how bad can it be. Well, it was worse than I expected.They want us to believe that dinosaurs are just living everywhere, nesting on top of the Empire State Building? What? The whole training of them was already a ridiculous idea in previous Jurassic films, but this was just worse.There are so many annoying plot holes and things that make no sense I could spend hours writing it. But one, why the hell is Grant STILL digging for dinosaur bones when they are everywhere alive. This was simply just added to bring in the original nostalgia so we can see the two original characters where they started, but it made n sense whatsoever.And how many times do we have to see a precocious teen that rebel against their own interest and well-being, and due to the rebellion gets in trouble or captured/kidnapped and has to be rescued? This is like the 500th movie with that exactly premise.It didn't help that they cramped in 24 storylines with 60 characters.BIG TIME SKIP!!","18 out of 35 found this helpful.

While I was hoping for something big, bold, exciting, and new. I got nothing but a story that felt rehashed with characters that didn't really need a comeback (granted it was nice to see them) with a villain that was just as annoying as the last one.On the surface this film looks spectacular, but that's all it is. Looks. The dinosaurs are stunning, as they meander along their surroundings which have rich detail. The dino battles are spectacular, as well.But for all that this film has no oomph. The characters are bland, new and old, as they go through the motions. Unlike the previous two I didn't feel very emotional by the end. I didn't feel the need to shred a tear as there was no true bond amongst characters. Like I said above. The story just wasn't intriguing enough. Instead of focusing on a few topics. I felt there were multiple focuses they tried to attack that didn't mesh well and they didn't fit in too well into the incredibly long runtime.I don't know where they plan to go next if they even plan to go anywhere, but the ending was so disappointing, it felt like a betrayal to all main characters, new and old, if this was truly the end.Overall, there was much to be desired. While IMAX was cool to see this film in. It felt like a waste. If you're considering seeing this film. Wait for a cheap night if you're theatre offers one.Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps you make a decision on the film. If it does help. Please consider leaving a like, and giving me a follow if you don't already.Until next time.... Enjoy the show!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yet the movie was too long by at least ten minutes becoming too repetitive by the end. There were also a few unbelievable action scenes, especially with the Clare Dearing character that needed drastically edited or written differently.

It is the movie they should have made a long time ago.But they didn't. So much of Dominion is built off of the stupid, awful foundation of those first two Jurassic World movies. They squeeze as much blood out of this rock that they can get, despite Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom amounting to two hour toy commercials intercut with scenes worshiping a nearly 30 year old movie.Dominion finally breaks the cycle of trying to recapture the magic of the first Jurassic Park and gives us an original story. Not all of the details make sense or follow logic, because again, we're dealing with Jurassic World. Ten dinosaurs escape from a black market deal in the second movie, and somehow that means dozens of species of fully grown adult dinosaurs now exist on every continent on earth in only a few short years time.How useful a black market for dinosaurs might be is never really addressed or answered. There's vague handwaving that they're easily trained or something, but there's not a lot of clear answers as to why dinosaurs are better than say, wolves, or bears, or any existing terrestrial animals. It's just a leftover idea from Jurassic World 2 and we gotta incorporate it somehow, I guess.This movie can be dumb like that. It's also unexpectedly different in tone than any of the other movies to come before it. There's this weird science fantasy vibe to it at times, like a strange blend of Star Wars meets Mission Impossible. It's a far cry from what Jurassic Park was trying to be, but the action is scenes are good, the dialog can be fun, and it's actually weirdly enjoyable to see the original Jurassic Park actors rub up against the Jurassic World cast and kind of poke at each other.Plot-wise, it also ditches the Jurassic Park structure of ""best intentions pave the road to hell."" This movie is blatantly up front about what's going on and who the real villains are. Again, there's no theme park, it's more about the bigger consequences and fallout of what happened in the previous movies. Some of that is definitely unearned, but it just means this is less about watching an accident spiral out of control and more about trying to deal with a long overdue problem. Those are easy lines to read between, and I dug what it was trying to say.This is a movie that manages to be better than the foundation its built upon. That's faint praise, mind you, but this movie feels like it was a long time coming. Shame it only took them so many bad movies to get here.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It really focuses on the characters wrapping up their storylines. And when it's not character driven, it's jump scare driven. While I would say it is not as violent as the previous films there are significantly more jump scare moments. The kid behind us seemed to be about 8 and left the movie crying. If your kids can handle the previous movies on the small screen, they will probably be able to handle this one on the small screen. But also be aware that a jump scare at home is a lot different than a jump scare on a giant theater screen. We really loved it though because of the way it positively represented biological and adoptive family members as well as adoptees. Find our full adoptive parent review on our blog.

"7","/10","Crowd pleasing final bow out to one of cinema's most successful franchises","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8375627/?ref_=tt_urv","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0345596/?ref_=tt_urv","27 July 2022","STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulIn a world where dinosaurs are learning to co-exist among humans, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and his family live a quiet existence in the cold outback, with adopted daughter Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who was created with a DNA strand from a dinosaur embryo, and finds herself kidnapped by people eager to exploit this for their own ends. Meanwhile, Ellie Satler (Laura Dern) tracks down her old partner, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) for his help in breaking in to BioSyn headquarters to retrieve a sample they stole to develop a new bio engineered chemical. Their paths collide as their respective missions take their course.It's a depressing milestone in your life when you are finally able to remember going to see the original of a group of films that became a franchise, and recall through much more innocent eyes that first sense of magic and wonder that the success it enjoyed made producers want to try and recreate again and again, with far less enchanting results. And so I remember as a child, on holiday in America, seeing the original Jurassic Park, and not appreciating what a cultural moment I was a part of. And it seems at least that the makers of Jurassic World: Dominion are aware of this affection held by many for this original memory, and so in the film that promises to be the last in the series, the original cast are reunited in an all out, hell for leather romp that despite being massively flawed, is still crowd pleasing enough to get by.While the original cast have gained a few years on them, together they still have a magic and chemistry that works well together. The younger cast feel a little clunkier, but at least have lead star Pratt is there to carry things, and projects an effective presence, and is involved with some well staged action sequences, notably one involving a motorcycle coming out a cargo carrier. The plot feels pretty unremarkable, the dialogue feels unnatural and the pace sags at various stages, but all in all, for what it is, it just about hits the spot, and remains an intelligent commentary on the morality of science and our impact on the world.Nothing could ever recapture the magic of the original, or even the first few films after it, but this is a perfectly satisfying ode to bow out on, with enough thrills, chills, spills and sense of wonder to make it an event. ***","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The main ingredient missing in the movie is fear. The first Jurassic park movie held so much fear of these unknown large creatures that could kill us humans in a heartbeat, and there was also the awe factor of how amazing the dinosaurs were. Every character was at risk of dying in the movie and it was heart pounding to will them to live, and not all did.But Now, watching Jurassic World Dominion, I am faced with a movie that has no fear or awe in it. No one is going to die, and we all know it. No matter what situation, all the main characters are going to be safe without a doubt in our mind. The big grand dinosaurs are nothing compared to us smart and witty humans that have no issue surviving them... and on top of it they throw in these mission impossible fighting and running scenes that do not belong in this movie. And to push the viewer one step further the actors always look perfect. Oh did I just fall out of the sky in a plane crash? Well guess what, my makeup is perfect afterwords, not a scratch on me? I'm not shaken by that, why would I be? That is not realistic, it makes the movie feel cheap and phony. The visuals were awesome during the film, but everything else was terrible.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

The pace is terrible, unfocused and doesn't feel Jurassic Park/World at all. Second, the plot...ffs! What was that? Definitely not what I was looking for on a Dinossaur movie. Such weird editing decisions, at least 20 minutes to cut...At least, it gets much better since Malta, especially after the plane crash (well, including). In short, not as terrible as critics say.

I enjoyed seeing all the old actors but I mean how many curtain calls do you really need? And wow, mixing Chris Pratt with the other old equally mediocre actors who took this movie also.. It really didn't have the nostalgic impact I can tell the movie wanted the viewer to feel. This felt warily similar to The Force Awakens. This didn't really have the ""anticipation"" and ""wonder"" the original Jurassic Parks did. I really think neither Star Wars nor the Jurassic needed to hit up the Member Berries so soon, or so hard. The lead up to the ending scene was so anticlimactic and set up so that no matter what they did I was not going to be impressed. I'm 30 years old, a highly desirable market, and just for the love of Pete stop forcing member berries down my throat and make something I'll actually like.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But I felt like the excitement wasn't worth it. Dominion had a great hype with its main tagline, ""The Epic Conclusion Of The Jurassic Era"" and I'm pretty sure everyone expected to see how humans and dinosaurs are going to coexist after the events of the previous film, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. However, the new film, Jurassic World: Dominion, ended up focusing more on the new creatures called 'Locusts' and the clone girl, Maisie, than the dinosaurs. It's like the story took place in a dinosaur living world and because of that, it's a Jurassic movie.I was really looking forward to seeing a big freaking adventure with the domination of dinosaurs, not Locusts. So, this movie isn't really about an epic conclusion of dinosaurs. Also, I felt like it took much time to get into the actual plot but still the action scenes with dinos were pretty good and intense, though the Malta scene felt like Jurassic World had a crossover with Fast & Furious. The fight between the T-Rex and Giganotosaurus felt kinda inappropriate as we've already seen two alpha dinos fighting in the first Jurassic World film and seeing a new dinosaur that had a very short amount of screen time, die at the end was kinda hurtful.Overall, Jurassic World: Dominion is an ok film but probably every single Jurassic fan hoped for an actual Jurassic film as the final installment in the JW trilogy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Now almost 30 years later, here we have the sixth installment of this franchise, supposedly the conclusion as it brings together all of the legacy characters along with the new ones for the final hurrah. The result is a long big mesh of an uninspired plot, repetitive scenes, cringe-worthy script, and extremely bad editing making the veterans Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, and Laura Dern appear unrehearsed and amateurish. Special effects-wise, the dinosaurs look superior compared to their 1993 counterparts but here, you don't feel any ounce of suspense or care if the characters get eaten or not, unlike the porta-potty scene in 1993 that had you biting your nails and your heart pounding.

The movie has great movie script writing and special effects as well as great directing by Collin Trevorrow. The CGI is outstanding, and so are the performances. Along with Chris Pratt (Owen Grady) Bryce Dallas Howard (Clair Dearing) and Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) reprising their roles from the previous film, which is Jurassic World: A Fallen Kingdom, The old cast from the original 1993 Jurassic Park movie returns in this movie. Sam Neil (Dr. Allen Grant) Laura Dern (Ellie Sattler) and Jeff GoldBlum (Ian Malcolm.) The movie has two plot points, the first one revolves around Clair and Owen protecting Maisie from poachers and bad scientists who want to experiment on her and Blue, the Velociraptor's baby. The second plot point which is the one that most movie buffs, amateur online movie critics and movie viewers absolutely hate in this movie, is about the Locus bugs feeding off of the crops and food sources for the humans, and in order to put an end to this huge problem, Allen and Ellie must go to the Biosyn headquarters building in order to get a Bio-Sample of the Locus Bug's DNA inside of a lab. For me the second plot point is very interesting and it helps the pacing of the movie. Putting both of those plot points together, makes for an amazing Jurassic World film. This movie overtakes my original favorite Jurassic Park movie, which was Jurassic Park: The Lost World, when I was a kid. Jurassic World: Dominion is a great wrap up film for the whole franchise. One of the taglines for this movie is: The Epic Conclusion. I do hope it is the conclusion, because if other filmmakers come along and want to continue this franchise, then movie buffs and amateur online movie critics need to letters and make calls to the production companies and studios, telling them that there shouldn't be a seventh film. The style of the movie is fantastic and I couldn't have asked for a better ending to the Jurassic Park franchise. This definitely gets a full 5 stars out of 5 and is a movie that I think should win at least a Golden Globe. Another one of my favorite things about the way that the movie is scripted, is that the dinosaurs come in straight away, so parents, guardians and older siblings and cousins won't have small children asking them when do the dinosaurs come in. This is truly a terrific movie.","15 out of 25 found this helpful.

This is the third in Trevorrow's trilogy of Jurassic World films taking forward the vision Spielberg created with Jurassic Park (1993) from Michael Crichton's novel. The original introduced the world to the magic of CGI with effects so fluid you could believe that dinosaurs were real and with all the advances in computer technology in the 29 years since Treverrow certainly makes use of it and gives the audience plenty of dinosaurs and impressive visuals to marvel at however the problem for me has always been the scripts and casting which has made his three Jurassic World films the weakest out of the six.Jurassic World Dominion is a nod to what has gone before by bringing back the original cast members of Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum and contains lots of fun references to past movies but offers very little in advancing the overall arch of a bigger story. What we get is another unscrupulous scientist who has a purpose built laboratory and taken genetics too far with plans to control the world's food supply. We are introduced to more characters and there's at least two stories running alongside each other which converge to bring the characters from the original cast with the new on screen together for the first time. I do like Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas-Howard as actors but I never thought their casting in Jurassic World worked. They don't have the chemistry needed and compared to the original actors they seem too one dimensional.Trevorrow and co-writer Emily Carmichael don't think big enough, they just go through the motions of previous Jurassic World adventures hitting all the right notes but this instalment doesn't go anywhere and doesn't provide the big finale fans were looking for. The overall theme is that we ultimately need to co-exist in order to survive as dinosaurs adapt to live side by side with modern day creatures here on Earth. This sentiment is reinforced by a narrator over the closing moments which seem almost tacked on just so we get the message.Dominion has all the right ingredients we've come to expect from a Jurassic movie with plenty of action, thrills, scares, dinosaurs and comedic moments to relieve the tension but we've seen it all before and apart from reuniting with the original cast, with B. D. Wong being the only actor to appear in all 6 movies, I came away feeling it was an unnecessary sequel. It all seems rather forced, clumsy and doesn't flow as well as it should and the continuation of the series would have benefited from having a more visionary director at the helm. I always felt that special effects artist turned director Joe Johnston did a much better job in taking the reins from Spielberg with Jurassic Park III (2001). Spielberg initially kept things simple so the audience knew where they were in the story, here Trevorrow throws in too many things, the main one being the subplot around Maisie Lockwood, without exploring them with any depth and at 2hrs 27mins this has the longest running time in the franchise which is not always put to good use.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"6","/10","An Underwhelming Conclusion to the Jurassic World Trilogy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8250940/?ref_=tt_urv","jaredkjacoby","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur111679790/?ref_=tt_urv","18 June 2022","Set four years after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Dominion has Owen and Claire raising Maisie alone in a remote area where she will not come into contact with anyone. However, employees from a dinosaur research company known as Biosyn Genetics kidnaps Maisie when she tries to leave as well as Blue's mysterious child. Claire and Owen set out to rescue them both. Meanwhile, Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler go to Biosyn to investigate the seeds that are left uneaten after a locust raid threatens food supply around the world.As someone whose favorite movie is Jurassic Park, I am rather mixed in Jurassic World. It was fine, but it did not have the tension or thrill of the first film. I thought Fallen Kingdom was much better, but I am in the minority there. I thought it did a great job focusing on the fright of the dinosaurs as well as showing how humans can be just monstrous if not more so. I also thought the ending was a nice setup to this film and it made me pretty excited for the ending to this trilogy. Does it end with a bang or a whimper?Let us start with the good. First of all, the cast is great. Seeing Sam Neill as Alan Grant and Lauren Dern as Ellie Sattler was a joy and they have just as smooth chemistry as they did nearly three decades ago. Some things never change with them, especially for Grant. Jeff Goldblum is much older, but he is as smooth and solid as ever as Ian Malcolm.The World cast are no slouches either. Bryce Dallas Howard continues to improve as Claire as she grows from being a rather cowardly Jurassic World employee to a strong person who is not afraid to step into action. They even show how much she has grown from the first by having her go on a dangerous rescue mission in her first scene. Chris Pratt is great as Owen. I always felt that this has always been Pratt's coolest role where he is a bit more serious but he still has a sense of humor for the more insane encounters he and Claire face. Isabella Sermon is solid as the rebellious Maisie her backstory continues to be pretty fascinating. Of the new characters, I liked DeWanda Wise as Kayla Watts. She is a fun character to watch as she is skilled and energetic. Wise seems to have a blast in this role. The cast is great overall.The cinematography is great. The shots look stunning as ever with some images that look almost out of a horror flick. The scene where Claire is trying to stay calm when encountering a carnivorous dinosaur showcases the movie's visual style perfectly. The dinosaurs look solid enough, though there are some scenes of questionable CGI. The action scenes are fun to watch overall, with the motorcycle chase standing out. The musical score by Michael Giacchino is fantastic and the sound design for the dinosaurs make them even more threatening. This all makes the movie technically solid. With a great cast, solid action, beautiful cinematography and some memorable new characters, why did I still leave the theater underwhelmed?Jurassic World: Dominion is a movie that I wish that I loved, but I don't. In fact, it is pretty disappointing. First of all, the story is a jumbled mess. There is so much going on that it is hard to keep track with the plot. Even then, it starts off so slow that it gets difficult to invest in the story, but it does pick up a little bit around the beginning of the second act. As much as I love seeing Grand and Sattler again, their role feels more like having them for the sake of having them rather than truly needing them. Blue gets absolutely nothing to do, though if you thought she got too much screen time in the second film, you might appreciate this.The biggest problem I have with the story though is the fact that it does little build upon the setup from the last film. Dinosaurs running around the real world? That sounds insane! There are so many ideas you can create with this premise, but most of the movie is about taking down another evil corporation and destroying the locusts. Locusts? I came to see this movie to see humanity live among dinosaurs. The locusts are unnecessary and they hinder the story more than anything. The one scene taking place underground where we get to see how dinosaurs are used in a club is more interesting than anything to do with locusts. Why could they not just build on that or other areas affected by the spread of the dinosaur population? That would have made for some great world-building.As for the villains, they are disappointing as well. The main human villain, Lewis Dodgson has one threatening scene, but he is not given much to do after that. I thought the human from Fallen Kingdom was better because he was much more detestable and vile. That was the kind of villain that I wanted to punch. Dodgson is pretty evil too, but he feels more generic. As for the Giganotosaurus, it is a massive disappointment. It hardly acts like a threat to the main characters, yet it is treated like a villain. I think they did not give this dinosaur enough screen time. If they focused on this dinosaur more than the locusts, maybe they would have shown how much of threatening predator this beast could have been.Despite my rant about the story and villains, I do not dislike Jurassic World: Dominion. I liked too much stuff in it to call it a bad film. I just wish it was great. It should have been great. That is why I feel so disappointed and underwhelmed with it. However, what does work works really well. If you are looking for a nostalgic experience and/or you want to see some cool dinosaur action, you'll get plenty of that here. Maybe it is time to lay this series to rest and move on before it can get really bad.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

After a while it felt like a commercial for dinosaurs. ""Hey look it's this dinosaur, oooh aaaah"", ""there's another one we've never seen in these movies, oooh aaahhh"". This was a major letdown.

The Therizinosauras otherwise known as ""Claw thing"" in the game is noticeablly the most dangerous but looks quite passive. They squeezed so many different dinos in this movie that it's actually quite fun. I give the film 4 stars just for that (Bringing popular gaming culture into high budgets are always awesome).The story and writing is sub-par -- equal to Uncharted, though. It's just throw-away plot just to have a popcorn shoved in your mouth movie. I think Jurassic Park 1-3 are definitely more investing with the last 2 being the latter.I love the actors, all of them actually, so they did their part yet short-lived. We have so many timelines happening here. Glad Chris Pratt can still find acting after Hollywood discriminating people of faith.6/10 like the rest of the Jurassic World movies. Fun flick to chill out to and learn about different dinosaurs. The characters still act canon and that's a big thing.

And ""Dominion"" is highly anticipated by many fans because not only does the movie have dinosaurs, it also explores the idea of dinosaurs and humans coexisting in the same world. It's disappointing to not only see the movie exploring that topic very lightly, but also because there's not enough dinosaurs. This movie has many elements to it-evil corporation, rescue mission, even a commentary on reality. But because it's trying to be too many things all at once, the movie loses its main focus on dinosaurs.The movie does have many cool components. Instead of having CG dinosaurs, are some real puppet ones. And the old trio getting back together is always fun to watch. However, that's it. The rest of the movie is dull and lacking creativity. Most importantly, the tension of dinosaur attacks are nowhere to be found. The T-Rex scene in the first ""Jurassic Park"" film was so brilliantly shot that the audience felt the fear and tension. Now, it's just dinosaurs being loud in front of the camera. The flat characters and bad dialogues only makes the movie worse.It's really disappointing to see the ""Jurassic World"" franchise end in such a unremarkable way.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Yes it feels a little lost and confused on what it wants to be, but its not an awful time, not a great one, not a particularly memorable one, but certainly not an awful one.Worth watching for the original cast atleast, to see them one final time in characters we love.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Like the first movie the basic plot coulda been done without dinosaurs (in the first movie they could have been done with malfunctioning rides/automated systems/cleaning robots). Its not a thriller per say maybe a heist movie? Its basically Claire and Ellie seeking to infiltrate a corrupt company. The movie has heavy themes of conservation, anti capitalism and preservation of the environment and the villain is basically a Bezos/musk expy whos willing to put millions at risk to make a buck.So while at its core the movie works as a regular good movie about fighting that situation(albiet not groundbreaking), it still has tons of good character interaction, new dinosaurs , and the heroes instead of being victims cleverly avoiding danger through desperation, teamwork and cleverness (giving the raptor scene int he climax of the final movie vibes).And there was a ton of fanservice that lovers of the franchise will enjoy. Just like W1 and 2 there are shoutouts and classic camera shots recreated with different context. And i dont think any of them felt forced (Marvel's :Guy steps into the camera, it zooms in on his face :""Its me Blorbo""). 1 Kinda corney moment with Blue, a certain interaction between two characters made me think there was something cut that showed more about the character.Enjoy!","16 out of 28 found this helpful.

It makes me sad that this trilogy didn't thrill me any more than it did. It just failed to capture the suspense and excitement of the original trilogy. Speaking of that, bringing back the main trio from the original trilogy and making them such a big part of this film was a great idea. It was fun and nostalgic having them back. It was interesting seeing dinosaurs let loose in a modern world. That was the biggest draw for me. We got to leave behind the usual tropical, zoo like setting for various different locations such as the snowy Sierra Mountains and the bustling city of Malta.I enjoyed some of the action sequences but things tended to get too preposterous too often. Unfortunately, the acting isn't great. It's just not the kind of movie that gives the cast much to work with. That's not to say the acting is all bad, there's just plenty of moments where it's distractingly unconvincing. It's a long movie, and I finished it, so that's saying something. But there's no desire to watch this again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There was just something missing. Not enough dinosaurs. Too many characters doing unrealistic things. Side characters that just vanish from the plot and are never addressed again. Iconic signature legacy characters simply trying to deliver their best most familiar recap of their character. The action and carnage was weaker this time around. Navigation of the plot is all over the place. The writing has its corny rushed moments. This film nearly crumbles under the weight of its previous films loose ends and baggage. It tries to be its own thing but staggers through a muddy forced espionage story. Dinosaurs are swept away to the sidelines as background details and decorations who pop up once in a while to say 'boo'. Our human characters aren't interesting nor developed enough while juggling numerous groups of them as characters. This feels like damage control from Fallen Kingdom tanking half this movie. All we see here is a few more of the same familiar thrills and chills, but less epic, and with less to tell. Everything is so rushed with so many sprawling story beats, there's no moment to really soak in the suspense, dread, or beauty of a dinosaur. The writing and excuse to gather the gangs of characters together feels contrived. More of the same. Fun to watch, but underwhelming. I can just say I'm relieved the second trilogy is over. I only hope the next one finds a way.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A little bit of plot, run away from Dinosaurs, a little bit more plot, run away from Dinosaurs and repeat, and repeat, and repeat. It got so stale so fast I wanted to turn the film off, and lets not forget some of the escape situations are so farfetched I don't understand how the writters expected you to sit through it all.Jurassic World: Dominion is nothing more then another Hollywood budget film rehashing old characters from past and present films in the franchise with extremely lazy writing. Do not recommend this one.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Well yes but acually no. Its an amazing addition to the franchise but the reason why i say this is because it lacked lots of expectations as well as the Giganotosarus being an antagonist, but was underused and was treated like an acual animal the problem is that i like how it was treated like an acual animal especially when he faught the rex over a depressed deer and the fight was more realistic than people think.

Whilst Jurassic World Dominion does present a world where dinosaurs and humanity co-exist on the planet, this presentation doesn't necessarily give us a movie about that.What we actually get is yet another movie half set within a secure compound where for a variety of reasons its integrity begins to break down and the obvious predictable problems and set pieces occurs and half a semi Indiana Jones style globetrotting adventure. This is set alongside a story of the dangers and potential evolution of genetic modifications that will either kill or save the planet/humanity.The effects and visuals are mostly incredible, which is what you would expect from a massive blockbuster. And it does feel like a blockbuster in terms of size and scale of pretty much everything that you see. The run time is the best part of 2 and half hours and whilst the first third is rather slow it does lend itself to what you presume they were trying to achieve; an epic final chapter, even if they fall short of the mark on that.There are a lot of odd things that you can overlook merely on the grounds of it being a Hollywood movie, such as Chris Pratt's character having the strength to be able to lasso and restrain a dinosaur five to ten times the size of himself that had been running most likely over 70mph, but one of things i felt was most odd was Dr Wu. It's essentially a completely different character in Jurassic World Dominion and whilst i can appreciate a character can have different motivations from one movie to the next (or turn over a new leaf so the speak) it's almost as if they gave the guy a sedative before filming.I got to the end and i was expecting something else to happen before the credits and I think that's the best way to sum up this movie. Ultimately unsatisfying and not fitting as a final instalment and i suspect the filmmakers will look back at this in the future and feel they let Michael Crichton, everyone who then created such a classic movie back in 1993 down and the fans. Such a missed opportunity.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The effects were appalling, the biggest predator type t-rex is portrayed almost as blind and with the moving speed of a snail who seems to be relying on smell alone. The movement and supposedly intense scenes weren't intense at all, it just made you sigh with absolute frustration and annoyance at how much they butchered this Jurassic Park movie and how much it wastes the viewers time. I'm quite surprised the calibre of actors who were in the film accepted to act it in to be honest it's definitely a career damaging move for them. I'm sorry if I come across as rude but wow I'm so frustrated at the film and I want my 2 hours of life back.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

masterpiece of the first part that starts especially in the middle of the movie. Which was the accepted effect of a movie in the 2 previous years . (though not the impression that remains in imitation). In the Jurassic Park 1993, none of the dinosaurs change into form, but the behavior that the characters emit in front of it creates an image of them in the mind. Maybe that's why we hardly feel such a void. . The most powerful sequence of jurassic world 2022 is when one of the dinosaurs looks at the surface of the water,like the most powerful sequence of jurassic park 1993 when looks at the car. Here too, none of the dinosaurs transform into a form. The brilliance of Spielbergto definition the narrative covers the Plot's flaws in Jurassic Park. Of course, I think that after some time, Spielberg himself came to the conclusion to use the sense of humor, but this sense of humor or caricature or darkness or the softness aspect should be done in the form of dinosaurs. Not to make dinosaurs that look too natural and serious while deflecting a sense of humor in a different angle.The action senses related to the Clare are perfect ; the rest
are istereotype. 3/75/5.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

Even for people who weren't into dinosaurs. After first generation of actors got old but audience was infused with young, they fortunately found Chris Pratt. But then came Marvel\DC and all the superhero movies. What seemed like amazing visual effects in 90s in Jurassic Park Movies now were almost nothing.The Jurassic Park films held on because of storytelling and character chemistry. But in this they tried to do too much. There were way too many people in it. Nobody had enough time, even though movie is 2h15m.The main threat in the movie is still very novel and correct. But even pursuing fixing that threat had to put on the back burner because otherwise big dinosaurs won't have time in addition to actors.Perhaps they will learn the lesson and have better focus next time unless this one has killed franchise.Should have been 5 but 6 just because they didn't copy paste background music that has become so ubiquitous in superhero\creature\fantasy movies that you would skip a movie just by that criteria alone in trailer.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first hour was dull and boring and had nothing special to it it was just another Jurassic park film adding nothing to the table . It was in my opinion extremely boring . When it comes to the second hour I enjoyed it way more because of the biosyn corporate stuff. I usually really enjoy this type of corporate secret bad guy stuff in movies and I very well enjoyed it with this . That was definitely the highlight of the film for me. The 6th and final movie of the Jurassic park franchise is in my opinion Not such a great conclusion to the long and beloved franchise . Even though the movie has its moments , Jurassic world dominion falls to be the weakest entry in the franchise .

It's safe to say the franchise has run out of steam at this point and arguably, it's been the case with all Jurassic Park/Jurassic World sequels since ""The Lost World."" At the very least, I anticipated that ""Dominion"" would surpass the mediocrity of ""Fallen Kingdom"" but somehow, ""Dominion"" wound up being even more convoluted and messy than Fallen Kingdom.To sum it up, Dominion many problems including a rushed script, too many subplots, disposable characters and a very bland, forgettable villain. One of the movie's biggest draws was returning characters from the first ""Jurassic Park"", Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler and Ian Malcolm, but even the reunion of the original cast members doesn't save ""Dominion"" from being an incredibly bland entry in the JW franchise, although admittedly I was happy to see Jeff Goldblum receive more screentime where he gets to deliver some genuinely funny lines. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the rest of the characters who feel underdeveloped and underused throughout the film despite a few moments where the character dynamic between the old and new characters was actually decent. If only the script was better then ""Dominion"" could've done a better job of bridging together the two franchises, Jurassic Park and Jurassic World"" and its characters and brought a satisfying close to the series.Overall, ""Jurassic Park Dominion"" is a sequel that plays it safe by relying on fan service and even toning down the violence in an effort to make the film more family-friendly than its predecessors as there's hardly much blood spilled in the movie. Granted, Jurassic Park/World has always been a PG-13 franchise that doesn't rely heavily on gore although the franchise still didn't shy away from depicting gruesome dinosaur kills. In spite of the above, Dominion, which features dinosaurs roaming around on a global scale, somehow manages to be even more tame than the previous JP/JW films where it contains fewer dinosaur kills and violence. All of the above contribute to ""Dominion"" being a very average, by-the-numbers sequel and a good indicator that the dino franchise has completely run out of steam at this point and probably should remain extinct.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The lack of direction of the cast is laugh out load funny but the real pain is the absence of any credible storyline. How can a movie franchise with a budget of this size end up with writing as empty as this? We deserve better. But it still enjoyable if you love your Jurassic scaly craziness.

The original Jurassic Park is one of my absolute favorite movies that I have seen so many times that I have it pretty much memorized. It was so far ahead of its time and still lives up to today. It is such an amazing classic. And this 'finale' didn't do it justice.But it wasn't horrible either. It was decent enough to still have me waiting to see what comes next. There were plenty of moment that were cringe. The story wasn't written very well. A lot of it was predictable. And too much reliance on nostalgia. Although I loved seeing Dr. Grant and my dear Dr. Sattler welcomed back to the Jurassic franchise, their roles in this movie didn't do their characters justice either. Still there were a few parts I did enjoy and I didn't necessarily hate anything. It just isn't very rewatchable and a lot of parts were unnecessary.Also I was mainly excited to see Blue and her baby but there just wasn't enough of them which left me disappointed. I did like that they explored Maisie's character a bit more but she honestly got pretty annoying at times. It mostly felt like they were trying too hard to do fan service and stuffed too much of it into the movie that they neglected creating a compelling story overall.I love my dinos though so I was still happy to see them again and some of the visuals were beautiful. So I am glad I saw it on the big screen instead of waiting for it to be released like some people I know plan to do. I just wish they had put more effort into the storyline. I guess like the first trilogy where I pretend the sequels don't exist, I'll have to do the same here and pretend Fallen Kingdom and Dominion don't exist so I can continue to enjoy Jurassic World which I do like even if it it doesn't match the perfection of the original Jurassic Park.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Second was ok but lost its way around the midpoint and to the end. This new one I credit with attempting to find a new variant to the story but in the end, where can it really go? But back to the same tried and tested formula of the other five. After all, it is a dinosaur movie! The action was routine, story pretty basic and too many holes where you know it doesn't make sense that governments etc would not be aware etc. Effects were great but in the end this is a by the numbers plot and the cast are wasted with standard dialogue. I got bored at about the half way point and that stayed with me until the end. Not awful but not great either. Great effects wasted on an uninspired script.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It seems that the effects, the constant running/racing/chasing around and screaming has to compensate for the lack of everything else. But that goes for more Hollywoord movies nowadays ... Story is totally predictable. This movie doesn't bring anything new on the table, it all has been done before in the previous movies in this francize. Everything in this movie is predictable if you now the format of current days Hollywoord action movies. You know when the action starts and stops. How it goes. Who wins or loses. Etc.Acting is mediocre and lacks believable emotion for the most part. Despite they brought back the original cast for parts of the movie. To be honest that was the only thing that convinced me to watch this movie. Hope that it would bring something back of that original movie.

It doesn't have anything to it, it's just so surface level and hollow that you can't help but not care about what's happening, hell I even started getting sleepy watching it.The Good:
Not much unfortunately which is a real shame as they had such a great concept of dinosaurs in the real world and did absolutely nothing with it. However I will say that the CGI and practical effects are really good and so are lots of the dinosaurs designs.The Bad:
There is a lot wrong with the script. For me one of the biggest things is that the movie doesn't seem to care about dinosaurs in the slightest. The film is so incredible unfocused and bland that you just don't care. The returning OG's aren't interesting and don't really feel like the same characters with the exception of Ian Malcom. Hollywood is so saturated with nostalgia bait and it's rarely actually good. Not to mention in previous Jurassic films they have a clear indication of who the big bad final boss dinosaurs is but in this one who have barely any clue until it appears for the final fight. Not to mention the final fight lasts about a minute and nothing happens in it, there is no stakes or intensity amplified by the fact that you don't care. And also lots of the cool new dinosaurs are in the film for about a minute before they disappear and we never see them again.This film is not one I would recommend and is definitely not worth your time, money or attention. Anything this film does, any other Jurassic film does better.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I didn't have any expectations for them and I wasn't thrilled with them either, but they didn't disappoint either. The same is true for me with Jurassic World Dominion where the film neither surprised nor disappointed me. It was such a surefire good movie for me. Story-wise, fine, but nothing great. Of course, the action scenes pulled it off, which is a given for this franchise. On the one hand, it was nice to see old Jurassic Park characters return. Nothing epic or breathtaking for me. It was just good, like the whole movie. I enjoyed the final battle, although I thought it could have been a bit longer. But maybe there would have been too much action. Either way, a good movie for me. What the fans of the franchise think of it I don't know, but a friend of mine who is a fan had the same opinion, saying that it is a good movie and nothing more, and even as a non-fan I feel the same way. A good movie that I can recommend. It didn't impress but it didn't disappoint.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It kept the action diverse enough to not grow tiresome.Also, with a cast this stacked, it goes without saying that the performers all give it their all and give some charisma that this script does not deserve.This is where my positives end, because this has an incredibly dumb, contrived screenplay, much like other big films I've seen in recent blockbuster memory.This third film does not feel like the conclusion to a trilogy, let alone a franchise. It exist just so that there can actually BE a trilogy. There is no attempt to provide payoff to anything that was established in previous films, or even in this film.The opening sequence gives us a newscaster voiceover giving us a bunch of information we already knew, then we are subjected to over two hours of people running around either performing Macguffin fetch quests or fleeing from dinosaurs. Finally, we get another news voiceover at the end of the movie that wraps up all the conflict and loose ends with a nice pretty bow.I feel sick for these actors, knowing that their talent was wasted on such thankless roles. None of them actually develop in any substantial way or even contribute to the plot. In fact, most of them don't even need to be in the movie.Half the cast is only here for nostalgia porn, and the entire cast just plays the same role of ""person who runs around and occasionally spouts expository dialogue."" It's embarrassing. Even the villain is just ""evil Steve Jobs,"" another uninspired addition.Lastly, this movie promoted itself on the concept of ""DINOSAURS ARE ON THE MAINLAND NOW!!!"" This was such a false advertising gimmick and I feel insulted.We really never see any sort of consequences of dinosaurs being integrated into the world. 90% of the movie takes place on a corporate compound, and it's even more boring than the mansion in the last movie.This is a movie that is a product; it banks on the popularity of its brand name and doesn't actually have any character, ideas, themes, or even set pieces that feel unique or even add up to make a story.The more I think about it, the more I hate it.Shameless.","31 out of 69 found this helpful.

I don't think this movie is as bad as some people say it is.Let's get to the good things first, which are few in between. 1) The movie has good and, at times, rather creative action that really utilizes the objects and even dinosaurs in their surroundings. 2) It has great visuals. Out of all the Jurassic movies, this one is undoubtedly the most impressive in terms of visuals. 3) Gives you a plethora of different dinosaurs, and while I do think some of them are unnecessarily put into this movie, if you could ignore that then the variety of dinosaurs would certainly be something you enjoy.That's where the good things end. Everything else about this movie is horrible.The plot is predictable, stupid, and inconsistent. The returning characters provide nothing interesting to the table besides being nostalgia bait. When it's not about action, the movie is a bore to watch. A certain character in the movie gets redeemed in the movie just because he feels guilty for what he did. The resolution at the end is especially strange because for the entire length of the movie, there was nothing that could have possibly made that ending.The characters could use the Force because Chris Pratt's character could use the hand thing on literally any dinosaur and somehow stop it for a moment, not to mention how he seems to even be physically stronger than some of the dinosaurs here - on second thought, that's actually quite funny.It does provide an interesting question about identity with the clone girl from the previous movie, if you even remember her, but the execution makes it wasted potential.Overall, while I don't think it's as bad as I've seen some people describe it, it's certainly nothing good either.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Far superior to Jurassic Park 3 in every way, and completely better than anything the Jurassic World franchise has produced yet. Not only does it bring back the original crew, but this movie is clever, fun, scary and exciting. If I had to choose one thing to dislike about this movie, it would only be that it's a hyper simplistic plot. But that's not the point of the film. The purpose of this movie is to wrap up the Jurassic World and Park franchise, and it does it perfectly. Yes, the story itself isn't anything too impressive, but it's about as simplistic and complex as the original Jurassic Park, which is what you want in a dinosaur movie. It's not about some evil hybrid serial killer dinosaur, or some weird special agent hybrid dinosaur; it's a bit like a heist film with plenty of dinosaurs all throughout. The CGI is amazing, the acting is great, and the variety of creature is immense. But the best two things about this movie are the themes and stunning cinematography. The action scenes are jam packed with motion and power, without being overwhelming, and the dinosaurs are stunning and beautiful. Most scenes incorporating them are immaculate, visual, artistic, and inspiring. Best of all this movie has humor and horror. The funny bits are not the stupid slap stick childish jokes of the last three movies. These little humourous cues are organic and fun, mostly made by Ian Malcolm, which fits his character. No more mind numbing half winded jokes that are just randomly placed in the movie for a cheap laugh. That being said, the horror aspect of the movie was intense. Plenty of scary scenes to keep you on your toes; big vicious frightening dinosaurs, and gruesome death scenes akin to the first and second Park (Not World) movies. Just enough violence, just enough horror, and just enough joy. There are also plenty of call backs to the earlier films, and some retconning which helps bring certain character development points together. All in all, it was an amazing movie and worthy of it's title. GO SEE IT.","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

Though I can see them doing more since it will probably make a lot of money.It's cool seeing the original cast team up with the younger crew. Pratt and Howard are decent but newcomer DeWanda Wise comes close to stealing the show as a badass pilot. She's tough and charming in a cocksure fashion that lead star Chris Pratt has nailed down to a tee. Campbell Scott is pretty bad as an evil tech CEO though.It's heartwarming to see Sam Neill and Laura Dern reprise their roles again as Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler. Although Jeff Goldblum is more fun to watch as Ian Malcolm again and he has the best one-liners.Compared to the first two JW movies, one thing I appreciate about DOMINION is that it embraces its absurdness with gusto. For better or worse. There's a subplot with mutant locusts that's pretty stupid and it feels like it belongs in a different movie. The bulk of the story is essentially a rescue mission which feels more in the vein of earlier movies, particularly The Lost World or Jurassic Park 3.Of course any of the stuff that involved dinosaurs directly was cool as hell. Seeing a black market where evil mercenaries sell dinos instead of drugs or guns was pretty cool. The raptor motorcycle chase is an awesome action scene. There's an early chase scene involving triceratops that's neat as well.In terms of technical prowess, this installment has the best looking dinosaurs out of the Jurassic World trilogy. There are some shots where the CGI for the primeval beasts looks phenomenal. And you can see there's a concentrated effort to rely more on practical effects and animatronic models.The finale takes place in a park full of escaped dinosaurs once more but there's more variety to the prehistoric wildlife this time. There's feathered raptors that can swim, a giant dino with massive claws named Therizinosaurus, the classic T-Rex, an aggressive rival named the Giganotosaurus, and plus a lot of angry pterosaurs the size of airplanes.At being number six in the franchise, there are some new ideas that lend themselves for cool action scenes and dangerous predicaments. As for the science fiction elements, it's practically a cartoon at this point. Giant bugs and human cloning, oh my. But it's hard not to enjoy seeing a plane taken out by a giant pterosaur or watching a mosasaur sink a fishing boat.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was ... okay. Not as bad as the critics say, but not a masterpiece, either. It was fun. Unlike last year's ""Ghostbusters"" where the originals got about 10 minutes of screen time. The three original JP characters were a major part of this storyline. Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are still ""hot"" for 70-somethings, but Laura Dern has injected so much plastic into her face that she is absolutely unrecognizable! And while 10 or 15 years ago I would have rolled my eyes at the ""easy villain"" being Big Bio, we all know that's absolutely TRUE now. It was a nice wrap-up with a nice homage to its beginnings. But I'd either see it on your movie theatre's cheap day, like I did, or wait for it to be available for home viewing. Not sure it's worth FULL price admission.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This film is filled with the typical dinosaur action sequences, a couple of which can feel indicative of Jason Bourne and Indiana Jones action scenes.Bringing back the original three was a stroke of genius and I appreciated how they fit them into the plot without them feeling shoehorned in.Where this movie fails for me was the flimsy plot.If you start to think, there are lots of coincidences and inconsistencies that push the plot forward.This film is not smartly written like some blockbusters today. It is nowhere near as smart as the original film.This film promised a story about dinosaurs in the real world, but instead it uses that as a catalyst for a story that has nothing to do with them being out in the real world. I feel as though this story could have been told if the cliffhanger from Fallen Kingdom never even happened.Beyond that, if this film was trying to produce a satisfying conclusion to each trilogy's story it horrendously failed. If it was simply trying to get me to smile really quick at seeing the original cast again, it succeeded spectacularly.In conclusion, this film is a one-watch scenario for me. It delivers the thrills of dinosaur action sequences and the joy of seeing my childhood heroes back on the screen. However, it did not fully deliver on the promise of a plot based around dinosaurs in the wild and it did not deliver the proper conclusion for the characters we've been following.The cast ranking
Laura Dern
Sam Neill
Jeff Goldblum

Isabella SermonChris Pratt is my favorite actor, but I was so disappointed with how little the script gave him to work with.If you're expecting a ton of dino action sequences, this is the film for you. If you're expecting a smartly written, Endgame-level conclusion to decades of story, just rewatch Endgame.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Couple with team Park investigating the malfeasances joining team World attempting to rejoin their family.This one has little love. People tend to rate it as the worst Jurassic film. I'd argue this one actually has a more characterization than most, and is attempting to tell a story that's more than just dinosaurs chasing and eating people.Honestly, with these that's all I'm expecting. Dinosaurs chasing people. Perhaps a trite love interests and message about working as a group leads to success. If that's all I get from Jurassic Park, it's expected.Likewise, teams of Disney paid critics tend to trash anything that's not owned by Disney. So criticisms from critics responding to a medium nearly dead by streamers not only makes me roll my eyes, but also extend a message to New Yorker, Times, Chicago Tribune critics that they're cool with remakes of Toy Story from 1995 to resent, 20 remakes of Iron Man, and sequel trilogy that copied the original to the point it lost its fans. (This paragraph is to discredit critics)Dominion is the best of the Jurassic World movies. The first was a remake of Jurassic Park but bigger, Fallen Kingdom went all sci network original movie. Compare to the Park trilogy 1-2 are great, but 3 has Pterodactyls so... lolJust finished watching it on Peacock. Loved it. Had a lot of fun.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sadly not.It was like they forgot the ending of fallen kingdom and instead opted for a complete rehash of Jurassic Park 1 and 2. The plot was meh, the scripting was dire, the wokeness cribgeworthy.In the 1st Jurassic Park movies (chiefly 1 and 2) they were more like psychological horror movies with dinosaurs. The dinosaurs were genuinely petrifying, the T really and velociraptors gave me nightmares. They were pure killers devoid of emotion. They did not have human traits attached to them and the SFX brought a real sense of realism to the movie.In the new trilogy we see too much of the dinosaurs, they've been given a friendly persona and had humanistic qualities attached to them, and instead of we need to get put of here and leave them alone, we now have this sense of hippy we must protect them at all costs compassion for them. It's ruined the whole ethos of lore of the originals.To sum it up it was aterrovle movie, I just wanted to get up and walk out and would of had I not paid a lot of money to see it in IMAX, don't allow yourself to get ripped of as I did. Stay well away.","12 out of 23 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, Dominion buckles under its own weight from too many characters and the story ultimately falls under the law of diminishing returns from having nothing new to say.At the end of Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom, dinosaurs have been let loose and are free roaming across the Earth, living alongside humans. I was expecting Dominion to explore this fresh untapped narrative.Unfortunately, that's not the story we get. Dominion is another story of corporate greed about genetically-bred locusts that's endangering the world's food supply. Maisie Lockwood, the clone daughter of Sir Benjamin Lockwood from the previous film, may hold the key to saving the world.Imagine buying a ticket to see dinosaurs. You see the movie and you're like, ""Hey man, where are my dinosaurs?"" The movie goes, ""Look! Locusts!""It is disappointing on some level. From the trailers, I was imagining the old and current cast teaming up, saving both humans and dinosaurs from each other across the globe, ensuring peace between the two like X-men, but with dinosaurs. ""D-men"", if you will. The script practically writes itself.Do not fret though. There are plenty of dinosaurs in Dominion despite not being the narrative focus. The dinosaurs are obstacles that the characters have to survive through in the film's numerous set pieces.The action is well done. The standout sequence is a Mission Impossible-like motorcycle chase with raptors through the streets of Malta. New dinosaurs also provide some nail-biting suspenseful moments.There are too many characters; that is 6 lead characters, and 5 supporting characters all fighting for screentime. The two characters that I cared about, and wished the film focused more on, were Sam Neil and Laura Dern's characters. One of the biggest disappointments in Jurassic Park 3 was learning that Alan Grant and Ellie Satler split up. Dominion attempts to mend that with a love story that it doesn't devote enough time towards.Dr. Ian Malcolm's part was disappointing. Even though he had an active role, Jeff Goldblum had nothing to react to or anything clever to say. His performance felt off as it seemed like he took an extra beat than needed.The Jurassic World films are in a repetitive story loop that the Fox's X-men franchise was once in. Similar to Magneto, Dr. Henry Wu, the true villain of the franchise, is always conveniently let go to keep the story going and for the same conflict to repeat. Dr. Wu should be branded as a known international criminal and jailed in a psychiatric ward by now for the havok he was brought in the last 3 films.Jurassic World Dominion was advertised as the end of the new trilogy. There just wasn't any finality to any of it. You'll remember the action scenes but ultimately forget what happened story-wise.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Even worse was the directing. The other movies at least took advantage of the dinosaurs. There was very little sense of tension and immersion. The old Jurassic movies were great at this. There was also no sense of scale. King Kong and Pacific Rim perfected this. In Dominion it felt like I was watching the dinosaurs from afar, through a camera, instead of feeling like I was in the presence of massive incredible creatures. The team behind this one really played it safe, to a fault. I would say it's worth watching but go in with low expectations.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

In the first movie it was somewhat believable within the context of behavioral conditioning during animal training, but now it's almost a 'thing' that every single animal regardless of specie will fall for, to give our protagonists a chance of escape.Silly moments like these are scattered throughout the film, but it's nothing new to this series. It seems like each release is more tangent from the original concept of Jurassic Park, to the point that dinosaurs have become akin to a deus-ex machina to move the plot along.Weirdly enough, i actually enjoyed this movie. The visuals were great on a big screen, and the multi generational cast interactions were somewhat refreshing from the ordinary.Definitely watch it if you're a fan of the series. Just be advised. Chris Pratt gets on a motorcycle with dinosaurs in this one too.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Having saw every Jurassic Park/ World movies in theaters, have to disagree with the criticism completely here. Dominion was a thousand times better and more entertaining a film than Fallen Kingdom ever was (and lets not even get into JPlll). Felt like they threw everything and everyone they could at this production to go out with a bang. You have great edge-of-your-seat suspense along with epic chase scenes and a story that wraps up all the different elements of the entire series nicely. No, its not Jurassic Park, and no, not they or anyone else will ever duplicate the magic of the original. If you base every sequel to that original on the standard it set, you are doing a complete disservice to the great filmmaking and story telling a movie like Dominion is doing on its own. And yes, there are scenes that do feel reminiscent of previous installments. But when you have a series based around the same basic components, theres only so much you honestly can do. And thats where I really give the writers here credit for trying to make this as interesting and as encapsulating a picture as they managed to do. The actors were all great in their roles, and the graphics were as sharp and tight as you could ever expect. With all the negative reviews, was expecting another mess of a film like Fallen Kingdom. Some rambling nonsense like that had been that would have ended the series on a sour note. But I truly felt this film did the series the justice I only could have hoped it would. Jurassic World: Dominion was everything you could want to wrap up what has been one of the great franchises in movie history. Highly reccomend.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The sense of Wonder and thrill, slight horror and just overall the movie has stood the test of time. Sequels like the lost world I had a special connection too overtime and always loved, JP3 although being that movie I grew up with as a kid I knew was terrible but I did enjoy it as a kid. Growing up seeing Jurassic world come into play, it was a solid movie with a sequel following it not being such the best movie either... but when they announced they were going to release a conclusion to this new trilogy bringing back the old cast I was excited. And here it is. Jurassic World Dominion... and this movie is probably the worst Jurassic park installment ever madeJurassic park 3 was better, this movie is Terrible in a lot of directions. Not even the old cast can hold the movie, it's nice to see them in the flesh, it gave me that nostalgia feel but the purpose and story surrounding it goes nowhere. Everything that leads up to terms just happens, there's a slight twist in the movie that was nice, but just doesn't feel earned. Everything in the movie doesn't feel earned and I think that's the main problem with it. The movie just feels like it's trying to be any other bland action block buster but throwing dinosaurs in the mix... I hate to compare this to the original, but what made the original so amazing was it combined the horrors of a disaster going wrong within the action.:. The sequels have been doing it ever since as well... even the bad sequels have been using the disaster method... part 2 with dinosaurs being brought to the USA, then 3 being stuck on an island, then the remake taking things from part 1... etc etc, I understand there's only so much you can do to leach off the same storyline... and for this new one I do appreciate the new direction... but this idea that dinosaurs are just a 2nd thought of danger throughout the movie just makes me not as thrilled as I should be... the dinosaurs in the movie just feel like an afterthought or product placement for the action itself, there's no tension, there's a couple of moments that I do feel the tension but overall it's just not there....and if you're gonna sit here and say ""they're dinosaurs you're not supposed to take this seriously"" A good example of a movie trilogy that makes you feel the stakes at hand was Matt Reeves planet of the apes trilogy you have this planet being controlled by apes, you feel the intensity arising, you feel it all, from the tone of the film and all now sure, these are dinosaurs compared to cgi apes who are like humans, but this idea of the franchise just going full cheese is just way too pathetic, it goes overboard in this movie... I feel like I'm watching a Jurassic park fan made movie, a bunch of characters don't care about the stakes and drop terrible one liners here and there, and a lot of characters are underutilized, There's maybe about 1 or 2 moments from certain characters and it's not they they are doing a bad job, the acting is fine, but the plot and story around the entire movie just feels like a entire drag, I didn't have my sense of urgency.... one thing for sure this movie highlights that I took away from was how much power the palm of your hand can do... I mean it just does so much in this film, stops characters from dying from predators that, let's be realistic here, would kill them... but I'll take it, Owen was a trainer of raptors and I guess the technique works, not just with him but kids and newcomers alike! So power to the hand! ... action is fine I guess... but again, It just goes back to my point that it just doesn't feel earned, not even the slightest... none of it does, the entire story of a missing Dino and child just feels totally not earned. When the scene came to play into motion I was thinking to myself ""this is really where this movie is headed?"" I guess I just could care less about this plot narrative.The original characters also feel like a forced collision, it just feels like parts and components spread apart with characters meshed together and it's forced to work because the movie says it has to... it just doesn't lead up to anything that feels like it was meant to be earned. And then the characters from the OG surprisingly just feel way out of place in this movie, there's not enough to nibble on with grant and Sadler, they have their moments but that's just because their acting is amazing but the writing is horrendous not enough meat and potatoes for them, they have a very awkward moment towards then end that TOTALLY goes unearned in this movie. Ian Malcom tries his best to save the movie, which is what he is good at, but even he can't when the director allows almost every line he says to be almost 4th wall breaking it becomes annoying. It's almost like he's winking at the Audience 24/7 WE GET IT!!!Best way to compare this movie... it's like eating breakfast mixed with dinner... not bad on paper, and might actually be good... but when you begin to eat it you realize it's not only a odd combination of foods but the food is stale, expired and terrible all together, some burnt others undercooked... things are just awful... oh but you have a nice cup of orange juice action... and on the side with a nostalgia action figure toy that comes included...The EXECUTION of this movie leads to EXTINCTION of this franchise as we know it.I hope nobody wastes money on this, only way you can actually enjoy this movie is if you're just on your phone and notice action is about to start so you put it down and watch away... and maybe a few scenes with characters you remember based on nostalgia other than that the sum of its parts is so bland and unoriginal. I feel you can genuinely make a better direction of plot... the events leading up to them finally meeting each other isn't even earned.Pros: Action, Actors, nostalgia, effects, (I also appreciate the use of animatronics they were nice) music was okay I guess especially when they used some from the original,Cons: too long, plot, story structure, script, execution,P. S I enjoyed Jurassic world, didn't hate fallen kingdom, I did believed it was a slight step down though... but this one?!!!

Meanwhile ""Alan Grant"" and ""Ellie Sattler"" infiltrate a secure facility that holds dinosaurs to uncover its dark secrets.I love the first two ""Jurassic Park"" films. After that though these films go downhill. ""Fallen Kingdom"" left a sour taste in my mouth and It lowered my expectations for this film. It's no surprise this film was really bad.The positivesAll the acting is great. All the main actors have great chemistry and I love how the original cast bounce off each-other. When the two casts meet its funny and charming and it's when the movie starts to improve. The CGI on the dinosaurs look great and I appreciate that more animatronics were used. There was some good cinematography sometimes and the music was great as it is in all of these films.The negativesThe plot and characters are atrocious in this film. There's 3 different plots going on and one isn't in the film for over an hour. The main plot is stupid and it doesn't focus on dinosaurs or human extinction. The characters get no development apart from two of them and even then Its not well developed. The dinosaur scenes are shoved in just to make a scene cool. The big dinosaur isn't introduced until the last 30 minutes and it just shows up out of nowhere. Some dinos are in the film for a minute and just leave without a trace. The editing is awful especially in the action scenes. It does the terrible ""shakey cam"" and quick cuts and it hurts your brain just watching them. The horror was non existent as I wasn't scared one bit in the film. There's pointless nostalgia just like the first two films that adds nothing to the story. Finally the green screen in the film is awful. You can see the outlines of actors when they're placed in from of them and it takes you out of the movie.ConclusionWhile I don't think ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" is the worst film in the franchise. It's still awful. It has great acting, good CGI and animatronics, nice cinematography and great music. But it's unfocused and messy plot, poor editing, useless dinosaurs, pointless nostalgia and atrocious green screen make this a terrible end to an extinct franchise.I'm going to give ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" a:3/10.","16 out of 34 found this helpful.

It becomes very formulaic.There are some fun references for fans who've watched every movie that will make you cheer though.This movie could have blown our minds with the set up from the previous release with closing Easter eggs of dinosaurs hunting surfers, but it barely touched on the real world problems of Dino's unleashed in the modern world.Apart from the plot line of giant insects destroying crops and all that entails with end of the world philosophy.Unfortunately insects are rarely as sexy as anything ending in saurs...they even admit that in their own dialogue.If we are actually only 3 meals away from anarchy then maybe this was one movie too many that didn't deliver on the promise and I was so looking forward to that movie they teased us with in the trailers.The ending is just downright laughable and corny.Instead we get a Disney version of life finding a way thanks to Amblin and Universal.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I've never thought of them as thought provoking in any way and just as a thriller that will occupy my time for two hours. This movie achieved that goal. I don't see anything to really hate about this movie. The cgi is good, the suspense is good, the choreography is well done (although never very original.) I do have some problems with this movie although none are too bad. The movie is filled with contrivances. Things will constantly happen just to happen. All of the characters are shallow and forgettable. The length is also a problem. I wouldn't have a problem with it was it not for so many unnecessary events happening. The last main issue I have is the entire set up from the last movie with the dinosaurs being released into the world was barely used. That could be entirely written out of the movie and nothing would have changed. Although there are issues Jurassic World: Dominion is an entertaining watch. If you're a fan of the franchise I'd recommend a watch, but don't expect anything groundbreaking. Just turn your brain off for 2 1/2 hours and watch people get eaten by dinosaurs.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So yeah, there is that, the plot is thin, non the less, it doesn´t need a big Plot, the history of the charachters really goes a long way, a concept that in this movie works really well. This movie did a great job with the action scenes and the dinamics in the film are so fast that truly evoques the golden times of adventure movies.This movie has beautiful cinematography too, really good sound mixing and thankfully in this entry they didn´t try to over do the music like in past films so it made for some good atmosphere through the movie.Acting was spot on by the cast of JP, Neil, Goldblum and Dern will live as some really good actors while the new charachters of Dallas, Pratt and the girl did a solid job, this movie did not relly on them and that is a good thing cause they can play to their strenghts in the actions sequences.Still there is a couple of lows in the movie, it capitalizes on nostalgia big time, something sometimes feels a bit out of place; it moves a couple of charachters out of the way since they are not important to the plot and there was a big premise delivered through the pomotional material that did not live up to the hype.However i feel like this movie is truly better than the past two, this one been far better paced and far faster than the other two, a lot like Mad Max in that sense, at the end is unrelenting start to finish with a thin plot, beat that.","23 out of 44 found this helpful.

It was entertaining, and pretty much worth a Redbox movie night, but possibly not a $30 theater experience unless you like this sort of thing on the big screen with big sound.I was never a big fan of any sort of monster movie, going back to Godzilla, King Kong, or Jurassic Park.What I AM a fan of - is an entertaining movie and this one pretty much fits that bill, In spite of the fact that I know there's going to be several dozen levels of suspensful moments involving staring at dinosaurs approaching, and dinosaur roars & breath being crammed down my throat. It's ok. That's the genre.My one (slight) disappointment was that Jeff seems to have lost a lot of his quirkiness.The only other thing that truly irks me is the trivia page for this movie. ENDLESS, repetitive, over long trivia - more than half commenting on the Twitter feeds of the actors, their interviews, all about how insanely hyped they were to do the movie, be with original cast members, the schedule, dealing with covid, blah, blah, blah. As well as too many repetitive, over-long trivia items about how the director wanted the dinosaurs to be portrayed the same as all wild animals that exist.I think the trivia for this movie is probably in the top 5 for one of the longest trivia pages for any movie, and it definitely broke a record for meaningless, redundancy, and I dare say, it's an awful lot of trivia for such an unpopular movie. Noting here that most long trivia pages are found with highly popular movies, and there the trivia is much more interesting.Meanwhile I give this a 6 for a movie night of fair-to-middlin', totally expected content, worth the popcorn & coke.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Feels
extremely inconsistent and without any sense of realism.Why humanity couldn't deal with the dinosaurs that got released into the wild 30 years earlier, before this movie takes place, is baffling.

Then I've seen The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Then Jurassic Park 3. In 2015, I've seen Jurassic World. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in 2018. Now Jurassic World: Dominion.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard still have great chemistry together. Their characters were definitely the parental type for Maisie. It was great to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum reuniting for this final installment of the entire franchise. The action is great as what the fans have seen throughout the years. I've noticed that some people are tired of seeing the same plot in every film that they've watched. It's always the screaming and running. It's just like watching Lex and Tim run and scream all over again. In the previous films that I've seen, there are bad guys and villains. I get it that people are tired of it and I know that I'm sort of getting tired of the same plot but it's great this film is the final installment of the entire franchise, so I don't think they won't make another film. Saying that I'm tired of watching the same plot in the previous films doesn't make me hate the entire franchise. No, I've enjoyed all five films including this sixth and final installment.I've noticed that the film had tone it down a bit because the violent carnage or anything that we've seen. The film has funny lines especially with Jeff Goldblum's character, Ian Malcolm. The action and CGI are definitely to watch for. In conclusion, this film is great to watch for the action and thrills.","23 out of 44 found this helpful.

The story that in my opinion works is the one with Owen and Claire and I wish the entire movie was spent on this story. While the other story really didn't need to be included and only existed to have the original trio back for this movie. I feel like the original trio still could've been included in this movie but just in a different way than what we got. I feel like due to these two different stories taking place is where the pacing for this movie takes a hit. I can safely say that I felt all 2 hours and twenty minutes of this movie because this movie moved at both a snail's pace and a fast one. One story moved at such a fast pace that it was hard to keep track of what exactly was going on while the other moved at such a snail's pace with barely anything interesting happening that I was hoping for a dinosaur to get loose so something would happen. Now I probably wouldn't have noticed this issue if the acting for this movie was good and well you can tell everybody was trying their best. Everybody in this movie you can tell is really trying to give it their all, especially the original trio, but it just came out flat. The only real standouts for me were the original trio consisting of Laura Dern, who plays Ellie Sattler, Sam Neill, who plays Alan Grant, and Jeff Goldblum, who plays Ian Malcolm. Honestly, the only good thing in this movie is the special effects. In the end, this was a very underwhelming finale for this already underwhelming series.","13 out of 27 found this helpful.

The original cast consisting of Laura Dern and Sam Neil are brought together for one last adventure. The acting was subpar, but the editing was superb especially with the special effects of the dinosaurs. The movie was a hit and miss, I neither loved it or hated it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Can you not see the connection to Today? In this ridiculous dialog, they try to justify their half-baked nonsense by questioning whether Man has any more rights than dinosaurs to inhabit our Planet!Nowhere did I see, in the 40 minutes I could stomach this miserable excuse for a film, did I see our Military trying to eradicate these creatures from a bygone age! ((Can we say Dinosaurs == 'Migrants'?))Perhaps PITA has a problem with hurting fake animals! Who knows?It's not the actors, or the Producers at fault here -- it is the miserable, phony, fetid, disgusting SCRIPT that is at fault. I've also lost ALL respect for the actors, many of whom are from previous ""Jurassic Park"" films, who agreed to babble their lines for this tripe!People are entitled to their sincere Political beliefs -- whatever they are. This film is extremely blatant in its message of ""Humans are disposable, and can be replaced"" theme. Where are our 'Leaders' in this film? Nowhhere to be found; while of course the Elites continue to hide in their protected caves -- as they always will -- or as long as there are idiots dumb enough to accept scraps of compensation to protect them.Go ahead, get some popcorn and watch this film -- you have been warned -- it is simply more brainwashing; so do so at your own risk. Try not to puke up that expensive popcorn you bought -- thinking you were going to be entertained!One other reviewer writes that this film is ""spiritless""; another writes ""lifeless"". Well of COURSE it is! These NWO people have no belief in God -- just in themselves and their money! This film is a darn-near CRIMINAL waste of anyone's attention!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

JW1 was pretty good enjoyed it over all besides it being a carbon copy of JP1. JW2 we don't need to talk about. JW3 even with all the hate it seems to be getting was surprisingly entertaining for me. I had low hopes for this movie. Disney has become complacent with their ability to regurgitate films and ideas while painting it with cameos and Easter eggs, LOOKING AT YOU STAR WARS. However, the entire ensemble really made the movie enjoyable! From introducing new characters that had spine and seemed real, unlike JW2, the additions of Dewanda Wise and Mamoudou Athie were solid (loved Ms. Wise in this), Goldblum did his thing but the additions of Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler we're merely for fan service and Disney's addiction to cameos/nostalgia. (Not detracting from the performances given). The story while what you have come to expect from the current Disney model was surprisingly improved not as many tropes and unrelenting call backs that actually allowed the movie to feel slightly fresh. At the end of the day if you haven't seen top gun see that instead but if you enjoy dinosaurs and a good cast this wasn't a bad way to spend an evening getting away from reality. Solid 6/10 for me.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Rex getting hurt does it take to stop this franchise?The conclusion to the Jurassic World trilogy. The movie itself is not really about the plot. Instead, it's an amalgamation of references to past movies and fan-service moments, and I had a fun time.If you rewatch the previous 5 movies leading up to this one, the callbacks would be so in-the-face. Multiple quotes, objects, and characters made me do that Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme. They were littered everywhere throughout the runtime. Even the ways some of the characters died in this movie were copies from previous ones. Not gonna lie it's pretty satisfying recognizing those references.Even though Dominion doesn't offer fan-service to the level of Endgame or No Way Home, there were still a lot. Not all of them worked though, as some felt kinda cringe.However, this doesn't discredit the solid sequences of actions in the movie. Once they forced the setup of the plot, the movie turned into constant chasing and dinosaur attacks. The sequences were handled well and created high levels of intensity. The jump scares didn't feel cheap or predictable, heightening the intensity furthermore.I have mentioned many of the problems of this movie. The plot was basic to the bone. It's just there so we can have a proper movie. The villain character was the typical forgettable evil villain. The dialogues were corny, and sadly even the veteran cast members could not save those lines.Overall, if you come in expecting a thrilling adventure with lots of service and homage, you will have a blast. 7-7.5/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I'll just write a better script right now instead. They meet up with the CIA guy in the beginning, the CIA guy has a flight they can catch with an insider that will take them to where the meet up with Dr. Grant, they can skip literally everything that happens in between, because absolutely nothing happens with them. Nothing. Them being on camera had nothing to do with the plot. The story could function without their entire subplot. Just get rid of it. Why was that nonsense in the film? Seriously? Chris pratt and his Bryce Howard and their new pilot sidekick did nothing of substance the whole film. Just have them fly to the base just like Dr. Grant. Some would say this is a manner of to many cooks in the kitchen but some of these cooks are not even cooking anything. Their ingredients do not provide any substance to the film. It's all just dead film space at most points where nothing and I mean absolutely nothing happens of substance. Why, would you reject Bryce Howard out of your plane if in the end you were just going to end up in the same place to begin with? Just so you could circle back and get her anyway. Why was that necessary. Just keep her in the plane with you. So you all end up in the same place to begin with. Honestly, they serve no purpose because the ""legacy characters"", do all the heavy lifting and keep the plot moving forward and end the end it's what they do that affect anything in the end anyway. I hate this movie so much. Its probably the worst film I've seen period.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The story line was empty and the acting was weak. Even the old faces brought in were unconvincing, I didn't saw any sign of their old passion. They acted like ""aah what the heck, okay, I'll do it for the money"". None of them was convincing. As well as all the other younger actors - they're lacking talent, charisma and emotions. Even Chris Pratt wasn't looking any enthusiastic, just a boring facial expressions like they dragged him by force to play in this.The whole idea of ""living together with dinosaurs"" was lame. Those ""hand-signals"" were also very lame already, now everyone were doing them like everyone trained these creatures. The giant locusts that doesn't eat specific crops, was also very lame addition.The CGI was very weak. How it's possible with all the technical and digital advantages nowadays, the dinos to look worse than the ones in the original Jurassic Park 30 years ago? Most scenes were happening at dark, so they can probably mask their CGI failure?Editing was also very bad, as well as the soundtrack. The music ruined every action scene. There wasn't enough scary scenes, only a couple moments when you could feel the fear in those people. They were acting as they face kittens. As of dinos are harmless creatures and humans can control them by eyes and hands. Gimme a break...In general - this whole movie was weak and bad, and it doesn't worth the 2 and a half hours. I won't recommend it to anyone.My rating: 2/10.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Jurassic World was, from the get-go, a much more bombastic and action-oriented series which paid homage to the original while not losing focus of the fact that they were just supposed to be plain, good action films... with dinosaurs. Dominion brings the concept to a satisfying close, with the right amount of fan-service, great visuals (even by today's high standards) and dino battles. If you watch the movie expecting originality, narrative prowess and realism in its actions scenes, you are bound to be disappointed. If you want a good action film with impressive CGI and a nice touch of humanity and growth in its characters, you might just be surprised and have a lot of fun. A big source of this fun is Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcom, who is a gem here, while all other returning characters from the original film render on-point performances which grant credence to their respective character arcs.Dominion is no masterpiece, but it might be the strongest entry of the Jurassic World trilogy, effectively closing the loop for this decades-old Jeep Wrangler. Suspend your disbelief, settle in, ignore the reviews, and make your own judgment. I definitely enjoyed it and would recommend it; keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Plus, the old cast didn't bring much to the film.I'm just such a geek about Dino's and the effort put into those is amazing.

Jon and Bob drink their warm milk and eat their cookies. Right before they sleep they start mind-storming. At the same time Director Colin Tremorrow is taking notes for his next blockbuster movie called Jurassic World DoMinions.Jon calls to Bob ""Bob look look. There is a huge Ice Pool it is really cold."" The other kid ""Yeah but it is tropical below that right?!"" Jon: ""Yeah, yeah and a huge plane crashes and it won't sink. Oh but the people on it can sink its like 1 inch thick they can drown."" The other kid again ""But yeah and there is a big dinosaur like a huge chicken but it can swim beneath the ice pond like a dolphin!""Colin smiles and he is happy. He chuckles and leaves the room.2nd Night of the script writing of Jon and Bob 2 year olds (Colin as always taking notes):Jon: ""An evil man lives in a building shaped like Apple's space craft building. Oh yeah and the evil man's name is Tim CooKie. He is greedy, he loves money!"" Bob:""Yeah yeah and all dinosaurs are living happy in the forest around Tim CooKie's building. But if there is anything booboo happens All dinosaurs will walk inside and eat each other!"" Jon: ""Bugs let's have bugs they are hugeee!"" Bob: ""Lets put em on fire! They are stored in a basement but when they are burned they can fly outside because there is a wide ventilation tube right above them!"" Jon: ""Burn the forest burn the forest!""Colin is amazed! He can't stop giggling and imagining how he will be winning the Oscar so easy in 2023.3rd Night:Jon:""Horses!"" Bob: ""Dinos"" Jon: ""Tom cruise riding bike! Bourne music yeah right!"" Jon: ""A huge dinosaur but its bigger than T-Rex"" Bob ""Let's fight them! And big Ostrich like Wolverine. Yeah they team up! Yeah fight the bigger dino!"" Jon: ""Lets have Raptors!"" Bob: ""Wait wait also there is a woman she can reproduce with mitosis she like Mother Marry!"" Jon ""Yeaah yeaahh she gives birth to she Jesus Christ. She so important.

Main big bad was obvious from the get go and rather weird considering he couldn't form a clear sentence and spoke almost staccato and his demise was rather lackluster. Side big bads had very easy ends as well; arrested or eaten. Action was good, comedy was good too, CGI in these is always on point.

I honestly believe most of the negative reviewers didn't even watch it, or maybe just watched a trailer or two and then decided to throw some shade.Outside of the original Jurassic Park, this one of the most original stories in the franchise and it worked well in tying the old to the new for wrapping everything up in a fun way. Maybe the story seemed convoluted to some people. It's fast paced, but it worked as far as I'm concerned. And let's face it, the story in this series is the literal macguffin to seeing a bunch of dinosaurs run around on screen anyway. The original JP was trashed much the same way when it originally came out.If I have to criticize something, Kayla's character was a very rushed add on and was not properly developed. Her addition felt more like a plot device crowbarred into the end of the second act, but the character ended up working out and was otherwise a good add.Visually, this movie is a stunner. The action sequences are bananas, and the direction was excellent. The dinosaurs were the best yet; the shear variety of what they've brought to life is indeed impressive - finally got the iguanodon in there! A return of the humor from the original ensemble was great and an unexpected treat. I personally would rank this second best in the series; JP1, JWD, JW, JPLW, JP3, JWFK.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

This was supposed to be the finale in which the phrase from Jurassic Parks banner ""When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth"" was supposed to come full circle and it fell HEAVILY on its face. Though more entertaining than its predecessor, Fallen Kingdom, I think it was because it was the return of the orginal cast members that lightened the mood. Though some of the jokes were extremely forced by Jeff Goldblum's Dr. Ian Malcom, it was B. D. Wong's Dr. Wu that I loathed the most out this entire movie.

As a devoted fan of the original Jurassic Park films, I eagerly anticipated this continuation of the dinosaur saga. However, what unfolded on screen was a confusing concoction of prehistoric creatures, grasshoppers, and an inexplicable inclusion of gangster elements.One of the most glaring issues with Jurassic Park Dominion was the lack of clarity regarding its central plot. Rather than focusing on the awe-inspiring wonder of resurrected dinosaurs or the ethical dilemmas of genetic engineering, the film seemed to wander aimlessly between disparate storylines. The addition of grasshoppers, while perhaps intended to introduce a novel threat, only served to further convolute an already muddled narrative.Despite boasting a cast of talented actors, including veterans of the franchise such as Sam Neill and Laura Dern, the film suffered from remarkably poor acting. Characters felt one-dimensional and lacked the depth and nuance that fans have come to expect from the Jurassic Park series. It was disappointing to see such esteemed performers deliver uninspired performances in roles that failed to resonate with the audience.One of the most disheartening aspects of Jurassic Park Dominion was its failure to capture the nostalgic charm of the original films. While previous installments effortlessly transported viewers back to the awe-inspiring world of Isla Nublar, this film felt disconnected and disjointed. There were few moments that evoked the sense of wonder and excitement that defined the early entries in the franchise, leaving fans longing for the magic of Jurassic Park's heyday.As the credits rolled and the lights came up in the theater, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment and regret. Jurassic Park Dominion was a film that could have easily been omitted from the franchise without any loss. Its illogical plot, nonsensical character decisions, and lackluster execution left me wishing I could reclaim the two hours of my life spent watching it.In conclusion, Jurassic Park Dominion failed to live up to the legacy of its predecessors. With its bewildering storyline, poor acting, and lack of nostalgic appeal, it stands as a forgettable entry in the beloved franchise. Fans of Jurassic Park would be better served revisiting the original films rather than subjecting themselves to the disappointment of this lackluster sequel.""","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Meanwhile Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant (Laura Dern and Sam Neill) have serious concerns about the remote facility wherein they reunite with Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).""Jurassic World: Dominion"" (2022) isn't great like the previous ""Fallen Kingdom"" (2018) and is arguably the least of the second trilogy. There are some Indiana Jones elements in the Malta segment and James Bond bits at the technologically advanced lair in the mountains, both of which I appreciate.Yet I strangely never bought the characters as real people. They always struck me as actors performing according to a contrived script, which tries too hard to check the diversity boxes. Still, there's certainly enough here to entertain if you're interested in a dinosaur-oriented sci-fi adventure.The film runs 2 hours, 27 minutes, with the Extended Version running just over 12 minutes longer (I viewed the latter).

It's the end of an era.The Jurassic World movies hasn't been the greatest movies. The first one i liked, that was a pretty good movie. But the second one not so much. So i didn't really know what to excpected from this movie other than that i thought the premise was interesting, this is the Jurassic park movie i wanted since the first time i saw ""The Lost World"" so what did i think about it?Jurassic World: Domino is a decent and solid adventure movie, and i enjoyed parts of it (especially those involving the OG trio) but for the most parts it was kinda boring, the story wasn't very good, the script was bad and the lack of emotions is what's dragging this movie down. I didn't feel a connection to any of the characters in this movie besides maybe the OG ones, and i didn't really care for any of them. So the best part of this movies Is maybe the last hour when the action kicks in and the movie has settled.But if you like me love the Jurassic park movie i definitely recommend you to see this on the big screen.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's totally absurd, in no world would people just deal with it and look the other way, literally no one would tolerate raptors on the loose... and in this movie, everyday people don't run and scream in horror for some reason, they hang about until they get eaten, seemingly with little knowledge of their two giant carnivores in broad daylight, or breaking out of a cage in the background... Dumb.That craziness aside, the movie picks up soon after, with more fun dinos and much better CG some of the new species (another issue with the early parts of the movie.) All of the current and past characters enjoy some good suspense or action. Dinos are best in dark, confined areas, with their threat taken seriously... which luckily the rest of the movie provides.All-in-all it's a worthy film. I went in with the assumption that I wouldn't be getting some perfect conclusion, and there are probably too many characters in play, but it was enjoyable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The acting, for all the great actors and actresses in it was a bit subpar for the people involved. What I mean is, in the first movie, you felt like you were there, and everyone in it put up such great performances, it was like it was really happening. The fear was believable, and you could've easily believed this was actually happening to them. In this movie it just seemed a bit like they were just phoning in their performances. Ian Malcolm is trying to think of a combination to help Ellie and Alan and company escape a dinosaur who's hot on their tail and he's just casually going thru a mental checklist of what the combination could be, for example- lol. Also the plot was a bit far fetched but still fun. Overall, I liked it fine, tho.

Groan.I am a keen observer of animals, since childhood. And so it's the CGI dinosaurs that struck me as very odd. When you see a crocodile lurching over land, when you see a monkey climbing - you always notice that the vertebral column is not a rigid thing. The animal's back can bend, the *entire* animal is rather elastic.In this film, it was most pronounced when the animals were moving slowly, especially the large four-legged ones. The computer models assumed the vertebrae to be completely rigid.It's puzzling how the 1993 film, with its very limited computing power behind the CGI, did a better job.But: Bonus points for using so many special aircraft. They even borrowed the weird Boeing 747 from ""Casino Royale"".","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If it wasn't for the perfection that was Top Gun Maverick a week earlier, I may have lost complete faith in the corporate film industry of today.If you're like me, you may think: how bad can it be? After all, there's the reunion of the original cast and cool dinosaurs and stuff... Oh, it can be bad... Unbelievably bad... Somehow, with a budget the size of a gigantosaurus and visual effects unparalleled in any of the predecessors, they've managed to make a film with zero thrills, zero wonder, zero fun and zero sense, not to mention not even an 8th grade grasp of science.I would try to pinpoint where it all went wrong, but literally every aspect is so painstakingly stupid I can only conclude it was written by somebody intoxicated, an artistically illiterate CEO, or maybe some new AI that Universal is trialling as part of a cost cutting initiative.If you're thinking you've seen the first two and need to see how this trilogy resolves, don't even expect a conclusion. The plot has nothing to do with the dinosaurs - I kid you not. The dinosaurs roaming the earth are merely a part of the background and nothing changes by the end. Again, just huh!?I gave one extra star for the visual effects and the original cast taking the time to appear, though they looked more lost than the pteranodons nesting on the World Trade Center. Avoid this film like the plague!","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Of course it's not as good as the original but it's still an entertaining roller coaster ride. The original cast gets plenty of screentime and they are a real asset to the experience. Yes, there are some scenes that are just plain copies of iconic scenes from the original but they are well executed and still work for me. I liked it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There, that's out of the way. Now, on to reviewing 'Dominion.'The clear intent of this wrap up was just that, to wrap it up, and that task has been accomplished. Several screen moments harkened back to the original, fitting because of all the returning stars. There was even an oblique Indiana Jones reference that many in the audience laughed at, and the laughter could be heard over the ear-splitting IMAX sound.The sets, the special effects, all the nuts and bolts get a ten out of ten. As
far as originality goes, I don't think that was ever the point.Dominion succeeds as a final chapter, does so with nostalgia and good humor, and let's hope those who make movies understand that this story is over.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

1. Too much dialogue - Jurassic Park thrilogy was all about being new, fresh, and exploration. World trilogo was about reliving that experience, and even extending it. This one gave us a glimpse of that - but wanted to create too much overlapping stories. At times, I felt like shouting to the screen, ""we get it. Let's cut to the next scene already""
2. Overacting - the main man of the original series returned with some of the OG cast - but his lines felt too forced and cheesy. The long stares, the macho moves and dramatic pauses before saying the lines made it feel awkward and too staged.3. Dinosaurs had lower importance - It felt like for a movie about dinosaurs, they certainly made their importance in this installment less significant.Now, I do want to point out that overall, the movie's still enjoyable. I think seeing both the cute and the scary dinos still never gets old!!! But story-wise, it was a let-down.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

This movie is just milking the decaying nipples of one of my favorite movie's dead and rotting corpse that was murdered for movies ago.

I mean, ANY Speilberg fan knows that 1138 is a requirement in his films. Anyway, it's a great one to watch with kids and for them its all new but honestly, it's a pretty good snore fest for a seasoned viewer.I'll give it three stars because 1 or 2 wouldn't leave room for complete trash films and Jurassic had money, good effects and known actors so a star for each. Otherwise, a useless film that is obsessed with it's former selves.So it's pronounced Jiggah-no-toe-sore-as not Gigah. It's also not the biggest carnivore, that's the blue whale. Plankton is still meat. Giga is also not the biggest dino either, not even the biggest carnivore. I was shocked that they got this wrong and I think it's because of Ark Survival the video game these mistakes were made. The largest carnivore in the dinosaurs is the Spinosaur, almost doubling the mass of a T-Rex.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Well, both of us couldn't be more pleased with this Jurassic film, in fact, for me, it was on par with the original in this franchise. The film touched on topics such as agri-business, illegal wildlife trade, unethical global corporations and power hungry billionaires, irresponsible use of bioengineering, corporation control of food production and access, and animal welfare and protection. I loved the humor, homages to previous Jurassic films (including Jeff Goldblum's propensity to baring his chest at inappropriate times in the first film) the heart-racing chase sequences and the exciting variety of dinosaurs, both familiar and those that had never appeared in this franchise before. I thoroughly enjoyed the dynamic between the principal cast members of the original and later Jurassic films, and found this a very satisfying conclusion to the Jurassic franchise.

And the worst part is: You won't care. You're so done with this tedious, mind-numbingly stupid scene that you're wanting them all to be finished off as quickly as possible, so you can move on to the next scene in hopes that the plot will finally go somewhere and matter.And, of course, you get Owen Grady doing the ""dinosaur whisperer"" thing. Yet, after 3 movies, Owen is still not yet confident that his ""trained"" raptor won't eat him or his family at any given moment.

'Jurassic World: Dominion' falls into that category. I mean, what could be better than reuniting the two casts from the two trilogies in one of the most storied blockbuster franchises in cinematic history?While it's great to see Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) back together, it's fair to say it was at the expense of the plot of 'Dominion.' There's too much going on here, and when you consider the extended version, it's clear that a lot of the filler should have been left on the cutting room floor. Sure, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard have more chemistry than the average onscreen duo, but many of the scenes featuring them could have been streamlined to have a more efficient story (e.g., the whole Malta situation). Same goes for the Tim Cook-esque Biosyn CEO, Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott).The CGI was great, as was the soundtrack. But 'Jurassic World: Dominion' was just too overproduced and over orchestrated, even if it was a likely end to the massive dino-centered series.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

In JP1 & 2 you're not privy to anything the characters aren't; you're going through the experience WITH them. That's a deliberate, important creative decision by Spielberg. From JP3 onwards you're on the side of the ""puppeteers"", to use a timely comparison. You're now (as a viewer) more omniscient, instead of sympathetic, it's criminal reallyAdditionally, Dominion was never going to be dinosaurs battling humans in New York City. It was something that, would honour Crichton's work a little bit more. I don't think he ever wrote a fantasy book.I think the he challenge for Trevorrow was getting to a place where the dinosaurs will be in this somewhat confined space, and obviously, still making sure all hell broke loose.For me, it's the second half of the movie when they started to converge in that environment. It may have been just because I did grow up on ""Jurassic Park,"" but each of these films rely on the humans not being able to just call an Uber and get out of there.They have to be trapped in a confined space in order for the kind of sequences that these movies thrive on to exist. I also felt like we've been taken the on a journey that has a lot of new stuff in it in the first half. It's a lot of new ideas and new sequences. I felt, as we got toward the end of this meal that we'd been served, it was important to bring out some comfort dishes, and make sure that, as the characters collided with the ""Jurassic Park"" characters, it really felt like ""Jurassic Park.""","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

And takes the Jurassic Park film which it never has been there before. Feeling different from the previous films. Which some may enjoy or some will miss the nostalgia of being back in the island with dinosaurs.The plot follows with people trying to coexist with dinosaurs. Some are amazed by the creatures living among them. While others are breeding and using them for an evil agenda. The plot follows Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who are living in hiding and trying to keep Maise (Isabella Sermon) safe. After the previous film and discovering her secret. While Ellie (Laura Dern) discovers prehistoric locusts that are destroying the farm fields and can be leading to our extinction. Which she enlists Alan (Sam Neill) and Ian (Jeff Goldblum) to help out and find out who is behind that. Which are the same people that Owen and Claire are looking for after they kidnap The raptor Blues baby.The plot has a couple of storylines that intercept and feels different than previous films. Which makes it feel like a globe trotting action thriller as Claire and Owen come across hybrid mixed raptors that are weaponized to attack certain people. Leading to a motorcycle chase scene in Malta.The action sequences are awesome. The visual effects are great. The cast ensemble is great. Its nice to see the original trio Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum back in action. I also love they brought one original character from the first movie back into the mix as a villain in this film. If your a fan of the series when the name is popped up. You will easily recognize. The film music score is also great.For a long running time with the movie. It does feel fast moving and short with the movie running into one action set piece to another. Overall, the film is one fun big blockbuster thats best to see on the big screen.","63 out of 140 found this helpful.

This movie is LOUD! Sound seemed to almost double once trailers ended and the movie started. At first, I thought it was because I hadn't been to theaters in a while but, everyone was saying the same thing as we were leaving. It felt like we just left an artillery range. They spent so much money on the earth trembles they want you to feel that they just crank the sound effects. YIKES!Now for content. Man, this was really disappointing. I didn't care for Fallen Kingdom but, I thought the premise that it set up for this movie seemed intriguing. It ended up really surprising me.....just not in a good way.I thought this had such potential to be the most unique sequel yet. Dinosaur roaming the earth? I figured they would lean in to Jeff Goldblum's ""Life...has way"" tag line (which they so heavily feature in trailers) to make it so dinosaurs started reproducing. Would we see an end of days scenario? Co-Existence? Not so much.They leaned HEAVILY into nostalgia. Which was kind of cool but, definitely can feel like the same story when....ya know....everything is the same.I don't consider this a spoiler since if is highly mentioned and reviewed but, man. The big bad threat being cross-engineered locusts instead of dinosaurs is legit the biggest let-down.I still like Pratt and it was cool seeing the original cast but, essentially everything outside of that felt like a major miss.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The result conjured primal wonder and terror in the minds of viewers. The T-Rex attack in particular was so brilliantly constructed and unrelentingly frightening that it put this writer sideways in his seat, one arm raised in front of his face as if to defend against a dinosaur attack. When there was a break in the mayhem, Spielberg cut to a very quiet scene, letting everyone hear how many people in the audience had been screaming in fright, which of course led to raucous laughter and a release of tension (a foolproof showman's trick). A small girl sitting near this writer regarded his still-terror-contorted body and asked, ""Mister, are you all right?""There's nothing in ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" that comes close to that first ""Jurassic Park"" T-Rex attack, or any other scene in it. Or for that matter, any of the scenes in the Spielberg-directed sequel ""The Lost World,"" which made the best of an inevitable cash-grab scenario by treating the film as an excuse to stage a series of dazzling large-scale action sequences, and giving Jeff Goldblum's chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm the action hero job. Goldblum, who reprises his role in ""Dominion"" alongside fellow original cast members Sam Neill and Laura Dern, turned his ""Lost World"" performance into a wry-yet-cranky meta-commentary on corporate capitalism. For that matter, there's nothing in this new film as good as the best parts of ""Jurassic Park III,"" ""Jurassic World,"" and ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"" the latter which suffered from diminishing-returns syndrome, yet still managed to stage a crackerjack action scene or dino attack here and there. J. A. Bayona's mixed-bag ""Fallen Kingdom,"" which provides literal as well as figurative DNA to the plot of ""Dominion,"" had the most surprising pivots since the original, conjuring Spielbergian images of wonder (think of that mournful shot of the brachiosaur left behind on the dock) and mixing gothic horror and haunted house-movie elements into its second half. ""Jurassic Park"" creator Michael Crichton's original inspiration, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, was referenced through the character of Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), a clone created by John Hammond's business partner to replace the daughter that he lost.","26 out of 52 found this helpful.

Pratt does a lot of the hand thing this time around, and it's as stupid as ever, but even if he kept his mitts firmly in his pockets, Dominion would still blow harder than that volcano in the last movie.This one has a plot that is so ridiculous that it feels like a parody at times: Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott), ruthless owner of genetics company Biosyn, has created prehistoric swarms of giant locusts designed to destroy all crops except for those grown from Biosyn seeds. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) discovers what is happening and convinces Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to help expose the plan; she, in turn, enlists the help of Alan Grant (Sam Neill). Yes, this one is so desperate it wheels in the three stars of the original Jurassic Park, who seem only too happy to cash a paycheck no matter how lousy the plot.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are also back, trying to find their adoptive daughter Maisie (Isabella Sermon), the dumb child who released dinosaurs to roam freely on Earth; she has been kidnapped by BioSyn, her special DNA required for further genetic experiments.I approached this film determined to not let a lack of logic prevent me from having fun, but that idea soon went the way of the dinosaurs: the film is so bad that no amount of giant lizard action could make it enjoyable. Stroppy kid Maisie is ultra-annoying, the giant locust plot is dumb, there's a really out-of-place action sequence involving laser-guided raptors, a feathered dinosaur flies underwater, and too much of the film is played for giggles. And then there's that scene where Owen puts his hand out to prevent a dinosaur from attacking, with both Maisie and Alan following suit: all three of them using the power of the hand was just too much for me.I pray that the franchise is now over, but I suspect that someone will dig it up in the future and bring it back to life.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The lines these poor women are expected to delivery are so corny that that they almost choke when trying to deliver them.The whole thing is sprinkled with lame self referential lines and scenes that splat on the floor like bad jokes.

I don't know how to say but I swear that at some stages I was like I was there and when Indominus-Rex was around I was standing still, and I realized this only after the movie was over :)
The scene when Indominus-Rex fights Tyrannosaurus (T-Rex) and teams up with raptors (Blue) to defeat Indominus-Rex!I'm really sorry about the Raptor Pack
I really liked Blue, Echo, Delta and Charlie they really seemed to have their own personality!And the scene when they find out the plain with the dead Apatosaurus really saddened me :(
I won't say more just that the movie is great and you have to watch it whether you are a fan of dinosaurs or not!","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

The film has a lot of excellent action sequences, especially the one involving a bike. The pacing is also good, even though the tempo infrequently drops a bit. Seeing it in 3D was another plus, as the film features gorgeous locales and eye-popping visual effects.

The opening sequence feels like it was thrown together by the film studio at the last possible minute and really sets the tone for just how bad this movie is overall. The first Jurassic trilogy had so much heart, and Spielberg was masterful in the way he immersed the audience in the adventure, thrills, & terror that his characters endured on Islas Nublar & Sorna. His stories were believable because they tried to stay grounded in reality. His dinosaurs were nuanced in the sense that they weren't just some psychotic monsters hell-bent on killing everything in sight. They were living creatures full of curiosity & instinct that had their own wants and needs. Jurassic World & Fallen Kingdom really lowered the bar for that experience with the Indominus Rex & Indoraptor - a pair of psychotic movie monsters hell-bent on killing everything in sight. That leads us to Dominion where Trevorrow gives us the Atrociraptors - psychotic movie monsters hell-bent on destroying half of Malta to...you guessed it...kill everything in sight. That whole second act felt so unnecessary to advance the plot (though it's possible that global Covid restrictions may have been a factor). And that's only one small scene from this movie. Jurassic World Dominion is such a chaotic mess that throws the audience from one insane situation to another without ever really tying it all together into a cohesive story that could be remotely believable. The movie feels like it was trying to be more of a Marvel flick than a Jurassic Park movie. Honestly I can't remember the last time I've seen a film that was edited so poorly. What's frustrating is that underneath all of the absurdity, there is a good movie in there somewhere. The scenes that were cut and shared online as promotional material are proof of that. It was just jumbled together in such a haphazard way that the immersion is completely lost because the story is completely rushed from start to finish and crammed full of unnecessary characters. Characters come and go in the blink of an eye and are never seen again. Everyone's motivations feel so hollow & superficial because this story has heroes & villains rather than nuanced characters. The OG cast felt completely out-of-place throughout the movie (with the possible exception of Ellie). I still have no idea what Allen Grant & Ian Malcolm were even doing there. How does one go from paleontology one day to corporate espionage the next? Honestly, the original cast felt like they were just shoehorned into this movie for the trailers - which spoiled 90% of the film btw. That's no exaggeration. There were no surprises whatsoever, and every scene was predictable from start to finish. This is in such stark contrast to the theatrical trailers I grew up seeing for Jurassic Park in 1993. The only glimpse audiences ever got of that Tyrannosaurus Rex was a foot in the mud. And for good reason. That scene WOWED audiences like no movie had ever done before or since. There's a reason why 30 years later, JP is still considered one of the greatest films ever made. The thought of Universal spoiling that scene is unimaginable. When did Hollywood become this incompetent? Even Blue felt shoehorned into this movie for nostalgic purposes, and the Jurassic World trilogy has anthropomorphized that raptor to the point that she's barely a dinosaur anymore. To be fair I think Colin Trevorrow really tried to make a decent movie, and it shows during the third act which was the only redeeming portion of the film. But somewhere along the line, I think the studio got ahold of his movie and whittled it down to the soulless husk of generic Hollywood blockbuster that it is today. It feels like this movie was written by a committee of teenagers. I pray there is a director's cut out there that can one day redeem this film. Otherwise, JW Dominion was the final straw that convinced me that it's probably time for the Jurassic franchise to go extinct. I can't believe I said it.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Dominion is the final nail in the coffin in what I'd hoped would be a fun film with plenty of dinosaur action, a sense of danger and adventure and a few callbacks to the first film seeing as the original cast were brought back.Well the film delivers on very little of that, the plot is not only ridiculous but it's also very boring and never takes off. I'm just expecting a film on par with Jurassic Park here, it's never going to happen but in an attempt to try and bring something new to the franchise Dominion has lost all sense of why I've enjoyed most of the sequels.It reminds me a bit of Star Wars The Last Jedi, a film that wanted to be so radically different from any other Star Wars film that it lost sight of what I enjoy about these films. Also same with Shane Black's The Predator from 2018, stop trying to drastically change the formula so much to the point where we're paying to see a film that's not how it's been marketed as at all.When you watch a Jurassic film you want a sense of dread and danger as we wonder who will meet a cruel fate next to one of the dinosaurs and who will survive and escape. I don't want boring subplots about a kidnapped girl who is a clone of some character that we see for the first time in this film. It's a waste of time in a film that's already overlong and overstuffed with filler. Without sounding old and cynical I miss the days of the briskly paced Lost World and Jurassic Park 3. Heck Dominion doesn't even feel like a conclusive chapter or has any sense of finality to the 6 films.I'd say don't waste your time and money, if you want to watch a Jurassic film you're better off just watching any of the other films (except maybe Fallen Kingdom) or watching Prehistoric Planet if you want a dinosaur fix. Dominion is a dull, soulless cash-grab of a sequel that fails to conclude these films in a satisfying way and as a standalone film it lacks the fun and thrills of previous sequels in the franchise.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

But there is a reason why I had to write about Dominion. Because it is a disaster of Jurassic proportions!Jurassic World: Dominion is set a few years after the events of Fallen Kingdom. The dinosaurs are living among humans now. Some are at peace but there are many who have been subjected to cruelty. Biosyn, a tech company provides a home in the mountains for the rehabilitated dinos but they do not seem to have the best interests in mind (read locusts).Jurassic Park (the original, the one and only) was one of a kind. Despite being made in the 90s, the film is a marvel even today. None of the movies that came after could beat that. It has a lot to do with the novelty factor that the animals hold. You see it once and you are in awe (like Ellie Satler and Alan Grant were in the original). You watch it 5 more times and you are basically suffering from dino fatigue. Dominion makes it even worse by reducing the number of dinos onscreen in the finale.The return of the legacy characters is a relief given the odd chemistry Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt share. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are the only redeeming factors of this sequel (apart from that perfectly choreographed bike chase scene in Malta). Even Jeff Goldblum seems to be lost. DeWanda Wise, Mamoudou Athie, BD WONG, Omar Sy & Isabella Sermon co-star.In a year filled with sequels, Jurassic World: Dominion is extremely disappointing. I went in with zero expectations and came out realising that I should have gone in with lower.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was enough for me to watch the first 20 minutes, to confirm my expectation was right, stupid silly story, even the action scenes we're just bad, poor cast performance, even from the original cast. End in the end I managed to watch half of the movie when I had to switch off. This can be added to the list of worst movies of 2022, plus list of worst movies of all time.

They really just don't care, about anything. Not about you, not about the franchise, they don't even care about their own film. Jurassic World: Dominion is regurgitated spam, a big ole' bloated helping of upchucked talking points, character beats, and faces from nearly thirty years ago. The direction is weak, the script is laughable, and the CGI is well below mediocre for a tentpole film as big as this.Dominion represents a new creative low for the franchise, impressive considering the entire trilogy has been overseen by Colin Trevorrow, a useless hack who will soon be seeking to ruin some other poor franchise which should've been put out of its misery a long, long time ago. No, I did not like the film.The film follows the familiar cast of characters as they journey to another goddamn island to be chased by more goddamn dinosaurs. There's another goddamn tech billionaire who's keeping the goddamn things thriving for his own purposes. In the end we all learn a lesson or two about family, togetherness, and swallowing that tasty, tasty corporate sludge so no one asks why gas is five dollars a gallon right now. There's also a swarm of mutant locusts.It should be noted that while the film's general laziness and indifference aren't anything out of the ordinary for this new corporate Hollywood, they also aren't quite out of line for the Jurassic Park franchise. The first film is an undisputed modern classic, a watershed film for the art and appliance of computer-generated effects and a masterclass in how to properly integrate them into a grounded yet thrilling story. Every sequel is middling at best, though its interesting to observe and analyze just how these new films are terrible.It's ironic that the new trilogy is so ungrounded (every character impossibly strong, fast, and knowledgeable) because the first film is close to reality. It's a rather small story, with charmingly mild character growth and a subtle message on human arrogance as it pertains to our place in the natural order. These qualities are subdued and nearly overwhelmed in the original sequels, but they manage to hang by a thread. The most embarrassing moment in the original trilogy is not the talking dinosaur; it's a moment in The Lost World, when a small child saves the day with the power of gymnastics. It's an outlier in the original trilogy, a quick lapse of judgement and a momentary release on the material.The Jurassic World trilogy, the latter two films especially, use this embarrassing outlier as their genetic code. They're poorly thought out, shockingly ungrounded, and tonally at odds with the danger presented. The new trilogy is an endless loop of that dinosaur being kicked out of a window, only here it's the audience being pushed out, and not by a little girl, but by an empty-headed hack who must've gained all of his film writing knowledge from masterclasses like Star Trek Discovery and Picard. More on him in just a moment.It's difficult to pinpoint exactly where Dominion first stumbles, and why it's so easy to hate. The whole thing is just so dumb. Few characters act with sufficient motivation, but they do possess the uncanny ability to escape every situation unscratched. Hiding from dinosaurs while awed by their presence makes sense.Fighting with dinosaurs toe to toe, or running from them on their own terms, makes far less sense and requires a fun-killing level of suspension of disbelief. Dominion, of course, usually opts for the latter. The best sequences in the film involve characters knowing their outmatched and simply hiding and praying for their lives. It's refreshing to see the film gets back to basics, but these sequences are few and far between.Aside from ludicrous yet lackluster action, Dominion skirts dangerously close to Transformers territory in its commitment to bland, impersonable characters. It was already difficult to care about Chris Pratt's Owen and Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire when they were new and fresh. Now they're old and purposeless, so it's impossible to muster up any sort of connection.To be fair, none of the new characters foster any sort of connection either; even old newcomers Sam Neill and Laura Dern feel like little more than set decoration. The only performer who sparks some quasi-joy is Jeff Goldblum, and even he looks disinterested in the surrounding events. There's just no sense of personality, professionalism, or agency. Even the original Jurassic Park isn't character-driven, but the audience is at least invested in whether or not Grant and Sattler are eaten alive by dinosaurs. Not so here.As mentioned, there is no directorial grasp on the material. Colin Trevorrow, back in the director's chair, can't skate by this time on the novelty of the franchise's revival or the creation of yet another big-bad to fight our friend the T. Rex. Admittedly, the Indominus Rex was cool, the babysitter's death was funny, and, hell, I even liked those big glass balls. But there's no novelty in Dominion. Trevorrow must try to direct while holding our gaze and fails miserably.His film oscillates between James Wan people-tiptoeing-around-to-hide-from-things-that-are-only-a-foot-away-from-them style boredom and Roland Emmerich nonsensical-mayhem-our-protagonists-dive-through-unharmed-even-though-we-don't-care-if-they-live-or-die-in-the-first-place style indifference. I longed for J. A. Bayona, who was at least kind enough to stylize the stupidity of Fallen Kingdom. Trevorrow brings no tension, no stakes, no passion, and no awe. Under his guidance, Dominion finally manages to make dinosaurs feel downright mundane. Congrats, Trevor.Is there anything to like? Well...there are two cool shots involving a new dinosaur baddie and one of the early chase sequences seems like it would've been fun on paper, though the execution screws the pooch. Goldblum is kinda' fun and there's a myriad of great-looking animatronics, especially those built to be menacing and not cutesy. So, to summarize: two cool shots, a theoretically cool chase, Goldblum, and some sparingly used but neat animatronics. That's what your ticket is paying for.Jurassic World: Dominion may be the final film in the Jurassic Park franchise. Good riddance. Absolutely nothing, in five full films, has given credence to the idea of expanding the original book or film. On the other hand, the film has already made good money after only two weeks in theaters, so audiences may be treated to yet another rehash of long-stale themes, characters, and dinosaur roars. Whatever the case, no matter which direction the franchise takes, or how long the initial impact of the first film remains in the minds of those who love it, one thing certainly remains clear: movies suck now.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The story was bland, the bad guy was so generic with no motive apart from ""control"" it was laughable, the acting was wooden, the plot holes were massive... i could go on but theres no point. Give it a miss and let the franchise die its already far too slow and painful death.

It's signalling just how bad this is going to be. This movie is so unbelievably boring, despite having probably the most stunning special effects of all the series. It could have been so good with that budget but halfway through gets hijacked by an absurd sub-plot about a bunch of baddies engaging in illegal animal trading. The sub-plot then takes over and it morphs into a by-the-numbers shoot 'em up gangster tale. The acting is hilarious, especially by the bleach blonde head gangster. She almost single handedly sinks the film on first appearance. She looked like she'd just popped in from the next-door studio set of Interview with a Vampire, minus the teeth. Come to think of it, adding a vampire twist could have been fun!I'm not sure how many writers were involved in this disaster (oh yes...there's also another sub-plot about Climate Change) but it appears they herded a bunch of them who were all working on different movie scripts into a room and instructed them to meld them all together to create 'Dominion'. Unfortunately they didn't unleash the dinosaurs into that room.The absolute mess this film turns out to be could possibly have been slightly bearable if it wasn't so excruciatingly boring. That's the kiss of death for any movie.What's next in this franchise? Sending them all into Space? Hopefully Elon Musk will go with them and we'll never hear from any of them again.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

While some of the scenes were not believable you have to let that go because we're watching a movie about dinosaurs so everything is on the table with this type of movie. I don't believe other peoples reviews, make your own opinions. This movie did a very good job of sending off the old cast and paving the way for the new. The visual effects are absolutely breathtaking, the plot and there is a plot was rather well done. The movie was rather enjoyable for myself and my family and who doesn't love dinosaurs?

There is nothing original in this.You have animals behaving in very peculiar ways.You have moral messages littered throughout with a final sign off at the end that was so crap that one has to think, right do you know what I want to do after watching this film is co-exist with a lion. No they will kill you.All this is is a fulfilment of a contract. No one looks like they care or are bothered and they want to make this thing, get paid and move on.At least Sam Neil (and the old gang) are trying.He's the best thing in it but then it's like feeling sorry for a diamond stuck in a pile of turd.

Its big, loud and dumb and has plot I guess.... but it don't matter cuz look at the shiny new visual!! But it still takes some brains to make that kind of blockbuster, Dominion however is overly long, made up of contrivances and coincidences, repeats the same old story which has been done to death and by the end leaves you with little to no recollection of what happened and did it even matter??So Dominion picks up after the events of Fallen Kingdom, four years to be precise.. after the destruction of Isla Nublar, dinosaurs have been freed and now live and hunt alongside humans all over the world. Now humans and dinosaurs live together in this big blue planet. If anyone remembers.. the clone daughter Maisie Lockwood from the previous one is now living with Chris Pratt and Dallas Howard's character. But she isn't allowed to go outside because she is a clone and some people might just have sinister interests with her and her genetics.Sam Neil and Laura Dern return as their iconic characters from the first one. Jeff Goldblum is present too so the original die hard fans will have something to look at.The plot as is the norm with these blockbusters these days is needlessly convoluted, Maisie gets kidnapped so Pratt goes on a globe trotting rescue mission to save her, meanwhile dangerous genetically modified locusts are destroying all harvests and crops of the planet and Ellie Sattler is here to investigate and drags Alan Grant along.Campbell Scott who played Peter Parker's dad in The Amazing Spiderman films plays a brilliant scientist who does some genetic research on the modification of genes to cure cancer and stuff. Yep pretty much the same character from those films. He heads Biosyn another evil corporation who has control over the dinosaurs and their living and everything. And if you are wondering what about the free roaming dinosaurs on our planet? Well don't worry because there isn't anything going on.Yep they did it in the previous one but didn't have the creativity to back it up so once again there are dinosaurs running around mostly in closed environments and humans are running and so on and so forth. There is one good chase sequence in a bazaar that keeps you entertained .A huge chunk of this film is dedicated to having the Maisie Lockwood plot running all over, but they fail to really ever give her any personality or character traits with which we can connect with you know like everyone did with the characters of the first one?Speaking of legacy characters Sam Neil as Alan Grant and Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler are having fun and Jeff Goldblum seems to be having a great time. Easily the most fun you can have is with him. The rest of the cast are decent and Chris Pratt carries the film some way but even he cannot take on the messy plot coincidences, overused CGI, boring characters and a stale, done to death storyline of Jurassic Park.The movie has been assembled pretty well with some decent sequences here and there, but its runtime is way too long. The biggest problem is that there is hardly anything to grasp at in this overkilled franchised that should have been extinct after the second part itself. Nothing new, crazy or even half memorable in this new installment. Just pretty stuff to look at, eat your popcorn, clap and consume and move on. The seemingly bland cinematography and a generic bland score doesn't help the cause at all.There isn't much to say well because Dominion doesn't give you anything to say!, Its your dumb blockbuster to which everyone is already numb too, following tropes and beats all too familiar this is well and truly what you call forgettable trash!","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Seriously, who decided that ending fight should play out that way? I was shaking my head in disbelief.The only good thing about the movie was seeing the original cast together again. But the plot doesn't do them any favours.Every scene fumbles onto the next with dinosaurs doing exactly what's required for plot convenience even when it makes absolutely no sense.This is a popcorn movie through and through.

The trailer clearly showed a scene with a T-Rex in a drive in & that was all I wanted to see... the scene isn't in the film. Somehow the film both tries too hard (with an overly complicated story) and doesn't try hard enough (failing to give any mystery to any of the dinosaurs, failing to be a horror movie once again like the original). The first few moment of the film just throws a huge sea dinosaur at your in a wide shot, nothing like the sense of fear or wonder Spielberg created, no tension or anticipation... just a big dinosaur thrown at you. Boring mood, boring camera coverage, characters are merely inconvenienced by their danger not in constant awe at how amazing the situation is. Characters regularly put themselves in danger, acting like superhero's instead of just people who get in sticky situations... which is what we come to see. Few characters do anything clever to escape their situation, mostly just end up accidentally getting out without much effort. Lots of the film is sidelined by a Bourne Identity rip off feel, having characters needlessly jumping on fancy roofs instead of just setting it in everyday settings. The bad guy is another rip off of Steve Jobs. All the bad guys are super cartoonish super villains for some reason. All the actors are trying & most succeed in holding their own, but it just doesn't have any spirit, sense of wonder, horror or well coordinated scenarios. I'm done with this franchise. I'll always love the original, but I'm embarrassed for all involved with this film taking down the name and classic status of the original. I wish Spielberg had taken care of his legacy here instead of letting others rip it apart. Jurassic World had some good ideas, many from him, but it totally fell apart.","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

One of the most respectful things screenwriters and director did was to reunite the old cast and the new one, and I mean really get them all together at some point so that all of them were in this same adventure. That's what to do when you bring an old classic into life. I find it respectful to the fans. And the dinos are great!!! So many amazing sequences I can't pick one as a favourte. The T-Rex cameo appearance in a reference to the old logo was great! I love every line, every reference (full pack fan service) and all the characters - from both trilogies. I'll be forever thankful to Spielberg for guiding this project and have this team to make it real.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Just when you thought Jurassic Park Lost World was the biggest pile of stegosaurus dung ever created, the franchise said ""wait, hold my beer"". Seriously the best part of this movie was the slime that ran down the T-Rexs neck after eating a deer. The not so subtle nods to the original were cool but came off stronger than a frat boy with a bottle of Jack Daniels at a college kegger. Like I said thank God they served beer or otherwise I'd have given it a 1 star. RIP Jurassic Park.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Bad storytelling, empty and meaningless characters with jumbled character developments. Sorry but I have had enough of teenage girls being the solution to the problem. And why did they think that replacing the scientist with a good and handsome boi with motorcycle will be good? Jurassic films was not about dinosaurs. OK, they are in it as the fear factor, but in my humble opinion they were the wonders of nature still. The other important message in the old movies was the role of science and scientist in discovering and trying to understand these marvels (dinos in this case). These two things made the Spielberg films that good. In these films we get the opposite of these values. Dinosaurs are monsters and science is bad.All in all this was ridiculous compared to the old movies. Dull.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Albeit it doesn't feel like an ""Epic Conclusion"" as Universals marketing team quipped, it manages to tell a complete story from beginning to end, with everything you love about Jurassic movies but with a twist. The main plot driving the OG cast's return is clearly inspired by Jurassic's SciFi roots (very Crichton-esque). The main plot driving the JW cast is solid and helps bring these two ""Era's"" together. 30 years of dinosaur and film magic comes down to this. Don't critique the film for what you think it should be, critique it for its individuality from the rest. Dominion is a great adventure ride (as to be expected from a Jurassic film) and easily can be rewatched. Be on the lookout for a *rumored* extended cut once the film releases on Blu Ray and Digital. If you are a fan of the franchise and if you appreciate the extended lore, you'll enjoy this film!","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

One jump scare and two and a half hours of your life gone are all you'll get from this disappointing conclusion to a once awe-inspiring franchise.Beyond the CGI nothing feels right. The dialogue, the performances, the predictable action sequences, the editing and pacing are all sub-par. The score that once evokes awe now feels limp and half-hearted.As a long-time franchise fan I'm glad I didn't go to a midnight screening on release day last week.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I honestly cannot tell you what happened in this movie despite enduring the whole thing, as I didn't understand half the time what was going on! The whole vibe was somewhat futuristic and dystopian. I found it hard to like or warm to any of the characters, there was literally zero chemistry between any of them. The plot was terrible and utterly confusing plot AND there was only a handful of Dinosaurs to boot!Whilst there is a bunch of well known and good actors in this movie, most were completely under utilized and therefore looked half asleep throughout. Whilst I think Sam Neal actually looked better in this movie than he did in the original (love the beard) they kept making his character out to be almost like Indiana Jones - fedora included! Also I think the worst thing about the supposed ""baddie"" was his bad acting, and just who the hell was the ""Woman In White"" supposed to be??? - yes yer one with the laser pointer wearing the silky white gilet!So in conclusion, I suggest you watch the original 1993 Jurassic Park film instead of this one! Utter nonsense!I give this movie a generous 1 out of 10... purely for Jeff Goldblum's one liners, and Sam Neill's beard!!!","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

There are some nice set pieces but it is weighed down by some clunky dialogue and Jurassic World 3 is ultimately a disappointment.

I was 99% sure I was not the one who would have watched it because I thought for sure I would not walk away from a Jurassic Park movie. So I started watching it again. And about 20 minutes in I realized why I left the first time. It is so terrible unbelievably so I mean if you're an adult, anyway. If you're a child or even a teenager you might find a lot of tension here with the dozens of dinosaurs who sound like tigers and run like dogs chasing people at high speeds but never catching them for some reason. Lol. The makeup on the actresses is almost comical it's so airbrushed. However I found all the original cast to look very nice considering their age. Can never go wrong with, darn it I forgot his name- he was in Independence Day as well. Nice looking guy with the dark hair. Anyway I found the reviews here much more entertaining than the film. I really have to give high fives to the guy who discussed cake and taxes to get to his 600 characters. It is a little bit unfortunate in my opinion that we can't just come here and say I wanted to sentence opinion about a film anymore. But this one is just all pure action and CGI, and is very disappointing considering it's from 2022. I mean dinosaurs really sounded like tigers and run like dogs? I guess it could happen but when I was in high school learning about dinosaurs we learned that they are a little bit less spry. I was particularly turned off by this Cliffhanger about she's my daughter but she's not my daughter and of course she's a rebellious teen who won't follow rules to save her own life. Oh my goodness can we ever get away from this crap. Someone needs to start disciplining our children. The other reason I was surprised it was from 2022 is because some of the PC issues introduced in the film seem a little yesterday to me. I agree with people who say that the script did not have much thought put into it. Or maybe it's been sitting on a shelf for 10 years. To reiterate, if you're a teenager or a child who's allowed to watch scary stuff you might enjoy this film. If you're an adult you might endure this film if there are children or teenagers in your house.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

This film is uninspired and just retreads everything we've seen in previous Jurassic movies, without having any of the interesting elements that made the original what it was. There are two main flaws:
1) The main villain is incredibly boring and one dimensionally evil.2) we were promised that this movie would show us a world where Dinos have essentially integrated into the modern world. Although the opening montage showcases some of this, after the main character intros are done the plot brings us back to another secluded Dino zone so we can relive all the scenes from Jurassic Park. However, none of the tension or suspense is there, except for one scene . I think only one named character actually gets killed by Dinos (which we don't actually see) making it far less scary than the original, where named characters are picked off one by one.I would only recommend this to parents of kids who want to see big dinosaurs on the big screen and don't care if the human characters are interesting. But for all other movie goers, save your money.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Those themes are similar to the first, but in a different way and built upon.Personally, I think if it were not cool to dunk on nostalgia bait, this film would be wildly popular.It's a very enjoyable and relevant film.

Jurassic world dominion isn't very logical, it's hard to imagine most of the scenarios, there's people constantly outrunning trained assassin dinosaurs, so much of the plot line is dependent on coincidences that realistically speaking aren't supposed to be in the ""good guys"" favor, happens once... that's alright, but the movie is littered with them. We have people who've never met and literally have no real connection somehow suddenly willing to risk their lives and everything else to help each other, they lack character depth but from the little we know don't really seem like the type. The movie tries to subtly be humorous but the only scene that made me chuckle was the 'pullover the plane to the side' otherwise most of the jokes don't land as hard as they're intended. The dinosaurs behavior was way out of character, especially when they were mingling with the rest of modern wildlife, just hard to believe. You see, a lot of the movie is unbelievable and you could keep on rambling about it; if you over analyze it you'll realize there's so many aspects of it that are way off and could be better and you end up not enjoying it... but it's a dinosaur movie, I think you should just look at as just that; entertainment not a piece of art. I acknowledge it isn't a great movie, but I enjoyed it and it's worth a watch. It's also a decent family movie.I watched a recap of the entire franchise and I must say it has really come from far and the recent releases have adapted the story with the times to make it more modern which ended up with fatuous plotlines like breeding animals for military use and all that, like if that made sense they'd have tried conscripting rhinos first. But none of it is as silly as fast and furious for example. If you're going to watch this with a keen eye and all you really won't enjoy it.My only major complaint is they tried to give it a heartfelt send off at the end with the emotional happy ending, sigh of relief, everybody coming together, it's all love music and it really wasn't giving man, I didn't care of the characters for that scene to deliver what the writers or directors thought it was giving. The movie had to be better than it actually was for that ending to mean something and that annoyed me. It's not an epic conclusion as advertised.It is a long movie as well, I don't think it had to be that long and if it was paced better could have shortened the runtime and made it more thrilling as the action was subpar. If I'm not mistaken, this is intended to be the last release in the franchise, and for that I'm a little upset because there was a huge time leap, about thirty years since dinosaurs were released and I'm sure amazing stories could have come from that, while this movie followed a more generic and more imaginative story.Anyway, I don't think it's an absolute catastrophe but if you head into this with expectations, you'll be disappointed. I didn't have any and thought it was bearable.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

A lot of the longer scenes do a fantastic job building up the plot and delving into the lore of the franchise, the two new heroes introduced in this movie were great, Chris Pratt was superb and all the legacy characters were so much fun.Don't be wavered by any negative reviews you see, go and watch the film for yourself, I highly, highly, recommend it.","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

I came to the theatre with low expectation (since the review are not really good) so i thought i could enjoy some dinosaur fight. Well, guess what? Nothing happen. The story was dull, even the conversation between characters feels corny. Bad acting (especially the one who play as maisie). And the funny thing is, everytime one of the character do something, they just start hugging and high five. The villain have no motivation and emotionless. There's two action scene that i thought it was decent, but it just hold for 8 minutes. So you guys must see the another 139 minutes pointless story to get there, plus unfunny moment everywhere with bad scoring.Epic conclusion of Jurassic era? I don't think so, even after the credit start rolling, the audience cant get the conclusion of what ever happened in the movie. But actually the movie could work if they have better story, like how humans and dinosaur live together and they can make the movie two parts, rather than execute this stupid story of how another bad company try to rule the world (again) and forced everything to collide because every character try to finished their own task just to meet at the end to say Hi. But hey, this is just my opinion, you can agree or disagree but this just felt really wrong. But this is the worst movie i've ever seen.The only good thing about this movie, well of course the animation, and Jeff Goldblum as Jeff Goldblum (Chris Pratt acting was decent but he seems doesn't want to be in the movie).Goofy Ah Movie. And just like another franchise, the studio will start a spin off or maybe do another useless reboot.Personal Rating: 1/10.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

These skits are of varying quality, a function of the actors, the dinosaurs and the context. The Dern, Neil and Goldblum skits are pretty good, it's nice to see the characters, nice to reminisce, homages to past movies, their class as actors shows through. The Pratt skits are just Chis Pratt, I don't mind the guy, he can be hunky, funny, whatever. Howard really overdoes the pathetic damsel in distress in this one, almost unwatchable. The young girl is so un-likeable I didn't even Google the actor's name. In general, the skits seemed to flow into something vaguely cogent, although there were a few occasions where characters and skit intersections defied all reason or logic but had to happen to keep the story flowing.Special mention to the editing which is horrific; so bad I had to check my internet hadn't glitched on a few occasions. I'm still not convinced it hadn't.The old guard added two stars, without them this was pretty terrible.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

What a liberal, idealistic, unrealistic piece of garbage! First off, the entire premise of the movie stinks. I was willing to let that go and escape into someone else's creativity. Then I got about 20 minutes in. Every little thing was a statement (either implied or otherwise) in liberal politics. I really wanted an escape, not a lecture. One of the three worst movies I've ever seen . . .When the film began building upon the previous movie, the idea of humans attempting to share the planet with dinosaurs seemed like a logical storyline. Then the garbage began. I'm not going to even attempt to go into detail, but every form of globalist, elitist form of the liberal agenda is presented in the most absurd manner possible! I thought Rowdy Roddy Piper in ""Hell Comes To Frogtown"" was ridiculous . . . An absolute joke! .","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

No more reviews ever for me. People said it was so bad, said it wasn't about dinosaurs, said it was just a character reunion, too long. Nope, quite the opposite. It was action packed, had a great story, characters were awesome, had great visuals and it was not too long. I don't want to sit there and pick a film completely apart when I want to be there to enjoy myself. I didn't even sit in a DBox seat solely because I didn't want that distraction, although I might go back and experience it. This film started with action and ended with it. It had a good pace and there was no dead space like some movies.I wish we'd seen more of Chris Pratt like in previous films, but he shared screen time with quite the cast. It had plenty of dinosaurs, emotions for them and the characters. I almost didn't go see this $5 Tuesday special because of so many bad reviews. I'm glad I pushed myself to go see it, and by myself at that. I am totally done with reading and writing reviews because I might have missed this jewel due to those misleading opinions. So many reviews aren't reviews anyway; they are just people acting like writers giving you the same synopsis that you already know about. I might not watch this film 8 times like I did for Jurassic Park, but it is worth a few viewings and I would not have been disappointed had I paid full price to see it. I also see no reason to close the door on this franchise. The movie has a definite conclusion, but seems open to me if they wanted to make another film since the characters are there. I gave 9/10 to only a few films; TG Maverick being the most recent with 10/10 going only to The Wizard of Oz due to the fact that it will be watched when it is 100 years old. I doubt Jurassic and Maverick will be able to boast that. This really is my last review, so stop reading them and just go to the theater and have a great time. Enjoy the experience, even if the film is not the best you ever saw. Reviews made me look for trouble where it did not exist and made me think this could be a failure, but it wasn't. I will never again allow reviews to sway my opinion of a film I haven't even seen. A 20 year old rusted barn find junk car is more reliable than any of these reviews. Farewell.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

This movie attempts to exploit the nostalgia of the original characters and it fails miserably at every level. The action, the editing, the direction, it's all terrible. The movie has no focus, too many characters that have nothing to do and nothing to do with each other.

It was beautifully shot, decently paced, and had a good balance of story, character focus, and, of course, action. It felt like Jurassic Park meets Bourne Identity, with a twist of Indiana Jones and even a bit Star Warsy at times. Like a Star Wars level of world immersion, where they took us away and we experienced a new world where dinosaurs were now integrated into some parts of society. The scene in Malta was totally comparable to a Star Wars Cantina scene.The aesthetic and cinematography of Dominion made me more nostalgic than seeing the original cast. The shots were a little more hard lit and gritty than what we're used to, versus the overly HDR hyperreal, super clean visuals we expect to see in most blockbuster movies. Dominion felt a lot more grounded and classically cinematic. Back and side lighting for the win.I enjoyed the focus and interactions between the large cast of characters, both old, older and new. It didn't feel like anyone overly dominated the screen, with everyone sharing a place, a purpose and a voice before finally uniting for a fun and exciting climax. The dinosaurs also didn't overtake the story, allowing the human elements to breath, with their appearances serving as well timed spectacles that complimented the overall world and story. Visually this is the best we've seen, and I wasn't sure at times if they brought back the animatronics, or the CGI has improved a lot more for this film. I think it may have been a mix of both.I really think that they went through the previous films in the series, saw what work and what didn't work, and put their efforts into not making the the same old mistakes. While simultaneously brainstorming a bucket list of new things they wanted to bring to life and create on screen. Like of course, if you have to compete with a baby Yoda it makes sense to create a baby Blue. Overall for me this was the strongest of the sequel trilogy, and a strong contender for the second best in the saga. I wouldn't be surprised if we hear another TV series announced some time soon based on this Jurassic World.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

And while the dinosaurs are (for the most part) beautiful and the amount of animatronic pieces are impressive, the main villain dinosaur is not shown very much at all, and depressingly harmless and rather useless when it is. Although most of the film struggles to find its voice, the chase through (CENSORED) was thrilling, enjoyable, and truly Jurassic in the amount of action and fun it has. Technically impressive but with a poor script, Dominion has enough fun callbacks to recommend a viewing in theaters.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

That dinosaurs didn't feauture more, there were plenty that were used right, the fact you wanted more shows you think they were good. So many other nonsensical ""opinions"" copy and pasted by those just jumping on the badwagon of being cool to hate.The only negative for me was the main villain, not enough of a presence and not the best acting, other than that I didn't see anything wrong with it, no one I spoke to had anything negative to say and conversations I heard after were all positive.I'll give you one task, find any of these negative reviews that offer any form of coherent improvements or arguments that would've improved the film, I'm not talking about making it shorter, adding more dinosaurs in, I mean the plot and execution. I read many a pompous self gratifying reviewer talking utter rubbish with no justification.I read 50 negative reviews and found not one offered anything but childish logic either from someone who's either not seen it, or saw it and liked it but saw it's more trendy to hate it so made up a bad review.The effects are brilliant, plot made sense and everything to me was great, the only mistake for me was not making it over two parts, as dinosaurs in the real world was always what I wanted to see, so splitting it into two films, adding some more set pieces or landmarks with the dinosaurs interacting would've been awesome but think that's just me wanting to see more cool moments and visuals because I enjoyed a great movie.Ignore the hate, have your OWN opinions for a change, stop being sheep.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

The movie is long and feels long and it seems that they made it that long in order to be able to show all kinds of dinosaurs. Less is more, I would say. The acting is a mixed bag, I would say, with Chris Pratt being the weakest link. But it doesn't beat the bad quality of the script. While the original Jurassic Park based on the book by Michael Crichton was science with some fiction, this movie is just fiction in so many aspects - starting with dinosaurs being comfortable in winter or having spread to other continents supposedly.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The story is about an bland but evil corporate head of BioSyn Dr Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) who breeds genetically modified prehistoric locusts to wipeout food crops apart from genetically engineered ones.So no one suspects that if BioSyn crops survive that BioSyn might be doing something nasty.The original Jurassic Park team of Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) go to investigate BioSyn.Right on their heels are Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) who are there to rescue Maisie the cloned girl and the offspring of the raptor, Blue.In the almost 30 years since Jurassic Park, the CGI has improved immeasurably. This is shown on the CGI dinosaurs which are much better than the animatronic ones.The story is limp as it tries to duplicate too many beats from previous movies. This lengthy film repeats the same tension over and over as someone is stalked or chased by a dinosaur.Jurassic World Dominion wants the audience to contemplate a world where humans, animal life and dinosaurs coexist. The opening montage makes that a non starter.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Good...Lord!This is coming from someone who is an extremely critical cinephile, mind you. But, good grief, I at least know how to keep it in the pocket.To lambast the actors and writers...I'm just-all I can think to suggest is maybe ya'll should just to stop going to see movies.Any reviewer who claims that this cast of actors performed poorly should be immediately disregarded. We're talking about Christ Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill, and Laura Dern. If these people haven't proven their abilities as actors by now to audiences, that's on the audience.This film had all the makings of a great Jurassic film. I was delighted to see the original cast mix with the new. Loved the new adventures and action, the dinosaurs, the characters, the heart. It had everything I wanted in a final installment.It's a franchise. There's a reason for that. It is the continuation of an umbrella plot line. If you're tired of it, don't watch the movie. Simple.Those of us who still enjoy the new developments of a continued story, the nostalgia, the new dino designs and adventures, had a great time.What I find hilarious is people blasting this film for doing what they laud in the original film. If you maxed out at the first film, watch the first film then! It is available for purchase to watch repeatedly at your heart's content. Leave the new films to those of us who can appreciate new approaches to a continued storyline.I get varying opinions. I consider this film to be a delightful 9/10 personally. But I can understand someone giving it an 8, 7, even 6. I disagree but a positive, if not more critical rating, I can understand. No film is perfect and no film reaches various people the same way.But calling this film trash, giving it a 1 star, calling it boring...sorry, but I'm looking at you and wondering what's wrong with you! Boo, who made you so angry?? 'Cause that makes literally zero sense.If you found THIS boring, you made the wrong choice for yourself from the jump. Check your pulse maybe? Idk!This was a great & thrilling film. Great performances, stunts, action, graphics, & nostalgia.It's a movie about humans and dinosaurs existing together...*blink *blink...it's SCIENCE...FICTION...suspend some derned belief for crying out loud.MY.... GOODNESS... Phew!It's a good thing actors get paid well, ya'll would kill the industry with these over-the-top, unjustly harsh criticisms. I used to be able to trust user reviews of movies and ignored the critics. But now it just looks like everybody's angry and bitter and jaded and taking it out on films by writing seriously ridiculous reviews. So much so, I'm literally starting to interpret 5 stars as a 7, and so on.I missed out on quite a few good films trusting user ratings in the last few years and have learned they can't be trusted anymore. Glad I didn't pay any attention to reviews for this movie. Gaaahlee!Lighten up ya'll. It's entertainment.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Weaving each legacy character tightly into the new story line like they were meant to be there all along. This movie takes you to fun and exciting places. You really feel like Trevarrow set out to make an epic conclusion to a franchise that's had its ups and downs.Relying on a lot of in camera effects, more so than other Jurassic World installments, made the film feel like classic Hollywood from the 90's. You may remember the time where entertainment was just that. The cinematography was big and bold. The dialogue made you laugh and feel good. Effects left you in wonderment. All without pushing a narrative that takes away from being entertained. Dominion's mixture of puppetry and CGI made the world feel tangible. It's a thrill ride that's full of the same dinosaur magic that made the original film feel so alive. The heartfelt moments are earned. Malcolm's witty personality is on full display. The legacy characters have closure. This film is tense, it's smart, and it's fun for the whole family!Don't listen to the critics! This film is exactly what the original film set out to do in 1993... entertain you! It's classic Hollywood at its finest, and I loved it! This is the Jurassic movie you didn't know you wanted, but now can't live without.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

The CGI, sound design, and camera were all topnotch as you would expect from a Jurassic Park film. Even the few shots of practical effects were quality. This was very expensive to make for sure.But everything else was flat and mindlessly, needlessly complicated. The first big problem I had with it was that it's WAY too long by at least an hour. The runtime became almost torture. It's like they kept inventing problems for the characters to solve for the sake of a longer duration.The next thing was that there was too much going on. There were multiple plots within the plot so it felt disjointed. And some of them were pointless. You've got a human clone with a story about her mother and the clone's search for her identity, a locust plague, a conspiracy, some more stuff, and then the dinosaurs. It was cluttered.With any Jurassic Park movie, I think less is more. The original adaptation did it best and I don't believe its magic will ever be recreated: A mysterious park with cloned dinosaurs who escape. The characters then try to survive the chaos. Throw in unbelievable filmmaking craftsmanship with lovable characters and we had a winner. That's it. That's all we needed.I will say that it was better than Fallen Kingdom. I can't declare that I outright hated Dominion but I wouldn't bother with it again and found it forgettable. Having the original cast back was nice to see but it didn't do anything to help beyond the warm nostalgic factor.This certainly wasn't a fitting end to the franchise.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I was also a big fan of JW when it came out, I've played both the JWE games too.So to finish the series with a very mediocre film is just downright disheartening.JW2 was a let down but it ended with such promise it was merely a stepping stone to get to THIS, THE SHOWDOWN, MAN VS DINOSAUR.And it just didn't happen, if anything this was worse than JW2.Now seeing the original cast back was cool, but it didn't solve the plethora of problems with the film. CGI was great and the actors put in good performances but I don't think anything could save this from the terrible story.Now the film does pickup A LOT in the last 40 mins or so, but the ending is terrible, no solution, no answers, no....ending tbh. It was almost like they were leaving it open for another sequel, but by making 2 bad films in a row I really think the box office would be WAY down for another one.It's not a terrible film and it's not a good film, IT'S NOT WHAT WE WANTED I cant tell you that!!!!It's probably above JP3 and below JW2 but an average film that squandered the opportunity to be absolutely epic makes me feels like I've been ripped off, money wise and hype/waiting wise.This could have been the best in the series and I'm gutted that,it wasn't.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Not even the CGI Deer!It is a ""dumb monster movie"" and nothing else.

Is he a guest professor at this place, trying to fumble through English but it all coming out as roaring? Buddy, they're standing right there! Just pick one of them and eat! This was the worst scene I've ever seen in any movie, and I sat through all of Mission to Mars (2000), so that's saying something.The fights between the dinosaurs were even worse. They just stand around roaring at each other. They could have put sensors on cockfighting roosters, and used that data to make some incredible fight scenes; instead the audience is served fight scenes of total banality.And the plot makes no sense. What does getting DNA samples of an insect at a sanctuary prove? This place literally captures and researches genetically resurrected organisms - it'd be strange if they *didn't* have samples of the insects.And lastly, why are characters where they are in the scenes they are? Why did you not leave when everyone else left? Are you that dumb, or was something important keeping you there?The movie started out with such promise; in the first couple of scenes, I thought it would be an epic commentary on the environment and genetic engineering, coronavirus, etc, and it slowly devolved from there.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

"5","/10","All this movie has going for are the legacy characters.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8228778/?ref_=tt_urv","drawlife","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14294603/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2022","JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION had one job. Show off how living with dinosaurs would effect the lives of the people. It was promised by the trailers/marketing and the ending of FALLEN KINGDOM. It hardly touches on that.It's about locusts...LOCUSTS...I just scratched my head not once, not twice, but like three or four times. It's mind boggling to me that anyone involved in the film would think that would be the best focal plot point as opposed to dinosaurs out and about. I'm looking at Colin Trevorrow, Emily Carmichael and Derek Connelly who were directly involved with story and script.Plot involving Pratt and Howard's characters involve the cloned granddaughter from the previous film being kidnapped by Biosyn who is owned and operated by Lewis Dodgson. Dodgson some how failed upwards as a John Hammond 2.0 and comes off as a paper-thin character/villain. Pratt and Howard are really just pawns to be moved throughout the story really. They've never been compelling characters in all honesty so there's nothing new there. Also the JURASSIC WORLD's mascot raptor Blue has hardly anything to do here. She has a baby raptor that gets kidnapped along with the cloned granddaughter and nothing comes of it.In conjunction with what Pratt and Howard are going through, the original trio Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum have meaty roles, but their part in the story involves the unnecessary locusts. It's only till the end both sides meet up and find their way out of Biosyn HQ. Biosyn was only there to once again put the dinosaurs in a controlled environment.I'm been very vocal on how I'm not a fan of the JURASSIC WORLD films, and the only reason why I had any interest in seeing this film was simply because Grant, Sattler and Malcolm returned on the promise that they would have roles more significant than a cameo. At the very least the movie delivers on that. The legacy characters are treated with respect and have something to do as opposed to just being in the film for the sake of being in the film. The unfortunate part is again, they mingled with locusts more than they mingled with dinosaurs.DeWanda Wise as smuggler pilot Kayla Watts I found to be kinda cool. She had more charisma and personality than Pratt or Howard had in all three films combined.It's baffling to me how FALLEN KINGDOM destroyed the island, and how Universal and the filmmakers were too afraid to show us actual coexistence with dinosaurs in real life situations. Just unacceptable.All this film has going for is that the legacy characters are handled properly despite a terrible plot thread, and aside from that, some good dinosaur scenes, that's really all there is to it. Six JURASSIC films in and only one good one. Even if this is billed as the ""culmination"" of the films, pretty sure they'll make more if it prints money at the box office. Either way for me at least, the franchise has ran its course.5/10.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

Key characters from previous movies thrown together into reminiscent past iconic scenes to loosely follow the very basic park plot. The characters are cardboard play pieces with mundane dialogue that goes nowhere. Not only was the monster dinosaurs recycled, but also some familiar dinosaurs from two decades ago (still filmed as obvious mechanical puppets). In conclusion, I struggle to avoid falling asleep watching a midday Jurassic Park reunion anniversary style movie special. Hopefully in future instalments they might actually create a decent interesting thrilling mature script around the existence of dinosaurs roaming in the human world. Previous two movies in recent years are brilliant. And the original three movies were magical. This movie was a boring letdown.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

I am dedicating my entire life to the wonderful craft of filmmaking that saved me from the darkness. Engrossing audiences in a compelling story with relatable characters and all the components that make up MOVIES.This is not a movie.This is a spectacle. A very bad, stupid spectacle. In recent years, I have come to realize that most big Hollywood movies are so hollow, generic and overall not compelling. I still have a mild amount of respect for the Marvel movies despite their flaws. They are most definitely not meant to be anything more than entertainment that appeals to the masses and families of the world but you can tell that they care about not being plain stupid and have that wonderful sense of fun.This isn't. WAY TOO MUCH exposition, poorly executed ""action"" scenes, very stupid dialogue and it only relies on showing you scenes from the previous movies of the franchise (even JP3, believe it or not). I wouldn't even recommend this movie to general families, they'll probably be bored and leave the theater frustrated.Please do not support this. You deserve better entertainment that will respect your intelligence. You deserve better.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

He must have some serious dirt on the producers of said franchises, because there is no way he is experienced, or talented, enough to take on those movies, as shown in this frankly appalling ""trilogy finale"". It's awful, truly awful. We can only be thankful he was taken off of Star Wars, the damage done to that IP was bad enough with what we got, I can't imagine the horrors he would have unleashed on the SW fanbase. Please keep him away from important franchises, and back in the indie world where he might make another passable picture. Maybe.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

The story with Maisie was interesting enough and Claire with Zia and Franklin at the beginning. After that it tends to fall.Owen survives a plane crash without a seatbelt and falls into ice water without any damage. He holds out his hands to many dinosaurs and most of the time the dinos stop. He is definitely a Marty Stu.Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler seem just tired and have barely any enthusiasm from their first film characters. They also have a forced love relationship which doesn't feel at all earned.Ian Malcom barely does anything.Lewis Dodgson is the most evil character in the book. Attempts to murder Sarah Harding and breaks a dinosaurs leg with no remorse. Well here, he has no relation to the character other than name sake. He is what I perceived a jab at Tim Cook from Apple. Even the complex is trying to replicate Apple Park.Henry Wu does a 180° and is a good guy without having earned it.There's many cringe scenes but the fact they even cameoed the logo of the film with the T Rex was just too much.I would have them do a 4th film just to fix this mess of a story they created.

Then they went dumb for three movies and made monster movies because they thought people would be tired of ""plain"" dinosaurs. Finally they realized no one has ever seen a dinosaur so how the hell are you going to be tired of them?! This is a great disaster/survival movie and I REALLY hope they make more.For starters, we could use a high budget limited series about how they got Jurassic Park back under control for Jurassic World.

They managed to make a dinosaur movie boring. That's the best thing I can say, I struggled to get through this movie, with how flat the plot was and soap opera like acting... I don't know how to explain it but the script and they way they delivered it was very bizarre. Even the action scenes were extremely boring and un-exciting Honestly giving it a 3 because the dinosaur cgi was good at times (like the opening scene) but not much else to praise here. I found myself not caring about any of the main characters it was just so forgettable overall, it could be skipped and you wouldn't be missing out on much.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's really sad to be honest because you hear the original tune and it brings wonderful feeling back of great movies. Not one single actor could have made it better because they all played along with the horrible corn dog writing and the dramatic stances. Just boo.

It had a few glimmering scenes that were decent, but overall everything was horribly disconnected and very random. The soundtrack unfitting for parts of the movie, the audio was terrible. I only gave it three stars out of 10 instead of one simply because of the throwback to the old movies that it did. The Retro feeling in certain parts and nods to the other aspects of the series we're appreciated.

I had no idea why these animals were wandering around the earth in our daily lives nor why Pratt was raising a British child who is a clone?! There are some action scenes that tense, but mostly this is just a bad & very stupid movie. I was watching a Parks and Rec episode the other day and I had forgotten how much fun Pratt was at one time. His last few films have been awful and he has been a bore. He doesn't even act like he wants to be in this particular film. Regurgitating Dern, O""Neill and Goldblum reeks of a script concept that has run out of ideas. The special effects are impeccable, but who notices anymore?! It's kind of sad that so much of special effects these days are no longer really special.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Being a longtime fan of the franchise as a whole, one of the most enjoyable aspects of this film was the unison of old and new characters. The portrayals of the characters were charismatic, and the eventual dynamic between these actors will undoubtedly bring a smile to any viewer's face. The visuals are also well done, with a notable combination of practical and computer effects. However, with all the flashy callbacks to previous films, visuals, and characters, the plot is what truly butchers the overall experience. Damage control from the sins of the previous film was at full capacity, desperately trying to justify the idiotic choices and twists that made the previous so infuriating. The plot is convoluted, trying too hard to give each of its large cast a piece of screen time and untimely forgetting to incorporate the true stars of the film, the dinosaurs. The film constantly focuses on useless subplots that bore and confuse rather than entertain. The villain of the film feels forced and contrived, copying and pasting from previous films and making no logical sense in the development of the overall series of films. The premise the film advertises is barely touched upon and deprives the audience of the most interesting aspect of the film. The logic is comparable to that of a Saturday morning cartoon, begging the audience to suspend disbelief for the stupidity that occurs. Overall, despite the aspects of the film that were done admirably, the baggage that came along in order to make it possible was eye-rolling and a definitive reason as to why this franchise should be laid to rest.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I know that when watching blockbuster movies that there's plenty of room for the unbelievable and you have to take certain things with a pinch of a salt. Normally I can switch off to things like that and let my brain cells melt away. That's part of the fun, and sometimes I seek that. But with very little redeeming things about it, the dumbness and implausible scenarios stand out. Too many cliches and too many predictable scenarios and plot points. Plus it doesn't really feel about dinosaurs anymore either.I didn't even care about any of the characters and part of me was egging on the dinos to devour every last one of them.It's a shame that the movie that collides the classic characters and the newer characters is this one. This is beyond mediocre and a boring mess of a film.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

To sequels or to indie films? To multi-hundred million dollar superhero CGI fests or to films that tell great stories? To cars jumping out of exploding planes or to moving scripts with well developed characters?Hollywood is dumb. And it's not its fault. They just follow the money. The onus of demanding quality filmmaking is on us. And the only way to make that happen is with our wallets. We need to stop showing up at the box office for dumb ""blockbuster"" movies and start supporting real creators, so that we may never be subjected again to a movie like Jurassic World Dominion.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's just another product made by studio executives that don't really know (or care) about cinema. These days there's just a few people in Hollywood that really understand what films are truly about. That's why streaming services are today's best option, sadly.I'm not writting this review out of nostalgia or disappoinment, it's kinda fun to watch this industry digging its own grave, because you know, cinema doesn't belong to them.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I am so disappointed in this blasphemy to the great Jurassic Park 1 I can't explain in words. Do not watch this atrocity of a movie. It will not entertain you whatsoever and it will simply get you angry about the entire series if you are a Jurassic Park fan whatsoever. It's just so sad how movie makers can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on something that is so bad. There seems to be no shame in Popcornflix anymore.

I was not disappointed. To someone born in the fifties, who learned to program computers with key punch cards (ask an old person) I am absolutely entranced with the animatronics. Everytime I see a dinosaur (in the movie) I think about all the work and creativity involved. If the giant ants in Them (1954) were frightening, then these super monsters are terrifying. Kudos to all who brought modern technology to science fiction today.I am also appreciative of the great cast. It was good to see actors and actresses from earlier Jurassic movies. I took a moment to mourn the absence of Sir Richard Attenborough; he added so much to the movies he was in. While watching The Green Planet series narrated by Sir Attenborough, I kept expecting a dinosaur to lurch through the jungle or desert.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Basically every scene is shot Infront of a green screen and it's blatantly obvious. There's a reason why if you pop in the first two movies by Spielberg that they are still exhilarating.The first Jurassic World was okay but it didn't deserve two sequels. As others have said this movie is a soulless entry Into the franchise. I feel like most of the actors are acting if this movie is beneath them and it is.They didn't bother to do anything new with this movie. It's the same message in the last few movies about how corporations are evil, and can't be trusted. Honestly not everyone that runs a hedge fund or major corporation is trying to take over the world or has evil motivations.This movie forgets that it was Hammond's naivety that lead to the downfall of Jurassic Park. He really thought what he was doing was for the good of humanity. In was in the name of exploration. In every film since then all the main villains have had some stupid evil motive.Ultimately this movie is very predictable and I hope it is the last one in the franchise for a long time.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The plot makes sense sure, but it's like watching a James Bond movie to find out it's about his tax return journey and discovering the trials and tribulations of such a perilous quest.The script/dialogue/writing is just poor, at some points it is just puzzling how it got a pass, at first it was funny, but soon got annoying.

Unfortunately this film felt like a bad wrap up for the trilogy for a number of reasons;The forced scenes, like the T-Rex lining up with the circle towards the end to make the logo 🙄 and the shaving cream scene just to name a couple.You then had the undertone of the movie, I don't know if it was just me, but the whole film felt more of political movie, about racism, togetherness, climate change and big corporations. It was no longer a focus on the dinosaurs and the story but more of a political piece.There is many hints towards this, such as big pharma manufacturing these locusts, to control the food market, then the coexisting and living together forced messages throughout the film and at the end, then talking about climate change, the pre movie at the theater was literally a raptor at a UN conference talking to people about climate change 😳🤣I felt this could of been so much more, even the short cross over from Jurassic Park: The Lost World had a enjoyable mix of city and dinosaurs.This story also focused alot on the clone of a person, I don't care about people cloning... this is Jurassic World its about dinosaurs not cloning people or making weird people hybrids.I was just left underwhelmed and disappointed, after Fallen World it seemed so promising but they just ruined the direction, I was so excited with bringing back original members from the series but they didn't do much for the story you had the dream situation here and the opportunity to have a major classic but it missed the mark.Hopefully when they revamp the series again they take more consideration into keeping it within there target audience saying that I'll probably be dead if they wait another 10-20 years for a revamp 😫It was nice to watch over all, but all the points above just didn't leave me wanting to watch it again.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It felt like a bad parody. Anti-climax of the last blockbusters released those last years, it seems to witness how much some of the last big movie productions are going down in every aspect. I was expecting a lot from the visual effects and, despite some extremely good shots, they weren't as interesting and well made as they could have been. Jurassic Park had one story to offer and it has certainly been told in the first movie, all of the following and especially this one are not more than a pale copy. Where those production used to be a wonderful playground for experimentation, technical breakthroughs, offering wonderful experiences to the audience inspiring a new generation of filmmakers, they now become flat and boring, lost in the shadow of their predecessors.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Isn't this a lesson they learned from the first movie?A few burning bugs take five minutes to set a swampy jungle ablaze.I just don't get the laser pointer that sics a dinosaur on somebody. This is a holdover from the last film I know... but you know what else points a laser at people? A rifle.Finally, in one of the laziest sequences of the film, let's just put some dinos down there in the tunnel. No explanation as to how they got in... but we need to off the main villain... so what'll it be....? Oh, how about.... Dilophosaurus. They killed Newman... so that's poetic, right?Is it fun? Eh, maybe. I know nobody expects this movie to be good, in say, a ""Mystic River"" sense. But I have to wonder, is a movie the like first JP even *possible* today? Can Hollywood still make an engrossing story with believable characters in real peril?

It was one of the first movies I ever got on DVD, and I've seen it over 100 times. The rest of the franchise has been enjoyable for the most part. I loved Jurassic Park 2 & 3 as a child, but looking back, they are a bit silly. I also enjoyed Jurassic World; it was fun and new. As a 10-year-old, I thought it was one of the best movies I had ever seen. I was disappointed but non the less entertained by Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. The most excited I had ever been for this franchise was when they announced the original cast would return to supporting roles. I thought there was no possible way to screw this up. I have to say there's no level to measure my disappointment.You have three award-winning Hollywood legends, and they feel so poorly written. We watched these same characters struggle through and grow during Jurassic Park. Speaking of poorly written, Owen and Claire have fallen off so hard as the films have gone on. They went from fun, intriguing characters to just meh. The uninteresting characters aren't even the worst part of the film. The worst part of the film has to be the locust plot. What's better than a Jurassic World film? A film that goes less on the Dinos and more on the Bugs said nobody ever. It was fun to see Doctor Wu featured in another role in this franchise, but why does it have to be bugs. I love the scenes with the Dinosaurs; there are a couple new ones, and I wish they spent more time on Dinos and less on the damn bugs. I almost included this on my list of worst films of the year. What kept me from that, you might ask, is Nostalgia. As much as I disliked it, I'll admit seeing the original cast back together for one last ride is what I always wished for. I just wished they had done it in a better way.5/10 A great franchise that has finally run its course.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In a World where one man's reckless ambition to build a supersized petting zoo has spawned countless hours of Animatronic and CGI snacking on human victims, mankind is forced to live side by side with deadly monsters...and I don't just mean drunk rednecks with guns (but there are those, too).So it's the 6th and (supposedly) final installment of the Jurassic Park feature film series. Probably the biggest challenge was finding new and interesting ways for these beasts to tear up unfortunate humans. Maybe that's why they didn't do that. Instead, we're treated to what amounts to a ""greatest hits"" recap of the previous 5 movies' wide selection of painful ways to become dino dental floss.The plot is completely implausible, totally predictable, and yet still manages to at least mildly entertain, largely because of some great performances by some new supporting characters. It's also helped along by a nice reunion of the original protagonists. There is one dud, though. Jeff Goldblum is back as the twitchy Dr. Malcolm, but his role has been relegated to spouting philosophical cliches, and he's been turned from the thoughtful conscience of the saga into the annoying kid in the back of the car who tells you you're speeding every 5 minutes.Once we spend the first hour of the film just getting the band back together, we briefly tour a planet where somehow dinosaurs have crossed oceans, taken over the skies, and multiplied to the point of being as common as cattle in the span of a single generation. That's a reproductive pace that would make even the US Supreme Court jealous.Every JP movie needs a villain, of course, and post-Spielberg's masterful first film we're not content anymore with it just being the biggest meat-eater. So the plot provides the obligatory mad-genius billionaire bent on using cataclysm to his own benefit, complete with a remote compound filled with other mad-genius cronies and the worst security since John Candy at Wally World.""Sorry, folks, evil hideout's closed. T-Rex out front should have told you.""
The mix of superfluous bad-guy tech, random Dino insertions and convenient push-button solutions makes the last half hour of the film feel like it was done completely on the fly.When even Starlord and the Grand Master can't save your movie, you know you've laid an egg.No doubt die-hard Jurassic fans will thoroughly enjoy it. It definitely delivers on the big scary lizard front, but anyone looking for more than just close-ups of gnashing teeth and probing reptilian eyes will likely feel a lot like Dr. Malcolm: ""Ooh, ahh, yeah, that's how it always starts; Then later there's the running and the screaming...but you stopped caring after the 1st act.""
Final thought: Yeah, we get it. Every actor in the film clearly spent hours learning how to pronounce Giganotosaurus. Well, congratulations.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now it does not stray from the storyline so so expect to see the same dino & human interactions, but it also cleans up and corrals! While many will disagree my rating is only one point seven stars higher than the average rating. Cheers to those who green-lighted this project as it deserved an honorable conclusion. As I'm a JP SUPER-FANATIC I won't say anything negative-I've seen the Live ""Walking with the Dinosaurs"" and was amazed more than my 9 year old godson-so it goes to say for me there is no such thing as a bad dinosaur movie. The actors played their parts well, were very diverse and the new or younger ones will make new movies-they are that good! JP:Dominion completes a story which took almost 30 years to tell! Thank you for doing just that - allowing the Jurassic Park movies to line up and gracefully bow as the curtain closes.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Really, it's just an excuse for some very excellent special effects all tied together with a story line so flimsy that it barely deserves to be called a plot. In fact, there doesn't seem to be one story line but about five different strands, none of which is satisfactorily explained, and which all together make for a confusing mess. As far as I could tell, it was something like: genetic modification, dinosaurs, evil company aiming for world domination, dinosaurs, some old characters from previous movies, dinosaurs, people running and being chased through forests, buildings, everywhere really, by dinosaurs, lucky escape at the end because two dinosaurs get distracted and fight each other. Did I mention dinosaurs? Them too!It's very lazy film-making. You'd have thought that by now film-makers would realize that special effects, no matter how good, aren't enough to carry a film. You need a good strong plot to hang the effects on. However, this lesson appears not to have been learned.However, I am happy to watch a film with my brain comfortably in neutral, and I did enjoy it for the silliness of it. But fans of the series (of which I used to be one) deserve better than this. My film-going companion fell asleep during the film, and decided firmly that it should be worth zero stars.The feel-good Disney-ish ending, which seemed to be lifted in spirit and style from the beginning of The Lion King, was so saccharine as to be almost nauseous.Basically, if you have a choice between this film and any other, choose the other.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Firstly, Laura Dern and Sam Neill are looking to expose the Biosyn Corporation who are trying to take over world food production and secondly a part of this evil goal is the kidnap by Biosyn of young Maisie Lockwood, who has a unique genetic makeup needed by the bad guys She is being cared for by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard who go in pursuit.A rather strange and to a large degree unsatisfying conclusion to the trilogy. It comes across for the most part as a sub standard James Bond type plot ie there's a Bond baddie with henchman and a plot for world control, a car chase, a plane crash and, albeit very professionally carried out, action sequences that just don't stop coming - ever. The only difference is, every scene features scary dinosaurs. The story is rather leaden with a ghastly script laying on the eco message with a trowel.On the plus side it's nice to see the original Jurassic Park cast, the action is well done as are the beasties, there are nods to Jurassic Park and the last 35 minutes are actually pretty exciting. Disappointing then but anyone whose seen the others will not want to miss this and will still probably enjoy most of it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Unfortunately this movie is not a vehicle for any of them. It's Just a way for the accountants to take advantage of everybody that loves this franchise. Doesn't mean the actors didn't work hard, but the film just don't do the job. What should be asked, is why? Why all the hard work? They've created one disaster of a movie that meanders, and meanders. Kind of like I'm doing right now. You'll probably watch this movie if you're a fan of the series no matter how bad it is. It's just highly unfortunate that for the last movie in the series they couldn't have spent all this money to do something spectacular, something new. Creativity is having a hard way finding life.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

For sure some are better than others but they all provide suspense, creativity and a storyline.Jurassic World Dominion however is not just a poor cousin to the above but one of the worst films I've ever seen.There's no real story line or development of characters, just a meaningless timeline of action moments, poor dialogue and increasingly bad effects. It's not suspenseful, interesting or even bearable at times.With the budget and cast this could have been an incredible movie. It would have taken someone to take responsibility and say ""THIS IS A BAD FILM"" to the executives and re write or amend the production. That's what fans, investors and everyone who put their time and effort into making the franchise a success over the years deserved.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In some parts, the acting even felt so terrible that it just felt like a gag. The dialogue was awful, the interaction between characters were worse, and it just felt like every other cliche script. Speaking of characters, we have our generic heroes, an awkward antagonist, a pointless middleman and a chracter who, for some reason, just walks around like she's a badass (who's incredibly strong by the way as you'll see in one scene) and acting cool as everything burns around her. Where is your sense of panic? But I don't blame her. There is no sense of danger in the entire movie. Remember that scene in Jurassic Park where the T. Rex first escapes the fence? That was 10 minutes of pure tension as we watched our vunerable characters struggle to find a way to hide from the beast. In this movie? There's a different type of dinosaur introduced every 5 minutes but the characters ""narrowly"" escape just as quickly. Its as if they wanted to fit as many dinosaurs as they can in the space of 2 hours. The writing was so abysmal it just felt like we were just following old characters doing one task to another without any great risks and Chris Pratt doing the hand thing. Also, spoiler alert, it obviously ends with a showdown with the poster boy and the apex predator, because it wouldn't be a Jurassic film without our main guy, T. Rex.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I had to watch the final instalment, despite the ongoing 'World' disappointments. I hoped Trevorrow would finally watch the original JP and pick apart what made it so thrilling and emotionally engaging. But, nope. It just gets worse.Having sat through Dominion, it is clear that Trevorrow's only take on a Jurassic Park movie is to throw as many dino scenes at the screen as possible with barely room to breathel. Narrative, dialogue, character development, sense and subtlety an afterthought. Like a 5 year old tipping a bucket of plastic dinosaurs on the floor and randomly, repeatedly smashing each one in your face while making up some loose story as to why it's happening. It's fun and interesting to start with, but all too quickly you could not be more sick of the seemingly endless whateversaurus reveal/chomp-chomp/runaway. 2 hours of the same scene / different dino repeated over and over and over with barely a sliver of story building.I find it incredulous to think how a big summer, big budget blockbuster about rampaging dinosaurs could be this long and boring. The last hour was painful and my brain was fully tuned out long before the finale, let alone all that extra padding stuffed on the end. Long after they'd pummelled our over-stuffed faces with endless servings of dinosaur, they served up a dessert of... dinosaur. Just one more spoonful. And another. And another. And another. Even when the awfully desperate dual storylines wrapped, the credits just wouldn't roll. ""We have MORE DINOSAURS!!"". The film wasn't even about dinosaurs in the first place! Not that there was even much of a story, but not one single dinosaur had any connection to the main narrative. Just a tissue paper thin story off the back of a director's need to rinse and repeat the same 'thrilling' scene over and over, and believe me this guy doesn't know how to craft a thrilling scene either. You see everything coming. Loud and noisy. Colin Trevorrow jumping on a couch shouting ""And you get a dinosaur, and you get a dinosaur, and you get a dinosaur"".I've not even mentioned the stupid caricatured baddies striding away from danger in dark glasses, or the way main characters repeatedly find or bump into each other over a 100 mile radius. And that painfully stupid velociraptor vs hand thing again and again. ""Hey... here's that stupid hand thing again"". How we all long for Blue to finally rip Chris Pratt's face off.I think after this rant, my phone is going to autocorrect every word to 'dinosaur' for a few weeks. I'm truly glad to think this is a last in the series, yet utterly disappointed that this is where we ended up.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

People are complaining about things that don't even make sense. Things that every Jurrassic Park movie has always done.Like having coincidences like the characters being in the right place at the right time. I remember being in the theater for Jurrassic park 2 with someone who laughed about that happening.Or one person complained about there being too many new dinosaurs and dinosaur attacks....well if you don't want to see new dinosaurs and more dinosaur attacks, why are you watching another Jurrassic park movie?Then there's the complaint that certain little details aren't realistic. Are you freaking kidding me...it's a sci fi/fantasy film about dinosaurs existing alongside humans....including one GMO dinosaur....and you are going to focus in on little details that aren't realistic? If you want to watch a realistic movie, you have chosen the wrong genre entirely.And then there's the complaint that the story isn't good. Um, what movie were you watching? Because there's very little wrong with the story. It builds upon all of the previous movies just like a good story should. It deals with modern issues and is more relevant to our real world than any of the others have been. It has so many good plot points and story elements. It has a lot of throwbacks to the first one, as well as some very new additions. And it is obvious to me that the people complaining about this story don't know anything about writing and story telling. And it's really just that they don't like the movie.But there's really little wrong with the film making either. Again, nothing that hasn't been wrong with some of the other films. They put a lot of work into making this movie. It looks fantastic. And I think the main reason people are complaining so much is not because of things that are wrong with the film. But because they already stopped being fans of the franchise and at this point it can't do anything right.Because there have been Jurrassic Park films before this that were not very good. And it has been a long time, and it does seem that these people leaving negative reviews are just disgrunted ex fans who are sick of it. And so if you are watching a movie that is over 2 hours long and you are really just sick of the franchise and watching it because you are bored and have nothing else to do (and probably have a bad attitude because of that), that would explain the negative reviews.But it also seems to me that with all the throwbacks to the first film, that anyone who loved the first one should also love this one. So maybe a lot of these people just don't like the genre or this type of movie.However if you are looking for a movie about dinosaurs living alongside humans, and are looking to have fun and don't want something that is serious and based in reality, but is just good cinematic entertainment, and you enjoyed the first film, there's a good chance you will like this one. Don't expect it to fix a bad attitude or anything. If you are the type of person who needs to complain about every little thing, well maybe instead of sitting around judging other peoples work you should get off your ass and try making a movie yourself so you can see how much work it actually is and gain a better appreciation of the art of film and how much actually goes into them. Because as a videographer myself, I tend to appreciate film a lot more because I have an understanding of these things that most people don't. And I find it ridiculous when I hear people complaining like this, in ways that make no sense and show that they don't know jack about film and are probably just a negative and pathetic excuse for a human being who entertains themselves by watching movies they aren't really into and then complaining about them.In my honest opinion, this film is the second best in the series next to the first one. There was so much about it that I loved. So much that they did right that I thought was absolute pure gold. So many amazing movie moments that made me want to just applaud them. It's a travesty that all of these internet trolls who probably couldn't even properly frame a shot aren't being fair to it. But I guess thats just how people are these days.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, all that they have for us is a reheated stew of everything from the previous films, minus any kind of intelligent or interesting plot.I used ""porn"" very deliberately in the title of this review, as the film reminds me of the days when x-rated movies thought that they needed to have some kind of ""plot"" as connective tissue between the action scenes that people were coming (err, sorry) for, but only put the minimum of thought and effort into them.The structure of this movie is much the same, stretches of boring ""plot"" with awkward coincidences and improbable events driving the action forward when the writers are too lazy to come up with something plausible, followed by the same old obligatory ""action""... main characters gazing in wonder at dinosaurs. Dinosaurs causing havoc. Main characters stalked and threatened by dinosaurs, but always managing to escape, however improbably. Main characters in vehicles dangling on the edge of a deadly plunge, being threatened by dinosaurs. Bad guys and random extras getting eaten by dinosaurs. Jeff Goldblum there to cynically comment on it all and say ""I told you so"". Yawn.(OK, I still enjoyed the Jeff Goldblum stuff, we all have our kinks...). And really, you're going to (repeatedly?!?) bring back Chris Pratt controlling dinosaurs with only an upraised palm? (facepalm)
I guess they thought that by making it bigger, longer, and louder, they were making it better, but all they did was give us more time to contemplate how pointless the whole exercise was.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's proved extremely difficult for the filmmakers to replicate the magic of those original characters, as seen with Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Scream, etc. Jurassic World Dominion is no different as it clearly had its hands full trying to tie in the original trilogy characters with the storyline of Owen and Claire. The computer generated dinosaurs were nonetheless pretty incredibly animated, and the constant action kept the movie moving at a decent pace. But the acting was bland from both the legacy characters as well as the newcomers, and the constant callbacks grew tedious. Maybe instead of constructing one overlong, convoluted final chapter in the Jurassic Park franchise, it would've functioned better as a two part conclusion.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Of the two storylines, only the one with the legacy characters has any momentum to it and that's because the legacy characters are ten times more interesting than the ""Jurassic World"" characters. Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill and Laura Dern bring their A game to a barely B movie subplot that did not deserve their efforts. While Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard look bored with the sad James Bond rip off storyline they had to work with. Only DeWanda Wise manages to bring her A game to this silly espionage storyline and she does more with her small role than ether Pratt or Howard. The special effects are a bit too CGI for its own good and the climax manages to rip off the climax of the first ""Jurassic World"" movie.While I don't consider this the worst Jurassic film of the series (That distinction still belongs to the cinematic black hole called ""Jurassic Park 3"" in my opinion) it's the most disappointing.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I does a great job - great acting, great script, great action scenes, great pacing. The movie provides compelling reasons for each of the characters to want to be involved.

I don't know if it was the whole Covid thing that messed this up but it seems the writing has a lot to do with the problem. Lack of writing is probably a better way to put it. Filming stopped for a while if I'm not mistaken. It seems that would have been a great time to rework what you think won't work. They had ample time to do so but for some reason they felt like what they had was working.Oversized locusts? What is that all about? Why are they on fire and still able to fly around long enough to burn everything down?It was nice to see the original tyrannosaurus sort of take back it's reign as the biggest and baddest dinosaur. Unfortunately she couldn't do so without the help of a giant big bird looking dino with Freddy Kruger looking fingers.This movie is just weird with the locusts, the Freddy Kruger, the ice fishing raptor and the worst ever antagonist to top it all off. And now after five films Dr Wu suddenly gets the madness and has a change of heart? Cheesy, all of it.Last but not least. Where are all the dinosaurs in this movie? They barely have any screen time. This is a movie about dinosaurs so again I'll quote Ian from the first movie ""eventually you will have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour?""
Apparently they answered that with a big ""nope!""","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Also I haven't slept in over 10 hours so let's make this quick.This is the worst film in the Jurassic franchise, it is trash, it is garbage, it is a dumpster fire. Terrible writing, terrible dialogue that will leave you shaking your head. No one, and I mean no one could've saved this film it was doomed from conception. I love Michael Giacchino but holy crap was this score horrible it did nothing to elevate what was happening on screen but then you don't care enough anyway so how can it. This film is two hours, and twenty six minutes long, and I felt every minute. It's also two hours, and twenty six minutes too long.This film is also wrongly titled ""Jurassic World Dominion"" ""Dominion"" implies these dinosaurs would be occupying the Earth almost similar to Planet of the Apes. Yet instead of dinosaurs ruling the Earth we are treated to a dull, boring story about the environment, and how we are destroying the environment. Typical of Hollywood to peddle this liberal trash! Not only does this film suffer from a bad title but also it's tone, it's all over the place. This film doesn't know what it wants to be.There's no redeeming factors here, the original characters add nothing except to fuel ticket sales. Also for the return of Dodgson well Wayne Knight said it best in Jurassic Park ""Dodgson we got Dogson here"" and nobody cares. Apparently all the main characters have a super power that stops dinosaur attacks by just rasing their hand, like what the hell kind of plot armor bull is that. This film is The Rise of Skywalker to the Jurassic franchise, the only good here is that it's finally over. Ever since the original Jurassic Park this franchise has gone down hill.I expected trash yet somehow they've still managed to disappoint. With this film they've done the impossible I'd rather watch Fallen Kingdom. Normally I would always encourage others to watch, and judge for yourself but I can't do that. Save yourself, save your money, and save your time. Instead watch Top Gun: Maverick in theaters or literally anything else.IMDb: 1/10

A. Bayona, Dominion is a big film in more ways than one and has the tricky task of balancing numerous plot lines with an abundance of characters that have to intermingle the old with the new and its a balancing act Trevorrow never comes to grips with as the film he produces weaves in and out of various states, ranging from the boring, the ridiculous and the entertaining.Moving away from the island setting that has been a staple of the series across previous entries, allowing the whole globe to play a part in this dino-lead chaos opens up a lot of potential doors in a narrative sense but for the most part Dominion unfortunately gives out short straws for its prehistoric critters with the tiresome humans and even bizarrely gigantic locusts hogging far too much of the screen-time, even if the mostly brief and well staged dinosaur moments showcase where the film could've become far more memorable overall if it had chosen to shy away from trying to create too many emotional/witty interactions with its humans.In amongst this loud, brash and totally bonkers film, that see's our team of do-gooders head to Italy to stop some nefarious genetic experiments while battling an as to be expected dinosaur outbreak in a remote facility is a loaded cast of series staples but while the appearance of Neill, Goldblum and Dern is enjoyable there's a feeling that Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard walk away with the best moments in the film, even if Pratt feels more as though his going through the motions here, far removed from his energetic first turn as Owen Grady way back in 2015.At days end its hard to exactly know how long-term fans of the Jurassic series are going to feel about this expensive and instantly forgettable outing, on one hand it gives them another chance to see those they know and loved in action once more but you can't help escape the feeling that there was a far better way to utilise their presence than what is done here and after this next generation of Jurassic action was started out solidly in 2015, in 2022 we culminate this period with a whimper not a bang, making this a rather sorry finale to a property with more downs than ups.Final Say -Not a complete dumpster fire but not the fitting return of past characters or finale one might've hoped for, Jurassic World Dominion does a few things right but with too much time dedicated to its humans not its creatures and an overall sense of mundanity, this blockbuster is unlikely to create much of a stir now or into the future.2 1/2 coathangered dinosaurs out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","8 out of 22 found this helpful.

I was twelve when Spielberg's 1993 original came in theaters, and obviously it was one of the most phenomenal things I had seen until then. Since, I've seen the original landmark numerous times, but also the immediate sequels and the revival films are repeatedly watched favorites. I never reviewed an installment in the ""Jurassic Park/World"" series because they are mainstream movies, and everything that can be written about them - either positive or negative -has already been written. Straight after watching the last (and hopefully final) entry in the franchise, I did feel the urge to write off some frustration, as this was a disappointment I won't easily recover from.Personally, I think it would have been perfectly fine if the saga ended with the climax of ""Fallen Kingdom"". The dinosaurs have been set free, unleashed upon the world, and humans and dinosaurs as well as regular animals are forced coexist. Period. Whatever happens after that should have been left to the imagination.But of course, they didn't stop! Co-writer/director Colin Treverrow absolutely wanted to complete his own trilogy, and by doing so comes up with one of the most preposterous, cliché-packed, and tiresome scenarios of the 21st century thus far. Evidently there's yet another multinational corporation (BioSyn, I believe it's called this time) running amok and kidnapping both the cloned girl and the super-intelligent Raptor for their unique DNAs, but this company also created a humongous and ravenous species of prehistoric locusts for some reason. This sub plot brings back Laura Dern and Sam Neill, but it's too ridiculous for words, and unfit for the franchise.Absolutely nothing in ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" looks or feels authentic, passionate, plausible, or even entertaining. Admittedly, it started out promisingly, with the typically human abusive behavior and desire to exploit whatever Mother Nature has created. There's illegal breeding (and crossbreeding) between different species of dinosaurs for commercial purposes, underground fighting/gambling activities, etc. As soon as the locusts pop up, however, the whole thing turns into a lousy B-movie. The stars of the previous two films, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, are pretty much downgraded to the supportive cast (particularly Bryce), and the original stars, Laura Dern and Sam Neill, do not seem the least bit interested in anything except for their paycheck. What a sad, sad conclusion...","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Its totally generic work with childish dialog and plot. Every scene turned cringy the second someone opened their mouth or when they did anything. It wasnt the acting. Actually the acting was down right average but nothing was going to save the plot or scenes which were poorly thought through, assuming anyone thought about them at all... im sort of wondering if the movie was written by some sort of early stage neanderthal level algorithm.On the upside, the movie looks great. The dinos are good and the jungle island was cool. If they just stopped talking it might have actually been ok... Actually I think the movie would have been 100x better if they put talking collars on the dinosaurs and just had them speak instead.

I love the original movie for its atmosphere, the fascinating dinosaurs, the scary scenes and the immersive story. After a few so-so sequels, Jurassic World did a great job of capturing what made JP so wonderful for me.I guess I'm liking the wrong things about the Jurassic franchise, because the newer movies focus on totally different things. Compared to JP and JW, Jurassic World Dominion feels more like an action movie that happens to have dinosaurs and recurring characters in it.It goes from dino attack to dino chase, to dino battle, to dino attack, etc. Hardly ever does the movie build up tension, let the characters grow friendships, or take the time to tell a nice story.If you like seeing lots of different dinosaurs in different action scenes, you'll probably love this movie. If you were hoping for something with that Jurassic Park vibe, this might not be it. And no, not even the original cast and some Easter eggs can do the trick.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Dominion may be a little better, but not by much, and I was a little disappointed in the end.I know a lot of more serious film fans weren't really hopeful for this, but I was cautiously optimistic it was going to be good. The last instalment ended with a good set-up for a sequel (dinosaurs roaming free in the human world) and it was good to hear that the first movie's trio of main characters were returning. Also, Jurassic World (2015) I remember being fun, and Dominion has the same director, so things were shaping up decently.The film doesn't come close to achieving its full potential, but I don't think it completely squanders it either. I think there are fun scenes and some good ideas that aren't fully realised. Unsurprisingly, it's at its best when it makes use of the whole dinosaurs running free in the real world. All the action at the halfway point was so stupid but also really entertaining- car chases, parkour, gunfights, and hand-to-hand fights, all including dinosaurs. It kind of felt like The Bourne Identity but with dinosaurs for a bit there, and if it had more stupid and entertaining stuff like that, I would've been happy.But the whole finale ends up taking place in yet another closed off facility, and mostly in the dark, so they can hide some of the imperfect special effects in the shadows (and felt like the effects here were weirdly inconsistent). There's fun to be had with Neill, Dern, and Goldblum returning. They're not squandered or just there as cameos, but like the other good things here, they're not used as well as they could have been.I can't deny most of the dinosaur scenes were fun. There was some silly action and goofy set pieces that were entertaining. It wasn't a boring movie, but it was a messy one, with three or four different storylines all jammed into one movie, and just not enough done with the premise of dinosaurs and humans having to co-exist. It's overall disappointing, but if you have a soft spot for dinosaurs or big monster movies like me, it's not a completely irredeemable disaster.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

It stinks and it's nasty. The dinosaurs don't need to be brought back to life, but good cinema sure does. I genuinely felt embarrassment watching the movie. To think they are handed millions of dollars to make a blockbuster and this is what they came up with? I should have just gone and seen Maverick again and left the dinosaurs dead and buried. Hollywood preyed on our nostalgia and click baited us with high hopes with the old cast returning. Some things are best left in the past.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Best dinosaur movie in 20 years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8215547/?ref_=tt_urv","korialfox","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur60955914/?ref_=tt_urv","7 June 2022","Jurassic World Dominion, unlike many other sequels in this saga, accomplishes what it set out to do. For casual viewers it has enough action, moments of wonder -that seemed to be missing in this franchise for the longest time- and enough plain fun. For the fans of the Jurassic movies it's a nostalgic joyride from start to finish.Pros:+ It's 6th movie in a franchise that manages not to feel dull and dumb.+ Gone are the stupid moments of dinosaurs swallowing ringing cell phones, escape from dinosaur on high heels or dinosaurs smiling.+ The plot, unlike in many of it's predecessors, actually makes more sense from scientific standpoint. It's still an action sci-fi horror monster movie, but it is consistent to the saga's mythos and characters.+ Features more dinosaurs than all of the other movies combined, and the new ones are different and exciting.+ The different locations of this movie from the previous tropical islands makes it stand out visually.+ Fixes some of the plot holes of the saga, explains some character motivations and quickly resolves idiotic plotlines from the previous movie.+ The script is very tight, I was amazed how they managed to fit everything into the runtime. Ending is not overdone like in the previous four movies and it is more impactful.+ Stupid dialogue is pretty much gone, caricatures of human beings are not present. Some characters are fixed to be much better this time around. Some dialogue is surprisingly great. Fun jokes.+ Some brilliant camerawork throughout, great effects, brilliant visuals.+ The story weaves it's many protagonists through the plot and puts them all together for the grand finale in a believable way.+ Great star power, the original cast elevates this movie and it's just a mystery to me why it took 29 years to put them in a movie together again.+ Brains and fan moments throughout the movie that many of the sequels lacked.Cons:I don't think anybody expected a genre defying experience like Jurassic Park brought in 1993. It definitely shows though that some of the ideas from the original are brought up here: Cloning, impact on humanity, mixing of species. While every other sequel after that mainly served to be a fun summer blockbuster, this movie surprised me in delving slightly back into these ideas from the original. Since then, there always was some dumb moment in each of the sequels that made me cringe: The entire San Diego sequence from the second movie, the terrible second half of the third movie, the stupidity of the fourth movie that among other things suggested dinosaurs have human-like IQ and the entire fifth movie, that seems mostly like a parody. Jurassic World Dominion is fun, almost entirely absent of these moments and has enough for you to enjoy it, especially if you are a fan of the original. 8/10.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

The story is needlessly convoluted, sidelining the dinosaurs (and their release) for a mediocre corporate scheme. There are multiple narratives that don't intertwine until the third act. Jokes misfire, plot points are convenient, and motivations are flimsy. Action sequences are messy and unrealistic, defusing their suspense. There are cheesy one-liners, lame fan service attempts, and inept villains. Still, the biggest issue is the missing protagonist or theme. Dominion is overstuffed, with no primary message. Plus, the actors are dull, especially Pratt. Only Goldblum is any fun. Overall, Dominion is emotionally draining and cluttered.Technically, Dominion is inconsistent. There are abundant animatronics, but the CGI is occasionally goofy. Reuniting the original cast is impressive, but less charming when they're past their primes. The cinematography uses decent lighting, angles, and extended shots. However, the sound coasts off of the originals without adding anything new. There is generic music, impersonal production design, and scattered direction. Tonally, Dominion attempts everything and lands very little. Lastly, the editing is bloated, boring, and unfocused. The film never gains momentum and feels like a chore. Whether it's excessive exposition, contrived drama, or numbing action, Dominion isn't engaging.Writing: 2/10

I just switched off my brain and just had fun with friends and then, and only then, was this movie a solid action movie. But if I switched on my brain and I would've thought a little about the story, ouch, it would've hurt so much. If you really care about this franchise and you want to appreciate the legacy of the first Jurassic Park, it's a painful experience, and that's completely sad to think about it when we are forced to treat blockbusters like this. But when you turn off your brain, it's fine. This movie isn't garbage, it has some beautiful scenery and one scene with water is awesome, but overall, it's bland as hell. I played a game while watching this movie. This game is about this: you watch some scenes and you are thinking about how much better you would film certain moments. So much fun. So I was entertained all throughout the movie, yet it should've been shorter, 147 minutes is a lot to take in when the movie is this mediocre.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It attempts to exploit the nostalgia of the original characters and it fails miserably at every level. The action, the editing, the direction, it's all terrible. The movie has no focus, too many characters that have nothing to do and nothing to do with each other. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is they did use plenty of ""real"" props for some of the dinosaurs, so it's not like the actors are always looking at a green screen. However, everyone just feels kind of disconnected from the movie. Like everyone involved knew the script was trash and the movie would just be a cash grab.Overall, it was the worst installment in Jurassic Park/ World franchise.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I must add you don'thave to have seen all theses films in the cannon ;Jurassic World: Dominion stands on it own with tremendous Creature Feature effects . The movie's visual effects and other technical elements are high-quality, with excellent sound design and another on-point soundtrack that incorporates John Williams' original theme.Four years after the destruction of Isla Nublar, dinosaurs now live and hunt alongside humans all over the world. This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history's most fearsome creatures.It was an extremely fun summer Block Buster 165 million dollar budget with very high production value leading edge CGI FX with top notch animatronics (thank you Jaws and E. T. for pioneering !). The dinosaurs/prehistoric creatures/flying reptiles were the stars . Dominion has some great creature feature moments. The story unites Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) from the newer films with scientists Dr. Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Grant (Sam Neill), and Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) from the original movies. Together they must fight the villainous CEO of an international genetics/agricultural corporation who's lying about how the company uses dinosaur DNA. Expect plenty of jump scares, human-eating dinosaurs, and epic predator-on-predator fights with generous nostalgic nods all over the place. The original trio of actors who made the original Jurassic Park memorable, Dern, Neill, and Goldblum add much gravitas to Jurassic World Dominion, portraying characters who are committed to saving the world with generous nostalgic nods all over the place. This is a fun and exciting finale to the JP franchise. I can not wait to own this one on Blu-ray.","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

The dialogues are terrible and the cast is composed by unable people: the young cast doesn't have an objective, the girl is unbearable, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are boring and not credible. About the old cast, they don't know why and how they are finished in this movie. They act like they don't care about the movie, above all Sam Neill!The villain is one of the worst character that I have ever seen and there isn't a final: there isn't a conclusion about the characters that have representated this trilogy and not.In conclusion, I think that this is one of the worst movie of 2022 and the worst movie of the jurassic saga.

I was emotionally attached to the first series and as well loved the new ones, i.e. Jurassic world which was fabulous & JW: fallen kingdom was 7/10 i'd say. So when this movie ended, I got really emotional as this was probably the last time we'd get to see the old cast together and tbh they really tried their best to save this movie. I had tears in my eyes and I felt sad even more because this movie was so bad. I never expected this to be this bad, i thought of it to be at least be better than fallen kingdom. I felt a lot of scenes were cut (very easy to observe because of poor editing)and that's the main reason we didn't get to experience the entire thing. Audiences near me were clapping and cheering at each and every moment of the last 15 minutes, but i was sitting quiet and in disbelief on how this movie was given a go with such poor editing and a bad story. This was totally unacceptable and I felt so bad. I really hope that they will release an extended version or a director cut later on. I felt good about the fact that at least 60% of the regular audience in my theatre happened to enjoy this one, they didn't seem to be a fan of the series or something, but they loved watching dinosaurs and they cheered on all the good scenes( which in my eyes weren't that good because they made the dinosaurs look dumb and slow in this movie), so I'm happy that at least not everyone was in the same boat as me. This movie deserved so much more!! I wish I could've been on the happy side. :(","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

There's an overdose of nostalgia and good visuals to be had and many fun nods to to the original. Sam Neill and Laura Dern also make their long awaited (and welcome) return to the franchise and the chemistry they share is nice, it's as if no time has passed at all since Jurassic Park.However, their return serves only to remind us why this sixth instalment has absolutely nothing on the original Spielberg classic. Simply put, the chemistry shared between Neill, Dern and Jeff Goldblum is not nearly enough to distract from Dominion's awfully dumb story, truly naff dialogue (""I promise I'm gonna get her back!"") and the noticeably bored performances of Pratt and Dallas Howard.In fact, unlike the original Jurassic Park, this is a lot more bore than awe. The action totally jumps the raptor, too, with the lowest stakes possible. You just know Owen Toretto and the gang are going to survive each and every dinosaur encounter which totally devours any tension. There's no horror, barely any excitement of any kind.I really wanted to like this but as a legacy sequel, Top Gun: Maverick this is not. Couple all of the above with a runtime as long as the Cretaceous period itself and you get a rather disappointing end to the World trilogy and the Jurassic franchise as a whole.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

And then in 1993, director Steven Spielberg turned it into a genuinely great and scary sci-fi/suspense thriller. Thus was born JURASSIC PARK. Two sequels-1997's THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (directed by Spielberg), and 2001's JURASSIC PARK 3 (directed by Joe Johnston)-came about, followed by a fourteen-year break. Then in 2015, with Spielberg serving as executive producer but not directing, there came JURASSIC WORLD, directed by Colin Treverrow, followed in 2018 by JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM (directed by J. A. Bayona) in 2018. And in 2022, we have come to what is likely the conclusion of this mega-successful dinosaur franchise, in the form of JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION, with Trevorrow back in the director's chair.At the end of JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM, a combination of an exploding volcano on Isla Nublar and the usual corporate avarice had allowed the dinosaurs and all manner of genetically engineered prehistoric creatures to break free. As JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION stars, therefore, humans and dinosaurs (and their offspring, needless to say) are co-existing together, with extremely chaotic results, including a plague of what are basically dino-locusts wiping out the world's grain supply. Dern and Neill return as the intrepid pair of paleontologists Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant to find out that those locusts are being fueled via a genetically-modified seed invented by the Biosyn corporation, run by one Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott), who seems very much a Steve Jobs type, but with megalomaniacal ambitions that could spell humanity's downfall. Pratt (as Owen Grady) and Howard (as Claire Dearing) are back to join in the race to stop Scott dead in his tracks; and they have a secret weapon of sorts in their adapted daughter (Sermon), who, in an interesting twist of a back story, is the granddaughter of John Hammond, the man responsible for this unleashing of genetic dinosaurs in the first place, and who also has a few dino genes inside her DNA as well. All of them converge at Biosyn's isolated mountain facility in northern Italy where, along with famous chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Goldblum), whom Scott has basically bribed up to this point, confront Scott and his off-the-wall ambitions; and what ensues is, of course, hair-raising dinosaur terror on an industrial, if not indeed downright apocalyptic scale.With a length of close to two and a half hours, JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION is obviously the longest of the entire six-film franchise, and, without too much doubt, in many places the most off-the-wall entry as well, mostly due to Scott's kidnapping plot involving Sermon, which contains chases on motorbikes, vans, and planes that wouldn't be out of place in any James Bond film, but arguably are here. As with the previous three films of the Jurassic Park/Jurassic World franchise, Spielberg functions as an executive producer only (having gotten himself in two major directorial undertakings of his own, WEST SIDE STORY and THE FABELMANS), so it is up to Trevorrow to come up with something huge. And this is indeed what happens in JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION. The dinosaurs, particularly the locusts, are more ferocious than they have ever been before, ensuring that the franchise end (if indeed it does end here) on an almost end-of-the-world scale. But to Trevorrow's credit, probably with Spielberg's encouragement, he had the good sense to bring Dern, Neill, and Goldblum back from the original 1993 classic, and combine them with Pratt and Howard, who are (thankfully) no longer a bickering couple as they were in the first two JURASSIC WORLD films, but responsible dinosaur behavioral experts also looking out for Sermon's welfare amidst all the violent, screaming dinosaur terror.Trevorrow is obviously not the subtlest of directors to begin with (sometimes, even Spielberg isn't either {witness ""1941""]), but when it comes to JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION, he delivers the goods without turning towards the way-over-the-top implausibilities of a Michael Bay (the infernal ""Transformers"" series) or Roland Emmerich (his admittedly good 2009 end-of-the-world opus ""2012""); and the six principal actors of the franchise keep much of everything else on an even keel.If this is indeed the end of this dinosaur franchise, it is one hell of a way to go out on.

What used to be dinosaur fun has turned into a boring rescue mission that has a bigger focus on the boring characters instead of the dinosaurs. The writing is lazy and convoluted and the performances are bland and boring. Chris Pratt's usual charm is next to gone, and his charisma just doesn't land like it has done before in previous projects, which might be a consequence of the writing or the performance.Going into the movie I thought it would be about how humans had to adapt to living among dinosaurs, but nope. It completely throws that out the window, instead focusing on a rescue mission and DNA separation in humans. It ultimately feels like two separate movies put together and it still doesn't manage to make an impression with so much material at hand.The dialogue is pretty lackluster and the only real redeeming thing is when the dinosaurs and the returning characters from the original. I must admit though, Jeff Goldblum did put a smile on my face each time he was on screen. He always had a quirky line, fun punk or joke and they landed pretty well.This is the end to the saga, which is definitely for the better as the formula and magic of the park movies has sadly run out, where every entry becomes worse and feels more like a cash grab than trying to create a good blockbuster.3/10.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

They should have stopped at Jurassic park 1 and called it a day. Ruining its legacy with FIVE unwanted sequels is so sad to see. I used to love the original as a kid and watching it become a bland action movie is unbearable. The movie itself isn't offensive in any way, it's doing its job, pleasing 8 year olds with more dinosaur action. No characters except Jeff goldbloom's were exciting to watch and no story beats or plot lines were fun enough to get a single cheer or laugh out of me. Don't watch this movie and give them a reason to reboot it yet again.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

A couple of chase sequences were done really well, gripping stuff, but that's all the good I can say about this as the rest of the movie was boring rehash and uninspiring.Also, in 2022 the special effects were a let down as most dinosaurs looked clayish and lifeless.

Well which is it, do we need to suffer or will you let humans do what humans do and that is to adapt their progress.Then we have the DEI nonsense that was layed on so think you would be hard pressed to know it wasn't an advert for the US military.Here's a news flash, you don't need to emasculate men to have strong female roles, it comes across as farcical and cringe.Overall I just found the film annoying, far to long and boring, offensive to both life and the original storyline and sums up just about everything that is wrong with the movie industry.How pleased am I that I didn't actually have to pay for this film other than the time I will sadly never get back.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

With the technology of the day, Jurassic Park's dinosaurs and background design were done with minimal computer use and the dinosaurs were physically designed. But by the time Jurassic World came around, the films had been created in 3D and highly realistic using full computer technology. But Jurassic World Dominion has failed to create realistically with the high use of technology as expected by the audience. It was created in the same mine that previously created Jurassic Park. Accordingly, the realism of the dinosaurs was very low and there were many inconsistencies (many contradictory, illogical premises in there) in the plot. Watched because of the love of the series, it can be considered as a fail movie when taken as a separate movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The end scene - i was expecting an epic battle. But, no, it lasted seconds and again, the characters were just stood around watching.The way Fallen Kingdom ended, i assumed this movie would be set in human populated areas, and have to either round up all of the dinosaurs or find a way to live among them. No.It felt like it was made just to squeeze as many different dinosaurs into it as possible.Plus, they need to stop with the silly raptor story line. It was really unnecessary. Risking their lives for a plastic looking baby dinosaur, because he made a promise....... to a DINOSAUR.The CGI was amazing.

On the other hand, many a movie that have been dissed over the years have gained favor from repeat viewers.I watched this movie again on video and actually liked it a lot better the third time around. Reading the reviews here, clearly there was great disappointment. But a scene in I believe the first Jurassic World could be applied to this series and particularly this movie. In that film, the need to create new dinosaurs is because people felt what was already out there was no more exciting than going to a standard zoo.The question is: What would you have had the movie been about that would repress the criticism of ""same old thing""? I have been a big Jurassic fan since the beginning and I cannot imagine a story line that hasn't been done that would create new excitement unless you enter the realm of the absurd. In other words, there is a limit to how creative these movies can be given the subject.Certainly dinosaurs integrating with the general animal and human populations could have been explore further, but how much can you keep doing with that?So the second viewing I appreciated the subtle differences in the story line and interactions of the characters. For those who claim there is no plot, there certainly is one if these folks actually watched the movie (which I often doubt).I don't know if there will be yet another movie, but the wrap-up of the characters was nice.I suppose we have gotten used to the CGI generated dinosaurs but one must be in awe of the genius that was able to create something so lifelike and believable, especially the new ones introduced in this installmentIn my previous review, I said this movie may not be my favorite but certainly I enjoyed it better than Jurassic Park III. But actually it has risen in the ranks of Jurassic movies, not sure where but I actually do like it.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

"5","/10","As Dumb as Jurassic Park 3 but Thinks It's as Smart as the First Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8308338/?ref_=tt_urv","mitchell5954","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur42936359/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2022","Jurassic World Dominion is the last film of the Jurassic World Trilogy. Hopefully this will be the last Jurassic Park movie ever, but that's highly doubtful. This franchise is pretty much just like the Transformers movies at this point. They get longer and dumber with each installment, and yet still make tons of money. Now, I haven't liked any of the previous Jurassic World movies. The first one was a dumbed down version of the original film. Fallen Kingdom was a braindead version of the Lost World. FallenKingdom was just awful, the worst Jurassic Park movie yet. I can see people enjoying the first Jurassic World on a mindless Sci-Fi action movie level, but I cannot see hardly any appeal in Fallen Kingdom other than some good effects. I didn't even bother to see that one in the theater.It's sad to see this franchise fall so far, because the original Jurassic Park is one of my all-time favorite movies. The Lost World, in my opinion, is a criminally underrated sequel. Jurassic Park 3 is admittedly a guilty pleasure. It's not a good movie, but I can enjoy it as a fun B-movie. I wanted to enjoy these Jurassic World films on that same level, but they're just so pretentious, and their priorities are really out-of-whack.Despite all of that, I was moderately excited for this move. Part of it was the return of the original cast. Another reason was that this movie was finally doing something I've wanted to see in a Jurassic Park movie since the Lost World, which is dinosaurs interacting with the modern world. Lost World had teased that in its final act, but this movie was seemingly going all the way with it finally. Dominion I will say is probably my favorite of these movies due to the novelty of seeing the original cast back together and interacting with the new cast. The effects are easily the best out of these JW films. Plus, the final climax is fun in a dumb popcorn movie way. With that said, this is still not that good. Objectively speaking, I'd say this is on par with JP 3 though I enjoy the latter more.The reason for that being that JP 3 knew how stupid it was and ran with it. It was short, to the point, and it knew what fans wanted to see and that's dinosaur action. These Jurassic World movies, this one in particular, does not seem to grasp that. It tries to tackle the same themes the first two movies did, ""man tampering with nature"" and animal rights. However, those themes were already explored and one right in those films. Those storylines are played out. They also focus too much on the human characters that, outside of the original cast, just aren't that interesting or even fun aside from maybe Chris Pratt. The main conflict of Dominion that our characters are trying to combat has really nothing to do with dinosaurs. This film promised us dinosaurs in the modern world, and we get that, sort of. The first fifteen minutes of the film gives that, and there is a fun dinosaur chase in a city in the middle. However, most of the movie, once again, takes place in one isolated location. The film is too long as well. The other JW films were two hours while this is two and a half, and it isn't needed at all.Overall, if you want to see the main cast reunited in a JP movie with some decent dinosaur action then by all mean check this out. If you liked the previous JW films, you should enjoy this okay. Unfortunately, this JW trilogy for me has been a letdown. In a lot of ways this feels like the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The first two installments are lesser versions of the original JP and the Lost World. This movie, while is doing something different for once, is still overly long, relies too heavily on nostalgia, and doesn't quite understand what fans want from Jurassic Park.With that being said, at least these movies don't kill off the original cast in stupid ways and have them never be on screen together. In fact, this film actually fixes a mistake made in Jurassic Park 3 regarding Grant and Sattler's characters, and I appreciate that. Because of that, these JW are as offensive to me as the sequel trilogy is or something like Independence Day Resurgence was. I just feel these JW movies could have been so much better than they were. If the focused on the dinosaur action more and didn't try to act smarter than they really are, then these could have been really fun times a t the movies, and that's all I really want at this point.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

A truly nonsensical plot that is not even entertaining. Just throws a bunch of actors from the original with the latest ""diverse"" cast and have dinos running amok in urban settings.

Can you blame me? The people behind the Jurassic World franchise (that includes you as well mister Spielberg) showcase a continued and epic misunderstanding of Jurassic Park's strengths. After Fallen Kingdom focused on the dumbest plotpoint of Jurassic World, Dominion makes the same mistake and smears the stupidest plotpoint of Fallen Kingdom over an entire film. Oh and it ads locusts... Yes, locusts.The best parts of this film are the moments without dialogue reminding you there's an insulting plot you don't care about. The dinosaurs look fantastic and are the true strengths of this film. Scenes of terror and wonder elevate the flick above detestable. Yet the film does its best to make us forget about the creatures we showed up for! It instead throws in yet another bioengineering company with at its head a character who was called irrelevant in the first film! ""Dodgson! We got Dodgson here! See, nobody cares."" Well said Nedry and 29 years later, we still don't care.Even if you're a fan of this new lane of Jurassic films, the film shows little respect for its audience. Blue is barely in the film. Don't get me started on Rexy. Hell, even the newly hyped up Apex predator has zero to no relevance to the core of the plot! Say what you will but the Spinosaurus in JP3 was at least essential to the plot! Remember when Jurassic films were about dinosaurs? Well screw you because now they're about locusts and human clones... Enjoy.Jurassic World Dominion is Ian Malcolm's iconic rant personified. It should'nt excist and has forgotten its genius predecessors on who's shoulders it's standing on. An admittedly fantastic ending can't save this massive locust plague sized disappointment. Please, as a fan of this franchise... Stop making these films. You've murdered any and all magic or wonder it had left.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Also the dinosaurs were just so awesome in this they were genuinely scary at time's and they also look really good and their cgi was fenomenal. And the action scenes in this movie are just really great I was in the edge of my seat the whole time. I just had the most amazing experience watching this in the movie theater, it truly feels like the EPIC conclusion to the jurassic era. But it also sets up other stories that can be told now.

More than once the characters were in positions where escape was impossible if the dino had simply made a move but instead it either stands and roars while they get away or either moves as fast as molasses.One thing that bothers me is they copied a scene from the original Jurassic World where a character either has an article of clothing or a cable attached to them and a large carnivore manages to grab it and start pulling them toward their jaws. By some miracle all it takes is a human or two to overpower the pulling strength of a 10 ton animal.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The fact that the old characters came back isn't all that innovative, but it's a good concoction in the trilogy. The movie does keep you gripped in certain scenes, so it's definitely a good movie.It might be a bit too predictable at times, but is that really all that important? I think this is a very very good addition to the trilogy that raises the bar! I can therefore recommend it for all dinosaur fans out there.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

This film really felt as if it didn't need to exist, and honestly it's hard to remember much that happened even though I only watched it a few days ago!The visuals and CGI were by far the best part of the film. The CG was as good as it needed to be and was very clean. I thought the cinematography was mainly dull, but there were a few great shots scattered about, with some decent colour palettes.The acting was decent, but no performance stood out. Unfortunately, Isabella Sermon was underwhelming as Maisie, and her acting was fairly poor to the point where it was hard to have sympathy for her character. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howards's characters were bland and the dialogue was lacklustre too. It was nice to see the original trilogy back, but it felt so forced and completely unnecessary to the plot.The score was alright, but nowhere near as iconic as the original Jurassic Park scores. It worked well in the scenes it was used for, but wasn't memorable in any way. Also, the sound design was pretty effective! It helped to create tension and intrigue.Lastly, my main issue comes with the plot and pacing. The plot itself surprisingly isn't centred around dinosaurs, and the dinos are somewhat of a subplot which was incredibly disappointing. The plot didn't make much sense, and there were supposed to be some shocking reveals, but they didn't pack a punch and I was just bored by them. The movie was paced very messily too, with no real structure.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Obviously, the story has some faults, but this movie has a lot of what people are coming to see, dinosaurs. The re-introduction of the legacy characters was also done greatly. If you like dinosaurs and action, go see this movie and enjoy it. Don't get carried away in the critical reviews because at the end of the day, it's just a movie about 65 million year old extinct animals.","9 out of 22 found this helpful.

"2","/10","Jurassic World: Dominion - Spoiler free review.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8224467/?ref_=tt_urv","rashid-5735","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur153624158/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2022","Most of us who grew up with the original JP were captivated by the film in many different ways. Some people loved the grandeur of such creatures, some loved the thrill of a summer blockbuster done right and the rest loved both those aspects.That movie has been loved by us for decades now, so I'm not going to compare the latest installment to it. That's unfair given the nature of the present day audience, who are kids just like we were but with way more pretentious ideologies and social media influenced interests.(I myself avoided such a fate, given that social media in general started shaping the younger generation right after I took on more adult responsibilities in life)Now, let's get into it.Jurassic World: Dominion is by no means a bad movie.Given what we went through in the last one(which isn't the directors fault, he did his job right), you would think that this doesn't deserve the hate it's getting.However, the strangest thing about this movie is that whatever makes it worth watching is also the stuff that quickly ruins it.If you're going to make a dinosaur movie, then make a dinosaur movie.Instead what we get is an erratic attempt at merging this concept with those from the fast and furious/mission impossible movies and trying to force the same old pandering we've seen one too many times.And like I mentioned, that's pretty much what makes this entertaining enough to sit through but also leaves you dissatisfied at the end of it.We're here to watch Jurassic World, not the Avengers.I will say that the film starts off very strong, and does make me care about the little girl from the last movie. Her storyline was surprisingly inspiring, and could have paved the way for a much better plot overall.Past the halfway mark however, it quickly becomes a mess of rushed plot lines all trying to close off the story as a whole and you are left with a feeling of emptiness when the credits roll.Another glaring issue was that whatever the trailer was advertising as the plot, is almost non existent in this movie. Even the scene of the T-rex ""attacking"" a movie theatre is simply for the online marketing.There is hardly any real threat faced by the human race, which does make sense to be honest but it's not in keeping with what the last movie did right by setting up.I was ready to hate this movie just for its diversion from the source material and the original trilogy. I instead dislike it for trying too hard to match up to said material, but without any sense of purpose or care.The lines are cheesy, the acting is semi decent but not inspired, the dinosaurs are almost forgotten in a movie called Jurassic World that took two movies to setup, but are also pushed into every minute of screen-time.It feels like a poorly constructed ride with characters that are written even worse and have the most cliché motivations.All in all, I would suggest watching this movie at-least once on a big screen with a nice bag of popcorn to go with it. It will not be what you want, but is a good enough experience that you will not want to leave halfway.The old cast appearing in the film didn't seem forced in my book, just a huge coincidence that they would all be together as the film went on.There is no real way that they should meet(old and new cast), but they do!That's just bad editing, which there seems to be a lot of during it's 2 hour 30 minute runtime. There was no reason for it to be this long, but it is.I rate it 5/10.If they ever make a new series of movies, I would like them to be their own thing, and an extension of the original trilogy as opposed to this weird attempt at showcasing the dangers of genetic power.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

How could the magic of the original jurassic park movie turn into something as pointless and endless as this film? How could intelligent people spend so much money, get competent actors involved, and end up with such a gloomy, noisy, incomprehensible mess? First, too many characters and no character development. You wish the dinosaurs would just eat these people and get it over with. Here, have some ketchup. Next, too many dinosaurs attacking way too often. I mean, everybody likes candy, but eat too much and it makes you sick. There needs to be a balance between character development and action in a film, and this film is so off balance it makes you dizzy. You can get up and make a sandwich in the middle of this, and not even care that you're missing anything. Yes, the dinosaurs look great. But this movie is no fun. There is just no fun in watching this. I'd rather see ray harryhausen's animation with good acting and a great story, like the beast from 20,000 fathoms. Those films had class. This movie is dark, gloomy, noisy, full of mannequin actors trying relentlessly hard to look tough and cool, and one dinosaur attack on a loop, repeated endlessly. My brother and I are watching this right now, and he just yawned. Yup, you got it. That's the right reaction. Oh well. At least we have the other jurrassic park movies to watch. We won't be watching this one again.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The dialog is just terrible, everything seems forced. The acting isn't too bad, also not great, but cant blame the actors for a bad script, they done what they could with it I guess. I would probably put this above the first Jurassic World maybe, it close but this is probably a hair better. Saying that, it really just not good, forced is best way I can describe this movie, and boring, oh god is it boring. When I'm getting bored during climax action scenes, something is wrong.Jurassic Park 1, is one of my favorite movies of all time, I really hate that the series went this way.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Film fails to deliver on Direction and Screenplay. I had good expectations from this legacy franchise especially Jurassic World 1 was so much entertaining. Film focuses more on humans and locusts than Dinosaurs. There is little continuity in the film, script is clueless. First 45 minutes are terribly wrong with no tense moments. Iconic Jurassic music theme plays only once in the entire movie when the legacy character makes entry in the film. The great T-Rex has very little screen time.Having said, Jurassic models and special effects are good and it feels real. Acting is good. Return of main characters from the original film is soothing. I wish they had done justice to the dinasours and audience by not writing so poor script. I give film 5 stars for failing the expectations from great Jurassic Kingdom.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Costumes and sets are drab thought the special effects and makeup artists have done reasonable work. Fair but not exceptional.The first half of the narrative is plainly bad and contrived nonsense and whilst this interminable imbecility continues to the end the second half of the film does build some fun and adventure as it settles into the familiar structure of stranded humans suffering dinosaur attentions in a disintegrating dinosaur facility whilst trying to save a token item.As a fan film the re-emergence of the original cast as the principle players is welcome as a replacement to the wafer thin newer cast and the jarringly constructed conceit of another dinosaurs park going belly up allows for familiar survival routines.This can not obscure thought the sad situation that the whole thing is a mess: very small ideas blown beyond any proportions to a protracted runtime and un-involving action scenarios.Overall I had the almost constant sense that 'Jurassic World Dominion ' has been savaged in post production editing to bring a sprawling tale down to a 2 and a half hour runtime. This has unfortunately increased the sense of muddled structure in the narrative and in individual scenes.The effects are of inconsistent quality: some highly effective and some much less so. The sound design and cinematography are solidly unremarkable however some audio design for the dinosaurs are powerful.There is no attempt at believable violence or kinetic action: it is very bloodless and off camera in its kills and the action is frankly awfully developed.There is however a clear attempt to build on the human versus technological exploitation of life but it's muddled and unconvincing for me in how these themes are implemented in this story.I rate a 3/10 as a feature film but 4/10 as a franchise instalment and give a compound score of 3.5/10.I recommend only to confirmed fans due to the resurgence of the more interesting and engaging original cast and actors. I do not consider this film to be very good but it is not a complete failure at drawing the Jurassic Park world into broader sci-fi tropes whilst rounding off the tale of the current characters.If this franchise is to return then the young adulthood of Maisie Lockwood a few years hence from the current continuity looks likely to be the viable starting point.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But the poor screenplay to this movie absolutely ruins the experience and left me hugely disappointed.I am not going to provide any spoilers-frankly there is nothing to spoil. Simply said this movie drifts miles from the original premise of Jurassic Park and the wonder of dinosaurs and turns into a jumbled mess of failed plotting and logic. As much as l liked some of the lines between Jeff Goldblum and Chris Pratt, there is absolutely no reason to see this movie-either in theaters or even at home.

Legacy actors seems more like superstars doing cameos (forever) and unable to convincingly resurrect their original character's essence, humility and synergy. The collaboration of the various legacy actors of the old and new did not seem to gel well. Main 'villain' too styled to Tim Cook of Apple look, poorly casted, background poorly established and more of a villain idiot than villain evil genius to be reckoned with. New lead lady characters too chic like a James Bond fashionistas that can do it all. The lack of focused established leads and generic usage of many legacy characters made me feel lost in direction.Cinematography & Editing - Bland framing and long cuts make it like a made for TV production with lazy camera movements and composition. 2:1 aspect ratio okay to capture size of dinosaurs, but framing too zoomed in on actors giving a lack of feel of their environment and mostly see the actors. Also, actors look like giants, should have zoomed out a little to consider for big screen, not a TV. That height zoom more useful in anamorphic aspect ratio where the environment is covered on the left and right spaces.Dinosaurs & CGI - Mostly good CGI and details, but some looked too cartoony and behaved too human like ala Disney and such. While some had good predatory animation and somewhat natural animal movements and mannerism, some had awkward and stiff control of their bodies as if a human had possessed the dinosaurs and figuring out how to use its limbs. The interactions of the alpha dinosaurs were awkwardly lost and poorly choreographed. The film trailers with outdoor cinemas and ""documentary"" wildlife feature are purely promotional (i.e. Misleading)Story - The redux on Blue and Maisie as a material part of ""purpose"" and their revelations and throwbacks are uninspiring. The ""evil corp"" doing woke detriment to the world is also so bland. Nothing intelligent. The ""oooo"" something behind the scenes is going on that is slowly unraveled to the audience is so poorly filmed and revealed that it was almost like little children playing make believe. Everything seems poorly established and shot (again with lazy cinematography, cuts/editing, dull framing and timing like a daytime drama). There was an essence of espionage and its relevant rush action, but I felt it out of place and too ""copy and paste"".Conclusion - This film lacks direction, ideation and inspiration, full of stale recycled formulae poorly executed. To the die hard fans, just watch it to scratch that dodgy itch, see some eye candy and be able to say you did it, but expect to be disappointed to a point of disgust. Did you watch Terminator Dark Fate? Its the same WTH vibe.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

They're all acting out of spite or cinematic illiteracy or both. Or maybe they think it's cool being cynical...but cynicism requires evidence in order to be effective, and the vast majority of reviews rating this film very low present no evidence other than emotional puerile dummy spits: ""not what I expected"", ""my least favourite in the franchise""...blah blah!No movie exists to meet preconceptions and expectations: expectations based on what? What a dishonest way to approach movies or indeed any form of art. See the jolly thing. Pay attention. Then by all means dislike it if you will but give reasons based on the movie's own terms not your prejudices.J W Dominion is a delight. It's an ode to the original and to the first sequel, a homage, a respectful love song. The number of scenes that are set up to echo now classic scenes in those two films are plentiful, especially in the third act, and they are done expertly, sensitively, with huge attention to camera work and the cinematic language of the original films. And yet they feel fresh. They're hugely enjoyable and we watch them with a knowing smile and recognition.I doubt everyone involved thought they were making an original. But they have made an authentic and not cynical attempt to tie together the threads of the franchise:
1. Having the oldies meet the newbies and working together is a superb statement on generational cooperation for the good of all; it's not a cynical money grabbing thing, but casting that works to meet the film's themes. Not that a bit of nostalgia is necessarily a bad thing, anyway.2. John Hammond's quest for redemption actually comes about with BD Wong's character (Henry) finally using genetic technology for good: the locusts are destroyed and there's the promise of using such tech to cure human diseases; the surviving animals are finally left to their own devices in a protected ""park"".3. T Rex rules in the end, as we had hoped. And it's the bad guys who meet their just desserts here. The dilophosaurus scene in the hyper loop is brilliant. Dodgson had it coming since the first movie! Yes! I've still not forgiven Mr Spielberg for killing Eddie in the second film.4. The movie is also a master class in the current obsession with DEI...Even in the first movie, Samuel Jackson and BD Wing had crucial roles but their ""diversity"" was not shoved in our faces. They were people with the requisite skills doing a job. Their diversity was NOT the issue. Same here: huge amount of sex, race, age etc diversity, and none of it is done for its own sake.I could go on but enough. Will I watch the film again? You bet! Far far more rewatchable than the previous two in this part of the franchise.Well done, Mr Trevorrow and all cast and crew. This one is gonna become a cult classic in time. Just loved it.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

Worse than the other sequels even. In fact, it was so bad I grew in appreciation for the other sequels which are by comparison quite competent. The set up for the movie is a great one, dinosaurs living in our world... unfortunately about 10 minutes into the movie it takes a sharp right turn and becomes a story about locusts instead. The dinosaurs in our world stuff gets pushed aside, and once our heroes board a plane to the Biosyn headquarters we're basically on yet another metaphorical island. The dinosaur action is good, but basically plot irrelevant and most scenes are too short. The final fight is totally unnecessary and in a way quite mean-spirited. The pacing is brisk and choppy, jumping to and fro between two separate stories. Some of the editing in action sequences is particularly obnoxious. The musical choices are also intermittently irritating, especially when the JP theme gets played loudly over dialogue for no reason other than nostalgia. The acting is good, but that only serves to make this movie more painful to watch, as the performances of legacy actors are squandered on this wasted potential. Finally the ending of this movie comes out of nowhere and is completely disconnected from the rest of the film. This makes Godzilla: King of the Monsters look decent.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Who lost a lot by appearing in this movie.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A strong conclusion to the Jurassic Park / World-Series","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8226171/?ref_=tt_urv","raven-11881","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur72965424/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2022","Last night I went to see ""Jurassic World 3 - A New Age"" at the cinema. Here's my personal impression of the movie.Briefly to the starting position of the story (minimal spoilers)The plot begins three years after the events of Jurassic World 2. Dinos have conquered the black market and have spread around the world in this way. This has turned life around the world upside down and both humans and animals must now live in coexistence with the new ""neighbor"", whether they like it or not. Of course, this again calls both poachers, hunters and conservationists on the plan, but of course also corporations who want to make their profit from it or who take advantage of the dinos to make medical advances with the help of their DNA. But as always, there is of course more to a large corporation than meets the eye. This then also calls Dr. Ellie Sattler on the scene, who analyzes a new life-threatening plague: gigantic locusts, which were obviously created artificially and are spreading further and further and eating up all the food. She enlists the help of Dr. Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm to uncover a mystery. Meanwhile, Owen Grady, Claire Dearing along with Maisie Lockwood live in a deserted area in a forest cabin to hide and protect Maisie because she is still wanted. Some dangerous people are after her. So much for the beginning and the starting point of the movie. (End of spoilers)The story is of course both trashy and rather flat, the characters remain quite pale, but that's what the series is known for. So I don't blame the film for that at all. I watch such movies because they are supposed to entertain and not because of their profundity, complexity or heaviness.Actors / CharactersOwen Grady (Chris Pratt) is as likable as ever. I like his character and I like his manner. Pratt plays his role solidly as always. Pratt may be an actor who mostly plays himself and he's not as changeable now as a Leonardo DiCaprio, but he doesn't have to be. We also loved Arnie or Willis not because of their acting talent, but because of their style and their very own character. It's the same with Tom Cruise or Dwayne Johnson. And so it is with Chris Pratt. Owen Grady may be a flat and one-dimensional character, but such characters are also allowed (even must exist) in such trashy movies. Grady is simply the savior of the need, the helper who is always there when he is needed most.Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is also as likable as ever. She is the animal/dinosaur protector par excellence and wants to prevent injustice to them at all costs. I buy this one. Otherwise, her character remains pale and superficial as well.Then there is Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), the artificially created ""clone"" of Charlotte Lockwood. She is quite possibly the most complex character in the film and you learn more and more about her and her creation as the plot progresses. This is interesting and exciting and adds to my interest in the plot. The fact that there are then dangerous people after her raises even more questions than it provides answers. Isabelle Sermon plays this role wonderfully believably and I really like this character. If more films are made at some point, I think she should take the lead role.Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) is still the old and level-headed woman who questions many things and who takes a central role in the plot. Laura Dern still plays her character confidently and believably.Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) assists Dr. Sattler in her investigation and is still the stubborn maverick. He and Sattler have great chemistry and you can tell they got along well on set as well. Sam Neill also still plays his character very believably and I always enjoy seeing him as an actor.Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) is of course also back in the cast and is once again allowed to utter wonderfully wacky, profound and philosophical phrases. He's still a great character with his wacky manner and charisma. I like him. And his scenes are always great and contrast with the serious situation.Seeing all three of the old characters together again, and even as leads, is really pure nostalgia and was also sensibly integrated into the plot.The antagonists are again just pull-off characters, but that's only half bad, because they serve their purpose to advance the plot and give the protagonists a task.Then there's a new addition: Kayla Watts (DeWanda Wise). She is a pilot and smuggler/mercenary. Her character is quite pale, but also sympathetic. She's a bit like the female Han Solo in Jurassic World.Also nice to have Omar Sy alias Barry Sembène back, who now works for the CIA.Dinos / CGI Animations / Action ScenesDinos are common in this finale and and appear in a wide variety of species.The CGI animations are very well done in my eyes and the dinos mostly look very believable and move really great. The integration into the moving image is very well done, so that only rarely the feeling of a ""foreign body"" arises.Really great class is the much higher creepiness and thrill factor in this finale of the trilogy. In the second half of the film, the characters come up against dangerous and deadly dinosaurs time and again and have to hide from them, sneak past them, run away or face them. This makes for an enormous amount of thrills and suspense.The first half of the film, on the other hand, is more dialogue-heavy, serving more to build the plot and show the new world. But to lighten things up, there are one or two fast-paced action scenes here as well. There is also a motorcycle chase with raptors through a city. I especially liked that one because it was so well edited, staged and filmed, and it's also just exciting and entertaining.I also love how the new world where humans and dinos coexist was depicted and staged. Playing children being harassed by Compsognathus dinosaurs, sauropods interfering with agriculture or other dinos showing up everywhere or even attacking and eating humans at times. I really liked this depiction of the new coexistence.Camera / Scenery / EditingAs briefly mentioned, I really like the camera work and there are a lot of great shots and takes. There isn't constant shaky cam, but the scenes were captured well and you always keep a good view of what is happening. Creepy moments were also captured great. I also liked the editing. Not too many hard and fast cuts, but often quite long cuts at a stretch.MusicAs always, the music consists of both old and new pieces. However, I was so captivated by the film that I didn't notice the music that much. I would therefore not classify it as particularly positive or negative at the moment after my first viewing.ConclusionJurassic World - A New Age is in my eyes a successful finale, which offers a lot of variety. The big appearance of the old guard from JP1 is a feast for nostalgics, especially since all three of them have a supporting role in the film and are present throughout from beginning to end. But Owen Grady and Claire Dearing also continue to be the likable characters I've known and taken to heart since JW1. Maisie Lockwood is the most exciting character and offers potential for a new lead in future films, if there will be any. The action scenes are classy and variedly staged and it never gets boring. There are a lot of dinosaur species in the film, and there are also a lot of thrills and plenty of scary and thrilling moments that took my breath away. Suspense is guaranteed here, especially in the second half of the film. The CGI effects are great and the dinos look very good.Overall, I am highly satisfied with the conclusion of the series and was able to leave with a satisfied grin. Even after a night of sleep I am still very convinced of the film and look forward to the second viewing.9/10 points - High rewatch value.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I'm a corporate media behemoth - and I'm here to tell you how a film as spectacularly bad as Jurassic World Dominion gets made.You might be wondering how a film like this can be so unbelievably shoddy, when the original was such an incredible cinematic feat. Well you see, A Corporate media behemoth, like me, is the foundation for building such a terrible thing. It starts with an endless pursuit of more money and a desire to exploit people's desperate desire for nostalgic reminders of simpler times before everything in the world became too much, often satisfied by the feeling they found in old cinematic masterpieces. And sometimes, films that came out many years ago, sometimes about dinosaurs, left their copyright for us to exploit. We just had to know where to look! Around about 30 years ago, there were film companies, just like today. And just like today, they fed on the attention of animals,. Even humans! Sometimes, after spewin' out a movie, the media company would land on something that audiences enjoyed - something that had well rounded characters, with clear rationale desires, real emotions and relationships, and concepts that catapulted audiences imaginations and transported them to new worlds - Even ones with dinosaurs. The media company would make the successful film, make tonnes of money, but then, like a prehistoric mosquito, they'd get stuck in the sap of success. After a long time, media executives at the company realise that they are sitting on this old fossil that made them lots of money and think, by cloning it, they could make just as much money as the first time if they just made the film again. They know they'll never capture the true form of the original, the magic that audiences felt; but they think that, by taking the same actors, the same basic ideas (eg ""dinosaurs are back!"") and throw it together on screen under a similar title to the original, people will pay money to see it, out of some desperation to re experience the excitement of the first film. Media behemoth executives use something we call ""money"" to persuade original cast members to sign up to remake this movie, and base the direction of the movie on what focus groups and ""data"" tell them what audiences supposedly want. This will inevitably be contradictory and miss the real elements that made the original so good; but they will ignore important cinematic principles like good scriptwriting, dramatic tension, good character arks or sensible direction or acting, and... bingo! You have a money making, but truly terrible, soulless clone - or ""sequel"" - that misses everything that gave the original merit; something that is soulless and ultimately tarnishes the Magic of the original.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

As someone who isn't completely obsessed with the Jurassic Park series, I was not paying too much attention for what it could have done after the expansion of opportunities, which it missed in Fallen Kingdom with the world of dinosaurs, but what the movie offered on its own. I think the plot line was fantastic, even if seemingly overused, it was done correctly. The direction at the beginning of the movie seemed confusing, but it made those connections more understandable by the end of the movie. The return of characters from JP1 was done quite fantastically, with all actors having the same feel and personality as in JP1. Jeff Goldblum was especially great in his return as Dr. Ian Malcolm, with his role in the plot making sense and with some great ad libs. The audio design was fantastic, with the surrounding environment being perfectly balanced, making you feel more interested and on your toes in scenes. John Williams did a fantastic job with the music, with new music making scenes more thrilling, as well as imputing the original theme correctly and in tone with the scenes. But the movie was not perfect on all fronts. The villain of Dr. Lewis Dodgson felt undeveloped and just cruel at times, even with the development in Fallen Kingdom. There are some areas that feel skipped over and other that feel overdone, such as the lack of comedy for most of the film, and too much comedy in certain parts. Some scenes were made too serious and others not serious enough. The film lacked balance at some points, but the movie did not disappoint as much as I feel the reviews might say. Its not perfect, but it is worth a rewatch or two once it releases on streaming services.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

As they are doing in Star Wars, they used this film to show that dinosaurs, animals and humans can live together.As if humans weren't responsible for the extinction of various animals such as rhinos and as if dinosaurs wouldn't shake the entire wild food chain if they were alive as shown in the movie.Watching the classic actors together again was amazing, but as planned was to convey the message of gender identity, they made a weak, pointless and bland plot.I repeat, they did the same thing with Star Wars, they put together everything that the creators (George Lucas and Steven Spielberg) built at the time and that was already validated by the desire of the fans and mixed it with personal matters without worrying about the essence of these franchises that are works of art in their originality.","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

It's good to inform people about the climate we're facing but preaching it all thru a movie about dinosaurs is a bit much,and the ending ""can't we all just get along"" speech was hilarious. Let's look at the writing.1)Woman being chased by raptor jumps in the back of a vehicle . DeWando jumps in the cab,slides over to the driver's seat and says ""hold on"". Woman in the back knows she going to floor it to out run the dinosaur? No. She says ""wait what""? What did she think was going to happen next,driver was gonna honk the horn and make it go away?2) Two women fighting. Woman One has a knife swinging at the face of Woman Two. Woman Two has a tazer wand and shocks woman one. Woman One says "" those aren't made for humans "" lol like saying ""hey that's not fair"".3) plane crashes into frozen lake. Ice blocks are 1' thick and plane is stuck on top of ice half in water. Two people get out onto the ice,but know it's cracking under their feet as if it's 4"" thick. One even falls thru. What is the ice around the plane magically thicker and colder than it is 4' away? Soooo many sloppy writing choices to go thru. All they had to do was ad alot of stereotypical millennials,over the top minorities, climate preaching,and inclusion speeches and idiots seem to buy it up like it's Dem speech on how electric cars will save the world.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I thought the storyline brought a satisfying conclusion to the explosive results unleashed in the first of the films. Also, a very interesting history for Maisie was revealed.

Did you all just try and make an awesome looking trailer and forget to make an actual dinosaur movie... I've never sat through an entire movie trying to not actively despise what I was watching. The whole story line felt like an x files with the dinos as a costar rather than the main purpose. Fitting these characters stories together was also odd and just seemed forced. I don't even know if a directors cut could save me and many others from wanting to own or purchase this movie once available.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Dinosaurs and humans in this fictional world are learning to live side by side among each other, while some big bio-tech firm BioSyn uses the gen-tech and the access to long extinct species for their own financial gain.As an advisor, no other than Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) gets involved with BioSyn. He, with the support of Ramsey Cole (Mamoudou Athie) create a plan to gather more information on BioSyn with the support of Malcom's companions from the original Jurassic Park adventure, Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Alan Grant (Sam Neill).In the meanwhile, we find Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) living with Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) in a very remote location, hiding her and her big secret from the world. Nearby lives also Blue, the rescued and incredible smart Velociraptor which escaped Jurrasic World and was originally trained by Owen. When Blue's baby and Maisie get kidnapped, the adventure for Owen and Claire really kicks off, with a wild hunt which leads them to the BioSyn location where Ellie and Allan are gathering more insights on BioSyn's doings. Goldblum occasionally revives his famous indignant moralizing from the original film, especially in a heated showdown with BioSyn executive Jeffrey Dodgson (Campbell Scott, in an icy performance).Colin Treverrow builds bridges and fun insights from the original Jurassic Park with some Jurassic World happenings and thereby creates another impressive Dinosaur adventure with Jurassic World: Dominion. The movie is paced just perfectly right, the 2.5 hours fly by much too quickly, it just never feels long at all. Recommended for everyone who likes stories with Dinosaurs, for fans of the very first Jurassic Park as much as for newbies.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

She destroys what she touches and that was unforgivable.The movie is using its name to make money. No real development but does have the right racial mix for modern audience lol. None of the last should be a surprise at this point.Note to writers. Make a movie with good character development on your own. Everything you are using today was created from previous masters.Bring on a new character by writing story around them hell you have some great actors and you could make a hit with Chris Pratt alone. Make each character have weaknesses and strengths.The movie should be a build up. Like a slow song that increases throughoutout. You don't need so make stupid jokes after killing people and the diversity is forced. It feels insulting from most people's perspective. Add more reqlisim and grit. Less you and Hollywood.The one thing I did learn from this is whenever faced with a dangerous animal or dinosaurs just put your hand up and it's all good. They become tame and just stop what they are doing.This is a good movie if board on a Sunday and nothing better to do. You can get up do laundry miss 15 minutes and it ready does not matter. Not a movie worth getting out of your seat for. But that seems to be most movies these days.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's like a cross between a low quality Marvel film, and a terrible Bourne film. Anyone and everyone associated with the original Jurassic Park should be ashamed of themselves. This story epitomises modern blockbusters... bringing back a few old faces and hopes that that is enough to placate the masses. Add in some awful ""humour"" too...I could go on and on, It's a cruel and very short-lived trick when the story could have been written on the back of a Cigarette packet. Insulting to anyone like me who was 9 when I saw Steven Spielberg's original, that film had genuine magic in it. These awful sequels should have been put to bed years ago, no magic left now just blatant money making, riding on the back of a franchise with sadly no sense of magic at all anymore.

Here, the bestiary is varied and diverse, but also perfect, thanks to CGI porn, animatronics and other techniques. Then it's time to evaluate its story, which here is already seen many times over and is boring: it's always the same story with the secret laboratory, the mad scientist, the genetically manipulated beasts... How is it possible to come up with the same nonsense over and over again? For young audiences perhaps. No matter. He then assesses the script, which is highly predictable, clocking in twists and turns with bugs every seven minutes, based on two dramatic arcs: that of the characters from the Jurassic World franchise (Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard as mechanical and bland as ever) and that of the Jurassic Park franchise (Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum). It's nice to see the trio from the first franchise again, but it feels mechanical and forced. The scenes between Howard and Pratt don't work: they're too conspicuously declaiming their lines, and we just don't buy it.As far as the cast is concerned, we feel that Steven Spielberg and Joe Johnston have a science of directing, unless it's the actors themselves who don't have the ability: this may well be the case, because if we compare them, it's glaringly obvious on screen that we don't have the same performance... It's true that we're not talking about experienced, seasoned actors for Jurassic World.The villain, Campbell Scott, is the most interesting character in the end, and the one we found best written, though full of cliché and hardly believable.The music is occasionally annoying. Many of the sequences are phoned in: the dialogue scenes between characters are heavy-handed. On the other hand, the dinosaur action sequences (CGI porn or digital-mechanical dolls) are technically perfect, but again boring. Proof that there was talent behind the Jurrasic Park franchise.All in all, as far as the beast soup is concerned, although indigestible, the film is a success; as for the rest, it's boring.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I am honestly shocked and saddened that Spielberg approved off this script. The story was a convoluted mess, and I left the cinema an hour ago with a sunken heart. Forced reunions, poor effects, rushed scenes, and stupid lines that almost made it feel like a really poor Bond film mixed with the most recent Fast and Furious movie.The director should be tried at the Hague for crimes against humanity, for crushing the soul of Jurassic Park with what I can only describe as the worst film in the complete franchise.In a world in which we have some of the greatest minds, I just can't understand why a better script wasn't written. Like the latest Rambo and Terminator, Dominion is the tombstone beneath which lies our beloved dinosaurs.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But instead of an epic clash for territory, this trilogy-closer chooses to retread the greatest hits and use its prehistoric animals mostly as props and turning them into a sub-plot. A really convoluted plot that didn't make sense. Choppy direction and horrible use of the legacy characters. The CGI seemed to be downgraded in this film somehow when compared to the previous instalment. Though some set pieces and animatronics were mesmerising to see. Overall a dumb boring movie that had the potential to be great. The producers were too pre occupied on wether or not they could make a movie and not wether or not they should.Acting: 5/10 (nothing stood out in this film. Besides Chris Pratt's Charisma and the on screen presence of the legacy actors, it was basic acting who could have been replaced by anyone.Action: 6/10 (All you want from a jurassic movie is Dinosaurs running amoc and killing people. When there was dino action it was great but so little of it and quickly finished left you wishing there was more. The whole malta sequence was perfectly executed. Though it had great animatronics, some CGI scenes of the Dinos was so bad it took you away from what was happening on screen and asking yourself what on earth happened here? Clearly they forgot the famous quote of the first film ""spare no expense"")Sound: 8/10 (I had the luxury to see this in a Dolby Atmos theatre. Sound design was amazing. Not as good as Topgun Maverick or Michael Bay's Ambulance but good enough to make you appreciate the surround sound. The Dilophosaurus scene is where it really accentuates the Dolby Atmos technology.Story: 1/10 (Convoluted plot and over all boring. Dinosaurs became a sub-plot to the story arc. Poor character development. Most notably the poor use of the legacy characters. Biggest disappointment was the character of Dr Allan Grant. Sam Niel did amazing for what he was given but writing and arc of his character in this film was abysmal.Feels/Nostalgia: 5/10 (There could have been great Nostalgia but poorly executed and barely used in my opinion. There were some cute emotional scenes between Humans and Dinos but the boring plot over shadowed those moments.Over all score 5/10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Now the Park is the whole world.Sure, it's a little too long and there's some plot points that are a little messy (your hand is not some sort of magic ""calm dinosaur"" technique Owen!), but overall it's a great conclusion to what has been a mediocre trilogy.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

By now, while the scale of the set-pieces have gone global, the impact unfortunately feels lessened. The plot simply moves from point A to point B to point C in a perfunctory way, and when some iconic characters pop up from the past, it simply comes across as mild relief. Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler still have chemistry and Ian Malcolm hasn't missed a funny beat in all these years, but the franchise's newer characters struggle to hold up in comparison. For the zillionth time, we come across humans hiding or running away from dinosaurs and the fear is no longer palpable. There's frankly no more gas left in this franchise's tank. It just needs to dissolve away into oblivion and the next generation should stick to studying (and dissecting) Spielberg's flicks and not Treverrow's sequels.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Jurassic Park is one of my favourite films of all time, I actually really like the sequel (super underrated, in my opinion), and heck, I can have fun with most of them.Dominion disappointed a lot of people, it seems, because it felt like a paint-by-numbers sci fi action flick that just so happened to have dinosaurs. Amazingly, I liked that about it. I liked that the film explored the implications of the ""cloning"" technology that is so prevalent throughout the series, realistically highlighting that if this technology existed, dinos roaming around Malta would be the least of our worries.This is a Jurassic Park movie with clones, killer locusts, evil corporations, feathered dinosaurs, Chris Pratt...I'm going to be honest, I had fun. Maybe it was because my expectations were so low, I genuinely enjoyed myself throughout this movie. It's truly bonkers and laughably campy at times, but honestly, anyone expecting high art at this point should get their head checked.Now, just because this movie swings for the fences doesn't mean it always hits. The main villain of the film: a CEO who bears such a resemblance to Apple CEO Tim Cook that my brother and I just started calling him that (and it made the experience so much funnier), essentially wants to use cloned prehistoric locusts to ravage American farmland and sell his company's own crops (which, naturally, the locusts have been ""engineered"" to be averse to), essentially giving one company control of the American agricultural industry.It's such a dastardly, evil, and unbelievably stupid plan (as if corporations couldn't just buy out millions of acres of disowned and dilapidated American countryside already), that the minute anyone - and I mean ANYONE - hears of it, they immediately turn on Tim Cook. Heck, even Tim Cook bails on the plan out of nowhere, seemingly realizing how stupid and over-the-top the plan is.The acting is pretty poor in some spots (I really dislike the little girl in the movie, I'm sorry), and like so many of these nostalgia bomb films, it elevates characters who really didn't matter in the original films to such a level of importance, it's eye rolling (looking at you, Henry Wu). Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard seem a bit tired and none of the new characters leave an impact. The old trio is actually pretty nice to see, but it's hard not to feel their inclusion is a bit contrived. Why is Dr. Sadler now a ""general scientist"" and not just a palaeontologist?This movie is also surprisingly light on the dinosaurs, but there are so legitimately awesome moments: the whole sequence in Malta is not only unintentionally hilarious, but a good little action set piece as well.I don't know, I didn't hate it. I thought I would, but I didn't. It's a fun time, as long as you keep your expectations very low.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The scenery was gorgeous and the animals were so realistic that I was astounded. I praised it to anyone who would listen and I saw it multiple times to see their reaction and to see how it related to my own.SO, I had heard how bad this one was and couldn't believe all the terrible things I heard because how could you NOT like a film about these amazing-looking beasts! I ended up enjoyed this as a comedy for too many reasons to list. First and foremost, the script was ludicrous. From the first scene, I knew what was going to happen and how it was going to end. The most notably hilarious to me personally? First, DeWana's hair and makeup throughout were perfect, even with all the dirt and hysteria, including falling through the ice into frigid water and coming out dry and not shivering at all. Second, Campbell Scott's ""menacing"" character was as villainous as my great grandmother when someone didn't enjoy her pasta. And finally, the dinosaurs themselves were seen too infrequently and they looked ugly and unreal, unlike in the first installment of the franchise. The first scenes were actually comical instead of menacing.Avoid this disaster at all costs. Don't waste your money. The only thing I can say in a positive way is that it finally cured my insomnia!!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

There are actually elements of this pitch in the movie, but the core plot doesn't have anything to do with dinosaurs themselves. The dinos are just sort of there for the most part & function as obstacles, rather than being the focus or point of the movie.Characters are given non-dinosaur related things to do. There are no character archs or growth. I really didn't care about anyone, even the returning cast, and at no time did I fear anything bad would happen to anybody who isn't clearly a bad guy. Characters that I somewhat liked from the previous movie show up, but then are forgotten about, while new characters are introduced that I didn't care about at all.There were way too many homages & recreated scenes from the first movie, and yet this movie lacked even what little spirit the previous two movies had. There are themes of irrevocable change due to tampering with genetics & resurrecting creatures that aren't even dinosaurs & yet everything wraps up nicely for no good reason at the end.I give 1 star for the CGI dinos when they are on screen, another for a few of the action scenes, and a final star for the sounds design because it is still top notch.

Notably these weren't focused on dinosaurs and the writers chose not to pick up on the story line (involving dinosaurs) that was teased at the end the previous film and in the marketing material. I gave up on the story and started watching it scene for scene.So many characters (old and new), so many storylines but not a whole deal of action and very few memorable moments. An underwhelming conclusion to the saga. Some of the dinosaurs looked cool though!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Their chemistry was amazing and while the story line was a bit cheesy in some beginning parts (the poachers reminded me of Jumanji movie bad guys) it still created the nostalgia it aimed for with great CGI.

Key word being 'different'. It's an action thriller more than an otherworldly jaw dropper, as we've already seen dinosaurs and I think people are expecting to revisit the charm of the very first film in the franchise for some reason.I agree, the premise of GM locusts modified to an accidental extreme by yet another bioengineering company was not particularly interesting as a plot device and I would've loved to sea some more ocean activity with the mosasaurus and other sea creatures, but I was absolutely enraptured by the new species of dinosaur we got to see, especially the ones present in the game Ark: Survival Evolved - Deinonychus, Giganotosaurus, Therizinosaurus, and more! There's a very entertaining giant dinosaur fight as well.Overall, very entertaining, immersive film, not groundbreaking, but it has romance, action to the extent of Fast and Furious stunts with black market traders and raptor chases, new dinosaurs, a backstory for Maisy, old characters revisited, and science! You can't have it all.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

They bring in a little new excitement here by the addition of three characters from the first movie (and thankfully the return of Neill, Dern and Goldblum) but of course their roles are much lesser than you'd expect or hope for. Sadly, Pratt and Howard are back too, once more running around and shoehorning themselves into a story which doesn't really fit them. This film has a novel concept, in which dinosaurs exist in the wild globally, but then ignores it in favour of a stock ""save the world from killer locusts"" storyline. The FX are okay and there's plenty of diverting action, but I would hope that this one's the last.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

There were some great ideas, interesting park design, some suspense, with a quite good final battle. It has its own mistakes, but as a new beginning it was a promising restart for the franchise.Unfortunately the sequel, Fallen Kingdom comes with stupid scenario, extreme silly dialogs and situations, irritating characters, and exploded Nublar island. Almost everyone thought it had gotten a lot worse than the first JW, and most of the mistakes came obviously from the bad scenario.And now we have the 'epic conclusion', which is... i can hardly believe this, but Dominion is worse than Fallen Kingdom. Due to an extreme bad and stupid scenario, the dinosaurs are just supporting actors, the characters (even the classic ones) are weightless, and suspense can't be find except one of two jumpscares. The new villains are completely insignificant in all areas, on both men and dinosaur line.This final movie is a shame on this budget with this actors, and the reason is the extreme weak storyline again.Mr. Trevorrow and Ms. Emily Carmichael, you buried this beloved franchise with your stupid mess, and we are not happy.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Many of the computer-generated, digitally composited effects were new, and the effects were startling, sparingly scary, and most certainly unforgettable. This new Jurassic film is quite different from its 5 predecessors. The FX in ""Jurassic World Dominion"" are unrelenting and intense. Frightening might even be a better description. And this is what defines this latest (and word has it) final chapter in the world's most epic and beloved dinosaur film franchise. I would imagine the producers, writers, and director, were thinking: ""If this is really the end of the Jurassic legacy, then let's go out with a BIG OL' BANG!""Having read some of the recent IMDb reviews of Jurassic World Dominion, I was a bit disappointed. It appears that JWD is being maligned for the one ingredient film fans unanimously agree must be present in any worthy movie: ""A film must be entertaining."" It doesn't need to be real, nor does it require a great plot or acting (though these elements would be helpful).I'm not going to waste anyone's ""reading time"" discussing the plot line (it has already been done 500+ times on IMDb and elsewhere). I will say that JWD feels both like a warmly embraceable cast reunion of sorts, which also includes the return of some of my favorite dinosaurs. There are also a number of enticing ""Easter Eggs"" scattered throughout the film. I caught a few of them - obvious nods to previous Jurassic films.JWD doesn't appear to have any illusions of becoming the next ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Aliens,"" or ""Avatar."" Audiences are already in the process of deciding this film's destiny, and no matter how much we choose to praise or criticize it, at the end of the day, JWD is nothing more or less than 2 hours and 20 minutes of complete and unapologetic entertainment. And perhaps, given these particularly rough and tumble times, being thoroughly entertained isn't such a bad thing.So why are some of us beating up on this film? Perhaps we've forgotten how to simply enjoy being entertained?Not that long ago, at some point in time, we were all kids (and if you're reading this and you're still a kid, that's perfectly cool too!). Being a kid is mainly a fun occupation, but ultimately, for the exception of Peter Pan and his rough little band of Lost Boys, all kids eventually grow up. It happens quickly, and in that precise moment when children make that nascent transition, many beautiful childhood fantasies disappear forever. Innocent imagination gives way to other more urgent ""adult"" matters such as work, money, marriage, divorce, love, taxes, life and death. It is a seemingly endless list of troublesome ""grown up issues"" that children should never have to inherit. Yet they all do. Nevertheless, the maturation process is very survivable. Perhaps we can try to resurrect that "" inner child"" so that we can relearn how to enjoy the simple mechanics of entertainment?To be memorable, a movie should, at the very least, aspire to be entertaining. Being entertained is why dedicated movie goers of all ages voluntarily ""suspend their belief"" as they watch a film. They rarely question what they see or hear, choosing instead to focus their rapt attention on ""how the film makes them feel."" Does anyone really believe that Indiana Jones could realistically avoid the hundreds of spears, darts, bullets and boulders (not to mention poisonous snakes) hurled at our favorite archeologist? I don't think so.Perhaps JWD is a reflection of art finding its own way into the realm of block buster films because it will soon reach (and likely surpass) worldwide sales of $900 million. Not too shabby for a film where many reviewers are intent on preventing this picture from earning more than six stars. Yet, the sum of these well conceived parts has conspired to produce a beautifully executed film, one that I think will someday earn its rightful place in the Jurassic canon of films.No spoilers here as usual, but I will reveal that when Jeff Goldblum found out he was appearing with his two co-stars (Laura Dern and Sam Neill) from the the original film, he posted on Instagram: ""You did it!

I went in with low expectations, but this movie didn't even meet them. Yes, the dinosaurs were pretty cool and had great animation. It is not good enough to save the atrocious plot of this movie. I was ready for the movie to be over an hour in and felt bored most of the movie. All of the tension was forced and it was so predictable! To the point where I could count down from three to my wife to predict a larger dinosaur would pop out. I'm thankful that this movie brought my wife and I closer over our shared laughter at the ridiculous plot. I won't see these movies in theater any longer, I'm so glad it was free.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie take great use of Narration and dragged out explanation so at times I think the entire movie is narrated like a documentary. We also get the usual environment propaganda how we should live in peace and harmony with nature - and this narration is told while Chris Pratt releases a deadly predator into the wild where it can murder more humans... yea, that happen...And perhaps that is the least believable with these movies. We all know the military would have killed everything, even nuked that island if need be. But they don't because the plot need to happen.The rest of the movie is okayish. The CGi is pretty great, the acting great, music and sets great. The problem with this is that we have seen it all before. This movie is basically a copy paste of all previous movies, sprinkled with some narration. The writing, and dialogue is horrible and often cringe. The storytelling is just a convoluted mess.I assume if you liked the previous ones you might like this too, it is perhaps even better than the last one just more boring since we seen it all already.I give this a very generous 4/10. The reason for that high score is that everything cinematography and the acting is at the very top. But don't kid yourself, this is a really bad movie.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

That scene with Bryce underwater was such a Beautiful Shot.But..........It's a Mediocre 5 out of 10 Blockbuster. Unfortunately that's not good enough for a Major Summer Blockbuster.Lower Tier Movies have a Baseline of 5, 6 and 7 out of 10. Not Blockbusters Which have the Capacity for a 9 and 10 out of 10 Cinematic Experience.Here's the Gripes -1. There is a lot going on in this movie but that isn't really the problem.2. The problem is the Writing and the lack of tieing things together properly and the performances from the Villain and of some of the other characters. They don't sell it well enough.3. The Villains performance was Terrible. When you have a bad villain, your movie is in trouble.That Being Said, I actually enjoyed it for what it was.Good Parts -1. The Malta Section of the Movie was Really Good.2. The Thin Ice Scene was Good.3. The Scene With Bryce holding her breath underwater to escape was Absolutely Excellent. What A Cinematic Shot That Was.4. The scene when the huge Dinosaur wraps his Jaw around the ladder when the little girl is climbing was a Great Visual Scene.5. The Locations were Beautiful to see on Screen.6. There were multiple different shots and scenes with such good Dinosaur Action.Overall, A one time Watch.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I'm gutted that after nearly 30 years we're left with this as our adieu to Hammond's dream.

The sheer amount of action sequences is astonishing, but more importantly, everything in them is a setup and payoff. And even though you know that the good guys are always going to come out unscathed, the director still manages to find creative ways to get them out of difficult situations. This way you're constantly following the characters, trying to figure out their best option, which makes for a tense and fun watching experience.That being said, the numerous character arcs and stories aren't quite given enough screen time. There's just so many people going through so many things, and then we're jumping from one company to the other, so that everything ends up feeling a bit messy. It's quite rewarding though seeing everyone meet up towards the end of the movie, and it certainly helps with the pacing, as the film doesn't just wrap up too abruptly.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The characters aren't all dreadful but I actually liked most of them in this movie. The dinosaurs look way better too, party because of the use of animatronics. And the terror of the dinosaurs hasn't been this good since JP ( dinosaurs are scary again!) .sure the end battle was cheesy and stupid like in the last few movies and the plot was pretty weird and not really interesting but it's still the best JW film in my opinion.People watch JW/JP for the dinosaurs and dinosaurs it gave us.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I could recall probably five scenes where dinosaurs were actually a pivotal part of this stupid insect movie. And they brought back the fellas from the original too?? Great! But why did they have to be so cringe? Jeff Goldblum was great. But he always is great because he's always just Jeff Goldblum in any movie he's in. 2 stars for the two minutes of dinosaurs.

But I could not. It is overlong, overstuffed with ridiculous plot lines that made watching it a chore. Of course, the whole concept of bringing dinosaurs back to life from the original onward is ridiculous, but ""Jurassic Park"" was so brilliantly executed and suspenseful that one could forget the implausibility of the whole thing. The series has gone downhill from then onward. And this movie represents the nadir of the series. Come on now, Chris Pratt is the dinosaur ""whisperer"" making promises to a raptor, please! And Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are brought back for no apparent reason other than nostalgia. Why are Laura Dern and Sam Neill invited to the villain's lair? Who knows? And why is Jeff Goldblum invited as well when all he is does in criticize the main villain's company? I found Campbell Scott's character reminiscent of an evil Tim Cook (not Steve Jobs as some have said). At least his performance was quietly creepy to me. The rest of the performances were passable at best - Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum appear to be embarrassed to be in the movie. The action scenes are poorly directed and not suspenseful. Therefore, I can only recommend the movie for Jurassic type completists like me - I just had to go even though I predicted it would be bad but hoped I was wrong. I was not. 5/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What were the writers thinking and more scarily the fact that other scripts would have been rejected in favour of this one. People go to see Jurassic Park/World films to see dinosaurs, a fact seemingly lost for a lot of this film. They don't want to see modified locusts, crime syndicates (taken on by action hero Chris Pratt) or human clones. That's not what we signed up for. They seem to have thought bringing back former characters would be enough, they got it massively wrong. My hopes weren't hugely high considering the last effort but I thought they might be able to go out with a bang. It's a shame they become so preoccupied with where they wanted to take the storyline without actually thinking whether it would appeal to audiences, particularly children who just want to see their favourite dinosaur. I hope in the future they go back to the story with a prequel so we can get a sense of where it all started and can then forget this mess of a movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The message is that life on earth that occurred naturally was awesome, just like the original movie. Subsequent efforts to replicate that accidental greatness in a test-tube is fated to fail catastrophically, just like this recent installment. The other part of the original message was that no matter how much money you throw at it, it will still fail.This movie has practically zero plot development and absolutely zero character development. As far as narrative structure goes, this movie's screenplay is ridiculously bad.There is no logical flow and so suspenseful situations seem obviously forced, predictable, and totally unsatisfactory.Watch it on streaming later on.

The dinosaurs are present but not the main focus, giving the impression that they are only there to extend the franchise. Even the inclusion of Alan Grant seems to be more for nostalgic purposes than contributing to the story. Chris Pratt's character also appears to be underutilized and serves more as a prop rather than a leading character.The camera work in the movie is particularly shoddy, with cuts from one angle to another creating confusion, especially in fast-paced scenes like the one in Malta. The depiction of Malta in the movie is also disappointing, with the country portrayed as a dirty, third-world Arabic nation covered in desert sand, which is not an accurate representation of the country. The use of Arabic style music in the background also seems out of place and unnecessary.Overall, Jurassic World Dominion seems to be a movie that was made to extend the franchise rather than being a well-planned and executed story. It is disappointing that a franchise that should have stopped by the third installment continues to churn out mediocre movies. Although the movie is not a complete disaster, it falls short of being an enjoyable watch.Additionally, the length of the movie seems to be excessive, and the dragging plot does not help in holding the audience's attention. The story's predictability adds to the monotony, leaving little to surprise or engage the viewers.As if to acknowledge the franchise's overreliance on gimmicks and sequels, Ian Malcolm's line, ""Jurassic World? Not a fan,"" serves as a meta-commentary on the movie itself. It is a nod to the fans who have been disappointed by the franchise's recent offerings, and unfortunately, Jurassic World Dominion does little to change that sentiment.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

However, that was before I watched it.After the crushing disappointment of the film itself, I tend to agree that this should be the last one. The ideas appear to have dried up and it is the bits and bobs they had left over from the other films that were coddled together to make this dull and lifeless finale.The dinosaurs seemed superfluous to the actual story. In fact, it seemed like another installment of ""Taken"" with dinosaurs added to spice it up.It was also a nice idea to bring the cast of J. Park and J. World together, but again, it seemed just for effect. At the end of the day, there was no real reason for doing this.To conclude, while I have watched the other Jurassic films at least 3 times each, I won't be giving this one another look. I choose to remember, instead, the 5 good ones and the enjoyment I got out of watching those.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I do blame the writers and greedy producers.Perhaps, it is time to stop milking the venerable franchise any more.

I had such high expectations for the epic conclusion, but left the cinema feeling disappointed. The plot was too stretched out unnecessarily with so much focus on the locusts instead of the Dino. No real battle between the Dino and humans. 80% of scenes are taken from all the previous 5 movies and put together for the conclusion. No original thoughts, lack of thrill and excitement except for the last 30mins of the movie which happens to be a remake of JP.The only saving grace was the OG casts, it was nostalgic to see them together 30yrs later. The cinematography and visuals were excellent as we would expect, but that's that. I really wished they had taken a different approach considering how the prequel ended at the Lockwood estate.Go watch it for the effects and if you're a fan. But don't have high expectations.

Instead of Dino's ruling the world, we get to see them in a compound. Yes, a compound. Where the dinosaurs are just put into they're natural environment with invisible fences.And the last problem I have with this movie is that these locusts have more screen time than there dinosaurs do.

Sure, it feeds into what dinosaur hungry audiences are expecting, but it offers nothing new and is a tiring retread of prehistory running amok in these modern times.I admit I felt bored at the beginning when scenes jumped all over the world with Jurassic World characters and Jurassic Park veterans getting introduced into the story to create a thread of what's going on. It was nice to see that combo happening, but things don't perk up until halfway through the flick.This time the evil corp. Is called 'Biosyn Genetics' which tampers with nature in more ways than one and predictably causes self destruction in the process. There's, of course, a ruthless CEO of that company who tries to profiteer from this age of large reptiles. Needless to say, that backfires just like other hungry investments before it.There's indeed a large adventure here though where escaping vicious dinosaurs is the major element, but without any intention of killing off any of them. I almost expected the ending credits to say, ""No dinosaurs were harmed during the making of this film"".I found the scenes with Owen Grady and Claire Dearing the major highlights of this movie. They have the best action scenes while the veterans from Jurassic Park are in more tamed down dilemmas. I guess it's due to their ages.Yeah, there's eventually destruction everywhere and a new genetically modified dinosaur thrown in for good measure. Those evil corporations never seem to learn. I'm surprised the global economy hasn't gotten bankrupt with those humungous investments into dinosaur modifications and creating gigantic sanctuaries for those beasts.I admit I'm a fan of the Jurassic franchise, but after 30 years of dinosaurs on the loose, it's pretty well worn itself out. I have no doubt a new reboot to the series will eventually happen. People don't easily get tired of dinosaurs.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Not a Grand Finale in Any Way","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8244878/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2022","While I, like the majority of film lovers, absolutely love the original Jurassic Park, I've basically felt like I've given the majority of the franchise pass, rather than genuinely believing they're great films. The only other film I genuinely think is a solid entry is the first Jurassic World (which in itself isn't original at all). I've felt that the sense of awe and wonder has been missing since the original film and with the release of the ""final"" installment with Jurassic World Dominion, I was eager to see how they would put a bow on the franchise at least. Sadly, I have to be honest and say this is probably my least favourite of the entire franchise. Let's dive into why I think fans should still see this movie, but with incredibly lowered expectations.Picking up about four years after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, dinosaurs are now free in our world and living amongst humans and other species. From here, there are multiple storylines that pick up that are not explored in the marketing for this film, so I'll keep it brief. Maisie Lockwood, the young girl from the previous film has been living with Owen and Claire in protective custody, but she is kidnapped and a rescue mission for her begins. Not only that, but the offspring of Owen's companion Blue is also with her. We then meet the original cast, who are on their own mission. Eventually, these two missions collide, but overall, I think this entire film was a missed opportunity.I felt as though this film spent next to zero time explaining what happened in between the events of the previous film and this final installment. This isn't even me getting my hopes up, because we've already seen dinosaurs on land before, so I truly believe a portion of this film should've been dedicated to people trying to survive or figuring out how to. With that said, there are still many unique ideas presented here that I thought were clever story developments, but I also found that the film failed to deliver on them, especially since they didn't work for a Jurassic Park film. That's also one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to massive franchises. When you present cool ideas, but they don't actually work in the context of the franchise, that just feels wildly disappointing.On a more positive note, I'm a fan of Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Laura Dern, Sam Neill, and Jeff Goldblum, so seeing them, all come together here was a lot of fun and some of their banter got some genuine laughs out of me. With that said, I actually believe newcomer DeWanda Wise as Kayla was the biggest standout here. Her witty dialogue and back and forth with Pratt throughout a lot of the film was terrific and I will gladly watch her performances in the future. It's always nice to have a new character added to a franchise that surprises you. If for nothing else, this was a great cast of characters to see together.Now for the dinosaurs, which were severely lacking in this film. This franchise, even in its weaker installments, has never had a shortage of Dinosaur action. Yes, this film has plenty of action involving Dinosaurs, some of which are genuinely fun, but I have to admit that the core story of this film really came out of left field for me, and not in a good way. I'm not about to dive into the details, because these details aren't even explored in the marketing, but I'll say that the main storyline focuses very little on Dinosaurs. For the end of a Dinosaur franchise, this rubbed me the wrong way. I couldn't comprehend why this story element was even being explored. It was basically what made me dislike this film overall, even though I enjoyed moments of it.In the end, Jurassic World Dominion isn't going to gain any new fans for the franchise, but at least the entire cast is here, having a good time, and it shows. I was excited to see Colin Trevorrow returning to direct, after working on the first Jurassic World, but even his touch didn't work here. The score didn't stand out to me either and the climax was very forgettable, especially being the ""finale"" of a franchise. I wish I had more positive things to say about a franchise that I have enjoyed until this point, but I honestly don't. Jurrasic Park fans will absolutely get a kick out of certain scenes so I recommend that fans still see it, but as a movie on its own, it's just not good.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jurassic World: Dominion (2022) has plot issues, it does not have a clear connection with the last movie, but it has fun and entertaining scenes.I will not give any spoilers. The main plot is not what we thought it could have been and what we from this movie with the dinosaurs are in some action scenes, but not in the whole movie.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are both good in the movie and cool seeing them in action or suspenseful scenes. The original cast from Jurassic Park (1993) return and its great seeing them Interact with the Jurassic World cast.I loved the return of Sam Neill as Alan Grant, Laura Seen as Ellie Sattler, and Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm. They were all good and I liked seeing them and the Jurassic World cast work together in the 3rd act against the main villain dinosaur.The action scenes are fun to watch and there are suspenseful scenes involving some dinosaurs. The dinosaurs look good and have nice effects, I also saw some interesting looking dinosaurs with unique designs that look cool.The big problem of the movie is the main plot and how it changes a certain story that was in the past film. I thought the beginning of the movie was slow, but it starts to pick up once it starts to go through the 2nd act and the 3rd act.The movie has references to the first Jurassic Park (1993), and the 3rd act was fun to watch. The 3rd act was suspenseful and cool seeing all the main characters from Jurassic Park and Jurassic World interacting and working together to stop the main dinosaur threat.The ending of the movie was confusing, and I did not know how we were led to it. Jurassic World: Dominion (2022) has an ok ending the movie series and was better than the last movie, but I think this could have been better if they gave us more of what we wanted and did not have a side plot in the way.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Instead we have the cast of Our Heroes, who spend the movie being Care Bears and running away from dinosaurs. Of course, we know that none of them will get eaten.

The dinosaurs are the most inept predators that ever evolved, as they signal they're stalking you by rumbling and gurgling. Then, before they bite, they always pause for a roar, allowing Our Heroes to escape. I kept falling asleep during this epic yawnfest.In a desperate attempt to salvage this dino dump, they had to add in some giant grasshoppers.

Well even with these, the movie is just bad and boring... The original movie was a huge hit, unique movie in concept (ok, based on book), ridiculously good VFX and pretty good script. I'm not saying the rest are bad because of my nostalgia ( i love the 3rd one because it was probably my first movie in the theaters) , but they stopped putting real efford in each next movie.So to go back to this.... thing. Lets start with the ONLY good thing. It has superb sound design. DTS:X pops up amazingly in here, tho if i have to be nitpicking, it can be even better esp during the locust flying scenes.And.. that's about it. The script is plain stupid. You turn to watch dinosaurs, and half the story is about cloned person and grasshoppers' problems. Dialogues are very stupid at some points, esp the Dodgeson's ones. And i bet the actor is not bad , it is the scipt that makes him look meh.VFX are not impressive. Definitely not cheap CGI, but you don't expect them to be cheap and bad... Yet you wont be wowed at all, compared even to the 2015 movie. 7 years later... which is a long time, yet the visuals are kinda the same (tad better but not much).Scenario is meh. No Character arch, no development, just nostalgic sentences and cliché after cliché .It would have beeen much better movie if it wasn't sooooo long. I still don't get it why they keep making movies with 2:20h+ ... it's good if you have amazing story , but if you don't it's tiresome and boring. 2 hours and a half is like 40 mins longer than it should have been with such story and script. I'd give it probably 5 if it was 1:50. Tho 4 is too much i think, i'd say my rating woud be 3.5/10 for this, mostly because of the very good sound.Definitely the worst one in the franchaise, tho i bet they will continue making these because the cow has a lot of milk to give.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

All the potential awe and terror of dinosaurs taking over the planet is lost in the shuffle, making for a massively missed opportunity.

But as it goes on it focuses too much on a ""locust"" plot, and forgets that bringing the original cast back is pointless. If you don't put them up against the original dinosaurs.There are some nostalgic moments that I loved. But the finale I hoped for is ruined by random dinosaurs turning up when all fans really wanted was a rematch or showdown.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There's plenty of them in the movie and as the title suggests, they are poised to rule the world. Other than that though, this is a mediocre plot at best.After a good setup in the previous films, the writers missed an opportunity to ask the big questions that were fascinating about the Spielberg original. Instead they go to familiar terrority and we are again put in some park with some evil scientist billionaire, treading worn out paths and scenes we've seen before, with too many coincidences and bad plot twists. A lot of misses are seen between this greatest hits show, most notably the bigger questions on genetics. And nostalgia is not enough to save it.Let's spare the actors because they had to work with this script and did their best, and of course the special effects team because, hey, dinosaurs right?So if you're here for those dinosaurs, they're good. But be prepared, and in the vain of chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Goldblum): you'll probably root for them instead of humanity after this bit.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What I don't want to see is story about a clone child and genetically engineered locusts. Sadly, that's what we get with Jurassic World Dominion. Quite why those involved in the development thought this was the direction to take is anybodies guess but unsurprisingly, it doesn't work. I could live with this is the plot served as nothing more than a means to take us from dino encounter to another but it doesn't. Instead the dinosaurs feel almost like they are an afterthought.When the dino action arrives it generally is pretty good but there just isn't enough of it to elevate the film above its dull plot. And some of the thrill of the chase is lost. In the past films there was always that element of tension as you knew that the protagonists probably hadn't shaken off the threat of the T-Rex, Velociraptor or Spinosaurus. None of that exists here though as in an attempt to just cram in as many different dinosaurs as possible, almost every different action sequence involves a different dinosaur. For me this removed all tension. Even the films supposed big bad, the Giganotosaurus, is given an underwhelming amount of screen-time.I'm probably being a bit generous giving this a 4 but as a dino nerd and a JP fan, there is still a bit of a thrill seeing dinosaurs in action, even if the overall quality of the film is poor.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Alan Grant grabs his hand when he's falling and delivers an ultra dramatic ""I got you."" Got you from what? Slipping 23"" down a ladder? They way they cut the scene makes it look like Goldblum is up near the top of the ladder. If that's true, he should be in the NBA because he could easily dunk on like a 14ft hoop.If lifetime movie network made a film for $185 million, this is it!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But this is easily the worst of the bunch.Some scenes are reminiscent of other movies.So after all the previous movies you would expect the characters to grow on you. But that isn't the case. So while in the first one you would be scared of something happening to a person. Well at this point you all have seen it before and are not that involved anymore.That was the main strength of the first one. And other movies with animal predators. But it soon becomes we have seen this before.....
The script is put together with tape and nuts and bolts. It doesn't have a clear view... it is only there to show of the advance of special effects ...
Nothing wrong with that but nothing really special to be seen there.What the writers thought as funny. Let pigeons get caught by a dinosaur instead of getting hit by a truck at a wedding.. only adds to the feeling that you all have seen it before..
While the first time it is funny..the second time it isn't...In short I find it disrespectful towards the viewer to add zero originality to a movie which setting offers limitless possibilities. Instead they decided to play peek-a-boo with a baby like grannies do... The granny should understand that the baby who has never seen dinosaurs grows up and now needs more.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Seeing Pratt's Owen and Sam Neill's Dr. Grant on the same screen was exciting. Though at times it felt like when your childhood friends visit you in college; fun at first, but things could go stale quickly.The action sequences were well choreographed, and the dinosaurs looked remarkable. The core plot was straightforward and easy to follow, though some of the side stories were irrelevant. I left the theater grateful for one specific actor, as he was the most entertaining and charismatic performer on screen: Jeff Goldblum. Every scene with Goldblum's Ian Malcolm was witty and engaging.Jurassic World: Dominion has everything you look for in a big summer blockbuster: great actors, big special effects, and a bit of nostalgia. Unfortunately, this movie was too bloated and overstuffed to keep my interest. The subplots were nonsensical and kept dragging out. I believe there were more scenes in this movie than any other film in recent memory, and that's not a good thing. The movie should have been 20-30 minutes shorter.The acting was poor, especially from the one Oscar winner in the bunch. There were character moments that could have been chill-inducing (i.e., Spider-Man: No Way Home) but those scenes fell flat. Even the score was unsatisfying, only using elements of John Williams' masterpiece a handful of times. Ultimately, the sloppy editing, uninspiring villain and lackluster performances left me disengaged and disappointed.The Jurassic films hold a special place in cinema history. Watching the park as it's being created (Jurassic Park) and then seeing it operational (Jurassic World) are some of my favorite cinematic memories. The charm that is present in those specific films is because of the awe-inspiring dinosaurs paired with calamity. Sadly, Jurassic World: Dominion falls prey to a tired concept and a well run dry. Is it the worst film in the franchise? No, I don't think so. That place is reserved for The Lost World: Jurassic Park.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The plot being fairly simple in that another evil corporation looks to exploit dinosaurs that now live along side humans for ultimate power. They require the offspring of the Raptor ""Blue"" and Maisie who's backstory was she was cloned in the previous film. The only positive was seeing Laura Dern, Jeff Golblum and Sam Neill reprising their roles from the original films. The story itself just lacks any imagination or magic that we've come to expect and really feels like a very lazy screenplay. If lesser actors were involved my opinion of this film would be much lower. Overall it's such a disappointment and an absolute shame that these actors were involved in project that is so flat. Sorry but I'd give this a miss if you love the previous films.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I think this was a worthy end to the saga, since I seriously think it gave it the ending it deserved and bringing together the protagonists of these 2 trilogies was a good way to conclude this Jurassic saga.

Ian clearly calls out genetic power and what we're to happen if it circled the globe. Cataclysmic change like death and while most feel it was a metaphor for climate change, it was actually a warning of the locusts. The technology learned from dinos being applied to something seemingly without worry turning Into a global disaster. I'm sure you can read other things Into it if you want but looking at it from a pure plot written standpoint, it was a fitting storyline to add.As for the rest of the film , solid acting, directing and action. I think the idea of keeping the prologue separate from the film turned out to be a bad one as it would have played out better as the start of the movie. The beginning is a bit off because of it but what comes after is fantastic. I hope Universal provides a directors cut or whatever the original vision was because it would make a difference. Solid 8 out of 10 and I plan to see it again as It's easily worth the price of admission!*Update* After watching the film 3 times in the theater and multiple times on digital, I've updated it to a 10 out of 10. For it's time frame, the film moves briskly and the second viewing corrected whatever the issues I had originally with the beginning. The action sequences, especially the motorcycle chase, are phenomenal and bringing the two casts together was done so well, I get a kick out of seeing the OG players every time. Especially Sam Neill.As for the Owen/Claire saga, it was concluded very well and ties up every theme presented in the two films before. Im excited to see the extended cut because I want even MORE!! Can;t get enough of Dominion!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Felt like a lame reunion as opposed to a film with much in the way of point or purpose","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8859246/?ref_=tt_urv","jimbo-53-186511","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26154754/?ref_=tt_urv","7 February 2023","I'll admit that I didn't realise that there was a film in between this one and Jurassic World which at least explains why I found some elements of this film puzzling. Once I've seen Fallen Kingdom I may revisit this review once I'm able to piece things together better...Having said that I still maintain that even films that are part of a franchise should still carry enough wait to work as standalone films (after all not everybody is going to watch all the films and may not watch them in the correct order as I erroneously did).No matter how you approach Dominion it is very long and in all honesty pretty dull. I really enjoyed Jurassic World and liked the earlier films (except Jurassic Park 3 which was far too stupid to be enjoyable). As well as being way too long and containing far too little action the actual product that is presented here is messy and convoluted; here we find ourselves travelling all across the globe and we get fragments of several stories which never really materialise in to an interesting completed article.Whilst it's great to see the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill and Laura Dern back here a dynamic and energy that once existed seems to be lacking in this film (this is most noticeable in Sam Neill, whom, as with Jurassic Park 3) looks like he wants to be anywhere but in this film. I believe Jeff Goldblum was in the previous film, but even so bringing these 3 characters back felt like a forced attempt at nostalgia. A quirky dynamic existed between Pratt and Howard in Jurassic World which is totally absent in this film (it has to be said that this film is also a lot more pompous and serious than Jurassic World which is another huge negative).I give the film some credit for throwing in some interesting ideas; such as dinosaurs that hunt, track and kill humans once a laser is locked on to a subject's scent. Also the scientist using a swarm of locusts as a bio weapon to destroy humanity. Unfortunately in a film like Dominion these intriguing concepts are not given the focus or the development to really make the film worthy of an investment of 150 minutes of your time.As I said I may revisit this review when I've watched Fallen Kingdom, but for now this is pretty much how I saw things with Dominion and I can't say that I was very impressed tbh.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.","Was this review helpful?  to vote.","","","Permalink","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8859246/?ref_=tt_urv","Sign in","https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin?ref_=urv"

I went into this already feeling disappointed. But I've learnt a valuable lesson today - the audiences in this day and age are so hard to please, even if the original Jurassic park were to come out today people would probably give that negative reviews too.Don't believe what you read from the masses. I thought this film was excellent and was a great send off for the ""world"" trilogy. It gave me goosebumps, it made me feel wonder, sadness, surprise and fear. Sound familiar?? Another film does that too. It's called Jurassic Park.I'm by no means saying this film is as good as the original. But it is MILES better than Fallen Kingdom and I actually think this film merged the original cast with the recent very well. Both groups were integral to the plot and actually contributed. They used their nightmare experience from the first film and used it to survive.I could go on and write another 1000 words to this review challenging people who say ""there wasn't enough dinosaurs. Too much focus on people"" and to that I say - if that's what you want then go watch the walking with dinosaurs movie.. this isn't a Dino documentary. It's a science fiction film which involved HUMANS creating dinosaurs from DNA. People and their selfish motivations are kind of important to how the entire series has worked thus far.If you're reading this review and haven't seen the film because you've been put off by all the negativity - then please, go and see the film and judge for yourself. Don't be the negativesaurus that so many seem to be these days.And yes, I did just say Negativesaurus. I'm using it now.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.","Was this review helpful?  to vote.","","","Permalink","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8224441/?ref_=tt_urv","Sign in","https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin?ref_=urv"

"2","/10","A zombie of a film; Hollywood lifelessness epitomized","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8230437/?ref_=tt_urv","TheVictoriousV","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2022","The Jurassic Park franchise goes out with a wet fart in Jurassic World: Dominion -- an absolute zombie of a film that encapsulates a great deal of what's gone wrong with Hollywood. To quote Metaplex writer Brendan Hodges, regarding the less than stellar RT scores of the most recent Jurassic films: ""In retrospect, it's nuts how many times people have f-cked up the surefire premise of dinosaur chomp-chomp human"".In a last-ditch effort to breathe any sort of life back into the series, Universal (well aware of how little we care about the Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard characters) has brought back the actors that were there from the start -- Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum -- to bait our nostalgia. And yet, this somehow makes the movie seem all the more piteous. These particular Member Berries turned to raisins a long time ago; we're only reminded how old and tired this all is. (I won't call them ""dinosaurs"", though. That's too mean and too obvious.)This doesn't feel like ""a look back at everything we've been through"", à la last year's Spider-Man: No Way Home. It's more akin to snatching Indiana Jones from the nursing home for a final adventure or having James Earle Jones record just a few more Darth Vader or Mufasa lines from his death bed.The plot... Well, what can I say? It's largely the same old spiel with the obligatory new touch -- of which each sequel needs to have at least one (e.g. The park actually being open in Jurassic World). The ""twist"" or whatever this time around is that the dinosaurs have actually started fully co-existing with humans (going on hunts with us and various other stuff that's ""supposed"" to be silly, u guize), while the real threat is a type of locust that has begun eradicating the Earth's food supply.Even so, the formula is largely unaltered. The dinosaurs still have a remote location all their own, albeit with human allies close by, and are only unleashed once the template permits it. Another mandatory detail is the human villain. This time around it's the greedy CEO of Biosyn Inc., who orchestrated the creation of the locusts to destroy the supplies of rival companies (these particular grasshoppers have been engineered to avoid whichever crops are property of Biosyn). I dunno, man. I can't even laugh at this stuff anymore.The only real joy I felt during this picture -- however ""ironic"" it may really have been -- was during the first few minutes where Goldblum was at his most Goldblum. Other than that, there is no reason for you to pick this film over this other movie that came out this weekend, crafted by the VFX supervisor on the first-ever Jurassic Park, Phil Tippett, over the course of 30 years. It's called Mad God and reportedly rivals even the new Cronenberg joint in terms of nastiness. I understand if that doesn't sound too attractive but I'd rather see something that makes me feel sick than something that makes me feel numb.Hell, even if you really, really feel that you need to see CG dinosaurs doing CG dinosaur things, Jon Favreau's Prehistoric Planet (putting his 2019 Lion King technology to more appropriate use) is a far better pick than this (not only because watching it doesn't require you to leave your sofa). We've come an incomprehensibly long way since 1925's The Lost World and even D. W. Griffith's 1914 short film Brute Force. There are ways to celebrate this that don't involve sitting through boring character moments, sloppily made scenes (with some truly maddening blocking as well as editing), or a Chris Pratt performance.Long story short: Yes, despite Colin Trevorrow's promises that the latest big new dinosaur -- unironically called a ""Giga"" -- would be like a dinosaur version of The Joker, Dominion still turned out to be a pretty cringe movie. I know, I'm shocked too.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.","Was this review helpful?  to vote.","","","Permalink","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8230437/?ref_=tt_urv","Sign in","https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin?ref_=urv"

A big point of consternation with the movie, is the fact that the writing as well as the production seem to be done by committee. There are a couple of scenes that are absolutely breathtaking and poignant while some scenes, the majority, seem to be have written and shot for the CW or a weirdo app like Pluto or something.It is really quite bad. I spent a lot of time wondering what went wrong, until I looked at the end credits and there it was, screenplay by Emily Carmichael (No relation). Emily is a writer, the likes of which, I refer to as The Destroyer of Worlds. These are writers who weasel onto a sequel project and completely upend what made earlier entries in a property or franchise work.The truth is, the people who made the movie clearly have no idea what they are doing. It's almost as if the filmmakers and crew were winging it.Unfortunately when you look further into the credits, that seems to be the case.This is a hundred million dollar student film, basically. There are dinosaurs I guess, and nobody is running up a mountain in high heels, there's actually a plot point where they zoom in on Claire's feet to show that indeed she is not wearing high heels this time.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.","Was this review helpful?  to vote.","","","Permalink","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8221368/?ref_=tt_urv","Sign in","https://www.imdb.com/registration/signin?ref_=urv"

I have been a dinosaur fan all my life, and the Jurassic Park franchise is just as important to me as any work of fiction would be. There is something interesting about Dinosaurs and cinema, in that they have been in the movies since the 1920's, and even back when dinosaurs were just stop motion puppets before going all CGI, people were still captivated by just the imagine of a dinosaur, and thinking of how wonderful it would be if we could live in a world beside them. This movie, like every other sequel in the franchise is not a perfect film. But the first Jurassic Park movie i ever saw in theatres was Jurassic Park 3, and even then that film was panned by critics and fans, and to this day is consider a bad movie, however i loved it as a kid and even though i do see the glaring flaws with these sequels and these movies when compared to the original, i think to myself ""there is no way to capture lightning in a bottle twice"" the first was a cinematic marvel when it first came out, and even the same people couldn't exactly replicate the magic again when doing more sequels. But that still doesn't mean these movies aren't entertaining. After all, the Jurassic Park sequels are filled with wild, weird, and wonderful ideas, and these are the very same elements that keep us entertained. This movie is corny, there are a lot of plot holes that do start to add up towards the end. However, i won't concede to someone elses negative review. Because for all the bad parts in this movie, i say to myself, ""i do not care"". Dinosaurs really speak to us, kids like me growing up all have there fascination and love for these creatures, and so do the children of today, and future generations to come. Because in the grand scheme of thing Dinosaurs were the most successful lifeforms on this planet, and humans will still have the shortest chapter in the history of life. And what's great about this movie, is fulfills a desire i had as a kids, and that was seeing dinosaurs co-existing alongside modern animals in the wild. I actually cried in the theatre when i saw those scenes, since it brought some really wonderful nostalgic memories. So don't go into this film thinking you'll get a piece of art, or award winning material, simply go in and except to have fun and be entertained by a film you know is going to worth rewatching over and over again.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Spielberg is one of the producers of this film and I believe he was involved as a producer in most if not all of the films in the series. However, his artistic guidance seems to be absent in this episode. If this is the final in the series, it is one devoid of glory. If others will follow, we can hope that it is only one of the weakest episodes and that a recovery will follow. Anyway, 'Jurassic World Dominion' disappointed me.Crichton's book and the first film were a cautionary parable about the dangers of science out of control. It's the theme of 'Frankenstein' only the monsters are not human but dinosaurs reborn through the wonders of genetic engineering. When he decided to make the first 'sequel', the main theme became the coexistence of humanity with the world of dinosaurs on our fragile planet. The latest series and this last one in particular add new themes related to the control of large corporations over advanced technologies and the ethical implications of genetic manipulations when they are carried out not 'only' on dinosaurs but also on human beings. These are interesting and important topics. The treatment reserved to each of them is the real problem with this film.The opening scenes and several episodes throughout the action contain a few promises, unfortunately unfulfilled. The biology of dinosaurs imagined by the authors of the film and special effects experts is one of the most diverse, which allows not only playing with sizes (from pet dinosaurs to the biggest carnivorous giants in the history of the planet) but also with the roles that they can play in people's lives. The chases in the prairie where the dinosaurs run alongside the wild horses, the bar populated by various characters, which quotes 'Star Wars', the circus arena where one of the violent confrontations takes place are each beautiful ideas that unfortunately are not supported even in terms of time screen nor as an action item. Instead, we are dealing with endless scenes - let's call them action - in which the soundtrack is dominated by the most diverse roars and which probably intent to be scary, but in reality become a little ridiculous through repetition. The head of a large global corporation that plays with the magic wand of genetic engineering without caring about the risks is the lead Bad Guy, presented as a kind of clone of Steve Jobs, another slightly questionable idea and in any case already seen before. There are many other good ideas in the script, unfortunately most of them are abandoned before they can make a consistent impact.'Jurassic World Dominion' introduces viewers to three generations of characters and actors. The younger appear here for the first time and will perhaps represent central characters in the following films, if the confrontations or coexistence of humanity with the world of dinosaurs continue on the screen. The middle generation is the one introduced by the first 'Jurassic World' together with the theme of human cloning, superficially addressed here, which also deserved a more careful and deeper treatment. Finally, the three main characters of the 1993 film, played by Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, reappear here. Time has not forgiven them much and their impact is mediocre, especially since they are made to repeat roughly what they had done 29 calendar (and maybe also cinematic) years ago. I generally have a reluctance about sequels that rehash characters with decades of their distant past success. The scriptwriters of these films should really ask themselves what the viewers want: the originals with the risks of degradation caused by the passage of time, or new actors to creatively continue the ideas and conflict lines? About the same as the concert reunion of rock idols from half a century ago, forgive me for the comparison. If it is not refreshed, the Jurassic series risks remaining frozen in history.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Clair was totally opposite to her character from the first movie and they made Owen into an average action movie hero to save the world wow wow wowthey are just making billions of dollars from the success of the first trilogy the new trilogy felt like downgraded ver of the original trilogy.

The creators did little to nothing to make the story exciting and spectacular, even though all needed is here: famous actors, impressive visual effects, nostalgic 90s notes, set by Steven Spielberg himself, and, finally, audience missing theatrical experience that, luckily, is alive again. If we talk about money, the movie is a profitable mosquito with a piece of the 1993 original's DNA, bringing $1 billion in Universal's pocket. But what about experience? In this case we got a loud unimaginative fly, struggling in air in front of audience's eyes, while potentially interesting ideas are flushed away.The movie was promoted as ""the epic conclusion of Jurassic era"", and it turned out that the franchise has nothing more to offer except ruined ideas, Perhaps, in 14 years Universal will try to bring dinosaurs to life again, as it happened with the first ""Jurassic World"" entry. Though it's only the matter of time when we find out what ""Jurassic World Dominion"" was: a mosquito stuck in amber and containing the piece of DNA of an adventure as spectacular as dinosaurs themselves, or a big locust destroying the Universal's farm that brings huge profit to the studio and pleasure to people. A locust created during the failed experiment with the use of genes of a worthy blockbuster, Spielberg's motives and 90s nostalgia.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But this time, in ANOTHER park. Wow. Truly, fascinating.Plus, as a casual viewer, the relentless nostalgia bait did absolutely nothing for me so the desperate attempts to pander to die-hard fans were wasted on me.The movie was dull. It shouldn't have been dull. But it was dull. Tediously dull. Very, very dull. I found it dull. Big, monotonous & dull.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Unfortunately that is more or less the only reason to watch this movie.I really do not understand how the Hollywood idiots can decide to spend loads of money on special effects but not bother to get a decent story/script writer? I mean come on, the story of this movie is just another thirteen on a dozen ""big companies are bad"" story with dinosaurs thrown in.The story is convoluted to say the least and there is as much logic in it as you would expect from a Hollywood writer hack. Things more or less just happen and the ""heroes"" fight off one dinosaur attack after another on their way to the bad gay without ever tiring. And why the hell can Hollywood never produce a movie where the ""heroes"" doesn't just stare like idiots at something until they are screwed?Idiotic nonsens like being able to train a dinosaur to home in on someone like a heat seeking missile and chase them forever after having pointed a laser marker on them for a couple of seconds is also the usual unintelligent Hollywood nonsense that just ruins a movie for anyone with anything like average intelligence.They brough back some of the old characters but they do not really help. The mostly act like they cannot wait to get paid and get out of there. Jeff Goldblum is his usual climate cult procelyte. I did not really like him in the first movie and he is even worse in this one. The bad guy totally lacks charisma. The only character I really liked was DeWanda Wise as Kyle Watts.It is really a shame to see another franchise destroyed by today's Hollywood morons. I've been a dinosaur fan since I was a kid and when the first Jurassic Parc came out with real, life like dinosaurs it was just wow. But now, not even the special effects can save this movie. It is not a good movie, plain and simple.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

From the beginning to the end of the movie, there are tons of action-packed scenes to keep you literally jumping for more. Fans of the Jurassic Park franchise will not be disappointed.Jurassic World Dominion centers around two different storylines. On one hand, Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), a teenager, who happens to be a clone of her biological mother, is kidnapped and taken to a company called Biosyn to become a science experiment so scientists can learn how her biological mother created her. On the other hand, her parents, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), set out on an adventure to rescue her. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) is suspicious of the works of Biosyn and its animal experiments, as well as its attempt to take over the food chain. She brings in Alan Grant (Sam Neill) to help her stop Biosyn from taking over. The two storylines eventually combine for one suspenseful adventure that happens to take place all while dinosaurs are threatening the characters' existence.The main characters in this film are Maisie, Claire, Owen, Alan, Ellie, and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). There are references and character appearances from other movies in the Jurassic Park franchise. I enjoyed seeing how characters from different parts of the film join together to save Maisie and end up trying to save each other and become a family while working together. There are some funny scenes throughout the film, and I loved seeing the characters communicating with the dinosaurs and even making them promises. The movie takes you on an emotional rollercoaster as you root for the good guys to not only survive but to win.This film touches on family and whether or not dinosaurs and humans can co-exist. You'll have to watch the movie to find out. While I highly enjoyed Jurassic World Dominion, this film may not be suitable for people who have certain fears/anxieties or even suffer from PTSD. Parents should look out for scenes with extreme violence, gory deaths, and loads of jump scares.I give Jurassic World Dominion 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 12 to 18, plus adults. This film roars into theaters on June 10, 2022. By Tiana S., KIDS FIRST!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The franchise is big but so are the special effects. I don't wait for super duper story. I want action, great effects, scenes that make my pulse react plus I need to feel for the actors. I've got all of that with each movie and even though this one here has a lot of lengths (especially before the island) it is still great and is an perfect good bye for all the fans that have been with the movies from the start.

The special effects are great, so there's that.But overall the new Jurassic World Dominion movie is a bomb. As in not a good one. Dumb plot, ridiculous premises and same ol' same ol' stuff. The idea that these creatures and people would live together in cities is off the charts. One scene shows kids at the park with ducks and little dino's running around. What do they think dinosaurs eat? Another scene has the Pyro Raptor living in a frozen cold climate. Not a place a cold blooded reptile would be.In the end there's not enough Chris Pratt and Jeff Goldblum and too much Sam Neill and Laura Dern. All chasing after a cute (Isabella Sermon) but unlikable girl who was kidnapped for some other ridiculously 'out there' reason. Truthfully I fell asleep in the middle.

It's already been torn to pieces by critics but I want to join in too on this bismal film. I'm gonna start with the unengaging and frankly boring plot. There is just so little substance and what you're left with is a generic storyline which has been done countless times before and even done within the film franchise itself. The villain lacks any clear motive and Scott's performance is pretty weak in the role. The rest of the performances from the original Jurassic park films and returning cast from Jurassic world are also weak and wooden lacking any depth to them. It felt like there was just no chemistry between them on screen. This made it a grueling task to have to soldier on through the boring scenes which sadly is most of the film. Items very apparent this film was made to cash in on the Jurassic Park nostalgia aspect seeing old characters come back to the big screen. This film just doesn't know what it wants to be, the humour falls flat and the thrilling scenes which are supposed to be tense never had me anxious as I didn't care for the characters at all. To conclude I don't think you should watch this film just watch Spielberg's classic Jurassic Park which is 10x better.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

First off, The acting was atrocious. There was Overacting by some, and a laxk of acting by others. The CGI was putrid, it was like watching a sci fi channel movie. The pacing was entirely wrong and made the action unbalanced. And even the opening scene, a faux news intro, was unnecessary and lazy exposition - it showed just how poorly the writers put the script together. The sets looked like they could've come from a sitcom. The original soundtrack from the movies was replaced by an endless supply of generic video game music. Just everything about this movie sucked, from beginning to end.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

With an incredibly captivating premise, Colin Trevorrow ignores the fascinating years of mankind trying to deal with the chaos of dinosaurs repopulating Earth, opting instead to write a generic, formulaic, surprisingly tedious screenplay.In addition to the lousy character treatment, the cast is divided into two storylines focused on nonsensical, bland rescue and espionage missions, placing dinosaurs on the back burner during the excessively long runtime.Action sequences reach drastically low entertainment levels, sometimes imperceptible due to erratic camera work and choppy editing.The cast, visuals, and score might save this from being a complete trainwreck, but not from miserably failing to deliver an epic conclusion to a saga that deserved nothing less than that.""Rating: D.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

How many movies dealing with the same subject over and over again can match the dinosaur saga for so long? It is the suggested interaction of dinosaurs and humans which never happened in history, having lived many millions of years apart, long before people roamed the Earth. It's the fantasy that draws the young and old together in this imaginary world.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Is this stupid or what?The only good thing was seeing the original Jurassic Park crew again.But there's no classic Dino story. Like they say: Too many cooks spoil the broth. This is a classic example of that. Too much is happening at the same time with all sorts of Dinos, locusts and normal gun and fist fights between humans.

On paper, every element in this bloated, nostalgia-bait ridden film should have tricked my lizard brain (pun intended) into clapping, cheering, and laughing as intended. The problem is that none of these elements blended together to create a product worth being excited about.I grew up in the late 90's and Jurassic Park was always in the rotation of movies to watch on Friday night. The scene of the T-Rex escaping its paddock and threatening our heroes in the first act of that film still gives me goosebumps to this day and inspired a life-long hobby in me as a film enthusiast.Jurassic World: Dominion forces my childhood heroes into a narrative that doesn't honor the legacy of the franchise or need them at all. This film felt frustrating in that it actively splits our attention between caring about two narratives that are happening simultaneously but don't converge until the third act in the least satisfying way.It could be construed as a bit needless to attack the writing in the dinosaur movie, but Michael Crichton, David Koepp, and Steven Spielberg demonstrated 29 years ago that it's possible to inspire feelings of wonderment, fear, and the call to adventure in a blend of genres that was nearly universally accepted and beloved. Jurassic World: Dominion would have done well to learn from its predecessor. The main characters are indestructible, the story devoid of the moral theming that inspired the series, and the plot unnecessary. The characters learn nothing by the end of the two hour and twenty six minute run time, and the world unchanged in the end by the plot of the film.""You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you wanna sell it."" - Dr. Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park (1993)On a final note, I do want to mention some positives. The visual effects are well executed for the most part. The dinosaurs look good and feel like real, tangible threats to our characters. For the most part, the acting is fine despite the lackluster writing supporting the performers. The film is also shot well, with a variety of settings for our characters to travel through. It's a shame that these positives fall victim to the meteoric calamity that is this film's plot.4/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The effort to create emotional attachment to the dinosaurs felt forced at times and manipulative. The woke ecological message mingled I didn't help things. I get the intention it was the execution that failed. Hokey trite script with a rehash of the other films that made no sense at times didn't help either. No matter bad you want it to no one can save this mangled mess. Glad I didn't pay to see this in the movie theater.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Acting wise I want to say it excelled in but alas, it really didn't. Which is a huge shame as I'm usually a fan of the actors and actresses who were involved.The plot was ridiculous and difficult to follow with many plot holes and unbelievability. Apart from perhaps Dichen Lachman's character all of the villains were entirely unthreatening and huge pushovers, there was no competent opposition to our heroes which does not make for an enjoyable watch. On the plus side up and coming actress Isabella Sermon did a competent job with the script she had. As I'd previously mentioned the acting did not excel or live up to what it should be with the usually high standard of the cast but it wasn't disastrous, Sam Neil, Mamoudou Athie, and especially Jeff Goldblum were probably the best of the lot but they couldn't in any way save the film with the awful plot and writing it had.3/10: The filmmakers obviously thought that style and good special effects alone could carry the film - to make a long story short they categorically could not.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I call it a review for practice cause there's already thousands of reviews and doubt mine will get read. Many people have said it but I will say it again this is an action movie with Dinosaurs in it much like how they turned the Fast and Furious franchise into action movies with some cars in it. They basically did what Ghostbusters afterlife did which was attract the audience by bringing in the original cast that was mostly what drew me in though it looked like a pretty decent trailer too. This is Hollywood's new thing either bring back the original cast or make a sequel to a movie that was made 20 years ago. I. E Coming 2 America/Maverick. Granted I did like Top Gun but it was nothing new. What happened in this film was new to Jurassic Park films in a horribly disastrous way. I still don't understand the clone plot or whatever the child was. I was so bored with the locust plot I stopped trying to even follow it. Now here's the ironic part I actually was the most annoyed by the returning cast. I found Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern very annoying and Sam Neil must be getting a bit Joe Bidenish in his old age because they hardly gave him any lines (maybe so he wouldn't forget them) or screen time(never show him running or doing any action). Laura Dern was trying so hard to be sexy it was very off-putting and honestly just made her look older. Ian was always supposed to be an annoying character but it's like they turned up the volume on this film. The biggest problem though is I constantly kept feeling as if I was watching two different movies. The story was all over the place, it didn't feel like a Jurassic Park movie, it was too long and too boring at times. Gotta give it to Chris though he is a phenomenal action star. I loved the hot black chick towards the end of the film. She was very watchable, very likable and action is her forte. The only Jurassic world movie that was vaguely good was the first one and it was all downhill from there. I think most would agree Jurassic Park didn't even need a Trilogy. The first two were enough. They disappointed us, they knew they would but they also knew they'd get our money and they did.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It has so much of action, edge of the seat thrill, survival scenes around lots of dinosaurs.VFX is great, background score is what you need and fast paced action.

This cheesy sequel with the usual clichés on running from dangerous animals only really has a simple message: the glorification of gene modification. The movie's content needs less attention than the message it conveys: ""Curing disease"" and ""improving our foodsources"" is the cliché freecard for all games people allow themselves to play God, conveniently forgetting who would be benefiting from all such achievements, while the rest would never be allowed to be blessed by it. Just watch Elysium for what that would look like. Or think about modified viruses let loose from some obscure foreign lab, for that matter..
As if curing disease or modifying cropse would change anything about the fact of mortality. It's like allowing yourself to drink ten times as much before you get drunk: the result is the same, it's just your bar tab that gets a lot longer. Since it does not exactly solve the issue of overpopulation (imagine people suddenly living twice as long, global population would blow through the roof with an insane amount of people of old age that would need to be taken care of, since nobody would want to work for 100 years, collapse of the global pension system, etc.), let me take an educated guess who the select few would be to benefit from all these ""fantastic gifts of science"": definitely not the masses..
This is the wet dream of the power hungry due to their fear of being mortal: mortality means that at some point you will have to face your demons and boy, do they have a BIG closet of those!The irony: at the same time the movie proves that such dangerous science will always be abused, neither can it be controlled. The arrogance of the producers of this movie is to propagate something that is simply wrong. Guess it needs an audience of brainwashed to eat their garbage..
Oh, and welcome to the future where men are not needed! Let's just create pregnancies out of thin air and do away with men alltogether.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Jurassic Park should have only been 1 movie, but let's be real, the producers weren't going to pass up the opportunity to make money on something as attractive as dinosaurs, even if for this they had to sacrifice the quality of the stories, among other things.In this film in particular, there is the complex issue of giving a believable plot. We know that everything on the screen is implausible, but that doesn't necessarily make it unbelievable. Well JW: Dominion fails massively on this. Nothing is believable. There is a fatal combination of poorly achieved factors, such as editing, script and visual effects. If these pillars fail, we have a tedious, messy, and horrible-looking movie. Dinosaurs never feel like part of the landscape. It's too noticeable that they are a digital addition. And the puppets are downright laughable. Unbelievably, almost 30 years after the original Jurassic Park, they still can't top those visuals and practicalities.If this movie doesn't kill the series, I hope they don't make another one to do it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Big business is killing our food supply and abusing animals as a commodity. They actively destroy our food for profit. They have no moral compass.2. Dinosaurs are special endangered species who deserve protection even though, in this movie's reality, they are an invasive species that pose danger to the human population.3. Scientists ate pure of heart truth seekers only seeking truth.Our heroes are stupid characters who can't hold our attention unless something is chasing them or something is blowing up. Seriously, there are three moments where the characters seem to not be running and screaming.Then there's Pratt hand. Apparently it just works on every Dinosaur regardless of familiarity.This movie was big, loud, nonsensical, and a waste of time. If you like that, please enjoy yourself.

It is a perfect masterpiece, that overcomes any flaw by grabbing you emotionally, as well as still being one of the most entertaining movies ever made. The sequels, while not being nearly as good, all delivered on the dinosaur action and had some good moments (the action in Lost World and 3 at times rivaled the action in that original movie, and World had some excellent ideas and moments of awe). But each one carried with it a little less of the magic than the last one. Here at Jurassic World Dominion that magic is gone. Its been flushed down the toilet!The film has 2 stories. Owen and Claire are rescuing a kidnapped girl and baby raptor. And then Alan Grant, Ellie Setler and Ian Malcolm are doing some espionage to stop an evil corporation from doing some dodgy stuff. Oh, also there are dinosaurs...sometimes, when the script needs them.There is no sugar coating it. This was terrible. Absolutely terrible! Fallen Kingdom, while not being a film I like, had a weird charm to it; great visuals, good direction and a Corman-esk final act. This, I appreciate now, elevated it from being garbage, even if it had none of what made the original good in the first place. So, and you read right, Dominion lacks what made Fallen Kingdom 'good'.Other than the nostalgia of seeing Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldbloom together again, this film has nothing going for it. It is completely soulless. The story doesn't work, and often uses action scenes to make it look like we are going somewhere. Most of the new actors are giving horrible performances. The music sucks, unless they use the original score in poorly placed moments. It is cripplingly boring on top of it all.The rest of the series coasted on dino action when all else failed. This was why I went to see this one. But even that is a let down. There are many types of dinosaurs here, but the dinosaurs feel secondary to everything else that is going on. The action rings hollow. Not to spoil, but the ending action scene left so little impact, it was shocking. You can't even enjoy the effects this time as they are easily the worst of the whole series. The CGI is fine, if a little wonky at times, but the animatronics are worse than those on the theme park ride. Stan Winston will be rolling in his grave.There are moments here and there. A scene involving a dinosaur with enormous claws was genuinely well done. Sam Neill and the others are great to watch. A tunnel scene with the dilophosaurus was creepy. And there are a good number of moments that had me laughing at the stupidity and absurdity of it all.In the end, that first film being my favourite of all time and the rest being good (or at least dumb) fun, I really didn't like this one. I am unsure as to whether I hate it or not, but that I am contemplating this, it is just sad to me. I felt like I was watching my copy of Jurassic Park burn. I don't care if they make any more, this is the last one for me.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's a really boring and uninteresting plot that jumps around a lot with a couple excellent action scenes, and a few terrible ones. The first 30 minutes is used to just catch up on all the characters and it doesn't really have any special moments to make it interesting, even the legacy characters coming back didn't feel as awesome as it should've. For the second act it's mostly 2 different plot points happening at once, the legacy characters trying to expose the CEO bad guy, and the new characters trying to rescue Maisie and Blue's child. Neither are super interesting but the new characters end up in a Malta action sequence that is absolutely amazing. In the meantime the legacy characters are just trying to extract some DNA and it's not really that interesting and not much really happens. A couple really good action scenes with the new characters and then they all converge for the final act, which is the biggest disappointment of it all. There's a few fun interactions between all of the characters, but the action itself is slow and meanders without being really tense. In the end the characters just kinda get on a helicopter and 2 dinosaurs randomly come in and fight, it's basically the end of the first Jurassic world and the second Jurassic world combined to make a really boring ending. Overall the movie underutilized its legacy characters and meanders too much with only a few excellent action scenes and a very unepic conclusion.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Jurassic Park (1993) is a great film, it's my favorite film of all time. As a kid I wore out a VHS of Jurassic Park, so needless to say I've seen it hundreds of times.I think Dominion is a good sequel, the return of the original three characters is great to see. The extended version of the film is much better than the theater version. The beginning is better and the extra 13 minutes ads a lot of script and depth to the characters. There was a lot of script and dialogue cut out of the movie for theaters.I will agree it has a lot of mindless action, lots of dinosaurs, and yes lots of CGI. But that is expected with any Jurassic Park sequel. If you watch the behind the scenes you will appreciate they did have puppetry and animatronics throughout the film. More animatronics than probably any other sequel besides the Lost World.Overall this is a very entertaining film with tons of action. The variety of different sets is also very nice to see, and of course the original three characters are wonderful to all see in a Jurassic film again.Again I don't understand all the hate on this film. If you hate this film, then how can you justify any of the sequels? Don't listen to the majority of the sheep. Be a wolf and make up your own mind.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The dinosaurs were more of a back story but it was interesting how they introduced a new plot line to make it unpredictable and exciting!

Chapter by chapter, we've gotten to know these characters well enough to call them friends, and now that the end has come, what could be more fitting than to bring them all together for one last adventure, one that will answer the questions raised in prior episodes, give us hope that the future can embrace the past, and prove that what we're becoming is better than what we've been?The answer, dear viewer, is here on the screen before us, and it is a glorious ending to one of cinema's finest storylines, and a truly worthy coda to this uniquely human journey. Well done, everyone! And thank you to all of the artists and craftsmen who have made this possible, and to the father of it all, Michael Crichton. He would have been proud of you all...Mike Ferguson

I mean Jurassic World's bread and butter is selling kids dinosaur crap 24/7.I love it when actors turn the words of a script into a real moment, y'know, what we call good acting? Yeah in this movie all the acting is in relation to a computer generated image, it can't possibly be real or dynamic because the shot requires the actors to be secondary to computer crap.I will accept a check.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Time to go the way of the dinosaurs","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8222536/?ref_=tt_urv","stilloopless1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2452576/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2022","The summer box office continues to heat up with this weeks' release of Jurassic World Dominion, the sixth and final installment of the popular movie franchise based on Michael Crichton's novels. Twenty-nine years after Jurassic Park, dinosaurs are living and hunting alongside humans taxing the fragile balance of nature all over the world. Well, that's what we're led to believe is the setup for Jurassic World Dominion, however, the movie we actually get is an altogether different beast.Jurassic World Dominion is essentially two different films with the original trio of Sam Neil (Alan Grant), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Jeff Goldblum (Ian Malcolm) reuniting in one story (the more interesting of the two in my opinion) and Chris Pratt (Owen Grady) and Bryce Dallas Howard (Claire Dearing) picking up and continuing their story from Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom. Eventually the two stories meet and everything is brought to a conclusion.Sadly, the conclusion, as well as the ride leading up to it is far from spectacular or overall satisfying.The pacing in Jurassic World Dominion is clunky and uneven, particularly in the beginning. Many of the themes are heavy handed and preachy to the point of making you feel you're sitting in a lecture hall. Oddly enough, Ian's actual lecture in the film is more entertaining and thought provoking than the bludgeoning messaging throughout the rest of the film. The call backs to previous films in many cases are stale. With the exception of the original Big Three, the returning characters are lifeless (in Pratt's case the film plays more like a contractual obligation) and uninspired. BD Wong's Dr. Wu takes an unexpected turn and the resolution of his story line feels unearned. New characters aren't fleshed out and act more as props to get from point a to point b than characters.Worse still, Jurassic World Dominion, is a dinosaur movie that has little to do with dinosaurs. Again, Goldblum's Ian says it best when he goes off on the seduction of dinos excusing what's going on. A note that the writers should of taken when sussing out the story. Dinosaurs are freely living among humans, what's that like? Dunno, it's glossed over save for a few references. I mean at one point in this 2 hour 26 minute film you go a good half hour to forty minutes without seeing or hearing ANYTHING about the dinosaurs.Serious bait and switch as well as a major disappointment.The biggest saving grace of Dominion is the legacy characters, especially Goldblum's Ian. The wit, charm, and humor is classic. All three actors seem to be having a blast and it shows and you feel it ever time they're on screen. When you get the dinosaurs they look amazing. These bad boys never fail to delight.All told Jurassic World Dominion looks great, has some shining moments, but ultimately is lifeless. If this is what the franchise has to offer, it's time to let it go the way of actual dinosaurs.Jurassic World Dominion gets a disappointing 5 from me.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The new characters vs the original characters. In spots the CGI is bad and will age horribly. Although it's not a Roger Corman film.

My feelings about this are pretty fresh and may mellow over the coming weeks, but I was not impressed.This is essentially The Rise of Skywalker for the JP franchise. Lots of fan service, lots of Spielberg references, lots of ""remember that from the previous films??!"" moments. It lacked any compelling story, making a Monsanto-type corporation the antagonist/bad guy with heroes/protagonists that make nonsensical decisions that serve only to propel the audience to the next action sequence.I can't tell if this movie needed to be split into two films so each could breathe on their own and develop its own story, or if this script just needed several more rewrites to get to a better form. At 2h30m, its a bloated frenzied mess that has huge holes in the plot, massive leaps of logic, and no real sense of what it wanted to say.The first JP was a marvel. Groundbreaking visual effects, one of the most memorable scores of the last 30 years, timeless quotes and sequences that entertain my kids as much as it entertained me when I first saw it. And no real heavey plot driven story. It was pure escapism. Jurassic World: Dominion is the sort of Frankenstein's monster it is trying to warn the world about. These hybrid dinosaurs, these man-made attempts to recapture the natural elegance of something less engineered, are to be feared as well as the people that seek the power to make and control them. The same could be said for the current decisionmakers that greenlit this to the theaters. Lots of recycled parts from other better movies to produce something loud, brash and just unintelligible.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Still, it's by far the best of the sequels.The dinosaurs look and feel incredible, and in this film they are everywhere. There are a couple main story threads that bring the main characters together, and one is more interesting than the other, but both hold your attention- and once the main characters are together, there is great chemistry there.They didn't bring the old characters in for a quick cameo at the end, either, they are integral to the plot and drive things forward in their own right.Jeff Goldblum, particularly, is just so entertaining to watch.Also, it's nonsense to say this movie is ""woke"" just because they added a young black female character to the cast. She was a good character. A ""Han Solo type"" pilot who doesn't want to get involved but can't help herself.Then the other half are mad that Chris Pratt was allowed to be in this film even though he's been publicly open about his faith- it must be exhausting to try to entertain people these days.I brought my 13 year old son to this and I'm so glad I did. This film was a massive spectacle and at the end it felt like we had just finished something special. The long runtime flew by.I don't know what some reviewers were expecting- perhaps the first film again- this isn't that. But it's fun and tense and amazing. I think it's become in fashion to bash these films (and the last one may have deserved it) but this one is very good.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Yes, it has had its up and downs, and will never catch the ""wow"" factor but a film that has dinosaurs is wow enough. The JW series have made significant changes in capturing that moment to put into their own mark in the franchise, which I think this chapter is the strongest and most entertaining.The nostalgia aspect of the film may lead me to being a biased to why I enjoyed it as much as I did.... but everything else this movie offered was great, though at first I thoughts the pacing of the movie dragged but coming away and really thinking about the story it's just a minimal let down for me.The throwbacks in these movies like to add are an amusing part of why I enjoy the JW series, and they do not disappoint in JW3.Overall this movie is the best of the JW series which old and new character times being used on screen will have you enjoy every moment, that's also including the dinosaurs adding to the enjoyment. DO NOT listen to the negative comments before seeing this movie, and save the agreements or disagreement tIll after you have seen JW3.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I saw this movie on June 9th, and I believe that this is a movie that should be loved and cherished. The screenwriters and the director did a great job at ending the franchise, unless another filmmaker will picks up this franchise. This movie is made for everyone, kids, teenagers and adults. Everyone should find this movie amazing. This is just as good as the first two movies. I think viewers now a days love to complain about everything. Jurassic World Dominion has everything that a Jurassic Park movie should have in it.

It focused on large cat size crop eating locust, a girl who was miraculously birth due to a lizard gene her mother injected in herself. One of those lizards that don't need a male to reproduce. The dinosaurs didn't look realistic like I would have thought they'd look considering advances in CGI technology over the years. The actors are good actors but they just didn't have a good story line to compliment their craft. So I'm not criticizing the actors. My criticism is towards the producer of the film and the writers. The cgi could've been better especially when the money is there to get quality cgi design but, I guess this isn't a Avatar movie so. I was basically another dinosaur movie that wasn't really different from the others before it. They were actually good because we were first introduced to the images but, as time goes by, we expect those images to improve, get better, look even more realistic. The baby triceratops for instance look like robots mimicking what a baby triceratops would be like but, it was just too robotic in my opinion.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Though action scenes was good and the appearance of new creature type dinosaurs was a bit of refreshment. But still it doesn't work for the story. Bringing back old characters is good to see but still you need to build the storyline in a proper way so that the old ones can fit properly. And the director & writers have failed to do this.

SKIP IT!The first 15 min is basically a commercial for PETA, but we'll call it PETD (People for the Ethical Treatment of Dinosaurs) where a group of people risks their lives to rescue a baby dino from confinement.Then we see several minutes of how science is the only truth, science is the best, and how science has the answers and will soon conquer cancer and every other disease that plagues humans... Which is absolutely amazing! I wonder if science will have an answer for sin and death, too. *Rolls eyes*The next few minutes are about how humans aren't special and we don't have dominion, which is a subtle attack against God's Word that tells us...Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have DOMINION over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth"" Genesis 1:26-28and...And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. Genesis 2:7And...So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. Genesis 1:27Then there's 30 min of predictable action in a remote jungle-ish area where a group of not-special, ""special"" people are forced to face off against the monstrous beasts...oh, and, yes, !SPOLIER ALERT! Dinos eat the bad guy at the end. But is that really a spoiler, though? I think not.Oh, there is a part in the movie where one person is sorta special: A brilliant woman scientist who reproduced a genetically-modified and enhanced child on her own without a man. Lord have mercy.(Oh, and why do they only show white people with meaningful relationships in this movie? The black people seem oddly placed with no development simply to hit a quota. But nevermind. I won't go there.)Finally, in the last few minutes, we get to hear all about evolution and how humans are again not special and must learn to co-exist with all creatures. Creatures?

Unfortunately there's plenty of way less entertaining stuff as well. Dominion suffers more than most from Hollywood's seeming obsession with making even the most vacuous popcorn flicks as long as possible. The plot meanders along in two parts (one for the Jurrasic Park characters, one for the Jurrasic World ones) so that they can come together for what would be the last act if this film actually had structure.What is the plot that needs so much attention? You guessed it, evil bioengineering company in charge of dinosaurs. Fifth times a charm I guess. Not that the company have learned any lessons themselves, hiring Jeff Goldblums famous genetic sceptic Ian Malcom to talk about how great their genetic program is. Goldblum is the only real bright spot amongst a returning cast that are clearly going through the motions, although newcomer DeWanda Wise adds some spirit to proceedings and really needed more screen time.The franchise has long teased dinosaurs running amuck in the world at large and there is a little of that here, the highlight bering some unsuspecting cafe goers getting munched, but not enough to freshen up proceedings. It feels as if there aren't enough dinosaurs on screen in general and there really isn't enough imagination on display when they are. There are only so many time you can watch two dinosaurs roar at each other and take turns biting necks until one is thrown to the ground before the encounters feel as stale as the evil corporation plot.Had Dominion been a trim hour and forty minutes it might have been worth a watch for dinosaur fans (although probably not T-Rex ones) at least but at over two and a half hours it's impossible to recommend taking that much time out your day.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

""Jurassic World: Dominion"" opens with a gripping portrayal of humans coexisting with dinosaurs, showcasing diverse reactions and the majestic beauty of these creatures. However, the film struggles with its dual plotlines, one of which-focused on Biocyn's creation of super locusts targeting rival crops-feels out of place in a dinosaur survival story. The motivations behind Biocyn's actions remain unclear, and the overuse of growling and snarling effects undermines the tension, making the dinosaurs feel like secondary elements rather than the main focus.Rating: 5/10Characters and Performances
The blended family dynamic featuring Pratt and Howard provides a comforting familiarity, while the return of fan-favorite velociraptor Blue is underutilized. The reappearance of original characters like Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), Alan Grant, and Ian Malcolm brings excitement, though their roles often feel wasted on less engaging subplots. The attempt to redeem Henry Wu and revive Dodgeson's character falls flat, failing to evoke much interest.Rating: 6/10Pacing
The film's pacing suffers from a slow start and an uneven buildup of stakes. While the action sequences and chases are entertaining, they often stretch believability and lack originality, making the film feel like a series of repetitive chase scenes.Rating: 2/10Direction/Cinematography
The action sequences are marred by blurriness, and attempts at nostalgic cinematography often miss the mark. Chris Pratt's repetitive hand-extending gesture to calm dinosaurs becomes tiresome. The frequent encounters with new deadly dinosaurs, meant to build suspense, feel contrived and overdone.Rating: 4/10Visual Effects
The fast-paced action scenes detract from the detailed depiction of dinosaurs, and the use of animatronics often looks cheap rather than nostalgic. Wide panning shots and CGI, such as the flaming locusts, are visually stunning, but close-up animatronic dinosaurs disrupt the immersion.Rating: 4/10Sound
The soundtrack effectively uses soothing music to evoke empathy for dinosaurs and employs epic trumpet and brass for scale. The classic theme returns with Alan Grant, adding a nostalgic touch. However, excessive roaring detracts from scenes needing tension, though the slow piano theme at the end provides a fitting nostalgic close to the saga.Rating: 4/10Overall
""Jurassic World: Dominion"" is a mixed bag, with strong performances and moments of visual and auditory brilliance overshadowed by a disjointed plot and pacing issues. Despite its ambitious scope, it fails to fully capture the magic of its predecessors.Overall Rating: 4.3/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What makes the film even better is that Sam Neill and Laura Dern reprise their respective roles as Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler along with Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm who now works for Biosyn a genetics company much similar to InGen involved with bringing prehistoric locusts back to life specifically to consume rival crops. Anyways focusing more on the film, the visual effects such as the dinosaurs are incredibly jaw-dropping and realistic at the same time. There more times where the dinosaurs are animatronics and sometimes there's ones that are computer-generated by Industrial Light & Magic (the same company that did the visual effects for several film franchises such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, Terminator, Men In Black, Pirates of The Caribbean, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe). However, there were approximately 18 animatronic dinosaurs of various sizes along with some being used by puppetry. Despite that this film has gained several negative reviews outside of the U. S. territory making it $55.7 million, the film has projected to gross around $125 million in the U. S. from 4,676 theaters during it's opening weekend. If your a Jurassic World fanatic waiting for the ending of the series, then I would totally recommend on seeing this in theaters.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Dinosaurs let loose on the world and returning fan favourite characters from the OG trilogy should be a slam dunk, but the result is an overcrowded and sprawling film that lacks focus and originality.There are positives with this film. Some scenes were incredibly tense and well executed. A jungle scene with Bryce and a scene on an icy river were very well done I thought, but sequences like this were too few and far between.The inclusion of the legacy characters (Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern) was a nice touch, particularly Goldblum who had some incredibly tongue in cheek but satisfying one liners. I do think though that the inclusion of these characters over saturated the story a bit, and perhaps they could have been confined to smaller roles as there were just too many characters and plot threads crammed into the film.I would have liked to have seen a more meaty role for Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire. I feel like she's been let down by the franchise a bit and could have grown into a more layered character.Most frustratingly though, 3 films into the franchise now and I am very tired of Chris Pratt controlling dinosaurs with his hand. This really isn't as cool as the director seems to think. I also resent the fact that we were fed another sequence where Pratt is chased by raptors while on a motorbike. All the possible dinosaurs, all the potential set pieces, and we are fed the exact same thing from the two previous movies...The dialogue is also very poor. Full of clunky exposition and goofy one liners that didn't land at all. A bit of a mess from a writing perspective.I think the word clunky sums up this movie pretty well actually. Too many characters, messy dialogue, a tad too long, glimpses of cool dinosaur action but not enough of it. There's fun to be had with this film but for the most part it is a bit of a let down.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Stayed with the story. Glad to see the original actors from Jurassic 1 in top form as well. Don't read the bad reviews, they put this in like a ""sequel"" to all the others. While this one does take place after the others, it is a stand alone story and movie all on its own. The plot is great and more believable than a few of the previous ones, which is refreshing, the action is quite well done as is the incredible CGI work. Especially the motorcycle chase, when you watch, just don't think of the other movies and you'll have a great time. I remember as a kid that all Dino movies were just claymation and ray harryhausen animation, we dreamed of movies like this, so grab some popcorn and have a great time. No foul language ( very very minimal if any) no nudity, a bit violent at times and lots of suspense, but ok for kids mature enough to handle monster movies. Great addition to the Jurassic franchise.

The inclusion of dinosaurs with feathers was a great touch and the CGI was spot on!With the old characters being back, it included some moments that felt like nudges to the older films and had a bit of a nostalgic feel.However, these things alone do not make a good film.It was as though when making the movie, everyone involved tried to squeeze in their own ideas, leaving a final disjointed feeling. Unfortunately, the story line did not flow smoothly, with certain scenes not linking well from one to the next, standard shots to build on the story being cut out and overall it made moments feel pointless.Often times characters would just appear back in the scene without any context of how they arrived there out of convenience to keep the story rolling with all the shots needed to cram in.Most of the original movies have moments that are suspenseful and rememable but nothing springs to mind with this one.Overall, it all just felt rushed from writing to the final product and maybe the crew were working to a timelimit, but they just needed to cut out some scenes and put more into others.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Trevorrow needs to stop directing Jurassic movies. He thought that by bringing in Sam Neil and Laura Dern they could save the film from an awful story. The story and soundtrack are the worst. On a story basis, he uses several homages to the original Jurassic Park that make me tear up a little, but then that moment is ruined by awful dialog or cheesy forced comedy. The acting is very forced and just very unnatural, as compared to the Jurassic Park masterpiece. There are just so many things in the story that I shake my head at.On an entertainment basis at least it has amazing sound design and fully utilized a 5.1 surround atmosphere.I wasn't willing to spend money to see this film at a theater and got lucky that Amazon Prime paid for a license for a while. This is definitely a movie that can play in the background. It doesn't require your full concentration. It's not scary, it's stupid action that is sometimes fun.It's a great action flick, but a major punch in the face to the 'Jurassic' title.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Fans should be able to agree on one thing though, it's better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Just finished watching on Peacock. The onslaught of negative reviews and the giant locusts part of plot kept me out of the theaters. Saw the first one in 1993, in the theater. None of the five followups have ever measured up. An impossibly high bar was set. When ever I watch the first movie, I still get the chills, the goosebumps, the sense of awe. It was nice seeing our original favorite 3, but I really didn't feel a sense of nostalgia. I think it was the plot, or rather plots, that distracted from the nostalgia. Yeah, there seems to be more than one plot. There's some character development, but this is a popcorn flick so confuse the audience with grand effects, some cheesy humor, and maybe you got something fun to watch.And so we are left with a very open ending, oh the possibilities. Please Hollywood take your time with the next one, flesh out a consistent plot first. Not asking for pinnacle acting or plot, just give us something with more heart and wonder, that's where the first excelled.Also, the Barbasol can of shaving cream was a nice nod and I'm very aware of how Dodgeson ended up having the can in his possession. I really do think there should've been some sort of callback to Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous. The ankylosaurus vocals immediately made me think of Bumpy, so there's that.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was wrong. The opening scene immediately sets the tone by spoon-feeding the audience Chris Pratt wrangling and taming a wild dinosaur. There is no cleverly sagacious writing here, just more explosions and dinosaur fight club from Trevorrow. The plot almost works, but feels too synthetic in having no point but to involve original cast members. The fundamental issue with the film is that, for all the grasping at nostalgia, the story is simply not set in the same world as where we want to see or remember the characters in.While the girls and bicurious Disney fans in love with Chris Pratt may like the movie, the older adults who vividly remember and cherish the first Jurassic Park as one of their favorite movies will be glad this franchise has finally been euthanized.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Then things truly fell apart at the halfway mark. The movie failed to follow this large cast and give each character justice. The cutting/editing was noticeably sloppy (and I don't consider myself a movie snob), dinosaurs constantly appeared out of nowhere and characters seemed to teleport from one location to another.

But then the daughter (or clone really) of the main characters gets kidnapped, along with a baby dinosaur, and the main character/s have to rescue them. Thus, it's about all the obstacles--the aggressive dinosaurs mainly--that they have to deal with. That's it.The cheesy lines throughout this movie become unbearable. It's also one of the most predictable movies you'll ever see. Oh, the good guy is trying to escape a dinosaur, I wonder what will happen... Oh, the bad guy is trying to escape a dinosaur, I wonder what will happen... No matter how unrealistic it might be for the good guy to survive such a situation, the movie will go for it. Now, don't get me wrong, everyone knows that this is going to be a completely unrealistic movie. But at some point, it becomes completely over the top unrealistic.I should also add, that the movie is not funny if anyone was thinking that that might save it. A lot of the movie was filmed at night, so we don't even really get to get a decent look at the dinosaurs either.So what are the positives? There aren't any major ones. As for insignificant positives, I can say that some of scenery looks nice. Or that there is 1 or 2 dinosaur chase scenes that I might give a B-. But that's about it. In summation, it's 2.5 hours of cheesy lines, poorly seen dinosaurs (because of the night), and predictable dinosaur chases.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

When Maisie and Beta (the raptor Blue's baby) are kidnapped by poachers, Clair and Owen travel across the world to find them.Dr. Sattler (Laura Dern) discovers that a new species of locust are destroying the earth's wheat supply. She enlists the help of Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) to get into the labs at BioSyn to get proof that they are manufacturing these locusts. She gets inside information from Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is a speaker at the facility.What I loved about this movie was the plot. They took two generations of Jurassic Park characters and had them in parallel storylines that eventually merge. However, up to that point, its almost two different movies and both are well written and well acted. Along the way, we get to meet a new character, Kayla (DeWanda Wise) an adventurous pilot who assists Clair and Owen look for Maisie. Her character is not as well written as the others, but Ms. Wise is a good actress and she is able to flesh out the character despite her small screen time in the first half of the movie. There is another connection to the original film in the Barbesol can that Nedry has used to smuggle the dinosaur DNA out of the complex in the first movie. In that movie he gave it to Lewis Dodgson. Now, 30 years later, Dodgson (Campbell Scott) is running Biosyn. They even bring back Dr. Wu (B. D. Wong) from the first movie.The CGI and practical effects are top notch. The legacy characters were handled with dignity and came off as more than just fan service as they are intricate to the plot. The globe trotting aspect makes it not exactly feel like a Jurassic Park movie, but it was handled so well, I didn't care. We didn't need another amusement park going haywire. This movie is a fine conclusion to the second trilogy and hopefully, if they make more, they will do as well with them as this one.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Where to start! If it was some other movie in which dinosaurs were still alive then it'd have been actually good. Why? Because then you wouldn't expect dinosaurs much but their cameos would be exciting. Yup, dinosaurs were only making cameos and it wasn't about them at all. Based on that it was very disappointing because I didn't feel like I was watching a movie that's in the Jurassic park franchise. There were two different stories and none of them was related to Jurassic park/dinosaurs. It felt like one of that action oriented movies where heros do some stunts and come out scatheless. If I wanted this, I'd watch any typical Marvel movie.Before I begin, the Dimetrodon scene was absolutely freaking marvelous. I looved it so much. But again, everyone comes out alive. It's not even about that but you won't even have a single scratch, that's not possible.I also cannot believe that I'm saying this but Laura Dern's acting in the beginning was so so extra. I don't know why because she's a good actor but she was overacting in the beginning. Someone told Jeff to forget about about his character Ian and act like how he did in his Cameo in FRIENDS and he took that seriously. Sam Neill didn't have many lines so can't say how he acted and same with Chris Pratt. Bryce Dallas's character story had nothing to do with Jurassic park or World.There was absolutely no need for the character Maisie to be in this movie let alone lead one of the story arcs. Now when I think of it, the character didn't need to be in fallen Kingdom too. Also, movies in general should give up its typical ""I'm a rebel independent mannerless teenager"" characters. There was also no need for the new characters. We know why they're here and not so surprisingly, they were righteous. Could have included Ian's daughter Kelly from The Lost world instead of new characters. Such a huge missed opportunity.This also wasn't what they promised.(Dinosaurs and humans together in a chaotic world) They want us to be okay with the fact that they've trained dinosaurs like lions or some other big cats and they won't harm humans. Others that are not trained and are pure wild, they're not harming humans as well. Yup! You heard it right.One thing I like is that at least dinosaurs don't look or act like cartoons like they did in fallen Kingdom. Also, I'm glad no one cracked stupid jokes like when they made the character Claire joke in fallen Kingdom ""see, not a t-rex"". No one screamed like a cartoon like that guy in fallen Kingdom and I appreciate that.You're also supposed to be okay with the fact that t-rex/rexy always wins. Don't get me wrong, I love rexy too but c'mon like you've an apex predator like giganotosaurus and you're saying that it's easy for it to just get killed.You're also supposed to be ok with the fact that therizinosaurus couldn't see Claire and seemingly appeared blind but towards the end could suddenly see conveniently. Btw the scene with Claire and therizinosaurus that you see in the trailer is the only one of the few scenes that's breathtaking to watch and should have been left for the movie.There was absolutely no suspense, tension, horror or mystery. After a while, you'd figure out that all the characters are immortals. You'd figure out after a while what's going to happen.It wouldn't feel like you're getting goosebumps or at least feeling significant excitement seeing the OGs aka Alan, Ellie and Ian on the screen in this and honestly that was disappointing.It wasn't so so so bad and gets fun after the first half but I had to watch the lost world after it to appreciate the franchise for what it was.Fallen Kingdom is still the worse one for me but I can't believe it's the second worse.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Looking at the trailer I'm guessing it will be brighter in Blu Ray format. There's not a lot of great 3D moments in it, either but the movie still works. If you like the behind the scenes videos I'm sure when it's released the disk will be chock full with info.

Jurassic Park is my favorite film of all time, I have a deep love for The Lost World, JP3 is a pretty big miss for me, but I adore those first two movies. Jurassic World and it's sequel, Fallen Kingdom, are fairly decent dinosaur-themed actioners that have an Amblin flourish to them, even if their disconnect from the original films is felt. Jurassic World: Dominion promised to bring dinosaurs to civilization, a near-apocalyptic scenario for our heroes to survive in and try to resolve. Added to that notion was the fact that this film would tie the two eras of this franchise together, bridging a gap that shouldn't have been severed in the first place. Colin Trevorrow, the writer/director of this entire World reboot, promised that everything had been leading to this film. So to say that this movie breaking that promise was disappointing would be an understatement. Instead of focusing on the planet's ecological tug-of-war with gigantic prehistoric beasts, Dominion hones in on Monsanto-style GMOs, corporate espionage, human clones, giant bugs and moustache-twirling super villains. Some of these ideas are very Michael Crichton-esque and its admirable that he wanted to pay homage to the late creator of the source material, but sometimes the obvious path is the correct one. We wanted to see dinosaurs wreaking havoc on society. It turns out we can get along with dinosaurs just fine. It's Interstellar-style crop droughts we need to worry about. Despite a poorly conceived, convoluted story, Jurassic World: Dominion does deliver on one promise, and that is Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum. They are a joy to watch here. If Trevorrow and Co. Have completely misunderstood what makes Jurassic Park's filmmaking so powerful, they didn't misunderstand what made it's central characters so likable and compelling. It's like meeting old friends, nostalgia done right. Neill is a bit older and out of his element and his boomer moments, which could come off as cringe, are actually sweet and endearing. Laura Dern commands the screen as the leader of the trio, and while Goldblum is playing up his meme schtick a little too heavily, his performance is still in line with Malcolm's past mannerisms and behavior. The action is really solid here. A chase sequence in Malta is a bit too Mission: Impossible/G. I. Joe, but it's effective and exhilarating. Michael Giacchino is still the perfect composer for this series outside of John Williams. His work is rock solid here. John Schwartzman's cinematography is really slick and shooting the movie on film was a very deliberate and wise decision. My only complaint visually-speaking is that many of the animatronic dinosaurs look incredibly stiff and artificial. It has a lot to do with the lighting and the angles they're shot at, though the sentiment of honoring the work Stan Winston did in the past films is well-intentioned. At the end of the day, Jurassic World: Dominion is an excuse to reconcile the two disparate chapters of this nearly 30-year-old franchise so that the series can move forward without being stuck in the past. It doesn't deliver on anything the previous films setup and that's a tough pill to swallow, but on its own terms, its a very stupid, very bloated, very fun summer blockbuster that's enjoyment completely hinges on your nostalgia/personal connection to the rest of the films in its franchise. I'd also recommend watching the extended edition of the film as it doesn't drag the pacing down, but adds much needed context, character development and gives the movie room to breathe.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I found JW Dominion to be too long, too predictable, too much of the same. I did like the merging of the characters from all of the films. Always enjoy watching Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum.Dallas Bryce-Howard was better in Jurassic World but I still enjoyed her performance in Dominion. Chris Pratt . . . I never did feel a sense of connection between him and the dinosaurs that would lead me to believe the ""hand"". It's too corny. And while we're talking ""corny"" - who is going to ride a horse to lasso a dinosaur that weighs 20 times more than the horse? What dinosaur is going to so easily succumb to a rope lasso? Oh, but maybe it was ""the Hand""! That's what subdued him.The Giganotosaurus didn't belong in the movie. Why would you want to try to top the T-Rex? The rendering of both of the huge dinosaurs was unimpressive. No detail. Bad lighting. We weren't told anything about the Giganotosaurus so that we could get a sense of who it was. The dinosaurs were portrayed much better in the original Jurassic Park. In addition to how realistic they looked and moved, time was given to working in the traits and characteristics of each dinosaur so that we knew who we were dealing with. Actually the whole Dominion movie was substandard in comparison to the original.I did appreciate that there was no gore or bad language in Dominion! That's about the only positive thing I can say. Glad that I only rented it and didn't buy it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

She and others are key to preventing that company from causing an ecological disaster. This is the sixth film in a series, a cautionary tale about genetic engineering. A handful of half-baked storylines clash together in an otherwise paint-by-numbers sequel. One part is a steady stream of protracted chases and dinosaur attacks that involve characters who could never be under threat due to their importance in the story. The other part is time spent telling a story about corporate corruption, which offers up nothing more meaningful than being bad. But the real test of patience will surely come from an ensemble of two sets of characters who have little to do with each other but are dwelt on at the expense of a sensible storyline. Do-gooder Bryce Dallas Howard is expected to flick a switch from doe-eyed and vulnerable to assertive and forceful in an instant; stock character hero Chris Pratt still holds out his hand zen-like to placate man-eaters - gift unexplained. With high production values, a team of technical artists worked hard to bring a picture to marvel at with its impressive stunts, slick action set pieces, and visual effects. But the CGI rendered is not much more realistic than 30 years ago, which is disappointing for a film that rests its believability on dinosaurs moving in fast motion.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The plot of the movie is better than previous one ""Fallen kingdom"". The CGI of the movie is praiseworthy and it gave satisfying feeling. This is a summer blockbuster type film and the important things are the dinosaurs and action sequences. The movie is a lot of fun and will fuel the imaginations and nightmares of children who watch and give parents a good bit of action. Sound quality and Actings are perfect there's no doubt about it. I highly recommend this one for watching this week .","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

If you like to see dinos on screen and you like JP/JW franchise, go see it in theaters !! You will not be disappointed.

Following up on the events of Fallen Kingdom where the large & scaly ones now roam the Earth w/o abandon, we find our heroes, Dallas Bryce Howard & Chris Pratt, together w/their new clone of a charge, Isabella Sermon, as they try to corral the beastly creatures & shuffle them off to safer climes while a new billionaire, Campbell Scott (modeled after Apple's Tim Cook my viewing partner remarked), who has a preserve in Europe where he's also doing the Lord's work keeping the Jurassics in check but no sooner does the appearance of all this philanthropic activity rear its head, evil shenanigans begin w/the appearance of oversized locusts attacking a farm in spitting view of one of Scott's factories where no harm has come to it. Lo & behold the revelation that the beneficial conglomerate has something to do w/it comes as no surprise to no one except the people on screen who by film's end have to right the wrongs & let the wild ones roam. W/the supposed added benefit of having the original Jurassic Park stars back in action (Sam Neill, Laura Dern & Jeff Goldbloom), the film is clock a block full of action & dino mayhem but what it lacks is a coherent script & an unjustified need to have all these returning players when they could've used the newer characters (DeWanda Wise, Dichen Lachman & Mamoudou Athie) to craft something maybe different (especially since the notion of human DNA manipulation tied to dinosaurs has been introduced). Billed the last in the series (I bet!), I wonder if they'll try something truly new when the inevitable follow up comes a calling in a few years.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched, period. Writing, direction, editing, even lens choice... It's all just absolutely horrible. It's a C-level movie with millions and millions of dollars wasted. This isn't a movie thats watchable if you are older than 9 years old. No logic, nothing makes sense. Please just avoid.I've watched student films with better writing and direction. This was so painful to watch, I had to stop multiple times just to try and deal with it. I stopped to write this review because it's so bad, the only redemption I have is to openly destroy this movie in a review. Just don't watch it!

The story line quality degrade in every Jurassic World movies.Too many characters are felt caricature. Too many Cliche. Copied so many scenes from Jurassic Park Franchise.Spielberg's Jurassic Park is one of the masterpiece. This Jurassic World movies are literally butchering the name.After watching this piece of crap i still believe Jurassic Park by Spielberg is miles.. miles.. miles ahead of these movies.Coming to the story, they really tried to put two stories in one movie. That resulted messy storyline, messy screenplay, unnecessary characters just comes and goes for no reason at all.There is no proper establishment in story for the locations where the movie takes place.2nd act and 3rd/Final act is all over the place with zero sense of things happening.1st act felt more like Kidnapping movie with few Dinosaurs. With a lot of scenes which have no sense at all.Too many Repeatedly used dialogues. Thriller scenes have no base or sense what so ever. Thrilling scenes are there just to fill the run time of the movie. Only good thing are VFX and The Dinosaurs. Nothing else.It's better to watch Spielberg's brilliantly directed movie Jurassic Park or even The Lost World.Final verdict:- This is a big budget messy Movie with too many references from Jurassic Park.Direction: 4/10
Screenplay: 3/10
Dialogues: 4/10
VFX: 9/10
Cinematography: 7/10
Acting: 6/10

Jurassic World: Dominion checks the action adventure box. At times, the monster horror box. But, it always falls short on novelty.You can't be surprised by this. After all this is the 6th installment of the series. Novelty left the building awhile ago.The Jurassic series chief conflict has always been man's desire to control nature, and despite the warnings of Jeff Goldblum we attempt it time and time again. Jurassic World: Dominion attempts to wrap up this conflict, and it does, albeit it in an unsatisfying way.There are three groups we follow through out the film. Each pursuing their own goals until they eventually converge. One of these story lines is good. The other two seem like filler with even one of them not having any real tangible effect.Jurassic World: Dominion try's. It try's really freaking hard. And when it hits it hits right. Those moments are just so few and far between. Honestly, if you take away the star power of Chris Pratt, Jeff Goldblum, and the call back cast from the original. It comes off like an early 2000's sequel that should have gone straight to dvd.I don't think it's a terrible movie. But I do think it falls short of even being a good film. If you like the new Jurassic World movies you'll like this as well. If not, we'll at least the dinosaurs look pretty.Oh, and there is an evil version of Tim Cook.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's made a joke of the franchise.It's full of clichés which is expected but to the point where we actively started predicting to each other the next scene that would be reused.It's so cheesy but beyond comfort cheese of well lived characters it's uncomfortable to watch.There was a few good action sequences... the swamp scene was cool. And the knew dinosaur with the claws... creeped me out.But overall I found myself bored to the point I wanted it to stop.The overuse of CGI made it even more silly aswell...I know people will hate this review.

A movie for all ages, no blood, no gore. Lots of scare moments but no real dread and fear which one could feel from Jurassic Park. When u would first see a T-Rex circuling a jeep inside having 2 REALLY frightened kids for the first time, it was EPIC!Dinosaurs should impress, cause fear.With Jurassic World Dominion it feels like they been tamed to be wild......did that make sense?So be prepared for a letdown unless you like pointless chases which been ripped and coppied out of other movies uncluding India Jones for instance.Iff i wasn't for some of the pointless one liners this movie might have made a bigger impression but even the cast probably felt like they where inside a loophole of cliche action sequenses which at some point seem to be endlessly long and boring.Next time i want to see Chris Prat while doing the pointles hand gesture and see his hand or arm ripped and head thorn of and blood splatter all over the place while the dino's start feeding. Just imagine the loook on the crowds face....omg ....our pointles hero died. Raptor Wins.....FATALITY!Now THATS how you bring dread to Dino's that have little regard to human life other then seeing their prey to be snacked on instead of toyed with and chased to make the camera crew look cool and flashy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","A decent attempt but still disappointment for hardcore Jurassic Park fans!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9114481/?ref_=tt_urv","sauravjoshi85","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47100167/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2023","Jurassic World Dominion is a science fiction action film directed by Colin Trevorrow. The film stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill, DeWanda Wise, Mamoudou Athie, Isabella Sermon, Campbell Scott, BD Wong and Omar Sy.The sequel to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), it is the final installment in the Jurassic World trilogy and the sixth installment overall in the Jurassic Park film series.Four years after the destruction of Isla Nublar, dinosaurs now live and hunt alongside humans all over the world. This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history's most fearsome creatures.Probably the most disappointing film of the entire Jurassic Park film franchise. The best part of the film was to bring the maximum possible star cast of the previous films together but still the film falls on the expectations. Although the good part was the VFX, the chasing scenes, the stellar star cast and off course the dinosaurs but the bad part was that the film gets boring and predictable in between and after sometime you'll feel that you are seeing the cocktail of all the previous Jurassic Park films with DNA engineered insects which becomes danger for the world, climate change, save the dinosaurs, save the humans etc. Etc.Plot of the film is decent and the execution is average, despite of the theme of the film the makers fails to keep the momentum and the films looses it's track in the middle and started gets slow and boring. A more refined and gripping screenplay could've worked in the favor of the film.Acting is good and almost all the star cast impresses be it Chris, Bryce, Laura, Jeff or Neill apart from Isabella Sermon as she irritates me whenever she comes on screen. You could be free spirited or revolutionary kid but i can't understand why do we always stereotype all the time when we have to show such kid.BGM is good and supports the screenplay very well, cinematography is brilliant and VFX are amazing. Climax of the film looked predictable and doesn't excites much.Overall an above average but still disappointing film of the Jurassic Park Franchise. Can be watched once.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Also the main problem in this movie is not the dinosaur which could be disappointing to some audiences. No Blue???

Dodgson you see nobody cares! However enough people care for the nostalgia of old folks returning that this will probably make enough to do the job and be on its way. Memorable? Well there are some nice moments yet many of these moments are a repeat of a story told. The die hard Jurassic fans will happily go along for the ride like always, but the less enthusiastic who will wanna be seeing something different might be more difficult to sway, more stubborn. Mostly this is there own damn fault, what more can you expect? The formula can't change much, it's always gonna be the wow look a dinosaur before all hell breaks loose. If it isn't broke don't fix it! Although maybe a wise move is to say this is the very end of the Jurassic era. Milk it much further and you'll have an even less tangible authentic product, in fact you'll have Pamela Anderson's breasts, except they'll be deflated of any life. You'll be faking it into obscurity.The originals weren't so tiresome they didn't fit, no not by a long shot! They brought life like performances whilst remaining true to the origins of their characters. Jeff Goldblum was a stand out once again for me bringing a lighthearted sense of humour and not allowing it to be taken too seriously. Sam Neil and Laura Dern once again gave very natural performances. I'd say the film did seem a little disjointed at first bouncing from the newer characters played by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard to reintroducing the originals.Colin Trevorrow certainly brings the action to a new level in this cinematic experience with new locations and amazing motorbike sequences juxtaposed with aeroplanes leaving very little to the imagination. The film seems slightly too long considering the content. I have never been a big fan of the training velociraptors theory to me a predator is a predator. Making them more emotional and communicating with them to the point of a promise seems farcical to me. Dodgsons character portrayal didn't quite work for me his aims and objectives wasn't as clear cut as they should've be in my opinion. So without giving too much of the plot away I'd say this isn't the weakest from the series of films but it's a long way from the strongest too.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There are so many weird storylines going on that it is hard to understand what the actual story is about. Comedy is used in awkward times which completely disrupts the already weak tension.

It was shocking to see how terrible the acting was from world-class actors and it was clear that they were chosen for the sake of continuity and not for talent. In my opinion, the acting was the worst - felt like I was watching a school show. The storyline could have been better - the build-up took such a long time, approx 3/4 of the movie and climax (which was a good one, not terrrible) and then everything else rushed through as if to finish the movie quickly. What was the big rush? Because everything after the climax was pretty great and everyone wanted to see a longer timeline.Overall opinion - had HUGE hopes for this movie and was super excited because we grew up with Jurassic World but this was shockingly, heartbreakingly bad.*4 stars for climax and the few minutes after.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Or something that would be a novelized sequel to a movie. It's that bad lol even within the massively contrived conceit that this movie starts out with, stuff happens that legitimately makes no sense at all. And could have easily been adjusted to do so. It makes no sense.Acting is uneven, to say the least. The bad guy is so, so bad. There's so much CGI getting in the way of cinematography it's hard to take in any decent shots. There's a few fun set pieces and stunts. A few more that are wildly dumb. Some weird new creature thing. It's predictably meandering and too long. Most annoying, though: some of the ideas about the plot are actually interesting. They're just packaged terribly. It should have just stayed an action flick. The ecology angle is blown. The ""heart"" of the film with the child: blown. It can't pull it off. All it can do is wave pretty CGI and make people die and run. That's the only move it can pull off, 12 movies later.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was a great installment to the Jurassic World films. It truly hit the mark with reintroducing the original Cast and was definitely done right. If you are a Fan of the movies this is definitely one to see. There are a couple slow moments but definitely pays off in the end. Even though I did enjoy this movie and would recommend it to anyone, I just hope they end the Series here. The ending was Perfect and did not leave any open-ended questions and I think if they did try to continue the series it would just ruin it and would not really have a story to give. If you are looking for a movie that is action/adventure packed and safe for the whole family I would suggest going to see this film.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

First of all, Giganotosaurus and T-rex DIDNOT lived at the same age, and much less on the same place, so a prehistoric fight was just impossible.But, if they did, who would wins?T-rex was MUCH MORE smarter, bulkier, heavier, with a much stronger jaw made for make bones EXPLODE and used to hunt the deadliest herbivors who ever lived.Giganotosaurus in other hand, was skinnier, dumbier, with a jaw made to make their preys bleed and used to hunt in group in a strategy of bite and run.On the contrary who many persons believe, they never find any Giganotosaurus bigger than T-rex named ""Scotty"", in fact, Giganotosaurus being bigger is just a guess based in a BONE FRAGMENT (MUCPv-95), theres no scientific evidences showing that Giganotosaurus was in fact bigger than the T-rex.But yes, it was big and even if it was a bit smaller or even taller than T-rex, it couldnt rivailize T-rex's wheight.That said, Giganotosaurus in most of combats against the T-rex would just be obliterated.Now I know that theres someone thinking ""heeey, its just a movie!

No, people dont know it.

The return of the old actors was a bit cheesy but I liked that the film did that.The story was dreadfully bad. While I didn't get bored, I just found the plot to be really contrived and nonsensical at times. The locust plot is especially B. S. because the problem spread all over the world. One locust isn't going to affect other continents locusts etc.Again, this could have been so so so much better with some blood, actual injuries. All they do is make the characters dirty.

This is yet another prime example of how a big Hollywood project managed to bring loads of cash, heavyweight actors, and a lot of other talented folks behind the scenes together, only for the result to be essentially a giant middle finger to
a beloved franchise and all self-respecting moviegoers. It's just so creatively bankrupt and devoid of anything interesting that I can barely recall what I even watched in the theatres as I am writing this review.Where do I begin? The runtime is as good as any, I suppose. There is no way this movie needed to be anywhere close to two-and-a-half hours, as honestly there is hardly any progress being made to for the characters or the storyline for the majority of this film. We essentially just get a bunch of humans trying to survive dinosaurs while trying to rescue some other humans and dinosaurs, but for whatever stupid reason it takes a millennia for them to get anywhere. The performances in this movie are all decent enough, but because of the massively bloated and poorly-constructed plot I have great difficulties caring for most of them, and not even bringing back the original main actors of Jurassic Park can save this dumpster fire of a script.The action sequences and special effects are all done relatively well, I suppose, but nothing mind-blowing and it still doesn't break any new grounds since the original. In fact, the action scenes are much worse, because I am still not a fan of CGI dinosaurs as they don't look real and thus I don't feel scared for the characters. Give me the original animatronics and practical effects any-day, seriously.Finally, the crowning crap to top all of this off has to be the main villain of the story, or the worst excuse of one I've ever seen. This dude has to be the most incompetent and nicest villain I have ever seen in a movie, because he just let all the good guys walk all over him in his face and practically shakes their hand as they are doing it. Finding out your sub-ordinates betrayed you and actively helped out your enemies? No big deal, just fire him and let him leave right in front of you so he can continue to help out your enemies. Bonus points for literally letting the dinosaur and the person you captured escape under your nose and not have a single protocol or personnel that can stop them. This guy also accidentally destroyed his own laboratory and dinosaur habitat in the process of burning some evidence, which was so incredibly retarded that I didn't even register what happened for a good five minutes. Honestly, bravo.At the end of the day, Jurassic World Dominion is not worth your time or money, because the new trilogy has definitely run its course and then some. Let's just wish that whoever decides to reboot this franchise can give it a bit more love and some semblance of intelligence into the writing, while I find myself a copy of the original title to cleanse my brain from this travesty.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I wondered to myself why so often do critics get it wrong? I'm not alone in this thought because here are the stats from critic's vs audience. I see this so often and I had to ask myself why is this? I think the honest answer is that critics are there because they must be, and audiences are there because they want to be. As the movie starts and the Universal logo rolled into place, I was brought back to my thirteen-year-old self. Jurassic Park came out June 9th, 1993. Twenty-nine years ago. It honestly changed movies forever for me. I have seen every Jurassic Park movie, and Jurassic World movie in the theatre. I remember a group of us going from prom to see the midnight showing of the Lost World when it came out dressed in full tux and gowns. That is fan dedication! So, to get into the Jurassic World Dominion, it is everything it should be, but not everything it could be. The film is a little long at 2 hours and 26 minutes, but it does go by quick. Colin Trevorrow sits in the director's chair again as he did in the Jurassic World (2015). As an artist I am always curious as to who the films cinematographer is? In this case, it was John Schwartzman. The film is stunning. The visuals and dinosaur effects are awesome. I appreciated the return to a lot of the practical dinosaur effects. The plot has everything a good dinosaur plot should have and a little bit more. No spoilers, but this is a straight up dinosaur James Bond movie. Personally, I love James Bond, but that was a point of contention for the critics. DeWanda Wise was a scene stealer as the dubbed Han Solo of Jurassic Park. She calls out another character in the film named Denise who your led to believe was a girlfriend? I am not sure if she is the first LGBTQ+ character in the franchise, but regardless she's great. It is also great to see all the legacy cast return. Laura Dern, Sam Neil, and of course Jeff Goldblum. The cast does become a bit of a scooby gang, and never quite feel like anything bad is going to happen to them. Alright, on to the big bad. Giganotosaurus. Well, he's bad but unintentionally gets upstaged by the Therizinosaurus (had to look that up twice) a terrifying Freddy Kruger like dinosaur. There is scene where it stalks Bryce Dallas Howard's (Claire) into a lake, and it is truly the stuff nightmares are made of. We also finally get to see the return of the dilophosaurus. The film is at its best mid-way through when a chase scene filmed in Malta breaks out. It was a real seat clencher. So, to land this review home I am going to bring it back to it was everything it should be, but not everything it could be. As far as where it lays in the franchise, I would say it falls nicely into third place behind Jurassic Park, and Jurassic World.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

My Rating 5/10My second journey this week out of my usual movie genre zone but it wasn't as successful as Top Gun Maverick.This sixth and I hope final journey back to the Jurassic Park movie franchise is far to long at nearly 2hrs 30 minutes .The story is drawn out and to my mind is the perfect example of a movie franchise running it's course.In my opinion Jurassic World Dominion breaks all my golden rules of movie enjoyment .I ask the three questions of any movie I see no matter what genre
1 - was I interested in the characters ? Answer for this movie - just the dinosaurs
2- was it an entertaining script ?Answer. No I've seen it all before done far better.3- Did I enjoy the performances ?Answer just the dinosaurs and they gave me a headache after a while.Top marks to the CGI and special effects Production team they certainly put new life into their extinct characters the Dinosaurs. However it's a pity the Script writers and Director couldn't manage the same with the human characters .In a 2004 book by Christopher Booker he explains The Seven Basic Plots: and why we tell stories? He gives examples of famous movies that fit into each category so I tried to place Jurassic World Dominion?They are -Overcoming the Monster
Rags to Riches
The Quest
Voyage and Return
Comedy
Tragedy
Rebirth
This movie has elements of Overcoming the monster and Voyage and Return but misses out on the author's main premise that no matter how many characters may appear in a story it's real concern is just on its hero no matter the genre or plot.Perhaps that's why Jurassic Park fails for me there is no hero in this movie but to many characters.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The premise in this movie has us believing and taking dinosaurs for granted like if you would see an ant's nest or a cloud formation no big deal and certainly not worth a second look or a dwelling moment. Even the writers couldn't wait for their script to end which becomes apparent as we wrap things up in the movie. I suppose this film will appeal to some group or persons, but I am at a loss to know who that would be? Methinks this is the end of something wonderous, beautiful and adventurous i.e. Dinosaurs roaming the earth brought to us via a good movie.

It was actually a pretty impressive hat trick that the first Jurassic World was able to reignite the spark, capturing some of what made the original so special. It was just a simple story of an amusement park filled with dinos, cue the John Williams score, *chefs kiss*By the third instalment of any franchise, things are bound to get a bit rocky. Dominion suffers by over stuffing it's plot with things you can't be bothered to care about. Clone kids, bioethics and a lot about locusts for some reason, all detract from the main event. What should be a straight line is a confusing zig zag of ""who's this character, and what do they have to do with the dinos exactly?"" It aims for more of a straight up action movie feel with the usual genre trappings of completely unrealistic close calls, plus Chris Pratt's dinosaur whisperer shtick is as absurd as everyone says it is.Of course, it's a Hollywood blockbuster by design, bringing out the best in the biz and investing a small fortune in it's creation, so it's bound to be well made in some respects. When they finally get down to the brass tacks of T-Rex attacks, it's an exciting brawl of high tech camera work and visual effects, with the bonus of far more practical/ animatronics than you'd expect in a modern film.It may be a cheap ploy for nostalgia, but I enjoyed the involvement of the original cast and numerous callbacks. It hinted at the more self aware, tongue in cheek movie that could have been if it wasn't otherwise getting bogged down trying to bite off more than it could chew.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Dallas as the leading characters.But the idea that Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern were returning, certainly put a new hope on the franchise.However, this film once again lacked any substance.I think my favourite part was Dern and Neill's characters connecting.

I really love Jurassic Park and is one of my all time favourites, but this instalment it doesn't add anything new in order to become a classic in the future. Not at all, it became a generic flick with dinosaurs included in it. The part of those mercenaries tradding dinos with that chick pointing with a laser to some people so then the raptors could chase them is just simply stupid.Yes, i know, it's a popcorn movie and it's mission is to amuse people who watch it, but in this case is a sequel, it's no more than a following to a classic saga, so they could done it better. Too shame, like i said before, it became a generic film packed with nonsense action scenes and dull moments that don't add anything important to the plot.Having back the main stars of the first film din't work at all, instead, it wast a waste of a valious resource.Anyway, i'll give it a 5 only because it haves the name Jurassic in it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I went into it with optimism... but... the glaring ridiculous themes and action was enough to turn me off...the directors lack of caring for the characters and inability to craft a good story were another glaring flaw.After seeing this,all I can say is wow...All 3 of the central beloved characters
, grant , sattler and Malcolm , were showing their age more than I could've imagined. Goldbloom could barely recite his lines.. and with no comedic timing..and the lines just weren't that good anyway. The action was dumbed down for them because of their advanced age and amped up for Pratt and company.. perhaps to balance out the lack of action... pratts side of the film showed like a James Bond movie rather than Jurassic.. I was confused.. is it bond or a dinosaur movie?well...Aside from being embarrassed for the 3 principal actors,I was confused about the what kind of movie it was.That being said, the first Jurassic park is one of my fav films and will always be a classic to me.. nothing will change that.. and that is how I will remember these characters.. not as they were showed in this ""film""..
please don't waste your time with this..
remember Jurassic park the way it was... watch the original... it's still the best and ONLY Jurassic park.. well... The second one isn't bad either lolPeace.. thanks for reading.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It just needed a much tighter script and a lot less rambling speeches. Not sure what the point of bringing all previous characters together was apart from massaging the actors egos. It is predictable and there are so many crazy coincidences which ruins any suspense or real sense of peril.

Honestly, the best film I've seen this summer (if not, the year) that is a deeply satisfying watch that never gets boring. ""Jurassic World: Dominion"", in my opinion, is up there with the best threequels: ""Return of The Jedi"", ""The Dark Knight Rises"", ""The Matrix: Revolutions"", and ""Zack Snyder's Justice League"".*Disclaimer: Don't expect a monster movie like ""King Kong"" or ""Godzilla"" where ""Things Go Wrong"", the dinosaurs are treated more like wildlife/exotic animals in this entry. If you are expecting a disaster movie then expect to be disappointed.

"5","/10","Terribly filmed action ruined what could've been a fun film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8258681/?ref_=tt_urv","darkreignn","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33659536/?ref_=tt_urv","21 June 2022","As I sat in the theatre watching ""Jurassic World: Dominion,"" I found that a question was forming in the back of my mind - small at first, like a mustard seed, but strong and pervasive in its growth. 30 minutes went by, then an hour, and I still couldn't shake it. The question? Well, I was simply wondering if ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" was secretly directed by Paul Greengrass due to the obnoxious and excessive use of close-up shaky camera.Listen, I'm a simple man. When I go see a movie called ""Jurassic World,"" I just want to watch some realistic looking dinosaurs eat people and wreak havoc. And ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" does have that in spades, after about an hour of horrifically boring, haphazard, stitched together plot necessities. You see, this movie takes a long time to find its footing; essentially two films for the price of one, you'll find yourself bouncing from character to character, scene to scene, until, inevitably, the two stories finally collide to form a cohesive whole. You'll be privy to awkward, forced dialogue delivered by actors who look like they'd rather be literally anywhere else. You'll sit through a collage of scenes that feel like they were sliced, diced, and stitched together in the editing room by Freddy Krueger. And in between the mediocre editing, wooden dialogue, and painful sequences of exposition, you will at least be able to feast your eyes on all of the dinosaur action your heart could ever desire. The problem is you won't be able to see any of it because, for some ungodly reason, most of the action in this movie was filmed in close-up shaky cam.I mean, come on people. This is a movie that features CGI dinosaurs taking part in a city-wide motorcycle chase that looks like it was ripped directly out of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" - at one point in this sequence the music even stops just so the audience can get a real feeling for how intense the action is. But you know what would've really made me get a feeling for the intensity of the action? A steady camera. I honestly got a headache trying to decipher the action, as the camera feels like it's always a few inches away from people, and it's constantly swaying in every single direction known to man. This faux-Paul Greengrass style of filmmaking is absolutely tiresome, and a pathetic excuse for generating excitement. If you really want to excite your audience, how about letting them clearly see what's happening, and who it's happening to. To say the least, the terribly filmed action ruined what could have otherwise been a fun film.And that basically concludes my review of ""Jurassic World: Dominion."" This is, simply put, not a very good film. I very much enjoyed the first ""Jurassic World"" movie and was looking forward to this, but I just found it boring, with the most exciting thing being my struggle to stay away in the theatre. If you want mindless - and I do mean mindless - action, then you can go see this and probably enjoy yourself; it certainly can be a visual spectacle, but past the surface level thrills you'll find a stunning mess in virtually every single department. This is not worth your time, and definitely not worth as many words as I have written.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's not even necessarily a bad movie, but it lacks the things that made the other movies great. The main focus doesn't seem to be on the Dinosaurs any longer and there was not a single moment that made me excited to see the Dinosaurs.

The script overall is weak and struggles to support its characters. Big character from fallen kingdom like Zia and Franklin are sidelined here, whilst new characters are barley given any time to develop with the exception being Kayla (this is purely by a stellar performance). Bryce dallas Howard shines once again as does Dern and Neil. The action is good and the dinosaurs looked good. But the story is so disjointed and all over the place it's hard to look past. For instance we have serval human ""villains"" all fail to register due to such limited screen time. The main human villain is weak and given barley any time to develop his intentions just being generic. Overall whilst the actors were there and giving it their all and the action was great this film was killed by a terrible story. What a sad ending to a brilliant franchise.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm also still angry the only attractive man (Billy was it?) in the one with Tea Leone got killed off i mean hello, if you have eye candy there is merit in having it live.

Jeff Goldblum (Malcolm) is Tyrese (Roman) because he's witty and hilarious. Sam Neill (Grant) is Sung Kang (Han) because he's back for almost no reason at all. DeWanda Wise (Kayla) is Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) for the tough female support. Mamoudou Athue (Ramsay) is Ludacris (Tej) for the tech knowledge. Isabella Sermon (Maisie) is Nathalie Emmanuel (Ramsey) because they're sought after by the bad guys. BD Wong (Dr. Wu) is Kurt Russell (Mr. Nobody) because they're the intelligence ops leaders.I'm sure I could keep going but you probably get the point by now. The dinosaurs were a complete subplot that existed only to serve the title of the franchise. There's no rhyme or reason to the dinosaur fight scenes for anything but fan service.

The whole combination of the old cast with new talents just works, both Omar Sy, Mamoudo Athie, Dewanda Wise and Isabella Serbon are a good fit with the old school cast like Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern and Sam Neill. There are funny Easter eggs and inside jokes that you will recognize if you watched all movies, which is an extra fun part too.

It was not a horrible film but it wasn't worth a visit to the theater. One big issue (for me) was the dramatic reveal of each original character as if we didn't already know from press releases that they were going to be in the movie. It made no sense to do a dramatic reveal, say their full name, then follow it with ""I'm a huge fan of your work"" whenever they met someone new or got reacquainted. Nostalgia can only carry a movie so far and the charm wore off within seconds. There were also many plot holes or plot points that just didn't make any sense. You could rewatch every single Jurassic movie and still not understand where they got certain topics from, it was a mess.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I have such wonderful memories of ""Jurassic Park"" that anything with Jurassic in the name is a siren call that I must heed.""Jurassic World Dominion"" or ""Jurassic World 3"" was not very good, except for the real stars: the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs always show up and show out; the people, however... ehhhh.This episode stars Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt again. They are still an item and now they have a plus one. They adopted Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), the little girl from ""Fallen Kingdom."" Apparently she was a hot commodity. Something about her DNA made her very desirable for the baddies.The baddies in this one were actually one baddie: Biosyn, a flourishing biotech company that brings up thoughts of Monsanto. The moment they showed the Biosyn commercials and their altruistic usages of dinosaurs I knew that Biosyn was going to be evil. It's the easy play. Make the wealthy corporation the bad guy. I'm just as anti-work as the next Redditor, but going the obvious and reused route of making a corporation the villain was weak.Heading Biosyn was Lewis Dogson (Campbell Scott). He was behind the creation of some very large and voracious locust which were destroying the world's crops. His top scientist, Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong), a holdover from Jurassic Worlds past, believed he could stop the locust apocalypse if he only had Maisie's DNA.To help expose Biosyn, three original cast members made an appearance. Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern, and Sam Neill all showed up looking thirty years older. Did they add anything of value to the movie? If you consider, ""Oh! The original crew is here!"" as adding value, then they added value. I would say that they were only written into the movie to generate buzz and perhaps sell more tickets by attracting the older nostalgic crowd.As for the plot, I didn't see anything I liked. I liked the narrow escapes from skulking dinosaurs and that was about it. The people just got in the way, but I suppose the predatory dinos need to have something to hunt. Maybe the next Jurassic World can be ""Running Man"" style where criminals get released into dino territory and have to make it to through to survive. It certainly wouldn't be much of a worse movie than they continue to release.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It achieved exactly what it was made for. I really hope they continue this franchise in the future. Would be great to get a 10 episode series for the next project.

I mean, what the @$#@# do someone expect from a Jurassic movie? I loved every second of it at the cinema, while falling asleep at a movie like Dune (I loved the Linch version a lot) with zero character dev., zero imersion, empty useless scenes and ""special effects"" of sand and more sand.I am smart enough to love movies like Shawshank Redemption or Jurassic World Domination, different movies, different genres, take them for what they are set to do.I am curious what people expected from this new Jurassic movie, psychological drama, Oscar wining scenario? It seems that they wanted unpredictable script, apparently a predictable scenario means a movie is trash. The old Jurassic movies where very unpredictable: the animlas escape always, the good guys are getting chased and survive every time while the bad guys got eaten. Simple and fun fantasy with dinosaurs. That's all, great visuals, cool action. That's the genre... Old school movie for old school fans. I really hope the next Jurassic movie is not some psychological drama in slow motion in order to be enjoyed by the new movie fans...","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

But anyway there was a reinvention of the franchise with Jurassic World that worked very well. This latest installment also has the added bonus of bringing the original cast together with the current one, which makes it a unique product. The movie has everything from chases in European cities, snow scenes, mysterious caves, new dinosaurs, monstrous insects, dangers on Isla Nublar etc etc. But it also has some homage scenes to that charming first film, with frames almost traced. Many believe they see repeated things but in reality they are deliberately made so that the viewer instantly connects with their childhood, adolescence or youth according to how old they were in the 90s. The second half of the movie does not give us respite and we see our heroes in constant dangers. To buy a bucket of popcorn and sit down to enjoy the adventure.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

But definitely not my favorite movie in the Jurassic Park/World franchise.I's rank it right next to Jurassic Park III.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Now I do need to point out that if plot holes, unrealistic set pieces, and an underdeveloped political/economic/social world are issues, then please avoid films with dinosaurs in the modern world.I also need to state that my expectations for dinosaur movies are:1. Dinosaurs.2. Dinosaurs fighting each other.3. Dinosaurs eating people.4. Pretty people to look at.I was not disappointed.It's mad fun, it's daft in places, it's thrilling, there are some great throwback moments. It's fantastic to see the cast together and overall, it's a great conclusion to the franchise ...so far.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It had some awesome action scenes, great use of several NEW dinos, scenes with ALL our FAV DINOS, (FINALLY some screen time for the dilophosaurus) and actual highly enjoyable storyline. Plenty of throwbacks to the first Jurassic World, as well as the original JP, The ""full circle"" back to the original film not only delights with familiar faces, its connects this films' Villain, while concluding a ""open ended"" storyline from the original Jurassic story - WHO PAID NED TO SMUGGLE OUT THE DINO DNA INSIDE THE FAUX BARSOL SHAVING CREAM CAN, AND WHAT WAS THEIR INTENTIONS?"" DODSON!!! WE GOT DODSO HERE!

Like real life, there's a wussy nerdy rich man who enjoys cloning and stealing others proprietary property, along with Asian sidekick hell bent on gendercide and the concept that women can get pregnant by themselves, together they push to create a modern day holocaust by controlling all of the worlds supply of medicine and food. AND just like real life.... WHISTLE BLOWER TO THE RESCUE. OH, and WOO gets a conscious...
Not sure what's with the negative comments and bad reviews. I don't know what movie they saw, but this was a great Summer Popcorn Flick. Plenty of dinos, plenty of action, plenty of great cinema, and plenty of enjoyment for Jurassic fans! Better than Fallen Kingdom and my 3rd fav in the entire series of 6 films.

The way the JP and JW cast get meshed together works very well, in my opinion. The movie has some very exciting and suspenseful moments....more than I've seen out of a JP/JW movie since Lost World!!Now, the cons: It is a slow moving film, and the VAST majority of the exciting and suspenseful moments occur in a 30 minute window near the end of the film. I wish there was more. There are definitely some great action sequences at the start and middle of the film, and they are FUN, but they are predictable and, therefore, don't build suspense. My final criticism is on the CGI. Honestly, there were some sequences where the CGI did NOT look fluid, but rather looked choppy and lower quality than anything since the original JP. It almost felt like their CGI budget was cut or something. The most exciting sequences, the CGI was spot on, but in other sequences, it was just WEIRD to watch.All in all, I give this film 8 stars since the plot was logical/believable, the acting was good (VERY good acting by the original JP cast), and the end of the movie saved the day by bringing in some REAL suspense.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

We think this was a brilliant follow on with lots of action and dinosaur fights. There are plenty of dinosaurs which haven't been seen in the other movies and it was really good to see the original Jurassic Park actors incorparated. The kids LOVED this and trying to guess all the different dinosaurs, as did I. Is it a bit predictable? Yes. But it stayed true to itself and had iconic moments from all the other movies which we found really fun trying to guess which movie. This follow on is perfect and will be well loved by all Jurassic Park / World fans. Well worth a watch!","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The story and its ending, visual and sound effects, direction, performance of Goldblum, action scenes, and emotional weight all deserve praise.But does this mean that the movie does not have flaws? Of course not. Jurassic World Dominion has several flaws that can be easily noticed if the person focuses well in it. First, the opening sequence makes the person who is watching confused regarding what the movie will be about. But what is good is that everything starts to gradually become clear as the movie progresses. Second, to be honest, I did not find anything special concerning the performances of the cast, except for the one of Goldblum. Even when it comes to Neill, I expected much better performace from him. But unfortunately, that didn't happen. Third, the person who is watching the movie can feel that there is neither an upgrade nor a downgrade if we want to compare Jurassic World Dominion to the previous installments. It would have been better if they worked on at least one upgrade.But do all these flaws mean that I did not like Jurassic World Dominion? Of course not. On the contrary, I liked it so much and the way it ended the story that started with Jurassic Park 1993. When it comes to the score, I give Jurassic World Dominion 8 out of 10.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

WHY all the bad reviews is the question I ask now! What was their motive? The cast was great: Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Laura Dern, Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum, DeWanda Wise, Mamoudou Athie, Isabella Serman, BD Wong and Dichen Lachman and more! The storyline was well thought out and is easy to follow. Editing was well done and special effects were as good if not better than the five previous films in the franchise. Here we see all the main characters are brought together for one incredible climax. I felt very satisfied with the action and how the plot rolled all the elements of the science together. If the reviews keep getting it wrong like they have in the last few years, they will be out of business.

We've seen the big dinosaur fights. We've seen the genetically modifed dinosaurs. We've seen the main characters in dino danger many many many times. We even got to see the park come together the way we knew it could be. I understand it's what we love, but with this being the very last movie, I know they had to be careful about tying up loose ends while also keeping us entertained.To me, this type of ending made the most sense. The nostalgia factor was high and I thought that was a really good move to include the OG cast. We have our closure and we feel good about all they've accomplished. The park has been done, the dinos being released into the ""real world"" has been done - what was left other than to close up the genetics storyline and make sure we understood that the dinos weren't going anywhere? You can't put it all back in the box, so there was nowhere else left to go.I guess I just don't see what people were expecting. There was plenty of action given. We've had all the wow moments we wanted, and I felt this movie did a decent job at giving us Dino scares mixed with real story. Was the ""magic"" there? Not exactlyyyy- and while I appreciate the nods to previous movies with the dino fights, it did feel a bit lazy. But it's the end so I didn't go in expecting some big twist and surprise. We knew what was coming and needed it to be wrapped up tightly, give a nod to all that we've seen and done and that came before us, and say goodbye. I felt this did exactly that and nothing more, so I appreciate it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I on the other hand, either: enjoy or do not enjoy a movie. Sure this is not one of the best of the series but it still scary and fun. I found myself drawn in and just went with it. It was delightful to see many of the previous cast reprise their rolls. The production values are high, the visuals are stunning (unless you are allergic to CGI). I could definitely enjoy seeing this movie again in the future.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

We thoroughly enjoyed it as a fun summer movie. Nothing will equal the original Jurassic Park, but I didn't expect it to. I loved the original cast reunion joining with the Jurassic World group. There were plenty of dinosaurs throughout and I jumped a few times, even though i could have predicted what was coming. Loved the Easter Eggs from the original, especially the open shirt joke for Goldblum/Malcolm.I can and have seen so many wonderful, serious, Oscar contending movies. Is Dominion one of them? Nope. Is it a fun summer movie, that's great on a big screen? Yup.

Mostly. The story was the main issue. Very wonky pacing, and a semi predictable story, and occasionally poor writing. But as a Jurassic movies fan, you'll probably have at least a semi-decent time. The jokes were pretty good, but sometimes they didn't land. It's half dinosaur sequences, 1/4th sprinkling of exposition and dialogue, and 1/4th both. Mostly enjoyable characters, extremely cool prehistoric animals, and if ya like action movies, you will love this movie.

Of course there are lots of ways to wrap up a franchise as grand as this, and this might not have been the correct vision, but it is still worth the watch, and there are some really nostalgic moments also for the die hard fans like me.There's nothing that will change the results now, it is what it is. So just grin and bare it if you do have annoyances or things that you would have done differently had you written the script. There are a few Jar Jar Binks type flaws that if we dwelled on it would ruin the whole experience, but don't over-dramatize it or shout at the screen.Instead, just do it for your younger self, give that high-5 to your childhood and be proud that you were there fantasising about dinosaurs thanks to the Jurassic Park franchise 30 years in the making.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Some people love it, some people hate it. I've had the pleasure of seeing it in advance, and here are my thoughts.Jurassic World: Dominion is the final planned film in the 30 year franchise. It brings back core characters from the original movies and the new cast. It has a lot of work to do, and moves quickly. Honestly, it did everything I, as a fan of this series since Michael Crichton's novel, wanted for the final film. If you're a fan of this series and it's characters, you'll enjoy this one.Full review with spoilers on my website morbidsmile dot com.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Why's that a problem? Shouldn't we (the fans) be grateful for that?I also read some opinions in which were said that the movie was to much of an action movie. I guess that's what got me stuck to the screen. A lot of breathtaking moments, as it was expected. We already had time to introduce the dinos and the main plot in the past movies, now we need to evolve and develop the history, and that was what they (the writers/directors) did.I loved the movie and I'm happy i went to the cinema to watch it.

If you liked any of the movies leading up to this entry, you'll enjoy this one.Second, this is the first time I've watched one of these since the original and been genuinely thrilled. There were even a few well earned jump scares.Third, I do not understand the negative reviews in the least. The fan service was minimal, never stood in the way of the story, and I felt made the movie more fun.The story, by the way, was great. Somehow managed to bring everyone together in a way that didn't feel cheap, and managed to introduce a couple of new and interesting characters that could further serve future entities if that ever happens.While I did go into the movie with low expectations based on these reviews, I was accompanied by someone who had much higher expectations and we were still both pleasantly surprised. Give it a chance. It's thrilling, interesting, engrossing and sometimes a little scary, and it really brings home the message that the previous iterations have only touched on, while still managing to give us more action and intrigue (the original excluded, it's still the best).","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yes it's a bit too long (it's the finale, so it needs more runtime to conclude the story of all characters). Yes it's over the top, but again, the finale of any multi-part movie series needs a grand finale. There's nothing woke here (that's a big sigh of relief to most of us). The CGI is great. The action/running/driving sequences are great. It has all the important characters in the franchise (that's a proper way to please all the fans). It has a proper ending. I mean honestly it's a pretty decent finale. Don't listen to the haters. They have nothing better to do.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The storyline is dinosaurs against mankind. This story has held up the franchise well. The pilot actress is a great addition to the series. She really adds to the film. The chase scenes are superb and are what really makes the film. The villain has believability and gets his due. This film will be looked back at in history as a great non-stop action film that delivers.

The movie was quite decent. I have no idea why so many people chose to write negative reviews. What exactly were they expecting from the movie is beyond me. Were they expecting the dinosaurs to dance or sing or write books or participate in a cooking contest or play chess or join machines to rule over humans? Who knows? Some said there was no story. How many different ways are there to write a Dino story? Most negative reviewers probably thought if they could trash the movie even before they could stop and ask themselves if they should. The CGI was great and the story was good too. Please do not go by reviews alone and if possible, watch the movie. I would say that there is a good chance that you would end up liking it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Where the previous films where mostly about people being stuck on an island, hiding from dinosaurs, this films did something diffrent.

I feel like this film was more modern than the previous films due to there being cities and interesting places. The film's story was a bit blurry and i don't know how i feel about bringing back thr older characters (REMINDS ME OF A SIMILAR FILM FROM LAST YEAR, IM TALKING ABOUT NO WAY HOME)Definitely a must watch for a Jurassic fan, but do remember it's diffrent from the rest of the films.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The Jurassic Park movie series is very old, i was a kid back then when i used to watch Jurassic Park.The dinosaurs and Trex and all that stuff, which i think i was introduced to about dinosaurs because of the Jurassic Park movie series. Although in reality there's no such thing as dinosaurs and any concept of dinosaurs being alive in this era.All of the dinosaurs went extinct almost 65 million years ago, when a great asteroid hit our earth. So no dinosaurs exist after that. Jurassic Park is a movie series which reminds many of their childhood memories.I instantly recognised that Doctor who gave an access card to both of them who went into that basement to collect a sample of locusts. The VFX is great in it, but sometimes you can easily tell that this is all computer generated.After all, the idea of dinosaurs being alive or anything like that is terrifying as hell. 9 April is the last day to watch it on Netflix, so i had to watch it today before it went.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

But I have to say, after watching this on Prime cause it was so for free I was like what the heck did I just watch, this was truly a work of art! I have to say, I was expecting a very low level script owing to giving more time to big like dumb fights that mean nothing in storytelling! But not here, they were put in with extremely good timing so that not to make it feel like a some odd contrivance! But the dialogue was spot on , a few things I would of tweaked here and there entering some scenes and maybe leaving them, mainly at the beginning but after the set up I was like this is adorable and the star-studed cast was so much fun and it worked remarkably well together! I Mean I would of given it a lil' more more sweetness by opting for a comedic pump-up in a few scenes but that's it! Otherwise I found the ride to be so exciting and really darling and my favorite part was the end! I just felt like it all worked so well and the message was so worth! I think who ever downs this should really re-think it cause it really was something terribly fun! I just want to commend everyone involved in this thing! I never thought these big budget films could deliver without just relying on their main vehicle to entertain and that's long action sequences that sometimes make me go like why? But this never made me ask why! Sure some of the things were a lil' too fast and strong for like a scooter-bike but I never once was like this is not cool! Cause it so totally was and is! Yes give it a shot! I just have this really cool feeling you will love it was well! Maybe don't compare it to the other ones , like I said I'm a lil' virgin but I'm definitely a whore when it comes to the wonderful gift of story! Most def!","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

I mean, is it a bad film? Not at all. It's digestible; but honestly, this isn't my favorite film in the Jurassic Park franchise, and I am a little disappointed that it's the conclusion film. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom could have been the real conclusion to the franchise with some tweaks in my opinion.And you know what...I knew the off-vibe this film was going to take when I started seeing them 1990 Dinosaurs sitcom baby dinosaurs (LOL). It just really changed the feel immediately for me.OTHER THOUGHTS:
Highlights: All action and tension scenes with the dinosaurs, overall pacing, the scene with the burning locusts is possibly the best moment of the entire film for me, the realism of the adult dinosaurs, & seeing Omar Sy.Could've Been Better: Better use of Dr. Lewis Dodgson, better use of Maisie, and the focus on/inclusion of the dinosaurs more with the story-the whole point of the Jurassic Park franchise.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

In other words, the existence of dinosaurs was first speculatively hypothesized by a knighted museum-head ""coincidentally"" in the mid-19th century, during the heyday of evolutionism, before a single dinosaur fossil had ever been found. The Masonic media and mainstream press worldwide got to work hyping stories of these supposed long-lost animals, and then lo and behold, 12 years later in 1854, Ferdinand Vandiveer Hayden during his exploration of the upper Missouri River, found ""proof"" of Owen's theory! A few unidentified teeth he mailed to leading paleontologist Joseph Leidy, who several years later declared them to be from an ancient extinct ""Trachodon,"" dinosaur (which beyond ironically means ""rough tooth"").Firstly, it should be needless to say that it is impossible to reconstruct an entire hypothetical ancient animal based on a few teeth! But even more importantly, it is dubious that a myriad of ancient reptile/bird and reptile/mammal transitional forms necessary for the blossoming theory of evolution, would be hypothesized and then conveniently ""discovered"" by teams of evolutionist archeologists purposely out looking to find such fossils! And it is even more dubious that such fossils have supposedly existed for millions of years but were never found by or known to any civilization in the history of humanity until evolutionism's Masonic renaissance in the mid-19th century!""Why are there no discoveries by native Americans in all the years previous when they roamed the American continents? There is no belief of dinosaurs in the Native American religion or tradition. For that matter, why were there no discoveries prior to the nineteenth century in any part of the world? According to the World Book Encyclopedia, 'before the 1800's no one ever knew that dinosaurs existed.' During the late 1800's and early 1900's, large deposits of dinosaur remains were discovered ...Why has man suddenly made all these discoveries?"" -David Wozney, ""Dinosaurs: Science or Science Fiction""","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

G.

I actually was quite skeptical going in because of the IMDB score and was very pleasantly surprised. Guys....this is a predictable final sequel. The entire point of this film was getting the old cast back together again. That's it. What more can they improve upon with the dinosaur CGI and/or dinosaur chase/encounter sequences? I think some people have way to unrealistic expectations for this movie. For myself, I really enjoying seeing all the old cast. They are just as memorable, humorous, quirky and fun as I remember them to be. Also, everybody looks great to be so much older! I found the story to be sure....predictable, but still entertaining. The similarity between the Bison CEO and Tim Cook was hilariously uncanny, lol. Anyway, check your brain out and rent the film. It's not as bad as some would make it out to be on here. I probably enjoyed it even more than the last one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Being a big fan of the first film having seen it at the cinema when first released I actually found many scenes quite emotional and not just on a nostalgic level. Yes it's a blockbuster big budget epic that was very expensive to make, but it held true to the original with great special effects and there's some good cinematography too if you bother to notice.Reunion, Repentance and Retribution.After 20 years Sam Neil and Laura Dern are back together again, will it be third time lucky for Dr Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler ? And of course to complete the comeback trio Jeff Goldblum is in on the action as Ian Malcolm again with more words of witty philosophical wisdom. The next (World) generation are of course also reunited and join forces with the original generation.BD Wong knocks up his 4th Jurassic appearance ( matching Goldblum's) as Dr Henry Wu, is it time for him to repent for his sins ? At biosin (ok BioSyn) or play along with the new mister big Dodgson. ?.
Although this might seem cast heavy they all contribute enough to make the movie more than the sum of its parts, it's a long film at near 150 minutes so they all get a chance to shine.The story moves on from the disastrous release of dinosaurs onto the mainland from Fallen Kingdom and their spread around the world through trafficking
The Return of old friends in the dinosaur ensemble cast too, just for a bit more nostalgia from 1993.Recycling the corruption plot with a world domination boost was inevitable with a subtitle like Dominion, and the latest villain on the block takes on a new satirical? Cliche in the guise of corporate meta , sorry I mean mega billionaire Dodgson , yes he is a bit dodgy, but well played by Campbell Scott.Young Maisie , Isabella Sermon isn't just a clone ? She's an actress with potential rather than talent at this stage, but reminds me of the young Kiera Knightley.Representation and diversity boxes well and truly ticked, including as many Redheads as Grey.Lots of laughs and love in the air plus a blast of mission impossible action for good measure, after all this is a ComActionRomDinoSatire.There are so many nice little jokes dropped in with many nods to the original trilogy, I also like the modern jokes, particularly the coffee barista guy and the scooter guy, maybe I just found it funnier than other people?.Looking at the many low ratings and review headers of 'boring' and pile of crap, I can't help think some people had no intention of trying to enjoy this fun action movie, it's far from boring and if you think it is crap the problem is with the viewer not the film, which has such a lot of good things to offer. Ok, it's not faultless, I noticed many little niggles in the plot and continuity errors but rather than let them spoil the overall entertainment I was able to ignore them because the fun and action more than compensates. Well, I have really enjoyed it 3 times at the cinema,so far.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I think this is the best movie since the first one. I'm not saying this was better than the original. This movie had a good enough story which wasn't just about surviving the dinosaurs which has already been done. The cloning of the girl and DNA splicing of the locusts gave the story some amount of depth in my opinion. There were plenty of on the edge of your seat moments which kept the movie moving at a good pace. Not a lot of humour and Pratt and his hand and everyone who thought they would also join in with the hand got a bit old.I'm not sure what people are expecting but this was a thoroughly entertaining movie from start to finish that both the adults and children in my family really enjoyed.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I grew up watching Jurrassic Park as a kid. I watched all 3 movies nearly every few months growing up. I had the toys and would dress up playing ""dinosaur."" I even had a ""vest"" pretending I was Dr. Grant haha. Goes without saying, I'm a huge Jurrasic Park fan. I just saw this movie on Saturday with my wife, and we both absolutely loved it! First off, they did a really good job bringing back the original characters and blending their storylines with the new cast. The dialougue between them, the way they interacted, was really well written and well acted. The writers were careful to pay their respects to the original cast. They didn't rush any scenes. They spent time on each scene/gave time for things to develop. They were in ""true character/how they would have acted in the originals. This means everything to fans! Well done! Also, we were so happy to see how they added to the original characters' storyline, as I am sure other fans are also (I won't spoil anything :)). GREAT action, the actors have good chemistry, and it ties up all loose ends from all the movies!","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

So I didn't expect much. But the trailers had looked exciting, so I went to see it. And, surprisingly, I really enjoyed myself with all the realistic CGI, and the very many, many exciting, hair-raising chase sequences kept me engaged throughout the film. I came in with such low expectations, but I left feeling very satisfied. This movie featured excellent acting, acceptable dialogue and story line, and a pleasurable amount of amazing artwork and graphics. Perhaps not a perfect movie, but a very, very good summer blockbuster. Considerably better than most, in my opinion.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

They may have made this movie for money and all that, but that's not important.

It's easily the best and worst Jurassic World film. Lots of visuals to love here but the story and most performances were all over the place. I attribute this to the dialogue. Young Isabella Sermon and Campbell Scott are the two consistently good performances throughout, but the rest are hit and miss. There are way too many things happening to justify an interesting story. And far too many main characters running around for all of them to survive without a scratch. My favorite part of the film was in the middle, as things start escalating. But the beginning was kinda boring and the finale just disappointing.If there is anything to like about the movie, it's the hybrid dinosaurs not introduced previously. It was also great to have the original cast in the film, but I believe they were overused, making their presence almost corny. Overall, I think for a dinosaur movie, the Jurassic Park films do a better job at capturing realism. The Jurassic World films, especially Dominion, was just way too obscure to capture the realism of the original trilogy. Unrealistic.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It not only entertained, but also sparked my interest in all things dinosaurs and was one of the movies that made me want to be a filmmaker. I am happy that even as I have grown older, and my cinematic tastes have matured I still am able to rate the film highly. I would echo with most regarding the sequels and that they all left much to be desired. The Lost World is entertaining and has some nice world building and spectacle but lacks the charm of its predecessor. Jurassic Park III is essentially one long action set piece with a storyline that is neither interest nor very exciting. Jurassic World is essentially the first movie on a larger scale but still is charming and entertaining. Fallen Kingdom has a nice set up but after the island is engulfed into ash it essentially becomes a monster-in-the-house kind of movie. Dominion I am sorry to say is not the complete home run a fan has been hoping for in 29 years.Dominion has the ambitious task of concluding this trilogy of Jurassic installments, finish the arcs for the new and old casts of characters, and ultimately conclude the franchise as a whole. It aims high but doesn't grasp at the greatness it's hoping to achieve. There is too much going on in the plot that often it feels like two different movies spliced into one. There are so many concepts, themes, characters, and set-ups that it honestly comes across like somebody edited down an entire season of television into a two-and-a-half-hour film - To be honest, I think I would have preferred a series over a movie given how much Colin Trevorrow sets out to do in such a span of time. The cast all do fine, everyone is charismatic, the imagery is often dynamic and fantastic, and the spectacle is often incredible to witness on the big screen, though the wonderment of the original and even The Lost World and to an extent Jurassic World feels almost entirely lost.Watching the film, I couldn't help but think that Trevorrow learned a lot from his experience with working on the ninth episode of Star Wars and how Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilm/Disney mismanaged and letdown legions of fans, and when he left and set out to try and avoid the pitfalls of The Rise of Skywalker by trying to give everyone as much as he thought they wanted; he succeeds to an extent, but the overlong runtime and constant juggle of storylines and characters make the more satisfying moments lacking total and complete emotional impact. I don't blame him for trying, especially given that Fallen Kingdom wasn't as well liked as Jurassic World and trying to make a picture that pleases every fan is satisfying as well. I wish it had worked out in his favor, but alas.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Also it's one of 'Jurassic' series and this one is the end of the 'World' series even it's good or not.I liked 'Park' trilogy a lot when I first watched them and were a kind of revolution of film history by CGI.Then the 'World' series. This sequel is started with opening of amusement park called 'Jurassic World' which the first series couldn't make. But there were some problems and it got out of control as first 'JP'. Not only that, the volcano in the island exploded and people decided to put the dinosaurs out of the island.Now, a lot of dinosaurs are all over the world. How do you deal with this chaos? That's the story of 'Dominion'.I think it was really hard to finish this story because of the bigness of scale.My fear was right. It was too much even creators did great job.Of course I was really excited for those people from 'Park' series and homage from old series. I enjoyed actions and battles of dinosaurs a lot. I was touched by the last scene by Chris Platt and the velociraptor because I like them even they had been getting smarter and smarter in the whole series. It was really unexpected thing that I was almost crying because of T-Rex.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is an entertaining movie that never takes itself too seriously. Of course there are some scenes very reminiscent of prior Jurassic Park movies but that isn't a bad thing.There are mainly three things going on and as the story develops they get tied together. One, a number of places where dinosaurs are being bred illegally, and we some involved in illegal fighting for sport. Second, the appearance of some really big bio-engineered locusts, maybe as long as 18 inches or so, and they are systematically devastating crops. If left unchecked it could lead to a worldwide food shortage.And third, the little bio-engineered girl, a clone of her scientist mother is now a teenager and typically rebellious, but also figuring out how her DNA was engineered can be a critical link to solving other issues.The movie has the mandatory manic action, most of it involving evading and fighting off dinosaurs that seem to want to eat people. The various stunt doubles get really good workouts. And there is the airplane, heavily damaged, when asked ""What's the plan?"" She responds, ""Whatever happens, that's the plan."" Fortunately for the story good things happen.My wife and I watched it at home on BluRay from our public library. Great sound track also, gives the subwoofer a good workout. Also the BD has some interesting extras on making the movie and how they tied in characters from the older Jurassic Park movies. And how they were able to use so many different animatronic approaches rather than CGI for everything. A real treat for movie-making nerds like me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Does the writer has a Hulk arm or how he could think that would even be possible? And the CG of that scene was very bad too. With every scene other scene the movie managed to pull my expectation even further down. Oh, and want to ask, did they tried to resemble Tim Cook in the movie as the CEO of the company?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Sure, in Dominion the value of entertainment is still there but the story was in my opinion too long stretched. I missed some suspense and surprising moments and it could have been cut for at least 30 minutes. I was disappointed for the poor end and that nothing has been shown to be continued in a sequel.The special effects were less good and sometimes cheesy but the dinosaurs seemed again real done.
