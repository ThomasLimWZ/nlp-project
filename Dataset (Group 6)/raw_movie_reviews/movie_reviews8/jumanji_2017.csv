"8","/10","No idea why it took me 2 years to watch it","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5274516/?ref_=tt_urv","danielmanson","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur89745032/?ref_=tt_urv","23 November 2019","It's good. I had no idea what to expect in all honest. I am not huge fans of other movies by these actors, but this really worked. You could see the great chemistry between them all and it paid off.What I liked: I enjoyed how it didn't dither about at the beginning and got right into the action. Jack Black especially was brilliant and hilarious! All the actors/actresses were great but Jack Black stood out. Good mix of action and comedy throughout. I was on the edge of my seat (metaphorically) wanting them to escape the game.Negatives: not many to be honest, couple of scenes were slightly cringe, but not off putting. Same logic goes for a couple of scenes which felt dragged out.I think people need to forget about this being a remake of a classic film and treat it as a separate movie altogether. If you start comparing the 2 that's when it goes wrong.Ps.. Karen Gillan. Marry me please?Worth watching and will be going cinema for 2nd instalment.","113 out of 131 found this helpful.

I didn't see the need for it and couldn't possibly see it at the same quality and style as the first one. Expectations sank even lower when I found about the cast. And then, 2 years later, I finally watched and, surprise, it's fun. It isn't something that will make you rolling on the floor from laughing or make you cry, but it's an enjoyable ride, actors actually aren't bad and wooden, so you will find yourself grinning a lot, particularly at the male part of the cast, which is awesome, especially Kevin Hart. Watch it with a good friend or a loved one and enjoy. It's not a masterpiece, but it's not just a dumb Hollywood blockbuster either. 8/10","55 out of 68 found this helpful.

It's called ""Jumanji"" and when they play it, the game sucks them into its world, where they each inhabit a different character: nerdy Spencer becomes Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), a musclebound action hero; football jock Fridge becomes diminutive sidekick Mouse (Kevin Hart); vacuous pretty girl Bethany becomes chubby middle-aged male scientist Prof. Oberon (Jack Black); and academically-driven Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan) a sexy martial artist. The quartet learn that they have to complete the game to return to the real world and their real bodies, but they each only have 3 lives in the game; die 3 times in the game, and they die for real.I saw the original Jumanji movie back in 1995 and liked it a great deal and I was therefore dreading how a reboot would taint the memory of the original. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The dichotomy of the characters in their real lives versus their in-game personas is funny and well exploited, and the conventions of video game storytelling and set-up are also lampooned with some wit. Johnson, Hart and Black are all performers who can be over the top, but the material calls for it here, and they all exceed, as does Gillan, especially during her hilariously awkward ""seduction"" scene. Even if some of the animal peril is blatantly more CGI cartoonery, it also fits with the videogame milieu. This strictly popcorn fare, but it isn't brainless, although it's a bit predictable. Still, it was much better than expected.","16 out of 18 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A movie with power packed smoldering intensity","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4118985/?ref_=tt_urv","veeresh1209","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46439746/?ref_=tt_urv","6 April 2018","Reboots can be tricky. While some click, most of them crumble under the pressure to shake off the barrage of comparisons that would be thrown at the movie. Last couple of years saw such horrible reboots like Jurassic World, The Mummy, Kong: Skull Island. But much like Spiderman: Homecoming, Jumanji succeeds to impress the viewers. 
Jumanji gets a modern age makeover where now instead of a board game it is a video game. Four teenagers with varying personalities are put together in a detention. Here they discover the Jumanji video game and enter the world of Jumanji as their avatars. Then starts the fun ride. There are enough plot holes like how did the video game end up in a high school from Alex's freak house. The movie uses time tested cliche - Four teenagers with some flaw realize their shortcomings when (literally) seen from some other's point of view. But the fun parts of the movie makes us forget them, at least till the movie ends.The movie does not take itself seriously, and that is a huge plus point. The plot of the movie is crazy, there are man eating albino (what?!) rhinos on one side and villainous henchmen with crazy mud racing bike skills on the other side. But such craziness has been ridiculed in the movie itself, which makes you fall in love with it more.The bigger plus for the movie has been the performance of the lead actors. All of them have created niche for themselves in the film industry. Jumanji has used such niche beautifully and built very funny characters. Parts where Dwayne Johnson(Spencer) stops to admire his own physique will have you in splits. Not to mention his hilarious display of 'smoldering intensity'. Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart and Jack Blake as a women in a man's body is perfect. Karen Gillan, who is this mean Nebula in MCU, comes up with a very charming performance.All in all, Jumanji is a movie that you can watch without any regret. It will make you gasp, wonder and laugh hysterically. It is definitely worth a watch.","90 out of 129 found this helpful.

The advertising didn't have me completely sold, was worried as to whether it would be fun or turn into puerile immaturity and wasn't sure about the cast entirely. Saw it anyway being someone who wanted to see as many 2017 films as possible, who has seen their fair share and likes films intended to be escapist fun, who loves the Jumanji premise and who has fondness for the Robin Williams film.'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' turned to be much better and far more enjoyable than expected. It may not be a masterpiece or great, but it clearly strived to be glossy escapist fun and succeeded very well in that. Do prefer the earlier film but other than the title and the basic premise 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' to me seemed like its own take and should stand on its own. Can see definitely why it won't appeal, and hasn't appealed to (though on the most part have seen more positivity than negativity), some. Didn't care for the first twenty minutes or so in the real world. It didn't have an awful lot of momentum in a first act that was just setting things up and took too long to do so, was awkward at times in the writing and the acting was far more comfortable and interesting once we got to Jumanji. Most of the performances are fine once the film got going, but for me Nick Jonas was very bland and while more subdued than he usually is Kevin Hart for me sometimes grated (though at other points he is amusing), the rapid loudmouth shtick is going to be a very acquired taste. However, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' was highly successful in its aim of being glossy fun escapism. The film is two hours but once we're in Jumanji they fly by. Although the story can be extremely predictable and the outcomes not surprising, the lively energy, the exciting thrills, thrilling action and suitably nail-biting but not intensely so sense of peril more than compensates.As do the witty script, that has the right dose of humour and surprising heart and even with the profanity from Hart it doesn't ever get too crude or puerile, and ace visual effects. Jumanji is colourfully rendered and mostly the film is nicely shot and more than capably directed. The music is rousing and pleasant to listen to and the ending is cosy and surprisingly poignant, which one doesn't expect yet it doesn't jar too much. There's even a nice Robin Williams/Alan Parrish tribute/homage touch, that is worth looking for if especially observant.Dwayne Johnson smoulders in intensity and charisma, in terms of acting style it is very familiar territory for Johnson but he does it well and that's all that matters. Karen Gillen more than holds her own with the other leads, with a good deal of sass and charm (her flirting/dance scene after being taught to do it is one of the film's highlights). Bobby Cannavale is suitably formidable villain, if somewhat underused. Absolutely agree with everybody who says that Jack Black steals the show, he has the funniest lines and moments (which are plenty) and it is perhaps his best performance since 'School of Rock'. The character interplay, which the film is heavy on, really sparkles.In conclusion, fun and surprisingly good film if not a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox","13 out of 17 found this helpful.

Not only is it a virtual non-stop ride of hilarity and laugh-out-loud moments, and it is, but the chemistry among the adult cast members is practically flawless and lends to the easy banter and overflowing, genius, COMEDIC DIALOGUE which just SHINES. Every look, every gesture, every note from The Rock, Kevin Hart and Jack Black are perfection in that at no time do you doubt they are who they are supposed to be. Karen Gillan is adorable and gorgeous at the same time. The obvious fun they are having, despite what I imagine to be uncomfortable filming locales, is palpable, and as an audience member, _if you allow yourself to be_, you WILL be swept up and transported by it.So, why ANY low ratings?While the first Jumanji was 'fun', underneath the fun, there were dark layers. There is none of that here and perhaps, this is where some of the disconnect from its detractors comes from. Unlike the original Jumanji, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a fun, and funny, film throughout. In closing, quite to the contrary of what a couple of reviewers are saying about Robin Williams, such as: 'he'd be rolling over in his grave (over this movie)', Robin Williams was one of those rare and amazingly special individuals who found joy and humor in most everything, and who chose to share that with those of us who are lucky enough to be witness to some of the favorites he left behind. Personally, I find it in very bad taste and verging on offensive, that those who seem to not share the capacity to laugh or live the way he did, or the ability to laugh with the rest of us, and who lack the gift of both being able to give or receive the very humor which exuded from Mr. Williams, would dare say he would be doing anything other than laughing riotously while munching on some popcorn and watching this film.Thank you, Robin Williams, for the precursor which was so fantastic, it brought about an equally wonderful sequel.You are missed.","365 out of 455 found this helpful.

I'm thankful for this as I'm tired of the senseless reboots, seriously enough already.With a fantastic cast who are all bringing their A game Jumanji is a very generic Hollywood movie. What I mean by that is its predictible, it's flashy, it's loud and has all the usual tropes that you'd expect.Don't get me wrong I'm not saying that's entirely a bad thing, at least it has fantastic production values but sadly it means it lacks in originality and has no real identity of it's own.Telling the story of 4 teenagers who get pulled into Jumanji, yet this time it's updated and has become a video game!Plenty of comedy, both hit and miss, the stunning Miss Gillan on show and Jack Black for the first time in years actually reminding us why we used to love him.It goes without saying that I prefer the first movie but credit where credit is due Welcome To The Jungle did exceed my expectations as I think I subconciously went in expecting and perhaps wanting to hate it.Nothing special, all flash with little filler.

In any case, I think I've visited here maybe twice in the last five years. Today though, after just getting back from watching this with my almost-grown kids, I had to make an account just to leave this review.To begin, I'll never understand people. I can't believe the negative reviews. How could anyone not have laughed like hell while watching this and still have a pulse? I didn't go in expecting much, but I came out with a smile on my face. The girl is hot, Jack Black ""owns it"", I've never been overly enthused about Kevin Hart, but he was fantastic. and The Rock just knocked it out of the park. I saw one review which reads: ""not a wrestling fan ever so to see 'the rock' in movies, instantly puts me off!"" Does anyone else want to vomit at the inanity, irony and ludicrousness of that statement? Then you have the user who out of 40+ titles he/she has reviewed in the past has only ever rated TWO above three stars. Seriously, if you don't enjoy films and find them so terrible, find a new hobby already. You've got one guy saying the shirt one of the kids wore was outdated. So, I'm guessing one can only wear clothing depicting the current year? Then you have the reviewers who maybe didn't understand the dialogue since they can barely communicate correctly themselves (such gems - I kid you not - as: 'averege'; 'what so ever'; 'family fair' (fare); 'are just wasn't'; 'due to it has'; 'all of there' {their); 'coz it is boring story'; 'no compare with'). Finally, you have the maybe half dozen reviewers who are so caught up in their bigotry that they can't relax and enjoy a film if it isn't whitewashed and who complain about the ""Hollywood liberal agenda of diversity"". Leave the politics at the door, man.
In short, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle was a fantastic hour or more of rip-riding fun and laughs.Except for one very funny moment, Dwayne Johnson retires his wrestling persona for this film and instead, provides a smoldering and intense performance, riddled with good-natured hilarity as the lead in this film. Gillan was great in Doctor Who, and although I thought she was the weakest of both characters and actors in this film, she still held her own and looked fantastic doing so. She has one of those faces you can't help but love. Kevin Hart was fantastic as the diminutive valet and looking back, I think he was somehow involved in every funny moment in which I laughed the hardest. Finally, the master, the maestro (though I never really was a fan prior to this), Jack Black plays the teen beauty queen with 100% commitment and to perfection.10/10 and definitely a film I will be purchasing right after I click ""Submit"". You can never have enough laughter in life, and Jumanji, Welcome to the Jungle delivers barrels-full.","179 out of 247 found this helpful.

Karen Gillan is adorable as the socially awkward nerdy girl. Jack Black playing a self obsessed popular girl is laugh out loud funny.

This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018.  No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting.  Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. ""Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!"" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much. Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.
 
Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch). Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car ""why can't you just drive us where we need to go?"" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is. Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with ""I'm just saying you're a babe."" Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short. These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.","46 out of 77 found this helpful.

The original is well crafted and now it's 2017 and we have Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. It's a fun, action comedy film with really cool references to the first film but as much as it entertains me it's not Jumanji. As Robin Williams said ""I've seen things you've only seen in your nightmares"" but in this film the jungle is safe enough to make margaritas and have scented candles on display. Dwayne Johnson tries to play a geeky character but he still plays that big tough guy. Kevin Hart plays himself nothing new, Karen Gillan plays a geeky shy girl and she has done that before and finally the highlight of the film is Jack Black playing as a teenage girl named Bethany. Everything Jack says is incredibly funny and will leave you falling off your seat.

It's by no means the greatest film ever made but it is a film I never thought would need a sequel, the very idea being a product of the lazy Hollywood cycle. To do a sequel to Jumanji, you have to be brave enough to evolve the franchise and not just rehash it all, which is exactly what they did with Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.When four teenagers get sucked into the video game Jumanji, they become their chosen avatars; Dr Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black), Franklin Finbar (Kevin Hart) and Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan). Together they must play along and finish the game to stand any chance of getting back home.The evolution of Jumanji from board game to video game is one of the sensible ways that the creative team bring us a sequel two decades after the original was released. It's the only way the kids of today would ever play it so to see the game itself change to attract new players makes sense. The idea of a sequel after all this time is one that left me skeptical however, thanks to a changed concept of the story taking place inside the game rather than the game coming to the real world, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle quickly became a sequel to become interested in.The changed concept is one that leads to a good old-fashioned adventure romp full of action and plenty of fun for the entire family. The idea of the kids being sucked into the game and being forced to play it out as characters totally opposite to their everyday selves makes for an amusing watch, the raucous laughter from the audience being a telling sign.No one is having more fun here than the four leads of the film mind. Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan all make Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle such great entertainment; Johnson milking it while playing a nerd trapped inside the body fit for an action movie star, Hart revelling in the big guy trapped in a small guy's body role, Black stealing the film as the Instagram obsessed girl playing as an overweight professor, a role he seems so suited for, and Gillan bringing the fierceness when she needs to as Ruby Roundhouse a.k.a. the ""Killer of Men"" which, as you've guessed, is so far away from her character back in the real world. You get a sense that working on this set would have been so much fun.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle works as a continuation of the Jumanji franchise, even if there are people out there who are adamant it won't. It's the perfect kind of film to take the family along to and I can guarantee fun will be had all round. It was much better than I was expecting and I'm ready to call it the biggest surprise of the year.","35 out of 85 found this helpful.

So when it was announced that a sequel was in the works 22 years later, my first reaction was ""Oh no... is nothing sacred?"". It's fair to say that I went into this flick with extremely low expectations.But I have to say that - given this low base - I was pleasantly surprised. It's actually quite a fun fantasy film that I predict that older kids will adore. Initially set (neatly) in 1995, a teen - Alex (Nick Jonas, of the Jonas Brothers) unearths the board game Jumanji where it ended up buried in beach-sand at the end of the last film. ""Who plays board games any more?"" he scoffs, which the game hears and morphs into a game cartridge. Cheesy? Yes, but no more crazy than the goings on of the first film. Back in 2017, four high-school teens - geeky Spencer (Alex Wolff, ""Patriot's Day""); sports-jock Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain); self-obsessed beauty Bethany (Madison Iseman); and self-conscious, nerdy and shy Martha (Morgan Turner) - find the game and are sucked into it, having to complete all the game levels before they can escape.But they are not themselves in the game; they adopt the Avatars they chose to play: Dr Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson, ""San Andreas""); Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart, ""Get Hard""); Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan, ""Dr Who"", ""The Circle""; ""Guardians of the Galaxy""); and Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black, ""Sex Tape"", ""Kong""). Can they combine their respective game talents - and suppress the human mental baggage they brought with them - to escape the game?There was a really dark time-travelling angle to the storyline of the original film - the traumatic start of Disney's ""Flight of the Navigator"" was perhaps also borrowed from the concept in the book by Chris Van Allsburg - and an attempt is made to recreate this in the sequel. The first film rather pulled its punches though in favour of a rather Hollywood ending: will this be the case this time? The film delivers laughs, but in a rather inconsistent fashion - it is mostly smile-worthy rather than laugh-out-loud funny. Much fun is had with the sex change of Bethany's character, with Jack Black's member featuring - erm - prominently. The characters all have strengths and weaknesses, like a game of Top Trumps, and this also entertains. But the most humour derives from the ""three lives and it's game over"" device giving the opportunity for various grisly ends, often relating to the above referenced weaknesses. Given the cast that's been signed up, the acting is not exactly first rate although Karen Gillan shines as the brightest star. But ""it's not bloody Shakespeare"" so ham-acting is not that much of a problem and the cast all have fun with their roles. Dwayne Johnson in particular gets to play out of character as the 'nerd within the hunk', and his ""smouldering look"" skill - arched eyebrow and all - is hilarious. Rhys Darby, looking so much like Hugh Jackman that I had to do several double takes, also turns up as an English game-guide in a Land Rover, and Bobby Cannavale (""Ant Man"") is Van Pelt, the villain of the piece.There has been much controversy over Karen Gillan's child-sized outfit. But she is clearly a parallel to the well-endowed Lara Croft, and young male teens didn't play that game for the jungle scenery! She is meant to be a hot and sexy video game character, and man - does she deliver! Gillan is not just hot in the film: she is #lavahot. This makes her comic attempts at flirting lessons (as the internally conflicted Martha) especially funny. Hats off to her stunt doubles as well, for some awe-inspiring martial arts fight scenes.Fans of ""Lost"" will again delight in the Jumanji scenery, surely one of the most over-used film locations in Hawaii if not the world!Where the film gets bogged down is in too much cod-faced philosophizing over the teenager's ""journeys"". This is laid on in such a clunky manner in the early (slow!) scenes that the script could have been significantly tightened up. And as I said above, the script - written, rather obviously, by a raft of writers - could have been so much funnier. Most of the humour comes from visually seeing what's happening: not from the dialogue.Directed by Jake Kasdan (son of director and Star Wars/Raiders screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan) it's really not half as bad as it could have been or as I feared, and I would gladly watch it again. For it's target audience, which is probably kids aged 10 to 14, I think they will love it. And, unlike many holiday films, the parents won't be totally bored either (especially the Dads, for the obvious misogynistic reasons outlined above!).","32 out of 78 found this helpful.

Robin Williams, fresh off hits like Aladdin and Mrs Doubtfire, delivered a performance for the ages. An animated tv series soon followed. Then Robin Williams passed away. Soon, it was time to reboot Jumanji for a new generation hooked on 3d games. Thus, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was born. The character that Williams played, Alan Parrish, is honored in an homage during the beginning of the movie. The main cast is excellent, with Karen Gillan, hot off Doctor Who and Guardians of the Galaxy, as well as Kevin Hart and Jack Black along with Dwayne Johnson, a.k.a. The Rock, in his biggest hit of his career since the last Fast and Furious movie. The special effects are just as good as the original movie, and there's tons of pop culture and video game references in this film that is still playing in theaters while making its digital HD debut this week with a physical release in two weeks.

Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a stand-alone, HILARIOUS romp which leaves the original in the dust. Heck, HILARIOUS IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. Note that this is not to say that the original Jumanji was bad. On the contrary, it was great, especially for when it was filmed and who better than SIR Robin Williams, but in terms of laugh-out-loud good fun and non-stop smiles, this Jumanji far outpaces and outdoes the original. While my BF and I have somewhat different tastes in movies, and he is not a Rock fan (he loved him as a wrestler, not so much as an actor), we both laughed SO MUCH while watching this. The Rock knocks it out of the park with equally stellar performances by Jack Black and Kevin Hart. What is even more fabulous is that it has kids humor, yes, but also 'thinking-people's humor' in the form of obscure little tidbits which are dropped here and there and keep you on your toes and grinning ear-to-ear. There is hardly any scene where you step out of the roller coaster ride of fun it sets you on from the moment they (and you) are IN Jumanji.Do yourself a favor. Watch this, and if you don't laugh raucously at LEAST six times, seriously, consider what else might be wrong. In fact, if you read through some of the negative comments, you see the same old, bored, stagnant people complaining about it being ""too PC"", AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. Cry me a river. If you notice these people's other reviews, it is easy to see that anything that they consider too scary (read: progressive) to fit in the mold of their little minds and world, automatically gets relegated to the 1/10 pile. Shame.In closing, this Jumanji gained a place within my favorite movies of all time, and the only thing which makes me sad about it, is that 1. I wonder if upon a fourth viewing (we saw it three times) through my 20th it will lose some of its luster; and 2. that it wasn't much, much longer, as I did not want the fun to end.","152 out of 273 found this helpful.

This movie almost do nothing but insult that beautiful legacy by just existing as a sequel no one even asked before (almost like the female version of Ghostbusters did (2016) to the original Ghostbusters (1984), and thank god I didn't watch the former on the theater, otherwise I just banged my head to the hardest and the thickest wall many times until I felt I had unwatched it). Sure the jokes make everyone laughs (and I hate to admit that I laughed few times too), but not all the jokes are the good jokes worth laughing out loud for. I'm pretty sure some of the viewers decided to use a cringe expression to some of the jokes, especially the ones that included male's vital organ as the laughing material. The action scenes were not good either, I mean, to the overall scenes, it feels like they were sinking very deep in the bottom of the ocean in the middle of a vast sea of talking, jokes, drama, and any other kind of unimportant moments. some of the moments with the cgi (and the plot) makes me think this movie should have been made into a tv series instead of a 2-hour long movie that ends up as a one of the year's worst movie ever set foot on the big screen (though I don't think many people would like it either). so, in short, all I was saying can be put in this one sentence: not even the comedy trio Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson-Kevin Hart-Jack Black can make this movie interesting to watch from beginning to end.","45 out of 122 found this helpful.

Never mind that originally it washed up from the ocean in France at the end of the first movie. It ""morphs"" into a Play Station-like self-contained video game and a teen-aged boy is sucked into it and becomes a helicopter pilot. Twenty-one years later, 4 teens get sucked into it again. This time, it is a jungle-themed adventure game with a rather-thin ""plot"" which follows silly video game protocols. Each player has 3 lives and special strengths and weaknesses, which they can view and sometimes control. Many twists and turns. The 4 ""gamers"" are transformed into new avatars. Two of them are almost ""invulnerable"". One is a Tarzan-like ""Indiana Jones"" and a gorgeous babe combining the charms of ""Laura Croft"" and Marvel's ""Black Widow "". Both can perform impossible leaps and bounds, like superheroes. A nerdy girl turns into a boy nerd (Jack Black). All are chased (and some are killed) by dangerous jaguars, ""man-eating"" hippos and rhinos. One gets blown up by explosive food, jumping to their death, etc. All are restored by their extra lives. Much ""tame"" mostly non-graphic video game violence, no cuss words, and the ""feeling"" that everything will turn out fine in the end. They are helped along-the-way by various ""guides"" and the magical powers of a luminous green gem that creates evil and yet returns everything back to normal when it is returned, similar to ""The Temple of Doom"" concept. Uttering the word ""Jumanji"" ends the game. The original player returns to his own timeline and so does everyone else. ""Jimanji 3"" is planned, and I don't really see a reason for it as the game is destroyed at the end of this movie. Perhaps magic or cursed things are ""immortal""? Look for ""Jumanji 3-The Search for More Money"" (my title) in 2 years.","8 out of 10 found this helpful.

The group dynamics are excellent, and they all have hilarious back-and-forths with each other. Some of my favorite moments in the movie are when everyone is simply standing around talking. Dwayne Johnson really shows his comedic talents here. While he does have a few scenes where he gets to show off his action chops, most of his role is comedy-heavy, and he delivers on it. Kevin Hart plays the same character he always plays, and more times than not it annoys me, but for whatever reason here it works. Maybe it's his chemistry with the other actors, but he's hysterical in this movie. I'm not a huge fan of Karen Gillan's character of Nebula in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, so I wasn't sure how she was going to be in this. But she delivers as well. Not only does she nail the action beats (and she has some of the best in the whole movie), but she also has some great comedic moments, comedy that I didn't know she could pull off as well as she did. But the true star of this movie is Jack Black. I thought he was hysterical in the trailer, but I was afraid that the concept of him actually being a teenage girl would get old and annoying quick, but it doesn't. Black is perfect for this role, and nails every comedic moment he's given. They are all fantastic together, and it makes for some great entertainment...","100 out of 180 found this helpful.

While the original movie has its moments, it loses itself in its silliness and nonsense. Jake Kasdan's installment proves to be a well-directed remake/reboot/sequel/whatever with a hilarious screenplay and a fast pacing (plus a cool score).Nevertheless, without this cast, it wouldn't be as good as it is. The fact that everyone (except Kevin Hart) portrays an anti-type character is itself remarkable. Watching a beast like Dwayne Johnson play an easily scared kid or Jack Black acting like he is a young teenage girl trapped in a middle-aged man's body is something that I never thought I needed until I actually witnessed it. Karen Gillan also does a fantastic job and Bobby Cannavale, unfortunately, is just portraying a villain who shows up once in a while, for a few seconds.Still, the film has its narrative flaws and two of them are arguably plot holes. The CGI sometimes is too noticeable and it bothered me a little. Basically, if you are able to accept or ignore the story's lack of logic on some details, you are in for a hell of a ride. It's entertaining from beginning to end and it even has some unexpected emotional moments, so if you need to watch an adventurous comedy with some friends at home, watch Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. You are not going to be disappointed!","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Average cinematography, the characters were stereotypical and boring, the plot was highly predictable and trite (as in, there was no part of the entire movie that caught me off guard or that I didn't expect), and the scenes that were apparently meant to be suspenseful or exciting were not. The film was full of cheesy, forced dialogue and pointless romantic subplots (one of my biggest pet peeves in action/adventure movies). It did have a few funny moments, which is just about the only thing that made me give it higher than a 1/10 rating.It's not the worst thing I've seen in my life, and to be fair I don't usually watch this genre of movie (it was the one my cousin wanted to see), but around halfway through I definitely was bored and looking forward to the end. In hindsight, I wouldn't have spent $10 and two hours on this. It's probably an all right family movie or an appealing plot for a 12-year-old, but for me it was a total yawn.","117 out of 290 found this helpful.

This was a very funny movie. Arguably one of the best performance Jack Black has done. When I watched this with my family, in a packed movie theatre, I kid you not, the entire cinema was laughing during quite a few of the scenes. The humour is excellently tailored to the audience and is a beautiful tribute to the original Jumanji with Robin Williams. The way it fantastically coincides with the original movie and moves onto a sort of sequel to this is beautiful, and a rare thing these days. The movie is very funny and easily one of the greatest movies to have come out this year. It is certainly in the top 15 movies that have come out, post 2010, accompanied with the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool and now the recent movie that just came out, Bright. If you felt that Bright was also under-appreciated by movie critics, the exact same thing has happened here as Jumanji is a 100% gaurantee, a movie that will be appreciated after watching. Personally, I would watch it again and again with people. It is not just a movie to watch and discard, this is one to put on the bookshelf and watch again in the future. Loved it. Thank you for such a great movie with a fantastic and fun cast who clearly have great chemistry on and off the screen.","126 out of 232 found this helpful.

Bethany turns into Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black) and Martha into scantily clad fighter Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan).This is simply fun. There are good laughs. The chemistry of the four leads are amazing. The Rock and Kevin Hart have been here before. Their charisma is off the charts. Jack Black is great playing a girl and he has a great scene teaching Gillan to flirt. Karen Gillan has the quirky comedic skills in a super cute package. The only squeaky wheel is Nick Jonas. I'm not convinced of his acting skills. In that smaller role, it would be amazing to have a big cameo like Sly or Schwarzenegger. Nick Jonas is both stiff and lacking.

I would've laughed and shouted ""Objection!"". Yet, here we are and guess what? It doesn't suck! The same concept as the original but substituting the board game with a retro video game from 1996. Four students are magically transported into the game where they must place a jewel at the head of a jaguar mountain in order to save Jumanji. Fortunately the creators didn't rehash the exact same idea, instead they implemented a modern twist to it. That is the sequel's strength, deconstructing how video games function. Back in my youth when I aspired to be a video game developer, I self-taught all the elements into making a game. NPCs, avatars, levels, respawning etc. so their inclusion in this felt like a little nod to me which brought a gleeful smile to my face. This re-imagination focussed on comedy and action, the fantasy traits from the original have been put to one side. Whilst the comedy is hit and miss (mostly miss) and the action is plagued with CGI...I was still entertained. Jack Black was the standout as he portrays a girl in a middle aged man's body, had me laugh quite a few times. Dwayne Johnson was likeable as ever, but then again so were everyone else. The differing character archetypes and the ""you can be whoever you want to be"" moral felt extremely forced and all too familiar. Include the plot linearity, pointless antagonist and lack of pop songs (honestly, would've been more appropriate than an original musical score) and you have yourself a good film. Not great, but highly watchable. Maybe that is just what audiences needed, to which I cannot complain. A pleasant surprise is how I would describe this. Was just waiting for Guns N' Roses to play...waited patiently...the film was ending in its incredibly cringeworthy eye rolling way...and...YES! Credits song!

All of the actors are excellent but Jack Black truly shines as a high school girl trapped in, well, Jack Black's body. The action and special effects are thrilling, but the movie really shines in the comedy and the chemistry between the cast.A really smart choice on the filmmaker's part was to take the time at the beginning of the movie to establish the characters of the four main teenagers, so much so that when they enter the video game you still feel like you are watching those four characters even as they have been replaced by their more famous counterparts, which is a testament to the acting of those four stars.This taking time at the beginning makes the first act a little bit light on the action, but it makes up for that once our hapless heroes arrive in the world of Jumanji. The helicopter sequence in particular is a standout, one that left my five year old quite literally on the edge of her seat.The film is also funny, very, very funny. Jack Black has had a rough stretch of bombs and has been almost forgotten in recent years, but he absolutely takes over this movie in sections, reminding us of his considerable comedic talent. This is not to take away anything from the rest of the cast, who all have great moments, the banter between Johnson and Hart is fantastic, and Gillan's dance fighting is a particularly enjoyable moment as well.While it can be said that the happy ending and the main characters never seem truly in danger throughout the film, I don't think anyone is going to see this film for realism or for an unhappy resolution so it's hard to fault it for that. If you are looking for a fast paced fun bit of entertainment for the whole family (my five year old daughter and 65 year old father in law loved it equally) you can't do much better than Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.Rating *** (out of Four)","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Very surprising!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4008533/?ref_=tt_urv","rebeccalucy","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81827060/?ref_=tt_urv","20 December 2017","A surprisingly good continuation of this series, with some good humour and a modern update with a twist. The acting is decent, with the rock and Kevin Hart giving better performances than usual. But Karen Gillan and Jack Black supplied most of the great comedy in the film. Jack had to portray a very stereotypical popular girl, but he gives it all he has got and adds some much needed heart. However, the villian is very under used and bland. Bobby Canavale did not have any time to develop his character, so he does seem as such a big threat.I really enjoyed the video game update, with the multiple lives they allow for urgency and a little comedy. They definitely use the video game idea to their advantage, but it could become a little dated in the future. Also, some of the comedy falls flat and could become dated also. Such as the constant references to technology. The cinematography and editing is basic but that obviously wasn't the focus. Some of the backgrounds are beautiful with the lush jungle. However the CGI could use a little more work considering the amount it is used. Overall, a fun update to Jumanji work at least one watch!","9 out of 22 found this helpful.

The sequel takes a different turn to catch up with the current craze: VIDEO GAMES. The film stars Dwayne ""The Rock Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black as the avatars of four teenagers who were sucked into the game. If you've seen the cast or watched the trailers, you'd probably go into this film thinking its a comedy. IT'S NOT(at least not a good one). Most of the jokes in this film where already shown in the trailers, and the ones that weren't didn't really click well. But where one aspect of this film falls short, another stands tall and that is the action. The action scenes in this film are beautifully choreographed, from motorcycle chases to the dance fights the film always exceeds my expectations(it also doesn't hurt that the cast does most of their own stunts).  Speaking of the cast, they're a bit of a mixed bag. I usually love Kevin Hart but he doesn't really work in this film because of the setup with his teenage counterpart who is a confident, VERY SERIOUS, jock. Kevin Hart is basically just playing Kevin Hart which works a lot, but not here. Dwayne Johnson is lacking a lot in this film, yes he does great in action sequences, but when it comes to the serious heartfelt moments(which the film has)he doesn't deliver. Karen Gillan and Jack Black are the real stars here. Jack Black plays a great typical teenage mean girl, and Karen Gillan really proves that she can hold her ground with the big names around her. Not to mention, that she has the BEST action scenes in the film. Gamers who go and watch this film will have an especially good time with the film's nods and respect to the video game format, The NPC(non player character)gags, work really well, even with the general audience and the dramatic cutscene with the players commenting is a nice add in. The villain in this film is bad but that makes him good, most video game villains are usually handsome, one dimensional characters, who just want to destroy the world and that exactly what this villain is and why it works. The film shoots on location in Hawaii which leads to some great set pieces and makes the film more believable really amercing the audience into the world of Jumanji. The CGI in the film is also very well done for a film with a smaller budget. Surprisingly, this film has very well written screenplay which leads to some actual emotional and heartfelt moments, if only those moments were performed with real emotion and genuine acting. Sadly there not, most of these moments center around a character who has been trapped in the game for about 20 years. This character is played by Nick Jonas and it really, really does not work out well most of the film he over acts and cant even sell his comedy. Jumanji: Welcome To Jungle is one of the delightful surprises of 2017, delivering a fun ""Popcorn and Soda"" flick to watch with your friends and family in the theater on a holiday weekend.","9 out of 22 found this helpful.

It's a sequel 20 years later to a movie I really, really loved. And not to mention that Robin Williams made such a huge impact on my childhood and has sadly since passed, meaning anything anyone did would have to ultimately be compared to his original work, I expected to be tearing this movie apart.I expected to be doing that.But I'm not.Everyone in this movie really loved this movie and it came through. And they obviously loved the original too. They didn't try to reinvent the wheel, but instead redesigned it to fit a new vehicle. The game was still the game but in a new way that was still dated (feeling old and new at the same time) just like a game that is mysterious and possibly ancient should be. The characters chemistry worked well together, these guys are obviously friends on set and probably off too. And the dynamics of the story felt appropriate for kids my this generation, just like the dynamics felt right in the first movie for my generation.In the end I found myself laughing and saying aww and yes, even falling for the smoulderingly a time or two. If you go into this looking for a faithful remake of the first film you're going to be sorely disappointed. But if you're looking for a sequel done by people who obviously loved the original and wanted to continue the fascinating and amazing world of Jumanji, it's well worth it.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

It genuinely feels like they cast the actors first, then wrote supposedly ""cool and funny"" scenes about them, making it feel more like a bunch of unconnected sketches and action sequences than a real story.The main problem is that the humour seemed almost entirely aimed at the handful of young kids in my (very busy) screening, they loved it of course; but literally everyone else... silence for the entire movie. The special effects are fine and the action sequences exciting enough, but without a half-decent story to hold it together, it all feels a bit empty. Ultimately keep your expectations rock bottom and you can probably just go along for the ride. But 22 years after the original, I would highly recommend you give the old one another try before you bother with this.","88 out of 229 found this helpful.

The storyline was very well written, kinda different than the original movie and everything was well-explained, however it was kinda simple and easy to understand. The characters were very interesting, kinda well-developed and really likeable.

The casting was really GOOD and their acting was perfect, everyone portrayed their character amazingly well. Also, it was a very intense movie, action-filled and full of epic chase/fight scenes. The opening scene was kinda unpredictable and it was definitely promising. The ending scene was kinda unexpected and it was definitely really good.

It's a good concept, and the director Jake Kasdan delivered it in a funny way. While in the game, the teenagers transform into the characters they selected, which are played by Dwayne Johnson as Spencer, Kevin Hart as Fridge, Jack Black as Bethany and Karen Gillan as Martha. This transformation was a trigger for all of them to start questioning who they really are and to realize some of the problems and correspondent solutions to their problems. With a lot of adventure and a lot of funny moments, the movie definitely was not boring, and even though it had some corny moments, it was very enjoyable. As usual, Kevin Hart didn't disappoint with his humor. I just love seeing this actor in action. In my opinion, he deserved a bit more of screen time, but to be fair, the rest of the actors had to have their own time, and it was well distributed, I didn't feel like some got more attention than others, which is a good thing. Another thing that this movie succeeded to deliver was the feel and experience of a video game with ""real life graphics"". As a gamer, it was really funny to imagine myself in some of their situations. I don't want to spoil, you should see for yourself. Overall, the movie delivers what's intended: a Jumanji sequel. It has a lot of adventure, comedy and some good old life-changing moments. A solid 7 out of 10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is always fun to see Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart working together. Anything can happen. This film and remake makes all viewers really think about how everyone plays and sees video games.

They're usually incredibly cringey, dull, unfunny or forgettable. But I was delighted to discover that this movie is not one of those.Really the only way to go about creating a sequel to Jumanji starring Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black is not to take yourself seriously. This movie only works because the entire time it is marveling at how stupid and over-the-top it is. They make fun of themselves, they mock the plot itself at points, and nothing in the story is taken too seriously. So you're both laughing AT the movie and WITH the movie. It knows that its own existence is pretty dumb. And that's how it's able to be fun instead of cringey!Also, the action is pretty good. Everything is exciting and fun and, like I said, very self-aware. The comedy is also actually pretty good for what you'd usually expect in these kinds of movies. Lots of the jokes were genuinely funny and the way all the actors made fun of themselves and hammed it up was pretty entertaining.So yes! Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a success in my book. I have lots of respect for it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

They are; Spencer Gilpin, an intelligent but shy boy; Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson, Spencer's friend who is a football player needing academic 'help' who are caught cheating; Bethany Walker, a popular girl who used her phone in class and Martha Kaply, an academic high-flier who doesn't see the point of physical education... or PE teachers. Once in detention together they are left alone in a room and find an old games console. The hook it up to a TV and select their characters... then they find themselves sucked into the game in the bodies of their characters. They also gain their characters' allotted skills.Somewhat inevitably their new in-game avatars are rather different to their real world characters. Spencer finds himself in the body of man-mountain Dwayne Johnson; Fridge ends up as Kevin Hart, no longer a great athlete but with knowledge that the team will need; Bethany is perhaps the most shocked when she becomes Jack Black and Martha finds herself in the scantily clad body of Karen Gillan... complete with martial arts skills. They soon meet a character who gives them their task... if they are to exit the game they are to return a gem to the statue it was stolen from. If they are to escape they will need to adapt to their new strengths and weaknesses and work as a team as they face a variety of challenges. It helps that they each have three lives but it is far from clear what happens if they lose the third... although they assume it means real death.I haven't seen the original 'Jumanji' but thought this would be worth checking out as the concept sounded fun and the four lead actors have all impressed me in the past. They may be very different but the film this made me think of was 'The Breakfast Club'; not just because it involves students in detention. Like that film it shows the characters are more than their stereotypes; something they learn when they suddenly find themselves forced to as characters very different to their own. The cast are all on great form and provide many laughs. It was great seeing Dwayne Johnson playing a slightly wimpy character and it was hilarious seeing Jack Black as a high school girl! Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan really impressed as well. The action was solid with good CGI making it look real. The villain didn't have much of a character but that makes sense given that they are meant to be in a game... all the non-player characters are comically limited in what they say and do. The spectacular Hawaiian countryside is used to great effect to make the land of Jumanji. While there are no real surprises the story is a lot of with its impressive mix of action, humour and great characters. The humour mostly avoids crudeness... even the idea of a high school girl coming to terms with her new male body is dealt with in a way that is unlikely to offend too many people. Overall I'd definitely recommend this fans of 'Indiana Jones' style action.","9 out of 13 found this helpful.

Many voiced trepidation at the prospect of a sequel after all these years later, and after the tragic death of original star Robin Williams, there were valid concerns about whether this sequel could be both a good movie and a fitting sequel and tribute to what had come before.I am glad to report that it fulfilled all expectations.The film relies almost entirely on its star power, and it has that in spades with the likes of Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas. Where the charm resides, though, is the actors playing against their types through the means of real-world to video game body switching: The Rock embodying a nerdy hypochondriac, Hart an all-star jock, Gillan a shy insecure reject, and perhaps most brilliant of them all, Black housing a she's-all-that pretty girl. Together our four teenage protagonists get sucked into the video game incarnation of Jumanji, a jungle land that is threatened from the typical video game threat, and our heroes must do the usual video game tasks in order to beat the game and return to the real world, all without getting killed in-game, which will get them killed in real life after three lives.The film thematically treads the same sort of ground that other teen movies tend to cover, mainly the stereotypical high school tropes get thrust into a situation that forces them to work together to correct each other's flaws and by the end they return to their 'normal' lives as better people.What the film does different in the body-switching is that these tropes are transferred onto adult actors, people who each have tropes of their own, and the way that each actor gets to play against their type is definitely what makes this movie so fun.On the flipside, like a video game, the villain is very one- dimensional, and while the narrative isn't necessarily harmed by it, it does stand out as something that's lacking, wishing that the villain was more than just 'I will kill you because reasons'.Also, the character introductions in the real world at the beginning of the film feel very forced, as in we all know they end up in the game, and the reasons they get into the situation feel very convenient, as if the writers could not find an elegant means to get these four people in the same place in front of the game console at the same time, so they just threw them all together.These are fairly minor nitpicks, as the pace of this film is fast, it doesn't really drag at all, and while they do repeat a joke or two, it doesn't step over the line into annoying. All this makes for a very fun film, definitely worth your time this holiday season, and after once it gets released on home media.","102 out of 210 found this helpful.

I like all of the actors. Special effects were great. That's where it just comes to a slow boring, dying, disappointing halt. A few jokes were funny, I'll admit. A good action, comedy HAS TO KEEP YOU OFF BALANCE! That is a must. You have to feel like you just don't know what surprise is around the corner. It has to keep you on the edge of your seat, so to speak and it has keep you laughing. This film did neither. As I have often said, timing is everything in a movie. Dead spots are taboo. A well written and well edited film keeps it moving with constant, ongoing discovery.
This was more like a committee got together and decided to ""get a few throw pillows and some paint and make a movie"".
It felt like each scene was painfully contrived by amateurs. Too many dead spots.Most reviewers here thought it was great. I have to respectfully disagree and go against the grain. I make no apologies.","40 out of 103 found this helpful.

These days it seems like everything is getting a half-assed reboot or spinoff so when I went in to watch this movie I didn't expect anything life changing or original. And I was shocked with the results. This story was actually GOOD. It took the original concept that was Jumanji and made its own twists and turns and didn't actually butcher the original source. And I really enjoyed all the characters as well, which is something I couldn't exactly say about the original film. I was so surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie that honestly I find myself wanting to go back and re-watch it. When it comes to movies starring comedians, I don't really get very hopeful about the content and quality of the movie, especially these days when ""comedians"" turn out to mostly rely upon profanities and slap stick more than wit and actual humor. However, the jokes in this movie were on point and I really enjoyed Kevin Hart's performance as well as Dwayne Johnson's. They played well off one another and it wasn't over the top. And wow... I really did think Jack Black had hit the high point of his career back in Kung Fu Panda and was on the down slope, but he was easily one of the best parts of this movie. The casting for this movie was great overall.
 
Not only that, but this movie was more than the typical ""comedy"" movies you see nowadays that are all about getting drunk/spitting out as many curse words in a sentence as possible/being ""shocking"". There was a serious plot behind it with actual stakes and it played its serious moments very well. All of the characters went through important evolutions that were believable by the end of the film. Now, it wasn't perfect. There are things that were a bit off in terms of continuity and if you know the first Jumanji then you might see where I'm getting at, but it wasn't enough to take away from the film itself. Overall this was a very enjoyable movie and I'd definitely watch it again. The movie was a tasteful update to the Jumanji franchise, and to be honest I'd love to see if they have plans for a sequel. I'd certainly watch it given how well they treated this movie.Then again, I did watch Pitch Perfect 3 in the same night as this one, so this positive review might be a little biased when taking in both movies side by side in a short period of time.","26 out of 48 found this helpful.

It deserves and 8/10 for it's fun but is definitely a 6/10 film.It was a fun adventure film and I can't help but think that this would be reviewed favorably if it did not have the Jumanji name attached. This is a fact that does annoys me, and impacted my expectations.The first act of the film is dull, a clear rip off of the Breakfast Club, and gives the convoluted reason why this is a Jumanji film. Unfortunately, the first characters introduced are one dimensional and unlikable , you can see their arc from miles away. The film picks up quickly once our ""heroes"" finally gets to Jumanji and is the turning point. In testament to the setup, the characters do retain their traits throughout the movie, which was a shock considering the caliber of actors in the film, sorry Dwayne.This film succeeds due to it's comedy, which is on point for the most part and is driven by Jack Black. It was also helped by the fact that Kevin Hart is subdued, a wise decision as he is typically insufferable. Jack Black is finally back to his best, as he has been poor for many years and is the stand out part of the movie.The plot of the film is ludicrous and full holes, merely there to support the comedy but you don't mind as the comedy is spot-on. The action is acceptable and keeps the viewer engaged for the most part.This film is not a work of genius and doesn't pretend to be and is partly the reason it works. It doesn't have interesting visuals, a complex plot, terribly great acting but it is excellent fun and I would recommend to anyone looking to fill 2 hours.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I watched 1st Jumanji and it was really great (and I watched it a couple times). The sequel is a little different with it's successor, with the theme is still same, a game that involved real adventures to it's player. Four teenagers sucked into the game, and they become a character they chose (which is very different from their real life). The movie is so funny, and if you played RPGs game you will find this really entertaining. The humour is still suitable for young audiences, so it's a family movie too. And while it's a humour adventures movie, it still have a good message. So I really recommend it, hope you'll enjoy it too.","71 out of 150 found this helpful.

Every note is so carefully (overly) crafted. You say this and then you say that. Everything feels wooden, inauthentic. The original wasn't great, but fun entertainment and stuck to the book. Each character is a millennia caricature with ""cutesy"" moments they spent months writing. I didn't see one spontaneous moment in the entire film. They took the cast of Breakfast Club and stuck it in Jumanji. And they made sure they got every racial representative in there, not because the original books had it, but because they wanted to get social justice.I feel as annoyed by forced social justice racial diversity, as I would if they remade the Cosby show with Asian, White and Hispanic actors.The acting is just so bad. The mediocrity that people seem to enjoy today is astounding. The movie made ZERO sense, so they made sure they explained it, laying it out in lazy expositions.When you have to explain everything, your writing is poorly done. Show -- don't tell.

"7","/10","An update of a classic family film which makes it relevant for the family of today - better than I expected.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4309049/?ref_=tt_urv","one9eighty","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16650558/?ref_=tt_urv","28 August 2018","Four kids from an American school are working off their detention doing tedious chores; they find a games console and decide to have some fun. Fun turns to magical mystery danger when they get sucked into the video game they were playing, and thrown into a jungle adventure wearing the avatars of the characters they selected. In order to escape the game they must complete it, which involves returning a mysterious green jewel back into a statue, thus freeing the jungle of evil tyranny. In this brand new Jumanji adventure, things are updated for a newer audience, but the set-up is similar to the original film with Robin Williams. Instead of the game escaping into reality, reality is sucked into the game. Instead of the outdated concept of a board game, modern audiences would be more familiar with a games console. I didn't expect a lot from this film, I was prepared for a big budget, low enjoyment re-hash of the 90's film but I have to admit, I was wrong. As a gaming fan myself I enjoyed the updated version of Jumanji and enjoyed the references to game set-up scenarios - particularly when obvious questions were asked - like ""Why?"". As in ""Why can't you just drive us to what you are talking about?"" or ""Why have you called us instead of the legal authority?"" The use of video games as a spine of the concept allowed for OTT realism to be used, super strength, super jumping, instant reincarnation from death, etc. This was used to good effect as a way of progressing the vehicle of the plot, and for comedic emphasis too. The plot may have been done before, but the delivery was sweet all the same. The cast were really good, one and all; they convincingly portrayed the traits they brought from reality as well as the traits the video game gave them. Modern films have a tendency to make humour sexy or gross out/lewd, this didn't, which was refreshing, it kept things aimed at family friendly - ok, it played on stereotypes based on the characters in the movie, but it managed to show a lot of character development. The people at the start of the film are different from what you see at the end of the film. The self-obsessed socialite it-girl was more nature and adventure loving by the end and didn't rely on her phone to run her life.Like the first film, there were subtle situations/events on-screen which younger audiences will not necessarily follow which offer a lot of depth to film savvy minds; such as multiverse's, fragmented realities, time travel, butterfly effects, inanimate objects with powers. One of the morality statements the film tried subtly to make, but failed, was the attire that Karen Gillan's character was wearing - one hand it was making a statement about the sexism of video games, but then in subsequent scenes she is seen using her body and her sexuality as a weapon - making the statement less effective.Packaged the way it is, there is something for all in this film. FTR, one of the things which I particularly enjoyed was the continuality between the first Jumanji in the 90's and this one. I watched them back to back and where one film finishes another picks up, and presumably, where this finishes, a future re-has could pick up. It was almost like a ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Hammer Horror"" concept in that the entity of Jumanji becomes timeless character in itself.I couldn't say that this was better or worse than the original, it's on par - but it's different. This, in my mind, makes the film a success and deserved of the same rating that I gave the first film. 7 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The chemistry among the cast is great, and the Rock proves once again he is the go to guy if Hollywood wants to revitalize a franchise, though he has yet to prove he can fuel an actual franchise by himself. As for Jack Black and Kevin Hart, both provide great comedy to an already comical The Rock. However, Kevin Hart's character is more interesting than Black's and therefore wins the crown for best comical character in the movie. Karen Gillan is stunning, and kicks ass, though she is not given much else to do. The movie has great sweeping shots, and over the top action, but all of this makes the movie plausible, given the premise that the characters are trapped in a game world.

Also with a different take on the coming-of-age story, and a good dynamic between the five main actors. Mostly great fun, with Jack Black outrageously entertaining and Dwayne Johnson who is sweetly funny as the muscular incarnation of a nerd.
Like a video game, the narrative lacks any character development, relying on chases and the fear of death. But all-in-all, the rebooted version of ""Jumanji"" remains a fun-family film to watch over the year and I think without a doubt, will bring more productions as soon as possible.

It is essentially an action heavy version of The Breakfast Club, as four high schoolers from different social groups are all in detention together and get sucked into the game. Along the way they grow and develop and move past their differences and realize they need to work together to get out of the game. The core of the movie is simple body swap comedy, which they all do well, but Jack Black excels in particular as a shallow self obsessed teenage girl trapped in Jack Black's body. The plot is essentially a video game, reminiscent of Tomb Raider or Uncharted, but used as a vehicle for humorous moments. The humor plays to all ages with jokes targeted at kids and jokes for adults. The adult jokes were mostly about flirting and social interactions with very few of them being sexual. There was only one joke that the 7 year old next to me felt the need to ask his mom about, but it was subtle enough that she could just move past it. There was also not a single fart or poop joke, which is a miracle in a modern comedy.This sequel is one of the few that actually surpasses the original, which was scarier for kids and not as funny for everyone else. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is the action comedy that leans on the comedy and is actually funny without being crude.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

""Great, another studio exploiting an irreplacable movie just for the cash."" But I was pleasantly surprised by the trailer so I was curious and honestly, after watching it, this is a pretty solid movie.The basic premise is that four kids in detention (with a bit of a Breakfast Club dynamic) find an old video game called ""Jumanji"" and are immediately sucked into the game and have to fight their way through the jungle as their characters.They could not have picked a better cast, in my opinion. Jack Black and The Rock (whom I refuse to call by his real name) especially were able to pull off characters that were outside of their usual roles. The Rock as the archetypal nerd whose avatar is a strong, muscular adventurer, and Jack Black as the popular girl who gets stuck as an older overweight cartographer guarantee laughs. But I don't want to underplay Kevin Hart and Karen Gillans performances. Kevin Hart as the jock playing as a short zoologist and Gillan as an outcast who plays as a commando and ""killer of men."" I'd imagine it's difficult for an adult to convincingly play a teenager without overdoing it but luckily, this cast has it covered. Despite being comedic characters they each have an arc that balances out the more goofy moments and add heart, which I was expecting this film would lack.This accompanied by a clever script in a very video game setting, they did well portraying live action video game play complete with cut scenes and side quests nostalgic of similar styled video games from the 90s. I was also relieved that they didn't try to oversaturate it with references to the original. There was one blink-if-you-miss-it moment that was brief but satisfying.Overall this is a fun movie that makes you laugh and gives you enough adventure action to warrant the title.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The jokes were perfect and suited the characters perfectly. No one else could have pulled this off but Jack Black, The Rock and Kevin Hart.The downfalls of the movie was that the CGI was terrible, the film dragged on a little with constant action scenes and there's absolutely no depth to the show.

Setting up the game, they each take a controller and choose a character, after which they are sucked into the world of Jumanji, where they become their avatars.Nerd Spencer (Alex Wolff) becomes musclebound adventurer Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson); meek Martha (Morgan Turner) becomes kick-ass babe Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan); shallow beauty Bethany (Madison Iseman) becomes middle-aged, overweight cartographer Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black); and jock Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) becomes short zoologist Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart). To escape the game, the players must work their way through the various levels and return a jewel, the Jaguar's Eye, to its rightful place in a huge statue.Aimed at the whole family, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is equal parts action and comedy, and largely succeeds in both areas, with some great gags (Jack Black, for once, manages to be funny and not throughly annoying) and several well-mounted set-pieces, the best of which involves a stampede of rhinos and a damaged helicopter. Of course, things work out exactly the way you imagine they will, but although there are few genuine surprises, the film still manages to be quite the thrill-ride.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

While i liked the idea of it being a computer game, the director did not go the whole way .. and so it wasn t more than a little side feature, easily forgotten and irrelevant.The effects were rather bad in some scenes and OKish in others.

Nothing great, but not bad either. I went into this movie with my doubts about it's quality. One, because I wasn't the biggest fan of the original, and two because I was fearful it would just be another generic action romp. I was WRONG. This is one of the best action films I've seen in some time, and there are many reasons as to why this one works so well. Reason number one: the casting. This cast is just perfectly put together. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson really was great in the lead role, one of his best performances in my opinion. Kevin Hart serves as the ever hilarious comedic relief, and he did a fabulous job of making the audience laugh their asses off. Jack Black is really great here as well, very funny, really the best middle aged man in Hollywood you could pick to play as a teenage girl stuck in another body. And lastly, Karen Gillan and Nick Jonas give fun entertaining performances. The acting is a big plus for this movie. Reason number two: the writing. The script allows for many things: comedy, action, and some serious stuff too. Funny lines for the comedic heavyweights and more touching/sweet content for when it's called for. And finally, reason number three: very exciting action and effects. The action scenes are done well and achieve the level of excitement that they are going for. And the visual effects are top of the line as well. Overall, this is just a great film overall, and it even gave a small harken back to the original 90s film. Great lovable characters, exciting action, skilled writing... just a joy overall. 9/10 for Jumanji: Welcome to the jungle.","37 out of 81 found this helpful.

Out of curiosity, the teenagers fire it up and each pick a character to play as on the game. Unbeknownst to them, once they select their characters they end up sucked into the game and become the very avatars they've chosen. The stakes are high for the teenagers when they find that they can only be freed from the game by returning a jewel back to the Jaguar to release a curse that has been put on Jumanji.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle has a very 'Breakfast Club' type opening to proceedings with the characters ending up in detention and playing similar clichéd characters to what we saw in that film over 30 years ago. However, the screenwriters have carefully crafted the characters in this manner as a mere set-up for them arriving in the game as the adult avatars that they've chosen.In effect, what this does is allows the teenagers to retain their original personalities, but in the bodies of completely different people. It perhaps doesn't sound that amusing if you look at it written down, but when you see the results on screen then you'll understand what I'm getting at. In fact, the character chemistry is really where the film is at its best; Spencer and Fridge have their roles slightly reversed in the game which sets up some fun interplay between Johnson and Hart (particularly when Fridge forgets that he is no longer bigger and tougher than Spencer). Black perhaps has the most fun camping it up as a teenage girl trapped inside a middle-aged man's body - I have to admit part of me found it a little creepy, but a lot of me found it very funny (particularly when Bethany is trying to get used to her new 'body'). Gillan doesn't quite have as much fun as the others as she is mostly forced to play it straight - although her flirting scene is good and she looks terrific in those little shorts!!!). Jonas is perhaps the slight weak link here as he never seems to quite gel with the rest of the cast. I don't rate him as much of an actor, but he was OK in this one.I've talked a lot about the characters and they are a big selling point in this film; the original film had Robin Williams and it's fair to say that he completed dominated that picture. In this film, the 4 teenagers play as computer game characters and all bring different skill-sets to the table; this automatically makes the narrative more involving as you know that each character needs the other which sets up a strong dynamic. In the original film I always felt that Williams carried the film whereas in this remake the 4 actors all bring it to life making it feel like a nice collective effort.If I was to be critical of the film then I did feel that the story was only so-so and I thought the villain was poor as were his band of goons.In summary then this was a fun adventure which mostly works due to the strong chemistry and camaraderie between the 4 leads. Having them play as computer game characters rather than just been sucked into the game as themselves adds another dimension to the film and makes them interesting. If you're in one of those 'switch off brain and enjoy moods' then just sit back and relax as there's a lot of joy to be found in this film.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I don't really remember the original Jumanji so I guess it was not a masterpiece, this sequel may not be so faithful to the plot or essence (if had any) of the original movie but if you go with no expectations you will surely enjoy it
The movie starts a little bit forced, maybe trying too hard to put things in a way to make sense (in fact couple things are totally non sense), but after a short time it flows well and do the job as comedy/action movie 
It reminded me of cheesy movies like The Mummy Returns/Brendan Fraser
There are many jokes or situations that are more for adults/teens (the movie is PG-13) so that's a low point, specially if you have younger kids wanting to watch it because they want to see DJ/The Rock, although the movie in general is quite clean and simple","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's actually pretty darling how the jock, two nerds (I call them that with love) and a conventionally attractive social media addict realise by the end they have more in common with each other than they first realised.The whole thing looks stunning and the set pieces are everything you want. They combine, spectacle, humour and great suspense.I was a little thrown by the thing of different actors playing the main characters playing the characters while they are in the game but it didn't taint the picture. Jack Black made a very convincing teenage girl though they sadly milked this gag for a lot more than it was worth, especially when she tries to teach Ruby how to flirt.I have more mixed feelings about the way the whole thing is presented exactly like a video game and takes a lot of time to mock game play mechanics. I actually like that it's a videogame now. It's pretty frightening to think the game can evolve to make sure that people won't lose interest in it. I did get the impression that no one in the game is sentient but the main characters and this was a negative but I choose to try and interpret it the other way.Ultimately a good bit of fun viewing that ticks all the boxes for its genre.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The transformation of the infamous Jumanji board game into a video game now presents its challenges to a new group of strangers as they get teleported inside the console when serving in an unsupervised detention in closed, dark room. Despite having a rather sceptical concept for film goers, the promising cast ties thrill and humour into a film which lacks a convincing villain.Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan play the avatars of high school nerds as Dr Smolder Bravestone and Ruby Roundhouse respectively. Despite Karen Gillan performing in science fiction films and series, her role of an adventurer is lovable and fun. Dwayne Johnson also features his towering powerhouse of a body and leadership personality as he plays alongside comedians Kevin Hart and Jack Black. The latter two did not disappoint in conjuring the occasional laughter when the team were in mortal peril from some villain that I forgot about. Jack Black's role as an avatar for a female cannot go without credit; as well as nailing a difficult personality, we are also presented with moments where the character's gender dilemma provided comedic value. In conclusion, with its video game element, it certainly ticks the 'well, it is different, I guess?' box on the criteria of things to look for in a film. But who cares? The sheer amusement from unique troubles encountered by the dazzling characters is suffice for anyone to feel grateful that they didn't wait for it to air on TV.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This new version boasts an all-star cast -- starring Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillian -- and tells the story of four teenagers who get trapped in the video game ""Jumanji"" and must work together in order to escape the game. Walking into this I had zero expectations whatsoever. The trailers didn't win me over at all, and the entire premise seemed pretty dumb to me. However, walking out, I was pretty satisfied with what I had just seen, even though the film is incredibly stupid and requires all suspension of disbelief. Jumanji is in no way a great movie, so let's begin with the flaws. The CGI is not the best, and there is an over reliance it. There are lots of moments and scenes where it is blatantly obvious that the actors are monologuing to a green screen, and the CG around them was pretty bad. I didn't particularly enjoy the first 20 minutes of the film, where the main characters are all teenagers in high school before they enter the video game. I found the beginning slow and pretty cringy, and the actual Jumanji setting is far better. Also the villain was extremely weak, and the plot itself was pretty predictable. Despite these flaws, I enjoyed Jumaji overall. The film knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else. By far the best thing about this movie is its fun sense of comedy and escapism. Jack Black does a phenomenal job depicting an Instagram-addicted teen, and the entire cast is very well written. They all have moments and funny dialogue, and the film kept me entertained for a solid 2 hours and laughing quite a lot. Jumanji has it's problems, but was a pretty fun experience.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It may have not smashed records like that of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) or Jurassic Park (1993), but it was also no underground film that went totally under the radar. Many fans remember it fondly for not only having likable characters and an interesting story, but also because of the lasting impression it left. While Jumanji was marketed as a family film, it definitely had some rather intense moments. When a sequel was announced to this film, somehow the reaction wasn't as largely lambasted. Probably majority of people were curious as to how such a feat could be pulled off. To everyone's surprise, things went better than expected, especially with respect to other game to movie adaptations.Directed by Jake Kasdan (Bad Teacher (2011) and Sex Tape (2014)) and writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers (The Lego Batman Movie (2017)), Scott Rosenberg (Gone in 60 Seconds (2000)) and Jeff Pinkner (The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)) all penning the script put together a sequel that remarkably matches up the original. Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany (Madison Iseman) and Martha (Morgan Turner) are all everyday high school students. Spencer's a nerd, Fridge is an athlete, Bethany is the popular girl and Martha is not. After they all receive detention for disobeying their teachers, they discover the Jumanji game in the form of a video game in the room they sit. It is there they discover there's more to the game than just something to use their time. Once inside the game, is when things get uniquely comical.Spencer becomes the macho Dr. ""Smolder"" Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Fridge turns into Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart), Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan) and Bethany, to her shock is now Professor Sheldon ""Shelly"" Oberon (Jack Black). And what makes the plot to this sequel a worthy follow-up is because of how it changes the scenario for everyone involved. Unlike the original where the game turned its surrounding environment into the jungle, here the people playing the game get transported into the game (which is a jungle). On top of that, the four main stars are also not turning in performances they usually fit the mold too. Johnson, Black, Gillan and Hart all have to play the younger actors' personalities and not their own. While some mannerisms are kept the same, seeing the veteran actors act like teenagers is very different.This leads to some very comedic scenes revolving around their situation. It's all opposites as to how they looked in real life. However aside from the physical aspect, the characters also have other moments to develop and learn to work as a team. There's also appearances from Nick Jonas and Bobby Cannavale who plays Van Pelt (the villain from the original movie). Most of the time replacing an already existing character would constitute as bad continuity, but here there's a justifiable reason as to why Van Pelt is being played by another actor, so it's okay. However one thing that does need to be addressed, is more use of the lesser known stars. Yes, having Jack Black, Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan and Kevin Hart star does help, but it would be nice to see more attention given to the younger actors. There's also the whole thing about how the story continues after this....it is rather definitive.As for visuals, the cinematography was handled by Gyula Pados. For what's shown, it looks great. The backgrounds are lush green and the inside scope of Jumanji looks vast and wide. Pados seems to know how to handle this based on the fact that he also shot for other big landscape films like Predators (2010) and Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials (2015). Lastly, the film score composed by Henry Jackman was well done too. Jackman has lent his talents to all genres like Monsters Vs. Aliens (2009), Kick-Ass (2010) and Winnie the Pooh (2011), so it shows that he can handle not only more tender moments but also lively action sequences too. While he doesn't reprise the creepy theme of James Horner's score, he does create a new one that fits the tone and it is repeated throughout.While the younger actors don't get as much time to shine, nor does this sequel really leave it open to more stories, this sequel is definitely on point with its predecessor. The action/comedy mix well, the scenario has the main leads challenge their performance skills, the cinematography is lit fantastically and the music is a welcome addition to franchise.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's good. I had no idea what to expect in all honest. I am not huge fans of other movies by these actors, but this really worked. You could see the great chemistry between them all and it paid off.What I liked: I enjoyed how it didn't dither about at the beginning and got right into the action. Jack Black especially was brilliant and hilarious! All the actors/actresses were great but Jack Black stood out. Good mix of action and comedy throughout. I was on the edge of my seat (metaphorically) wanting them to escape the game.Negatives: not many to be honest, couple of scenes were slightly cringe, but not off putting. Same logic goes for a couple of scenes which felt dragged out.I think people need to forget about this being a remake of a classic film and treat it as a separate movie altogether. If you start comparing the 2 that's when it goes wrong.Worth watching and will be going cinema for 2nd instalment.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It still held up when I rewatched it earlier this month. The effects aren't the greatest but the film was fun and had a lot of heart. I was not one of those annoying people who had pitchforks out when they heard about Jumanji being rebooted or getting a sequel. Always give a film a chance, that's what I do. After seeing promo pics and trailers I was hyped. I like The Rock and Kevin Hart working together, and also love Karen Gillan. The film looked like a fresh spin on the original and even looked like an effort that wanted to stand on its own. It does exactly that. Say what you want, this is a very fun film.Four different teenagers are given detention and once there they discover an old video game named Jumanji. They plug the game system in and are sucked into the world of Jumanji, primarily in a jungle where they must return a jewel into an enormous Jaguar statue. Sounds easy, but the jungle is filled with tricks and traps and wild animals. Oh yeah, the four characters become the characters in the game physically. This makes for a very entertaining time with almost non stop humor on top of its adventure.The actors do very well in this. Jack Black and Kevin Hart bring the comedy. Jack Black's character is actually the embodiment of a self absorbed teenage girl, and he plays that remarkably well. I dig Kevin Hart with his loud commentary. I also love that he's always getting knocked over thrown around, in the way of danger, or in this films case- explodes. All the humor in this film comes at you tenfold and it all works. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat and, while somewhat predictable its never boring. The action scenes are gripping and grand scale. I loved the world of the film and the connection between the characters.The film has a few nods to the original but the film is still quite independent from the original which is nice. Really its in name alone; the connection to the first. Overall, its a blast at the end of the year. Its a re-watchable and exciting comedy/adventure. Take off your critical lenses and actually sit and enjoy this. The negative things I'm reading about this are analyzing it on such a deep level. Dude, relax and enjoy.8/10","38 out of 88 found this helpful.

Not only is this movie good but it has me hyped for the sequel (or trilogy if you consider this a sequel for the first movie).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I mean, these days sequels to a 20 years old movies or reboots aren't that great, and I'm not that stingy with reboots, because I just want to watch a movie and not compare to the original one, I like watching it as a standalone. But with these one, I was so worried, but oh man, I love to be wrong in these situations.
It was brilliant, I was not feeling the modern version of Jumanji, but that was cleared in the beginning and it didn't bothered me that much, actually. The characters were amazing to watch, mostly because I easily related to them if I was in that situation with my friends. 
The plot was good enough, nothing new and unique, but it was well planned and cohesive, and that's one of the most important aspects of a plot. 
The game theme was so well written in this movie, and once again super cohesive and it follows it's rules, which demonstrates excellent writing and not just ""for a moment in particular alteration"". The cast was phenomenal, even though I liked The Roch way more before, it was still pleasant to watch him in a different role, actually more funny and interesting than I want to admit, and the rest of the cast I was already in love, specially Jack Black, who killed this performance alongside Kevin Hart and Karen Gillian (who I never watch before, but I'm already in love).
This is a perfect family adventurous movie, you don't have to watch the first one, but there are easter eggs in this sequel that are so special to those who enjoyed the first one, like me.
Give it a go, I can't promise you'll love it, but to me it's good entertainment","19 out of 40 found this helpful.

It was a cute Robin Williams film aimed at the youth, and I think it delivered just that. However I had a fun 2 hours watching the new Jumanji, and I think it's a well produced and highly entertaining piece even despite it's weaknesses.Let's start with the script: it's very well put together - the idea of reproducing Jumanji for a 2017 set doesn't sounds easy at all, but the writer's didn't take much risk and chose to turn the board game into a video game. That eliminated the chance of mediocre teen acting and too much ""teenager"" elements, because for some reason teens nowadays don't like movies with teens. They like Dwayne Johnson action scenes, and they got just that.As for Mr. Johnson - I think despite all his bad movies, he is a very talented and skilled actor, he won't let down people in Jumanji either. Kevin Hart's OK as well. But when it comes to other members of the cast I think it was just too difficult for some roles to be reproduced authentically. I'm not saying overacting shouldn't be a part of a movie like that - you can tell that Jack Black totally tried to do what s(he) was supposed to do, but the difference between a genius and dumb character is very narrow here, it's hard to tell if he did good or not. But the point of Jumanji is not collecting Oscar awards, so that won't ruin anyone's career, none had to prove how fantastic actors they are, the goal was to provide entertainment to the viewers, which they succeeded in.Also, there are some funny pop-cultural references in the movie, which might be good jokes even for adults, but to be honest, there are so many aspects in which it delivers only ""mediocre"", that the 2017 Jumanji surely won't be as memorable as the original one. The base concept wasn't something new, it's classic Hollywood content recycling, even if it's done right.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Different than the 1996 film, this adaption makes the game of Jumanji relevant to this time by transforming itself into a video game (although I would argue board games are making a come back). For those with positive memories of the 1996 film with Robin Williams, one could be nervous that director Jake Kasdan would ruin that feel-good fighting spirit they found in the original. For that nostalgic among us, the film provides a few subtle ""shout-outs"" to the original film that will happily send you down memory lane. For example, this film begins almost identical to the 1996 version. A boy, Alex (Mason Guccione and Nick Jonas) finds the Jumanji board game while running by the water. When Alex is more interested in his video games, the board game transforms itself into a video game version of itself. While unbelievable that a board game would have that much power, it is not a far stretch of the imagination when you then realize that this game has now sucked multiple people into it...literally. The evil hunter Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) is also reintroduced, though he leaves his normal jungle hunting garb back in the 90s. Additionally, and probably the best throw-back Kasdan included is the reference directly back to William's character, Alan Parrish while we see the new characters in a tree house that Parrish build during his 26 year stay in Jumanji. Kasdan assembled a great cast including Dwayne Johnson (Spencer), Kevin Hart (Fridge), Jack Black (Bethany), Karen Gillan (Martha), and Jonas. Like his previous movies, Kasdan added a lot of humor into this film, which had me and the audience audibly laughing at times. I am beginning to really enjoy the comedic duo that is Hart and Johnson as they complement each other well. The acting was well done across the board and one could tell the actors had a good time making this film. Black's performance must be complimented as it is no small feat to play a cell phone obsessed teenage woman stuck in a body of a middle-aged man. Overall, Jumanji is a new part of the adventure that introduces the story to a new generation and makes it relevant to new viewers. If you go in thinking it is a continuation of the original 1996 film you will be disappointed, however, with fresh eyes one can enjoy the newness of this film and the humor it brings to the Jumanji storyline. Recommendation: Worth the laughs","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A ductile Sunday follow-up that shatters the pledges raised from its wheedling envelope","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4018297/?ref_=tt_urv","FelipeCarrillo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61617922/?ref_=tt_urv","30 December 2017","Art is the quality, activity or product executed from the fruit of skills, keeping a core artistic and communicative purpose, an own idea that is materialized through different resources predisposed by humans that ends up influencing what people think and feel, a way of expressing, a way of manifesting. Over the years, the evolution of man has stirred up the emersion of disparate disciplines, always focused on the aesthetic conception overlaid by the time, which were established as Arts, they were officially enumerated by Ricciotto Cuckold in 1911; dance, music and poetry form a reserved list of expressions whose basis is the exhibition of personal thought in response to the events of the world, each of these intervened, of course, by the perceptions and styles of the artist, thus placing originality, imagination and creativity as cardinal tools. Within this prodigious series of acts is the one which, personally, I consider the mother of all arts: cinema, clearly. The Seventh Art, as many call it, is capable of encompassing any of the traditional arts disseminated by human senses, it manages to join movements, narrations, colors and melodies by means of picture and sound. Precisely, an audio-(sound, hearing) visual (vision) experience represents the perfect mold, one in which each individual takes the role of emitter and receiver. From its birth on 28 December 1895 from the hand of the Lumière brothers to my latest showing on 28 December 2018 have passed 123 years of stories, biographies, tales, loves and disappointments, betrayals and loyalties, surprises and speeches; cinematic annals raised by masterpieces, debuts, sequels, trilogies or octologies from different men and women who show intimate insights on millions of screens around the world weekly, creating a range of universes that have written, officially, the highly controversial History of Film. At this point, today, it's revealed the difficulty of each release hitting cinemas to add something fruitfully n brand-new to the Book of Celluloid. More than half of them culminate in either average or deeply deceptive flicks, being only a small minority which gets to take a place, at least, in golden headlines from the best of the year, here, the actor germ: the lack of originality. This problem, sharply commented by this reviewer, affected and continues to affect the creative minds of Hollywood, the cinematic power that being on the brink of the abyss, opts to reuse, literally, proposals from the past, using new faces to get a new audience who shows interest in seeing more of the same, then, Will we get to the point where cinema establishes a unique series of stories on which the thousands of filmmakers work? We pray for no more recycling of ideas.Within the culture broth that has become American cinema, lies adaptation, remake, reboot and continuation; ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" drinks from these four disadvantaged categories. A hybrid that becomes an adaptation of the mythical reference book, a remake of the legacy and mythology of 90's story, a reboot of the time and customs in which the tale develops, a sequel when posing a contemporary plot with a fascinating twist, and even reaches to play with homage in certain fragments that venerate the motion picture from twenty-two years ago. With sufficient controversy and critic, more non-exemplary ideas are cooking up, desperately, with major studios as sponsors, while, quietly and gradually, small indie productions are dedicated to being such small minority.Jake Kasdan directs the flick that means the kick off for a possible needless saga of stories that, according to the grossing at the box office - which are predicted favorable -, will have the chance of arriving in the years to come. Basically, the mythology is preserved, a mythical board game in which every roll of the dice means a drastic change in the real world of the players, however, the variable in the declared sequel reverses the rules, it's founded on the transporting of the players inside the game - now video game cassettes - personified by the sexiest, most hilarious and requested movie stars of today. So far, everything looks interesting and potentially functional, however, this game is missing pieces. The script starts to waver hardly in the introduction of the new batch of actors, some high school boys who fit perfectly in the stereotyped juvenile roles, only, to pour them in the cloned characters of modern cinema. Although the film takes its time presenting the four young protagonists, the spectator never gets good vibes with any of them due to a lousy and clichéd sketch of characters, their attitudes fall into the abhorrent common places and end up in those same places. It's worth highlighting the high level of predictability that the script shows, it's possible to anticipate each move that story is going to execute, besides, adding a poor chemistry and charm between the quartet of the young characters. In the first act, there is a framing in which the four are seated side by side awaiting their punishment, however, there is an empty chair, opening the opportunity to foreshadow the sudden appearance of the character that would become the comic relief, but not, It's just an empty chair until the half the footage, at least, a pinch of subversion. Likewise, we shouldn't expect any kind of identification with the plastic avatars in the jungle-themed game, equally pigeonholed in the roles of strength, intelligence, beauty and stupidity; nor with an antagonist who allows different disgusting insects come out from inside his ears or mouth. Yeah man, the film knows how to build up ephemeral situations in which the vis comica of each one of them pops up, nevertheless, it never touches the same emotional, comical and even sinister dimensions of the feature film directed by Joe Johnston, where we watched a newcomer Kirsten Dunst along with the acting master Robin Williams. It's indisputable that thanks to the busiest and most popular cast, led by the always hilarious Jack Black, the story remains standing and manages to stretch a dynamic and kinetic pace as much as possible, however, it does by an odious predictability and some visual landscapes that don't exploit the huge possibilities that they held in their hands, even though most of the locations are real places (Hawaii) and its special medium-level digital effects. As is customary in these types of proposals, the film is as chaotic as the situations it exhibits due to traditional symptoms, that are hidden behind all the creative process. The first and main trigger is the number of screenwriters, four writers proposing and laughing at an executive table while they prepare a cocktail of dramatic and sidesplitting moments as unequally functional as necessarily witty. Chris McKenna, the man behind ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" and ""The LEGO Batman Movie"" - two of the superhero jewels of the year - was responsible for writing the global story, but apparently, it seems to have left all his powerful ideas in his previous works. Leaning ingeniously and respectfully on the world of video games, the central plot follows a traditional structure and doesn't provide eminent strangeness that should be the salvation key for this kind of movies, those that set up its stories more in the humor of the situations than in the humor of tale as such. As a strong point, a cunning, subtle play around the video-game-themed background, the screenwriters gave with an ingenious magical formula to overturn the storylines or the different settings of newfangled video game consoles with, of course, a narrative and parody purpose, however, many of these situations work well, even though the film is riddled with them.Jake Kasdan's ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" brings together three of the funniest movie stars of the moment, one ""Doctor Who"" Scottish actress and one former member of the American pop-rock band Jonas Brothers to deliver a free-entertainment film with the exact doses of nostalgia and new content, devoid of any drop of true originality, but brimming with one-liners and comical moments that follows the proper procedures of the typical mega-studio productions in the genre. A funny follow-up to close a year of surprising cinema of just quality, therefore, simply stays in that way, in a correct and admissible time killer, not something really substantial. One more play in the lucrative game called Hollywood. A game, just that.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Everyone who follows movies even remotely knows that's not a hard task to complete, but Jumanji earnestly gets that title from me by being self-aware, armed with charismatic performances, and an undeniably fun and energetic tone from beginning to end.The second pairing from Kevin hart and Dwayne Johnson comes as way of a sequel to the classic 1995 film, Jumani. Instead of just rebooting a beloved film 20 years later, this installment does feel like a standalone film, but in more than one way, it honors the legacy that began with the Robin Williams led film in the 90's. What better way to do that than get The Rock and Hart to team-up again for an adventurous action-comedy. Their chemistry, along with Karen Gillan and Jack Black are quite the team. Luckily, the film doesn't rely too heavily on Hart and Johnson's funny banter from Central Intelligence last year. Each character had their own arc and I didn't feel as though any one particular character was put in the background.Did I approve of all the character choices and humor? Certainly not. Jack Black is a naturally funny guy, but I wasn't too fond of his portrayal of a popular teenage girl. All of the characters are stereotypes obviously, but for some reason that character rubbed me the wrong way. Gillan on the other-hand, was much more in her comfort zone than it seemed like she was in the Guardians films. Her range of playing a scared and vulnerable young woman to be a ""dance fighting"" bada** was a joy to watch, and playing off of Johnson may have even superseded Johnson and Hart for me.Like everyone else, I was very skeptical of this film for the last few years. What was the need to go back and try to recapture the spirit of the first film? Well, they reinvented the wheel without replacing the entire car. Using video games instead of a board game seemed like a cheap trick, but it ended up being the best decision the franchise could have made. Where do you go from here? Well, it now seems the possibilities are endless. In all, a well-rounded cast, endless energy, and a little heart go a long way with this one.8.6/10","35 out of 83 found this helpful.

Kevin Hart was absolutely in his best self in this movie. The superb cast of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart coupled with Karen Gillan's beauty makes this movie most interesting. Once you are into it, you can't help but notice the stunning visuals; thanks to the Kualoa Ranch private nature reserve, where the movie was filmed. The storyline is excellent, with every detail taken care of - right from how swash plates of a helicopter blade control the pitch of the blades, creating thrust, to how game environments often defy real world physics. The slapstick humour adds to the comical charm of this wonderful movie - a mind freshener for the whole family.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

Board games are out and video games are in. It won't win any awards for screenwriting with it's predictable and plodding plot-high school stereotypes must save the titular game-world by returning a stolen jewel-however the team of scribes get one big tick; the introduction of a body swap conceit generates consistent laughs. In fact, the broad comedy is consistently (and surprisingly) excellent. There's a lot of low-hanging fruit, sure, but the combination of the cast's comedic timing and their willingness to poke fun at themselves is a winning formula that absolutely shines through. Dwayne Johnson is his usual likable self as jungle explorer Dr Smolder Bravestone, Karen Gillan is a crack-up as the awkward bad-ass Ruby Roundhouse, Kevin Hart gives good Kevin Hart as sidekick Mouse Finbar, and Jack Black unequivocally steals the show as an egotistical ""hot-girl"" stuck in the body of overweight, middle-aged man Professor Shelly Oberon. The set pieces are decent without ever really impressing, the raft of winks and nods to the 1995 version earning enough goodwill to let the lack of originality slide for two-thirds of the movie. The final act, however, becomes quite the slog to get through as the comedy is swept aside in favour of an action finale full of poor CGI, unmemorable sequences and an overacting Bobby Canavale as the sneering villain. A flawed action movie, but a good-quality laugh-at-loud comedy, Jumanji is the epitome of Boxing Day family flick: dumb but hilarious, messy but entertaining.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm in complete agreement with this person. I also believe these movie critics are a cancer to all artists. And they're a cancer to the film industry.TRUTH: Critics kill any joy of those who actually do something. Phil Collins said he was glad to retire because of the music critics. Kevin Durant said sports critics are killing the game. And James Cameron didn't direct for 10 years after Titanic because he was sick of movie critics bashing him.Everyone knows the story of Herman Melville who died a broken man because the critics savaged his book, ""Moby Dick"". The book didn't sell well and Melville went bankrupt and spent his last years in a grocery store. True story.Movie critics are not just a poison, they're very dangerous. I didn't watch Kevin Costner's 'The Postman' for YEARS because the movie critics said it was utterly horrible. However, after watching the film, I was shocked at how good the film was. I almost missed out on watching a great film because again I listened to these loser critics. I almost didn't watch 'Hidden Figures' because another critic savaged the movie as 'unwatchable'. What is going on? Like the previous poster said, ""Movie critics have never written, directed, acted, or produced a film in their entire lives. They're just losers who wish they could be filmmakers.""So this is the essence then of today's movie criticism. It's useless. Pointless. Fake News. One critic admitted he would never give Paramount good reviews because Paramount wouldn't read his script.So what can we do about this? What can movie fans and those artists (and crew members) in the film industry do? FIGHT BACK. Let's 'out' these critics by name in public forums like 'Topix.com'; 'Ripoff.com' 'ComplaintsBoard.com' - the critics will see their name smeared on Page 1 of Google the same way they smear filmmakers. Give them a taste of their own medicine.FIGHT BACK.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

In fact what my wife and I noticed was the movie was a lot more comedic than adventurous. This was a bit different from the movie's predecessor, the 1995 version of Jumanji which felt having more adventure. Apart from being a sequel to that movie, this one also served as a tribute to Robin Williams who played the lead character of Alan Parrish. From my personal view, the original movie was something that truly blow my mind with the obviously awesome special effect at that time and also a wonderful experience seeing so many animals came and wreak havoc in the city. While in this movie, the characters were the ones who went inside the game and the animals scenes were not that frequent.The movie seemed to focus on the characters development and chemistry which were fun to see. I actually loved Jack Black's character whom I think was totally spot on. Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson seemed to hit it off very easily, most likely because they had played in an action comedy movie earlier Central Intelligence. Meanwhile Karen Gillan was totally different from the other roles that I had seen earlier as she provided few funny moments, with the funniest one relating to 2 bad guards. What I loved the most was the high school students were transformed into totally different adult persons and had to adjust themselves with their transformation. Though this also provided some rather crude jokes which probably not understood by young children. The special effects were definitely a lot better than the 1995 version (especially if you see the old one now). During the almost 2 hours duration of the movie, my wife and I had plenty of laughs and for me personally, I was happy and satisfied watching this one as it provided me with the light pop corn movie where I do not have to overthink and just enjoy it. Btw, there was no end credit scene in the movie which was rather surprising as I thought (and hoped) there would be one.Anyway, if you are looking for a fun, light, comedy adventure movie, then you definitely should see this one. If you have seen the original movie, you might also enjoy this as it had the aura and some scenes that would remind you with that one. It would be best if you have seen the original movie first before seeing this one to really appreciate and understand it better. And please do not expect a heavy logical movie where you need to over analyze it. Just go to the cinema and experience the fun.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id","19 out of 42 found this helpful.

It is sad to see none of the original actors or characters from the film but then again, that was over 20 years ago, so we can't really blame them. I still miss Robin Williams. I like the idea of updating the story into a video game and there are tons of amusing moments in this movie. The characters are really quite likeable especially Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black. The special effects could probably be better, but they're still nice.This movie really does have a lot of heart to it and I found myself rooting for the characters at the end. The ending is quite heartwarming and it feels well deserved for everybody. I admit I don't like the idea of all the creatures being inside the game and not coming out. We still get a lot of great jokes and playful jabs at video games in general. I was annoyed at how none of the creatures from the original film appeared in this.

Video game movies are hit and miss at best and maybe this was a new way to help that along. They took an existing property and made it a video game movie. There were cool instances where they brought in aspects of video games that genuinely worked (I liked the non-playable character gag where they can only have a few responses) and then there were other times where it was a little awkward and didn't translate effectively (the concept of the lives was a little clunky, they lost lives falling from some heights and not others and then using CPR to transfer one?). I have to admire their ambition but only partial points for execution.This is an action/comedy geared more towards families than adult audiences. Does it work on that level? I would say yes. The movie isn't hilarious but there were plenty of times where I was chuckling, and it also had some decent action in it. I don't think the movie was exceptional in either area, but it did its job. I did like how they brought in some Indiana Jones style elements too. Using specific traps and the returning the treasure to its rightful place were nice additions and made it feel like it was playing towards an old school adventure movie.I did have a couple of big problems with this movie. I felt like the characters of the kids were way too stereotypical (the awkward nerd, the self-involved pretty girl, the dumb jock etc.). I know that they can't be all completely fresh characters, but they still could have added a little more dimension by going in a different direction. The other is that the movie has some dialogue so bad that it will make you roll your eyes and snicker. I couldn't help but giggle at it (in an unintentionally funny way) and I know the movie is directed at kids but again I think they could have put a little more effort in. Other than playing with this cool idea, I thought the script for this was pretty mediocre. I also had a personal nitpick about more contemporary gaming being not referenced at all but that's admittedly due to the fact I wasn't involved in that era of gaming and I don't have a detailed memory of those type of games.As much as I had a couple of problems with the material, I wouldn't blame any of the main cast for it. Alex Wolff, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman and Morgan Turner as Spencer, Fridge, Bethany and Martha were all okay. They didn't really impress me, but I think that was more the material than anything. The adult actors all really sold out. Dwayne Johnson is his usual charming self, Kevin Hart is funny in spurts, Karen Gillan was great in her role and the meta jokes about her character were pretty funny. Jack Black was just short of mugging the entire movie but he was one of the few actors who could have made his part work. The biggest surprise was that I didn't mind Nick Jonas all that much. Bobby Cannavale is a good actor but his villain was so forgettable that it wasn't worth an actor of his calibre.I was psyched going into this movie, the scores across the board were better than expected and I thought the marketing for it was pretty good. I walked out having enjoyed Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle but I did feel like it had the potential to be even better. Its doing well at the box office so maybe I'll like the sequel (if there is one) that much more. I would definitely like to see this cast again with the strong chemistry they had. I'd give it a 7/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It does not fit in with the original at all, and does not continue the story.I was very young when I first saw the original Jumanji (with Robin Williams) which I honestly felt was quite terrifying (in a good way). So, to make this comparison fair, I decided to watch both movies back to back.I can honestly say that the original grips me into the film more. HOWEVER, both Kevin Hart and Jack Black are absolutely incredible in this new film. I actually laughed out loud (too informal to say lol) at some of the jokes. I would however say that the only reason that this was called ""Jumanji"" was to increase profits by producing an all awaited for 'sequel'.I would highly recommend watching this film with the family, but do not expect anything linking back to the original.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Normally, I'm so apprehensive about remakes and sequels because they're simply never as good as the original. But this time I was extremely hopeful because the trailers were so good. In fact, the trailers were too good. The various trailers gave away the first quarter of the movie. There wasn't a punchline in the first 20 or so minutes of the movie except that I'd already seen it. That still left 75% or more of the movie to be viewed untainted but it did suck to be watching reruns at the start. I guess that's the catch 22. Because the trailers were so good I committed to watch it, yet those same trailers stole some of my enjoyment.Still, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was a clever remake. Instead of a board game it's now a video game and instead of all of the events occurring within your surroundings the player is drawn into the game. The movie provided plenty of laughs courtesy of Kevin Hart followed by Jack Black. As a story it made sense and flowed well. I still think the original is better but this was a good tribute.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Jumanji uses several on the nose stereotyping as it focuses on the four main leads, teenagers stuck inside of the video game: Jumanji.If there is one thing that Jumanji deserves to be praised for it is the acting, especially Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black, who perfectly depict this alter ego embodying their physical appearances. It is fascinating and wonderfully fun to see these two act as the two teenage characters that they are 'portraying'. Not to dismiss the fact that the whole cast was wonderful and perfect for the roles that they were in.However at the end of the day, Jumanji was fun, exciting and definitely worthwhile but was extremely predictable and follows many action-comedy beats with its only real innovation being this whole body switching idea that does play into some good laughs. It wasn't disappointing but it didn't defy expectations either, it simply is well executed and a good laugh.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Jack Black is the true gem of this film, winning me over more and more as the film went on. Not much of a plot, hardly clever, but did lead to some moments that made me chuckle. I had to move to a different seat twice throughout the film as the viewers sitting next to me couldn't manage to listen to the film, instead repeating line after line of cheap dialogue. This tells me that even though it's not a great film, people seem to love it.REVIEWI don't know whether you'd call it a sequel or a remake, but either way ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" occupies a similar universe as the Robin Williams film I remember from my childhood. It begins with the Jumanji board game being found on a beach under some sand. Once the discoverer takes it home and realizes it's a board game instead of a video game he shelves it. The game magically morphs into a video game, calls to him, he plugs it in, and he is sucked into the game. Years later that same video game console is found by four mismatched teenagers while serving time in detention. Hmmm, Breakfast Club anyone? One teen is a self-absorbed, cell phone-addicted ""hot girl"" named Bethany, another is the intelligent Martha who is struggling with her self esteem. Spencer is the self-proclaimed nerd, and Fridge is the tall, athletic football player. After they get sucked into the game they discover that their bodies have become the pre-set avatars from the game itself. Spencer becomes the goliath Dwayne Johnson while Fridge ironically becomes Kevin Hart. Martha becomes the scantily-clad Karen Gillan, and Bethany hilariously becomes Jack Black. They are charged with saving the jungle of Jumanji by returning the stone to the eye of the jaguar and saying the game's name. After they complete this mission they are then free to leave the game. The unlikely heroes set out to try and return home, but are met with all the twists and turns of a typical RPG video game.There isn't much to be said about the plot of the film - the game comes to life - it's a clever idea we've seen before in the original ""Jumanji."" The added comic twist of the characters occupying their avatars' bodies is the fresh aspect. Dwayne Johnson, who often impresses me, gave a solid performance as the cowardly nerd occupying a hulk of a body. Karen Gillan, whom I've never seen before, gave a fittingly awkward performance as the insecure Martha. Kevin Hart played, well, Kevin Hart, disappointingly. According to the blueprints of the film and all the other performances, he was supposed to play Fridge, the big athletic football player, but instead he's just Kevin Hart making wild comments about how tall he's really supposed to be. Jack Black takes the cake here depicting the self-absorbed Bethany who is surprised to be a fat, middle-aged man with a penis.Generally, the humor is not particularly clever and doesn't contain much substance, but there are some heart-warming scenes throughout. Jack Black's character experiences the most character development and has the most interesting character arc, even though the film made it seem like Johnson's character was supposed to. The body humor does hint at (without ever seriously going there) the idea of being trapped in a body you don't want, and in a few instances makes it rather fun and comical (imagine going to the bathroom). Other than that no real issues are brought up or discussed despite providing the perfect vehicle for such commentary (a lost opportunity to be sure). The universal theme mainly concerns bravery and believing in yourself, and I will give the film credit for a well-deserved sentimental ending.I was disappointed in Kevin Hart's performance, or rather the way his role was constructed. He really took me out of the film. If they'd written or directed Fridge to deliver his lines in the flamboyant way Kevin Hart delivers his the continuity of the film would have been much better. The only reason I gave the film an above average score was due to Jack Black's convincing performance of a girl who is more concerned about finding her cell phone than the fact that she is now in a different body. The movie was nearly sold out on a Monday night a week after opening weekend, so it's obviously doing well enough with audiences, but these are not the audiences you'd expect to see in a slow-burning, dialogue-heavy, contemplative film. That said, I did enjoy the film, and I don't regret watching it, but I kind of wish I'd waited to see this one on a streaming service at home.See hutchnotes.com for more reviews.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I don't remember being a huge fan of the first film, was never enamored with Robin Williams' manic excesses.
The second time around seems a bit more laid back powered by an enjoyable cast led by The Rock who truly deserves that moniker. His whole body is something to behold, serious granite going on there.
The young kids playing the real life versions of their more famous counterparts do a credible job as well with the obvious obligatory contemporary updates like cellphones and selfies.
The biggest laughs are generated by Kevin Hart as a reduced in size football star, a wimp now reincarnated as a kickass Dwayne Johnson (what a dream!) and a petulant self obsessed, prettily vacuous cheerleader as a rotund, spectacled middle age dweeb played by Jack Black. Didn't know the actress Karen Gillan but she more than holds her own as the wannabe vamp of the bunch with killer kung fu and dance moves.
There are a few modest laughs to be had here, nothing like belly laughs but some chuckle worth inducing moments.
I didn't expect too much so I wasn't disappointed. The dialogue was trite with the clicheed homilies of live your life to the fullest, you only have one life, let's go team, we can do this together, ect.... more than serviceable with nothing too deep. This is not a movie meant to educate or inspire, we're strictly along for the ride and the potentially entertainment value.
Did find the CG effects pretty shabby overall. The jungle never felt like the jungle, ditto for the animals, could smell a green background. Maybe I'm just getting used to the way CG effects look on the screen, these did not impress.

The fantastic, against-type acting really is great fun. The four major stars easily pass as simple avatars for the 'real', more-or-less teenage cast who actually get sucked into the titular game. You actually forget that you're watching Dwayne Johnson instead of Alex Wolff. The film isn't hilarious but it's funny enough, humorously milking its video-game setting and unexpected characters for all they're worth. When it gets going, it's very enjoyable. It isn't exactly deep, but - if you're willing to go with it - it's entertaining, crowd-pleasing fluff. Plus, it actually does a decent job with character development.

I think that Dwayne Johnson (Spencer), Kevin Hart (Fridge), Jack Black (Bethany), Karen Gillan (Martha) and Nick Jonas (Alex) are so fantastic in their characters. This movie is the most mysterious, the most humorous, the most original because is a good cover and the funniest movie. And it is really little scary. Jake Kasdan was the best director for this movie. The special effects ars just really splendid and I liked are. It's the best movie I've ever seen.

Four high school students are in after-school detention, for four unrelated reasons. One of them finds an old electronic game box, they manage to hook it up to an old TV, then proceed to each select a Jumanji game character. Upon completion each is sucked into the fictional reality of the Jumanji world where they have to elude beasts and other dangers, and find a way to correct a wrongdoing to save Jumanji.Just fun entertainment, the most enjoyment is from each character. For example a meek geek boy becomes a muscular fighter (The Rock) while a large football player called The Fridge becomes a short weekling (Kevin Hart). One of the girls becomes a man (Jack Black) and marvels at the extra body part she now has.Well made and fun entertainment.

"7","/10","surprisingly entertaining thanks to a director who cares and cast ready to work","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4011080/?ref_=tt_urv","Quinoa1984","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0453068/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2017","Heres one you can chalk up to low expectations, but a movie with the unfortunate title of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (and look I get it, people still remember the song and it plays with a trailer, but it doesn't play as far as anything remotely clever) is an enjoyable experience. This all comes down to who is involved and, for the most part, how the director uses his cast and resources.Jake Kasdan is not especially known for big Hollywood spectacle on a 100 mil budget (whatever it is if it has Dwayne Johnson and it's *under* 100 mil that's an achievement), but he is known for, to varying degrees of success, his work in comedies like Orange County and the underrated Walk Hard. Kasdan isnt a Joe Johnston, who directed the first moderately successful/hey-its-not-some-nostalgic-classic-its-alright original, so he only has a competent sense of action and effects (theyre not *bad* theyre just competent and adequate and thats fine). What he does have in spades is the ability to get good work out of actors ready to stretch themselves just a little, and thats what you get here with an additional treat: video game meta(ish)ness.In other words, if you pay attention to movies currently and have seen what The Rock and Kevin Hart and (to a smaller extent) Jack Black have done in movies, this subverts that since the concept opens it up; the pitch is almost like, I dunno, Breakfast Club meets Tron but, of course, in a jungle, as four teens (dorks, jock, popular girl, et al) get stuck in a video game during detention and take on avatars of Johnson, Hart, the lovely Karen Gillan and Black and have to take on a mission all aren't quite ready for. Though this does leave us with seeing arcs play out with the original teen actors bookending the movie, they're solid arcs for what is at heart a kids comedy, and it's a comedy that banks on us knowing at least some (if not a lot more) of how we see these actors, for the most part, and what happens when Johnson has to play afraid of everything and Hart is a football star who has his stated video game character ""weakness"" as ""Speed"". Woops.Thats the other thing, on the whole, this movie understands video games likely more than 99% of other video game movies (if one wants to count Scott Pilgrim vs the World as one, and I would up to a point, thats the only one that really digs deep into understanding and satitirizing video games, at least until Ready Player One comes out, that I can think of). When we get a flashback, for example, of Bobby Cannavale's sneering weird-iris-eyed villain's origin a character explains to another that this is what's called a ""cut scene."" There are also life bars on the characters' arms and the uncertainty about what will happen if all the bars are gone and if that means actual death, not just dead-and-come-back, is not a plot hole so much as it works as genuine ambiguity for what these people are in to and for us. And, again, every major actor here is up to so the double work of playing these teen types and what their video game avatars are supposed to do (ie Black's Bethany is a cartographer, to which she states at one point shes a map ""doctor"", so to speak I guess).This is a genuinely clever, funny script that shows Kasdan's skill at mining for comedy based on everything the premise can give him. And it provides a lot for everyone in the cast (save maybe Cannave, who is better than this but whatever he's screen presency) to dig in to, and the arcs for them while a bit obvious are worthwhile and the message of looking past the types into what makes you stronger or more confident or just not, well, a dick to people or others (ie Bethanys self-centeredness or Fridge's stand-offish 'i dont need to study' aspect), works. This doesnt mean everything is as funny as it should be, which is why I said ""for the most part"" before; Jack Black is given one note to play as ""ugh""-y teen narcissist and it gets a bit tiring when there isn't something completely genius for him to say (which is often). It's to the point where, and I never thought I'd say this, Hart gets more or just stronger comedic material than Black does, or knows how to use how we see him to an advantage or whathaveyou. There's also a fifth character midway through that provides some story intrigue and more stakes (it also is a good move via set up and pay off from the opening of the film which may/may not be following up off the original, dont know doesnt matter) and he is serviceable as an actor but doesn't stand out like everyone elae does.This might just be grading on a curve since its far from anything great and isn't without some logical jumps to make - yes, I say this, for a Jumanj maybe standalone rebooquel - such as a thing that happens with a life exchange that just happens and is never properly explained (I'm not sure without spoiling it I can recall seeing a multi-player game where that was a thing, though I must admit I haven't been avid as a gamer in a while), and again the action and actual spectacle is only impressive inasmuch as what's there as Kasdan as competence but not an original or striking vision (perhaps the one perk to Johnston over the next gen director, albeit time and money have changed the quality of effects). But if you are curious in the slightest and the trailer didn't turn you off and like Johnson and Gillan and most of the folks involved in making this, you may be surprised to see people who give a damn about what they're doing and the lines they say and how their characters develop within the limitations of a children's fantasy adventure. It's the B side once you're done this season with Star Wars's A-side record.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Jumanji: Welcome to the Review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4106676/?ref_=tt_urv","bobandlulureview","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur86821570/?ref_=tt_urv","27 March 2018","Just as much as I love reading books, I enjoy watching movies too. It's a gene inherited from my parents. 
Now, besides watching movies in the theatres, I record movies on my set-top box and watch it at night, within the comfortable confines of our living room. 
I have new found company for animated films in my five year old. (Though, I really think he comes just for the popcorn). I record movies for Arjun as well and he has now slowly graduated to watching non-animated children's films like Home Alone, Baby's Day Out, Dunston Checks In, Zathura etc. I recently made him watch Jumanji (Part 1) on TV and he seemed to like it. 
And what do you know! Part 2 had hit the theatres. I wasn't even aware of a sequel until I heard it on the radio. I screeched in delight and looked around in the car at the other passengers. My parents had suddenly something very important to discuss and my husband began avoiding eye contact. Arjun looked at me and said ""we'll go driving"". Please note that I have recently started driving and shall do another post reviewing the Alto K10 automatic car. 
I LOVED (still do) Jumanji. I couldn't wait to watch the sequel and dish it. Sequels rarely match up to the original. We went to a nondescript mall closest to our house that had the most convenient timing, post lunch. Not expecting a jam packed theatre, I decided to book tickets at the counter. Bad decision, as the only seats available was at the first row. 
I was a bit disappointed thinking Arjun would have to strain his neck, looking up at the screen, the whole time. We grabbed our 3D glasses. Arjun wasn't pleased with his small ""baby glasses"". Since we'd just had lunch, I had to pull the drooling 5 year old away from the popcorn counter with the promise of cheese popcorn during the ""intermission"". The couple walking towards our seat was wondering why I was giving them dirty looks. They plonked themselves next to us with their gigantic tub of popcorn! (Exaggerated eye-roll) 
Arjun is very loud in theatres. He waits for the theatre to quieten before he can make his proclamation to the public. ""I am very very hungry, you haven't given me anything to eat"" said Arjun looking at our neighbours' popcorn. Thankfully, the screen lit up and the trailers of the upcoming films began. It started off with the Akshay Kumar starrer 'Padman'. The audience drowned in laughter, the trailer was funny. Arjun waited for his moment and loudly asked, ""This is not a Batman, this is a Padman, but what is a Pad?"" Everyone burst out laughing again. Arjun was pleased and with that he forgot his popcorn. 
REVIEW BEGINS HERE: The movie begins with a kid inserting a cartridge into a video game console and my heart sank a little. I have no patience for spotty high school kids and how dare they change the game from a board game to a video game. Are all these millennials too cool for board games!
The movie proceeds with four high school kids being sucked into the game's setting into the world of Jumanji where they don on their respective video game avatars. This is where Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson makes his entry which was met with a lot of hoots and cat calls in the theatre and a ""Why are you screaming now"" from Arjun. The four characters are then enlisted to return the jewel, 'Jaguar's eye' to a gigantic rocky Jaguar statue. The movie follows their journey from their entry into the game all the way up till the statue. The path is trodden with hurdles thrown in by Russel Van Pelt, a hunter, who wants the jewel for himself in order to be able to control the animals of Jumanji. Each player has three lives, losing all of which would mean death. This is a typical action-adventure film and it reminded me of a light hearted version of Hunger Games. 
The 3D effects are superb and the effect was much more pronounced being in the first row. The movie is HILARIOUS, the actors are funny especially Jack Black and Kevin Hart. The five year old had his eyebrows up and mouth wide open so I am presuming he enjoyed it too. At the risk of sounding unfaithful to Robin Williams, Dwayne did an excellent job as the protagonist, Dr. Smolder Bravestone. 
Yes, I would record this movie when it comes on TV and watch it again.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Above average popcorn entertainment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4080852/?ref_=tt_urv","Vartiainen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30163554/?ref_=tt_urv","4 March 2018","You know what, in this age of endless remakes and soft reboots, I actually think that a sequel to Jumanji is not actually all that terrible an idea. I mean, the original 1995 adventure film already hinted at possible sequels with its ending and the story and the world of Jumanji is such that you can tell countless stories with it. Plus, it also has the fact going for it that the original film was not a great one. I mean, it's good and nowadays more than nostalgic, but it's not a masterpiece. There is room for improvement here.And while I do not think that this film surpasses the original, it does come very close to matching it in quality. It keeps the lighthearted, tongue in cheek tone of the original, updates the visuals, changes the story enough to remain interesting, while still wholeheartedly feeling like a Jumanji story.What I liked the most were the actors. The ones playing the actual teenagers were okay, even if their characters are about as three-dimensional as the original Super Mario Bros game. But it's the characters playing the game characters that are the saving grace here. From Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan as two invincible heroes to Jack Black and Kevin Hart as their bumbling sidekicks. The fact that they have to act like they're being controlled by teenagers is admittedly a cheap joke, but it's a joke that keeps on giving. Especially Black as a self-centered queen bee brat.And that's actually the perfect way to sum up the film. Its humour and entertainment value are... cheap... -ish, no way around it, but it's just the right kind of cheap. Perhaps I do miss the more serious moments and actual drama of the original just a little bit, and I cannot say that the film gets modern teenagers particularly well, but on the other hand the action scenes are better, the locations are more interesting and it's simply too much fun to disdain in any meaningful way.Grab a bucket of popcorn, pop a soda, lean back and take a trip to the jungles of Jumanji. Watch out for the hippos.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I personally just felt that there wasn't any intense moments that made you jump out of your seat, or compassionate moments that made you smile. I understand the route they went, but it was too focused on comedy, and quite a lot of unrealistic things. In Jumanji 1995, the scene with the lion, I was scared, almost as scared as the children, but in this Jumanji, not once did I not feel that they wouldn't make finish the journey, not once did I feel as though they should be scared. It had to switch every good or romantic or even thriller moments into something funny. The story was lighthearted and not intense enough, the script needed improvement but everything else was great. I recommend this movie if you just want to have a good time and enjoy the company of your friends and family. So through everything like this I give this movie a 6/10.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

There is a loose link to the character played by Robin Williams in the original.Jumanji was known for its CGI wild animal stampede, however this film shows how much CGI has come on from those days.The film starts off a little like The Breakfast Club as four diverse high school kids get detention and come across an old video console containing the Jumanji video game. The teenagers get transported into another dimension where they become video game characters different to their real world counterparts.Spencer the nerdy gamer becomes the muscular Dr Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) with no weaknesses. Fridge, his big football playing former friend becomes Bravestone's sidekick and zoologist, Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar (Kevin Hart) who must avoid cake. Narcissistic 'it' girl Bethany becomes chubby and turns into cartographer Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black.) Clever but insular Martha turns into a kick ass Lara Croft type adventurer, Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan.)The characters must work together to save Jumanji by returning a stolen artefact while encountering various dangers and henchmen.This is a comedy adventure with some video game tropes. I always felt that the original Jumanji was a rather clumsy fantasy adventure which did not get the comedy balance right.It helps that Johnson and Hart have worked together previously and riff off each other. Director Jake Kasdan, whose father Lawrence Kasdan wrote some of the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies makes something more than a cynical adventure film. He allows some character growth, such as Spencer and Martha coming close as themselves although there is a moment where Dr Bravestone does wonder if it would be better to stay as the avatar in a video game.An entertaining film which kids would especially enjoy.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

It does have references to the original. It also takes a new perspective. The original was a board game that had things coming out that the players has to interact with (unless you were sucked in). In this, the board game realises people play game consoles and adapts to it (to make it appealing to the newer age group). The players are sucked into the game (no option for things to come out - which is disappointing) as the avatars they chose and have to complete a mission with different 'levels' (which are different areas of a map). The humour is very good (jack black playing a woman in a mans body for one). The trailer doesn't show all the good bits so there's nothing to worry about there. The film is full of entertainment.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The story is fun, but sometimes I feel like the references to the original movie are pretty dumb, and the writers didn't even watch the movie, which they definitely did. In my opinion, and I think most people can agree, the acting is the worst part of this movie. Dwayne Johnson is actually a decent actor, but Nick Jonas? Really? Actually, Nick Jonas was ok I guess, but the only person I think did a great job was Jack Black, although the high schooler he was based on is unrealistic, he is still funny and is great at acting like her. Overall a funny and almost great movie, might be my favorite from Dwayne.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But what's interesting is having LOW expectations of movies. Then, when you go in expecting to hate every freaking scene in the film, you're pleased when there are things about it you liked.In the case of what I guess is classified as a ""Reboot"" (although having an Easter Egg planted right smack in the middle of the movie that tells you otherwise means it's a sequel), JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE was an absolute riot.I liked the original JUMANJI, but I never fell in love with it. Robin Williams was excellent because honestly, even in amazingly bad films such as TOYS, it wasn't Robin I was irritated with. Guys like him always push it as hard as they can, but they can't do more than what they're stuck to work with.Comparing the two, I would say that what truly was lacking in the original was a definitive sense of humor. Trying to balance humor and drama is tough, VERY tough, because the themes don't generally mix together. One usually dominates over the other, making one the flavor while the other is the main course. In the first JUMANJI, it wasn't demanding enough to be scary, and it wasn't funny enough to be hilarious.While I won't say that WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is scary in any way, it does at least TRY to have a more pressing urgency to it. The original wasn't terribly clear on the more interesting rules of the game: if one of the players died, for REAL, what would have happened? It's presumed, based on the theme of the film, that it's not possible for the players to die. Here, coming up with a definite penalty system, clearly illustrated early on in the predicament of the four students stuck in Jumanji, the pressure is on. It's delivered with humor, but it's there, and it keeps you guessing throughout the film as to what exactly Game Over would be, when somebody fails.One of the most shining moments of the film has to be the main cast, acting as if they were the teenagers that inhabit their bodies. On the comedy side, nobody can beat Jack Black, who is the avatar of the popular cellphone-obsessed white teenage girl, reacting and over-reacting to the fact that she's now an overweight, middle-aged pudgy white dude. Dwayne Johnson also shines here, stretching his acting muscles to emulate the leader of the gang, as they try to team up and make their way through Jumanji. Karen Gillan, whom I've never had the pleasure of seeing in anything before now, was also hilarious in her own way, her avatar being the opposite of the teenager that's stuck inside of her. And Kevin Hart, the man who makes comedy as a profession, is good, but strangely outplayed here, delivering yuks but never really stealing the show. On the dramatic side, the film never does take itself too seriously, but I believe it to be one of its strengths. The main drama comes from the ticking of the clock, from the pressure of racing toward the ending without assurances that everything's going to be okay. If you want a criticism, I will give you two of them: I'm not sure if the kids who start out the movie are acting poorly, or acting poorly on purpose. I think it's the latter, where the director knew he'd have less screen time with them than with their avatars, so he needed a way to kind of... over-identify their personalities early on, so you could see Dwayne and co. pull off such great jobs at emulating them. I THINK that's the reason. Because honestly, the first part of this movie was, for me, the toughest to get through.Secondly, the villain's scenes seemed unnecessary, most of the time. The team could have been fighting Jumanji as a semi-formed background filled with enemies, and it would have been just as effective. The heavy, whose character is a nod to the original JUMANJI, feels out of place here, without a real definitive character or personality of any kind.Overall, however, I had a blast with this film, and I laughed myself to tears through a lot of it. I don't remember having NEARLY as much fun with the original. The marketeers want to call this a ""reboot"", and I see, according to IMDb, that the studios are already gearing up for what's listed as ""JUMANJI 2"", but I don't care what the marketeers are saying, cause it's just not true. This was a SEQUEL to the original, and it lives in that rarest of categories where it was much better than the original.And that's where I will leave it. The review, I mean. Because I'd love to get my hands on this movie, and add it to my collection.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I just watched it because I haven't seen many movies with Karen Gillan, who I liked from Doctor Who.The premise seems to have come when someone watched the original Jumanji back-to-back with The Breakfast Club. Four teenagers in detention find a mysterious game console and find themselves sucked into a strange world where they are in the body of avatars and must complete the game to return to the real world.The cast is quite good. I particularly like Jack Black's take on a teenage girl. Gillan gets a little blown out by her castmate's star power; it probably would have been better to cast the role with a strong comedic actor like Amy Schumer or Tiffany Hadish or even with a strong action star like Daisy Ridley. Still, I like her flirt-fail scene.It's very silly and very forgettable but it's fun and funny and does a fairly decent job of emulating a video game structure, although one in which everyone would want the same avatar, which is bad design. If you have a chance to catch it on an airplane ride, I'd say go for it.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Can they get back alive?""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" (2017) is the third film in the current four-film franchise if you include ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" (2005). It was a surprise hit at the box office and produced an immediate sequel in 2019.While I give the edge to the original 1995 movie, this one delivers the goods for an entertaining family-friendly adventure/fantasy with a good message. The nonsense in the jungle is amusing & thrilling without overstaying its welcome. What really makes the film work is that it effectively establishes the four characters and their situations in the first act and wraps up with showing how they've grown as a result of their otherworldly adventure.Dwayne Johnson is always great for the lead in these kinds of flicks and Hart & Black offer comical support. Karen Gillan is cute and athletic, but needs to gain some weight IMHO. Meanwhile Madison Iseman (Bethany) has alluring eyes, but Morgan Turner (Martha) actually outshines her. The exceptional title song plays during the credits.The movie runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, and was shot in Atlanta, Georgia (neighborhood scenes) and Hawaii with loads of CGI backdrops.GRADE: B","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This was the second time Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart teamed up in a movie together. The first being Central Intelligence, though you can't go wrong with a little Hart and one big Johnson, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was a better fit for them than Central Intelligence, even without Hart and Johnson's help from some star power like Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas.So just like with the original film, a few kids find some old game and begin to play it, only to get sucked into the game they are playing. Keeping with the video game tone the kids become the avatars they select. So this kid name Spencer, who in real life is a little nerd, gets to become The Rock, who plays Dr. Smolder Bravestone, not much of a doctor of anything but he's got strength, speed, and no weaknesses, so like I said, he becomes the Rock, and what kid does not want to become the Rock, right? (hell I'm a grown man and I want to become The Rock)Not all the other kids are as lucky with the avatars they randomly selected. 6 feet tall high school football star, becomes 5'3"" Kevin Hart, who plays Moose Finbar, and acts as Bravestone's weapons holder. Not that being Kevin Hart, who is funny and rich would not be cool, but not really something I've dreamed about, but it could be worse, you could be Bethany, a cute and shallow teenage girl who picks the avatar Shelly Oberon, who happens to be a fat middle age man. Some of the best laughs of the movie do come from Black playing a girl discovering the advantages and disadvantages of being a dude.Then we have Karen Gillan, as the avatar Ruby Roundhouse, a total jab at the female stereotypes in video games, a hot chick who can kick butt, but is not wearing enough clothing, which makes the user Martha uncomfortable.The movie is all about what it would be like to truly live out the game as the characters treat each adventure like a level in the video game and have to overcome these adventures without loosing the three lives they are given.It does not make for much character development. Each person comes into the game with with certain issues that seem to be what the film was going to focus on, but the whole thing went by too fast to be of any substance.This new Jumanji works on the pure star power it has as we watch The Rock, Kevin Hart and Jack Black interact with each other as they play the game. It's worth it for that and that alone","13 out of 28 found this helpful.

""Jumanji"" is way more than its movie trailer. Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan are awesome. The Rock embodies a genuine ""nerd' charm in his action hero persona. It's nice to 'see' Karen not hidden behind the Nebula visage of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"". I'm a fan from her short lived series ""Selfie"". Gillan is beautiful, beguiling, and comedic charm. Jack Black as Shelly the gender swapped avatar practically steals the show illustrating the movie's surprising message. Game avatar Shelly, who's real life persona is ""it"" girl Bethany, schools now stunning Martha (Gillan) how be attractive to men. Shelly says, ""You're hot. Now own it."" Black offers comic relief in the video game mayhem as Shelly confesses to Smolder Bravestone (Johnson) and diminutive Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart) that having penis makes it so easy to pee. In the touching narrative arc, as their avatars in ""Jumanji"" Martha tells Bethany that she is so self-absorbed, consequently totally so selfish. Bethany tells Martha that she judges people first, before they have chance to hurt her. Director Jake Kasdan surprises not so much with the light hearted large-scale action with Johnson and Gillan kicking some ass battling motorcycle villains commanded by Bravestone's arch nemesis Van Pelt, played by ruthless vile Bobby Cannavale. Rather his poignant message in this video gamer movie is: Be who you are. This is amazing given that the screenplay based on the book, ""Jumanji"" has screenwriters Chis McKenna, Erik Sommer, Scott Rosenberg, and Jeff Pinker. Usually having that many writers inevitably generates kluge. Instead they are often touching. Young Spencer now The Rock's Bravestone has been in love with teen iconoclast Martha, now Ruby Roundhouse, since 7th grade. Both Johnson and Gillan are the most beautiful screen actors in paradox as Spencer says, ""I'm a nerd."" Martha says, ""I like nerds."" Bravestone fears death realizing that he only has one game ""life"" remaining in ""Jumanji"", doubting if he can save his friends and return the magical green jewel to the Jaguar statue. His friend Finbar, played by Hart, reminds that in the real world, ""We all only have one life."" So do your best. That's what anyone can do. Johnson is amazing movie star swag and gentle introspection as Bravestone. Hart is nervous comic energy as Finbar. He tells someone about his avatar's weakness, ""Cake makes me explode."" Don't often hear that one. Hart is also all heart. Their partnership along with Gillan and Black are about seeing others as greater than they know. In the end that's what makes you become. And perhaps, the hero arises from within. ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is derivative of ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"". 
""Jumanji"" does not aim to be as iconic, although it is about: Who you are? Who are you going to be? Young Spencer, Fridge, Bethany, and Martha, played convincingly by Alex Wolf, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman, and Morgan Turner, all enter the video game ""Jumanji"" as who they are. Perhaps, they transform as greater. Really that's up to them. Director Kasdan invites you along for the ride with cool martial arts and gorgeous locales. Go along for the ride. The ride is well worth it.","19 out of 45 found this helpful.

Surprisingly, (at least for me), Jack Black MADE the movie. They must have had the kids act out the scenes and then the adults recreate their expressions and mannerisms and what not, because Jack Black NAILED the teenage girl thing (and I'm a 19 y/o female). He wasn't over-the-top or stereotypical & demeaning, just super funny and spot on, and both my teenage sisters agree. All in all, not a bad movie, would definitely watch again.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Those tribal instruments were just one component of the adventure Jumanji was back in the 90s, well that and about a thousand other things that made for a fun adventure. Now, decades later, the jungle is to be unleashed once more to the modern generation in hopes of reviving the adventure once more, perhaps for more sequels. Robbie K here to give you the 411 on the latest movies, so let's get started!LIKES: The References: It's always fun to get pleasant memories of your childhood refreshed with a nostalgic reference. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, tips its hat towards a couple of Easter eggs that will take you back to the nineties. The animatronic animals, the familiar sounds of wild life hidden in the bushes, and a few shout outs to previous characters were well placed to revive the spark the prequel made long ago. Acting: Okay, this film isn't going to win any major awards for best actor/actress, but that doesn't count it out for quality, entertaining talent. Dwayne Johnson is still a rugged, stud adventure type with a smolder and skill for comedic sarcasm. Kevin Hart has the rant style down, focusing on energetic, loud delivery with a little cursing to sweeten the pot. Jack Black provides the awkward comedy, yet manages to take it one step further by acting like a girl trapped in a man's body, including all the mannerisms that modern teenage girls exemplify. Karen Gillan is edgy, angst filled, yet somehow reserved to bring a fighter not fueled by raging hormones of stress. While it doesn't sound that different, there are a couple of things that impressed me. The first is that the chemistry between these actors, which seemed very natural as they bounced their insults and dialogue off of one another. The second component is how the actors seemed to portray not only the qualities of their avatar, but also of the kids trapped inside them. Much like Jack Black, the actors all had to balance teenage adolescent with epic adventure role and it worked very well for me. Comedy: By far the strongest component for me though is the laugh fest hidden in the foliage of the artificial jungle world. Jumanji 2 was one of the funniest adventures I've seen in a while, filled with a plethora of comedic styles to tickle your fancy in a variety of ways. Insult humor, one-liners, meme worthy antics, and even sexual innuendos are all crammed into the 2-hour run time. Spreading the humor throughout kept things fresh for me and changing up the style only further kept me laughing. However, the component I loved was how tasteful the stupidity was, managing to combine wit and slapstick into a blend that is just a hoot to watch. I feel this style will work for a wide variety of ages, though beware of the occasional curse bomb to light up the screen. 
DISLIKES; A Little Corny/Stretch: Welcome to the Jungle is a stretch in many regards, however there are times where the movie treks of the already ridiculous path. Some of the action scenes have stunts that defy physics, or performances that are pushing the limits at times. These inconsistencies are easy to ignore for the most part, and really don't ruin much with all the fun to be had. Yet, these components are a little cheesy at times, fake looking even more so, and dilutes the message in a preachy fashion. The Bad Guy: The main villain has a cool power to use, but sadly the villain doesn't utilize it very well. In addition, the primary antagonist and his cronies are a little anticlimactic in terms of threatening the jungle, being more roar than bite. A few lousy maneuvers, a threat here or there, and some lame NPC minions just didn't do it for me in regards to development and design. Missing Adventure: As fun as the video game twist was on the movie, I missed the component of the board game that made the original the adventure it was. Remember the terror of the unknown as the dice rolled and the swirling green mist formed into a message? How about seeing the horrors of the jungle out into the real world and our heroes having to do everything to keep the board safe? Yeah, those thrills are what Jumanji was about as the beasts were unleashed in special effect glory. This movie focused a little too heavy on the biker gang motive and sort of ditched the jungle component for me. I missed the animal part of this adventure and the blending of these threats together, and the adventure they crafted. The VERDICT:  Welcome to the Jungle is a very fun movie and I was not disappointed as I could have been. It's funny, with a great cast to bring the crew to life and a great energy to keep one entertained throughout the whole movie. Yet, the comedy seemed to be the main focus, because the balanced laughs really overshadowed the adventure component the first movie had within it. Still, many ages will enjoy what this movie has to offer and will be quoting this movie for quite some time after it leaves theaters. Worth a trip to the theater? Absolutely, though save your dough and don't see it in 3-D. My Scores:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.0","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was a one of a kind movie for me. It had a great concept of a cursed board game that can bring the entire jungle into the real world. And I enjoyed it a lot. And after 2 decades of silence, Columbia pictures decided to bring back the obscure game, but in a form of a video game. I was actually curious to check it out, but sadly I couldn't. And in April I decided to finally witness this sequel.The movie starts with 4 high school students - Spencer, Fridge, Martha and Bethany. They lived a regular life until they messed up. So much so, that they got sent to detention. As a punishment, they had to clean up the basement, where they find an old game called Jumanji. After they started the game, our characters get sucked into the jungle and the only way out is to break the curse. In the beginning it was a little bit boring, since the teen acting wasn't the best and the plot felt dry, but once we enter into the game, this is where it begins to shine. Anyways, the characters turn into the video game avatars, and all of them become confused. Which can lead into some funny moments. Probably the funniest one has to be Dr Shelly Oberon (Jack Black). It was interesting to see a diva girl being stuck in a body of a middle aged scientist. As a fan of Jack Black's performance in Shallow Hal, Shark tale and Kung fu panda, he just made me smile throughout the film. Another character that I liked is Ruby Roundhouse. In this case, her body was taken by Martha, who is a shy nerdy girl, but thanks to her friends, she gained confidence. I especially liked the scenes where she had to distract the guards by dance fighting. As for the other elements, I can say that it succeeded with a lot of elements. I liked the whole video game jungle atmosphere, it really gave me some Ice age 3, Jurassic park and Journey to the centre of the Earth vibes (despite the fact that it has no dinosaurs). As for the game aspect, it does have some gaming elements like 3 lives, non playable characters saying automatic phrases and each of the players having their own strengths and weaknesses. Even as someone who doesn't play games a lot, I can say that this a smart move for the directors to take a board game and upgrade it to the next level. I really love the adventure aspect, where the characters had to go through different levels to reach the destination, while fighting against animals and moto cyclists.The acting from the main actors was great, with Dwayne Johnson being the brave hero with great speed, jumping and fighting skills, Kevin Hart being the helpful sidekick with a huge backpack, Jack Black (like I mentioned) being the funny scientist and Karen Gillian being the tough female fighter, that would kick men while also dancing. Each actor felt like a realistic teenage that turned into a video game avatar, where all of them become confused at first, but once they know what to do, they try their best to find a solution of breaking the curse. There's also Nick Jonas as the mysterious pilot character named Alex, who sadly got stuck on the same level for 20 years. Without spoilers, you can actually feel for him and support him.Despite all the positives being said, it's not a perfect film. First, the villain was super generic! He just a typical vengeful antagonist that wants to steal the gem and use it for evil purposes. Sadly, I don't even remember his name. Also, some elements were dumb, like moto cyclists felt out of place for a jungle movie. And the humour can sometimes be juvenile, especially the toilet joke one, which makes the film feel a little bit stupid. Sadly, it barely connects itself to the first movie. Sure, it does have some references like mentioning Alan's name, but none of the original characters return, which could upset long time fans. On the bright side, newcomers don't have to worry about the events of the prequel, since it's perfectly fine as it's own story.I can say that this movie is a treat for all fans of jungle adventure and video game movies. It has an energetic plot, likeable characters, some great action and nice soundtrack. Even with little to no connection to the first movie, some dumb elements and a weak antagonist, it still had the power to break the curse of bad sequels. Not as great as the first movie, but still a great journey that I wouldn't mind to visit again. And yes, it's a popcorn flick kind of a film. So it's not for people who look for a deep messages, but rather a fun distraction from the real life problems where you actually feel like your inside a virtual world. Not a must watch, but still a good movie for a Friday night!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A boring beginning and predictable, uninspiring ending is what can happen so easily when a film is written by a panel.
I've hardly thought about this film since I left the cinema, and I struggle to recommend it to anyone.

I was very pleasantly surprised. Not only is it funny and exciting throughout but also the comedy and story are directly related. All the teens are changed to have bodies and skills that are the exact opposite of theirs, not only for comedic purposes but also to help each of them overcome their weaknesses. Many have complained that the story was incredibly cliche and that the whole story can be summed up by ""kids get sucked in, fight,and get out"", but thats not what this is about at all. This movie is first and foremost about the teens themselves (even though they have very little screen time). I'd like to say that my screening was filled with teens adults and much older people, and they were all laughing. This movie isn't neccesarily new or fresh but its a good fun movie. If you didn't enjoy this movie it's because you couldn't, cause you didn't let yourself enjoy it.

Along the way, the meet, Alex, played by nick jonas, whom was a teen that went missing 20 years ago. He has been stuck in the game, not able to advance. There is some crazy CGI I can only assume meant to look video game listic. Like stampeding rhinos, attacking hippos, a den of snakes, driving a bike over impossible terrain.

However does he live up to the name he carries? The beginning of the story is short and simple, featuring the four protagonists, completely different students who are united by a day of detention. During the time of punishment they find an old video game console in the school pantry, and start the game online. When each of them selects one of the four avatars, they are then sucked into the game world, where they need to complete all the stages in order to then be able to return to their world. As already mentioned, the presentation of the characters in the real world is very short and serves well to introduce each character, which work as clichés in the best club style of the five (only of the four). The patricinha, the sportsman, the nerd and the stranger are present, and the dynamics between them work well. The whole thing becomes more fun when entering the game, when the characters start to use the body of the avatars they have chosen, and there is an exchange of roles. The nerd, for example, has the strongest and most athletic character, while the patricinha takes the place of the chubby cartographer. This exchange of roles is hilarious and well explored. Jack Black acting like a patricinha is priceless. Another factor also contributes too much to the fun of the film: the debauchery that is made with the elements of video games. The presence of cutscenes and NPCs with limited programmed phrases and so on. If you think about it, there is even a phase in the sewer haha. The fact that the film takes place within a game is used to not take itself seriously and yields good jokes. I have pointed out so far that the film is successful in entertaining the public. However, it is not much of that. There is a certain excess of jokes, some getting out of the mood that could develop better, or just plain dull. A lot of the boring jokes come from Kevin Hart, curious ... A lot of the action scenes are cool, but the final confrontation against the big bad guy is kind of confusing, and some cuts throughout the film are weird and confusing. Anyway, the film doesn't try to take itself too seriously, and the negative points are less highlighted like that. As for the name Jumanji in the title, it is another discussion. The justification for the game to be digital this time is there, as well as references to the first film. However, in my opinion the continuation has little of the atmosphere of the first, the jungle and its elements seeming to have little importance.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Like Space Jam and Casper, it was a 90s kids movies that is very of its time: high-concept, slightly obnoxious, technologically advanced, and drenched in unimaginative jokes. So not only is it surprising for us to be getting a sequel 20 years later, with none of the original cast and very little actual connection to its source, it's even more surprising that it's this old-fashioned and good. Easily the best video game film I've seen, it's the kind of corny, good-natured fun we rarely get anymore.
Four teenagers come across an old video game system, which sucks them into the jungle world of Jumanji, giving them the avatar bodies of The Rock, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan. Much of the entertainment comes from the body-swap and fish-out-of-water humor. Still, the fantasy story is refreshingly decent, with the constructs of a video game leading the both the plot and the comedy.
Most impressive is the story's willingness to slow down to let the characters jokes and relationships shine. The performers are perfectly cast, with Rock and Black really shining. Each captures the personality of their teen counterpart with surprising accuracy, except Hart, who still manages plenty of laughs without the actual commitment to his character. 
It's all just more well-thought out than it has any right to be. The action scenes are clear and engaging. The dialogue is solid and memorably funny. There are multiple scenes that standout among the comedy of 2017 films. So when the movie falls into contrivance sporadically, it's all-the-more disappointing. Still, this Jumanji is a perfect way to cap-off the year-in-movies: with a turn-off-your-cynicism, good-time family adventure comedy.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I always felt my memories of Jumanji were actually better than it was though, and even now I can't remember a whole lot about it.What I can remember though is that Welcome to the Jungle picks up from the original's cliffhanger; with the board game washing up on the beach, and claiming it's first victim in it's new video game guise to act as this movies Alan Parrish. Fast forward twenty years to the present day and we're introduced to a varied, if slightly cliché, group of high schoolers. During detention, they find the video game, plug it in, and get sucked into the world of Jumanji, updated for the video game generation.What follows is like an amalgamation of Breakfast Club, Freaky Friday, and Tropic Thunder. Each teenager is put into a new body, in a game character who holds a completely new role for them to play than they do in their lives. The two popular/athletic kids are stuck in brainy, physically-diminished bodies, while the two nerds are stuck in attractive, athletic bodies. Many of the jokes hinge on these body swaps, and while you can see where these jokes go before they even happen, they still manage to feel fresh and funny. Seeing Dwayne Johnson play an awkward, jumpy kid is always funny. Always.On that note, the core cast are pretty great on the whole, which actually really surprised me. At no point did I watch them and think 'oh hey that's Dwayne Johnson being goofy'. Instead they managed to capture the essence of being a teenager perfectly to the point that I still considered them teenagers, as if some sort of acting voodoo had occured that literally swapped the body's of the actors. Barring Kevin Hart, who literally just plays Kevin Hart the whole time. But Karen Gillan fits snug in the nerdy, socially awkward character of Martha so effortlessly that she even keeps the character going when she's just in the background and not the main focus. She also has a surprising amount of comedy chops too. Seeing her attempt and fail to flirt and be sexy is worth the price of admission alone. (And on the note of her outfit, it's a video game, that's the entire point)That said Jack Black steals the show as Bethany. While sometimes he can find it hard to break free of being himself, at other times he can be truly transformative, and Welcome to the Jungle is one of those times. He's not Jack Black here, he's a teenage white girl obsessed with her phone and her looks. The way he marvels at being able to pee standing up, or teaching Martha how to flirt, or giving Nick Jonas mouth-to-mouth, or staring at Dwayne Johnson wide-eyed and gushing. He really channels his inner teenage girl so well that's hard to take him any other way. He steals the show. Of course it helps that Bethany becomes one of the best developed characters in the entire movie. She starts out stereotypically self-absorbed, and almost cringeworthy in her obsession with selfies and instagram. But as the movie develops we see new sides to her. Away from her phone, she's understanding and smart, and at no point is she played as a ditsy blonde that this kind of movie would fall back on for jokes.The character of Bethany is more of an exception than the rule when it comes to character development though. Martha and Spencer enjoy a little bit from being put in attractive, athletic bodies for once, and the newfound confidences that brings, but otherwise they come out the other end the same nerdy teenagers they were before. Fridge is even worse. He's a terrible human being throughout the entire movie until the coda where they're all suddenly best friends. The villain is horrifically underutilised as well. He's a snarling, one-dimensional villain without motivations, put in there just to give a human antagonist to fight against. I wouldn't be surprised if Bobby Cannavale wasn't happy with how his character turned out in the end.Humour is top-notch and is the movie's sole reason for existence. It makes it not only bearable, but genuinely enjoyable to watch. It takes it's jokes from a variety of genres, from slapstick, to wit, to the whole body swap thing, but never relies on cringe or gross-out moments. It also manages to keep its humourous tone consistent throughout, never getting too serious, or conversely making light of more serious moments.Of course what this does mean is that Welcome to the Jungle does not feel like Jumanji at all. It's a fun adventure romp with teenagers body-swapping into a jungle game. The opening with the recreated cliffhanger from the original, and even a name-drop or two of Alan Parrish are all well and good, but they don't alter the fact that Welcome to the Jungle completely lacks any of the scares or fantasy established in that first film. There's no mutant animals or plants at all, and the tone is consistently light and upbeat, opting for surface entertainment than taking the opportunity to explore something deeper. The introduction of each character having three lives is smart, but it takes out much of the threat and danger of the place.Another minor niggle is the overabundance of needless CGI to create stunts and interesting fight choreography. I'm not usually one to complain about the use of CGI, but here it really stands out, enough to break the immersion and make you realise you are actually watching a movie. The music as well is super bland, and almost dated. Maybe that's deliberate to harken back to the original, but for such a modern re-telling it feels out-of-place and a little cheesy.In all Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is the definition of a safe family movie. It doesn't attempt to break any moulds or try anything new, and in fact shirks the tone of the franchise entirely just to keep it all feeling a little more vanilla. That said, and this is crucial, it's a movie that knows exactly what it is. It's cheap, surface-level entertainment, and in that is a rip-roaring success. It drags you into the world of these teenagers, never breaks character, and will keep you smiling and laughing from beginning to end. I cannot say that I had a terrible time or that I didn't like the movie, because despite being aimed at the lowest common denominator, it does it so well that I got sucked in just like everyone else. I give it an enjoyable 7/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It doesn't matter how old I am, or what I'm doing, Jumanji is getting watched! Robin Williams performance in the film was phenomenal, and personally, one of my favorites. This being said, I was very weary about the new Jumanji coming out. I knew for sure thy would ruin it. No way could they compete with the modern classic!! 22 years later & all I could gather up were low expectations and mild interests.
However, given my low enthusiasm of this film, I was pleasantly surprised by how ""fun"" the movie is. The movie theatre actually filled with laughter (mine included). You couldn't help but smile your way through it. Given the all the components (Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black) comedy is sure to ensue. And let's face it...anytime Kevin & Dwayne do anything on screen together, I don't care what it is, I'm there.Unfortunately, I will say that Kevin Hart is exactly that in this movie, Kevin Hart. We all know his humor, and to be honest it is getting sort of old and routine. His comedic style is very predictable and sometimes overdone. Jack Black (Bethany) delivers a great performance with his rendition of a white teenage girl that will have you laughing the whole way through. His one-liners kept a smile on my face the whole movie, and surprisingly he became my favorite character.
Going into this movie, I had to keep reminding myself that it is not, by any means, a remake of the original. There were very scarce similarities, and I found that as an upside. I loved the fact that the film tried to stand on its own. They weren't trying to recreate and redo this classic that they could potentially ruin. Going in with an open mind really helped me enjoy this new Jumanji film. It delivers a continuation of the film with some major modern updates for the 2000 generation.
""Jumanji"" (1995) was thrilling and chilling. You're lying if you say you weren't terrified of those humongous spiders or Van Pelt with his shotgun. ""In the jungle you must wait, until the dice read 5 or 8"" was my constant reminder to NEVER play Jumanji, even if the board game was bought at the nearest Walmart. However, ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,"" was not scary or thrilling at all. It definitely is more comedic than adventurous, which depending on your preferred genre, may be a plus or negative to you.
It is definitely a great film for the family to see together right around the holidays, just don't count on any Oscar nominations any time soon 😊","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story is so strong for a nice film but I am afraid they could not use correctly. Although visual effects are not outstanding if you want to choice like fantastic movie. Seems like producer did not want to spend money for this movie I sense an intense lack of quality and cheapness. Character introduction is pretty crucial in movies like this because we watch a loser men-women and apparently they improve themselves with time but I didn't take proper information before the action especially for girl. And then suddenly plot point 1 was over, they included the game. After that time during 20 minutes we watch the sexy girl joke. The story is never going on in that times. After the first scenes of motorbiker guys we watch billions of scenes which are trying to make epic. Al the time with increasing music sound, somebody explore himself and decide to become self-confident person, 5 minutes later again I watch the same thing . At least 4-5 scenes are like this. I have never watched a regularly rising of character story. Because of this reason I don't feel any signal of victory before the resolution part of script.Frankly, I like the game-inside point only. Rest of the movie don't satisfy me, if you want to spend time with your children you can choose it otherwise no need for watching.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Much as I like Jack Black normally, he's pretty wasted in his role, and Kevin Hart works overtime to wring laughs out of the script but didn't make me chuckle once.

It has thrills, humour, and tries to tell you something about life. It remains a popcorn flick but for anyone who wants to watch a movie that will fade away after a day or two, but still offers enough enjoyment for an evening, Jumanji gives you just that. Featuring three of the funniest guys in Hollywood and one talented hot chick (and one of brothers Jonas) the movie remains approachable and well-paced throughout. There is a framework for character development but as expected it is forced and basic as hell. I would still watch the original from '95 but for modern audiences this would likely becomes the go to film in the 'franchise'. There will be likely another one based on the huge money it earned so far.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Add to that this being a sequel and has Jack Black in it as a teenage girl... yeah I was expecting something intolerable with it.It starts off lame as expected. A bunch of walking stereotypes all get a contrived reason to have detention together where they find the game and start playing. This leads to the first continuity error of the movie, The game turned into a gaming cartilage when the 90's kid ignored it at first. kindda off it's version of keeping up with the times. When the other kids come across it, it's a console.make no mistake the first 15-20 minutes of this drag like hell. once they're in the game however it's a 180. I totally buy that they are avatars of those same teens. the ""game"" is very straight forward and easy to grasp from the get go with the movie being more about the character's development then anything else. They started off paper thin but the movie played it up nicely, the visuals were fun and... I can't believe I'm saying this but Jack Black was actually funny in this!There is a tie in with the original but it's subtle and I liked how the ending was faithful to how the original ended. This was fun movie for the family. it started at ground zero but made you care about the characters and get invested in it as it went on. 8.5 stars and a recommendation from me.","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

That is very much appreciated. Second off, even though it never would have happened, Jack Black legitimately deserved an Oscar nomination for this movie. Never for a second did I not believe he was a teenage girl. He does so much more than just play on the stereotypes as well. Mr. Black gives Bethany a proper character arc, using subtle humor. He is the best part of the movie by miles. On that note, the movie does an impressive job of depicting high schoolers realistically, even if they are trapped in the bodies of video game avatars. Another performance that wowed me was Karen Gillen. I've been a fan of hers since Doctor Who and I was incredibly pleased to see her do such a great job with her character, a fun little play on the stereotypical video game female. If I had to pick a cast member I wasn't pleased with, it was Kevin Hart. He didn't seem to put as much effort into his character as the rest of the cast. It would have been better if they would have cast an actor who doesn't act the same in every movie, one who could've given a more talented performance. I also found that character rather weak. And Nick Jonas... sigh. The villain was fine. Nothing special. The introduction of his character felt really unnecessary and forced. I do wish the movie had gone a little farther with its parody of video games. It introduces fun concepts, like the cutscene, but doesn't really run with it enough to make it as fun as it could be. All in all a flawed, but ultimately fun and funny movie, even if a few jokes don't land.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is the best The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) movie i ever seen since The Rundown (2003). Kevin Hart's also great too. Jack Black was good, Karen Gillan was great too. This movie is the sequel of 1995 of the same film staring Robin Williams, who died in 2014, causing suicide by hanging. I also like Robin Williams since Patch Adams and RV (2006). I haven't seen Mrs. Doubtfire yet, but I will watch it very soon. I also watch the original film, it was the great movie.I wonder don't why people hate this movie because this is not Jumanji. Well, I like this film, it was a funny movie. Just for it, my cousin's sister paid us RM 17 for movie tickets.

2017Fun movie. I was impressed. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has come along way over the years. At the beginning of his acting career I really didn't like The Rock. Perhaps I was persuaded by his pathetic and embarrassing performance as a wrestler. But recently, I've become a fan of The Rock and feel he's becoming a quality actor. I was skeptical about this movie from the beginning but was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I found myself laughing throughout. Not to mention it keeps making money at the box office.The movie is about a group of misfits in detention that stumble across a vintage video game system. When they set it up and begin to play they are sucked into the game actually becoming the individual characters of the game, complete with a number of lives, strengths and weaknesses. The film is convincing as an actual video game and gives video games styles appropriate credit. The action and visual effects are impressive and entertaining. Jack Black gives a convincing performance as a ditzy, popular, sexy blond that is addicted to her phone. Johnson seems to be the typical role as the strong hero with no weaknesses that seems to lead the team. Kevin Hart is his usual self as Fridge, a small whiney character in the game, a very different person than the football jock from the real world. (Assume that's where his name 'Fridge' comes from) He seems to have an insignificant role as Johnson's side kick, but quickly adapts, accepts and contributes. My favorite character was Martha, the nerdy girl that seems to see the world clearly with all its superficial and unimportant elements. She becomes a martial arts babe who has a sexy and rare ability for dance fighting. See the movie for more info, I don't want to spoil anything. Her performance is funny and entertaining. I love the way she kicks some tail and thinks through situations assisting the team. Because the film takes place in a video game setting some action is convincing and believable when in other movies it might appear ridiculous or far fetched. Flying a helicopter sideways for example. In a Mission Impossible movie it may force us to roll our eyes and mutter: ""Seriously? Come on."" It has the ability to exaggerate reality laws, much like the Matrix movies. I was a little disappointed with a few inappropriate and completely unnecessary sexual jokes and some romantic drama that was included in the story that didn't seem to fit. Some may appreciate it, but I felt the film could have done without it. Can I mention this? I know others are hesitant to address it. In every movie Johnson shows off his impressive chest tribal tattoo. Instead of seeing the character in the movie I see The Rock, playing that character. The Rock looks the exact same in every film he is in. Just like Baywatch, a post for another time, instead of Mitch Buchannon, I'm seeing Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson playing a lifeguard in a movie. The same goes for every other recent movie Johnson has been in. We all know his tattoo, and what it looks like. It's as if Johnson refuses to be anyone else, other than himself, for any movie. Fast and Furious? San Andreas? GI Joe? See where I'm going with this? Could we please have hair and makeup strive to show some effort in converting Johnson into the actual character in the film? Do I even need to add a reference to the character transformation of Gary Oldman for the film Darkest Hour here?I really do miss PG movies that are appropriate for all ages. They seem to be very rare now days. It would have been nice if a little bit of unnecessary content would have been filtered from this movie to give it the PG rating, so that kids could enjoy it as well.Overall the movie was a lot of fun. One I'd see again and recommend to others. I can see why it keeps making money at the box office.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Trapped inside of mirror opposite avatars (Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan) of themselves, the incongruous crew sets out to save the jungle nation by returning a stolen gemstone to the jaguar god.

The feminist agenda surrounding Gillan felt flat and unauthentic, falling into a lame copycat of Black Widow. And why Kasdan decided to go with Jack Black´s feminine/gay stereotype?.

I love the movie and the Jumanji 2017 movie is really fun, especially the characters and many funny scenes that make me laugh until my popcorn scrambling. Dwayne Johnson can do mimiques of face like a teenager. The plot is ordinary, about to conquer a quest of game, but the adventure is never boring. I appreciate the Director of Casting who can search the faces of all actors similar to the faces of game characters, this is miraculous.The only weakness that I found in Jumanji 2017 movie is that the core story itself: how can people get into the game. This is super imaginative and that part also makes us curious about the game business with the question of such: ""can we really doing game like in reality?"" and if yes, ""could we comeback?"" The final scene is also quite fiction for me, but I hope Jumanji 2017 movie can be an eternal movie like Home Alone or Air Buddy and every time we watch it, never boring.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

"9","/10","""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle""- Who'd have thought such an unnecessary and belated sequel could not only be good... but also be better than the original?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4108863/?ref_=tt_urv","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4669024/?ref_=tt_urv","29 March 2018","In the months leading up to the release of 2017's ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"", pretty much all you could hear was moans and groans from the collective film-going audience. People were upset that the beloved 1995 Robin Williams classic was getting a sequel. Purists were infuriated that the movie was updating the treacherous game for modern times. Online commentators couldn't get over co-star Karen Gillan's laughably skimpy outfit and took pot-shots at the movie over it. This is one of those films that just couldn't catch a break.Yet, something happened. Early reviews weren't just solid- they were absolutely glowing. A slew of sneak-preview screenings garnered extremely positive feedback from audiences. And when the film was finally released, it earned a near-unanimous acclaim. For a film that just couldn't catch a break, ""Welcome to the Jungle"" became a welcome and fantastic example of that old saying ""never judge a book by its cover."" Everyone was so wrapped up in pre-release drama and accusations... we just never considered that it might have not only been good- it might have actually been better than the original.Twenty years after the original adventure, a group of modern-day high school students all find themselves stuck in detention for varying reasons. Neurotic geek Spencer (Alex Wolff), meat-headed football star Anthony (Ser'Darius Blain), awkward loner Martha (Morgan Turner) and self-obsessed popular-girl Bethany (Madison Iseman). While sorting old magazines for recycling, the group discovers a mysterious video-game entitled ""Jumanji"" and boot it up, only to find themselves magically pulled inside of the game. Now occupying the bodies of the characters they chose (Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black), the troubled teenagers must complete the game's objective and solve increasingly difficult ""levels"" in order to escape. Along the way, they find a new ally in Alex (Nick Jonas), a long-lost kid who has been stuck in the game since 1996, all while being tracked by the game's villainous baddie Russell Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), whom has attained control over Jumanji's animal kingdom.The greatest treats of ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" are the playful and creative tone the story takes, and the excellent cast who have a grand time hamming it up for the camera. Co-written by Chris McKenna of ""Community"" fame, the script is an absolute blast and a half that both pays tribute to the original film while also taking the story in interesting new directions. The idea of Jumanji transforming itself into a video-game to attract modern teenagers is actually really clever, and it keeps the sequel fresh and unique while still remaining true to the original. There's also a ton of really fun meta-humor that fans of modern games will absolutely adore. I really got a kick over how the secondary characters can only speak a few specific lines over and over, in a playful nod to how video-game NPC's usually only have a handful of programmed responses. And the uproariously funny fact that Gillan's aforementioned skimpy outfit is a satirical swipe at how games often objectify female characters. (Like I said... never judge a book by its cover...)This is aided quite well by director Jake Kasdan's keen eye for visuals and sharp sense of pacing. The film's action set-pieces are genuinely thrilling, the humor is well-delivered and there's almost never a dull moment to be had. Kasdan has honed his skills throughout the years with some delightful projects, including the woefully underrated ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"", and here, that experience pays off in spades. And I can't wait to see what he does next.But perhaps the films greatest achievement is the absolutely outstanding cast. Particularly Johnson, Hart, Gillan and Black, who get to play against type and seem to relish in this in each and every moment. Everyone knows Johnson is one kick-butt dude... so it's a lot of fun seeing him playing the role of a neurotic teen whose allergic to just about everything. Gillan often plays sexy side-kicks or treacherous characters, which makes for a good contrast when she's playing an uncomfortable weirdo who can't talk to guys and doesn't like to be noticed. Hart's an absolute hoot playing a giant linebacker stuck in a diminutive body. And Jack Black... my god, Jack Black is outstanding as a popular teen girl stuck in a middle-aged man's body. He gets the biggest laughs of the film, and wisely never plays the part too broad. He's just perfect, perfect, perfect.It's a genuine surprise just how much fun this film is. I know as a 90's kid myself, I had my standards set high and thought nothing could come close to the original. And I was very pleasantly shocked when I walked out of the theater and realized that in many ways, ""Welcome to the Jungle"" is better than the original. It's sharp. Exciting. Hilarious. It really is the perfect continuation. Sure I could nit-pick the fact that the villainous Van Pelt is a bit under-developed. And I could argue that a few of the effects don't quite work. But on the whole... yeah. If you loved the original, I can't imagine you wouldn't love this stellar sequel just as much if not more.I'm giving ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" an excellent 9 out of 10 for its sheer, infectious fun-factor. Definitely go in with an open mind and give it a shot. Because take it from me... no matter what pre-conceived notions you might have, it'll defy your expectations in the best of ways!","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I honestly probably wouldn't have seen this film (certainly not in theatres) had it not been for a family trip to the movies Christmas day. However, I must say I was pleasantly surprised.
Let me say that this is not a good movie, but neither is it a bad movie. It is ever so slightly above average as far as I am concerned. The plot is essentially ""Breakfast Club"" meets ""Ready Player One"" meets ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"". Four mismatched kids are sent to detention, where they discover a videogame that sucks them into the Amazonian world of Jumanji. They must work together, braving the dangers of the jungle, to return an ostrich-egg-sized jewel with magical properties to the eye socket of a massive Jaguar idol before the villain, Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale, ""Ant-Man""), wraps his evil talons round it.
Jumanji is fast paced, light-hearted, humorous, and, above all, just a ton of fun. It is not anything that will win awards; it didn't break any new ground, it (probably) won't be remembered as a classic in fifteen years, but if you're looking for something fun, this movie might just put a smile on your face. Don't go in expecting to be blown away, but with managed expectations, this film is utterly enjoyable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It starts off exactly where the first one left off which is pretty amazing and awesome but after that great scene then the movie just spirals down to another 5/10 hollywood crap-fest. Filled with cliche moments, forced laughter and such cringe worthy moments I just had to look up into the ceiling because it was really terrible at times. True the movie has it moments and it is funny at times but the main plot is nothing like the original which I saw last week and it still holds up and that is a 8/10 movie even though it has some lame jokes here and there. But it's a truly amazing movie. But when it comes to this one. Sure it is entertaining and The cast is great but the movie is so poorly written and I was sitting there expecting a twist or something cool to happen but it's really lame if you compare it to the first movie which was and still is an amazing movie. The intro and build up of Alan Parrish story which seems like a Stephen King inspired moment, how it is filmed and the style and yeah everything.

It has so many aspects such as comedy, action, fantasy, adventure. The best one is its comedy the movie uses old a new joke that makes the character funny and the cast fits the character very well like the main character is casted by Dwayne Johnson which is considered one of the best comedy actors while in some movies that he cast are comedy and action. Every gesture, every note from The Rock, Kevin Hart and Jack Black are perfection they're no negativity in the movie which make the main casts very comfortable in each of their role. Not to mention it does not abandon its traditional Jumanji movie from the 90s a classic game that turns into reality people who goes into the game. Jumanji welcome to the forest also has a very great story and plot the movie has many plot twist and amazing quality for a movie in 2017 the side character and villain in Jumanji also makes it like a live adventure which refreshes the viewer's mind. There is no boring moment in the movie and the cast very knows they're own character which make it very lively. Although the movie is great in its own element for some people, they need drama which is the most lacking one here although in some cases they are some but most of them are covered by its comedy aspect.Best comedy, action movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is the new version of the very succesful movie from the 90´s.With that being said is not a remake, just to clarify.
Welcome to the Jungle has a twist, the teens get into the bodys of different characters, very different form them.It´s a twist that works, the comedy comes from there and also from the stregths and weaknesses of the characters in the game, which are well developed and inserted making the story go forward and making the movie funny. So, in that way the script is well developed even if it is different obstacles the characters have to pass.
The whole cast does a good job giving they´re one mannerisms into the characters in the game.
It is also worth talking about the entertainmment level, the movie never forgets to be fun, problably the biggest virtue of all.
Regarding the negative aspects of the movie, Bobby Cannavle plays an underappreciated generic villain, and there were moments were the CGI could have been improved.
Jumanji-Welcome to the jungle is a well developed movie, it´s fun, funny, thrilling and surprisingly touching by the end.7.1/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This one was frustrating because its not the worst film I have seen but I would not look to this film for a laugh or enjoyment of any sort, it's just another project on DJ's CV, he's got his star on the walk of fame now, he can just hang up the towel now.

This version turns the magical board game into a magical video game transporting the players into the game itself. With that, it is a film about children in the bodies of adults (the adults being their in-game avatars), the adults being famous people. The famous people include Dwayne ""The Rock'' Johnson (wrestler turned actor who appeared in films like Scorpion King, DC League of Super Pets, and Black Adam), Kevin Hart (comedian and actor who often co-stars with The Rock), Jack Black (actor who did roles in School of Rock, Tropic Thunder, and the Super Mario Bros Movie), and Karen Gillan (Nebula in the MCU). With that, it is pretty much a comedy, though the humor could have some mild cheesiness.It is way more of an action/adventure than Robin's version. It leans into the action even more that it is rated PG-13 rather than having the predecessor's PG rating. It also takes place in the jungle setting and the 1995 version has the jungle coming to the players' town and not them being brought to the jungle. I have watched the 1995 version before but it has been a little while since I had seen it but still, it seems hard to beat anything comical from Robin Williams.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

My jaw hurt from laughing so much at Jack Black playing a selfie-obsessed teenage girl!

Dudes with bulging muscles and women in skintight clothes baring their midriff."" Oh wait, no I didn't.Hollywood needs to go back to focusing on storytelling, and stop putting all their money into eye candy and special effects. I would have much rather seen Robin Williams reprise his role from the original film (before he passed, obviously), and maybe even Kirsten Dunst. If that wasn't possible, or if the studio wasn't able to stay faithful to the original, then they should have left it alone. Sometimes it's worth it to let something become/remain a classic.In any other industry, if a company is no longer able to innovate or becomes stale, they go under. Clearly, Hollywood is out of ideas. They are constantly recycling and rebooting existing films and franchises, not all of which need it. Maybe we should start letting some of these studios fail.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The older version, because of its originality, had a good mix of fun, excitement and visual treat. I watched the newer version anticipating it to be the better version of the original idea, but got disappointed. While Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a good entertainment, it lacks the excitement and surprise factors that original movie presented. The plot begins in a very similar manner to the older version but instead of a board game, we see an electronic version of Jumanji. The movie progresses with the characters getting sucked in the game's reality to accomplish the challenge posed by the game's plot. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart successfully carry the responsibility of entertaining the audience but the story-line doesn't allow the characters to be memorable. The movie contains a few scattered pieces of good entertainment that makes you laugh. Like the original version, new Jumanji carries many special effects and welcomes you to the Jungle as name suggests. But we are in the year 2017 - I expected a bit more from the visual effects.
Overall, it's a good entertainer but is just an incremental improvement from the original version.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Rock may not be a great actor, but he saves it with utter charm, and Jack Black as a teenage girl could have gone wrong in so many ways, but it just works.
If I have a criticism, it has to be the main villain, who is just rather forgettable, but in a movie this charming and fun its a minor gripe.

The 2017 film has the same premise, except this time it's not a board game, but a video game from the 90's.Four students at a school receive detentions for different reasons, and end up together having to staple booklets. Spencer (Alex Wolf) discovers an old video game called 'Jumanji', the students set up the game and play it, but end up being sucked in, turning them into the form of the characters they chose. Spencer's character takes the form of Dwayne Johnson. The other characters actors' consist of Karen Gillan, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black. From here onwards, there is non stop fun, action, great humour, and a glorious soundtrack!The premise here really works well. The plot takes unexpected twists and turns that keeps the audience on their toes. But what makes it thrive, is the great chemistry between the actors, in particular Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart; this type of chemistry can't be scripted. The one liners exchanged between both are hilarious and they work really well together. We'll definitely be seeing these two together in more movies in the future. It's not just these two that have great chemistry, Karen Gillan and Jack Black also really fit in with Johnson and Hart. All of them each have their own style and bring something different to the crew, Whether it's Johnson's charisma, Hart's comedy or Gillan's striking looks, there is something for everybody to enjoy in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.And trust me, Karen Gillan isn't just there for her beauty, she's hilarious and a vital asset to the rest of the team. All of her scenes are memorable, whether she's dancing to Big Mountain's Baby, I Love Your Way while beating soldiers up, or taking flirting advice from Jack Black, she's constantly the star among the popular likes of Dwayne Johnson, which demonstrates her strength as an actor if she can outdo The Rock! Her performance is brilliant, and the video game character is a complete opposite to the real life Martha, played by Morgan Turner. In real life she's shy, anxious and unpopular. However in the game she's a complete badass! The way the filmmakers handled each character is really great. The tough Spencer is a nerdy guy in real life. Completely different to Fridge (Kevin Hart) who is a strong, tough, popular football player, but in the game, he's quite cowardly, small and weak. This aspect I really liked.Henry Jackman's score is used really effectively. Every scene benefited with the heart pounding music. In particular, there is a lot of sequences where the tension and suspense is just incredible. The score also resembles the whole jungle premise, making the scenes feel real and not just seem like a movie set. The sound still stayed a reasonable volume and you can still hear the dialogue. In a lot of films, the booming sound is unpleasant, but in Jumanji the music is a great addition to the already-intense scenes.The action was almost non stop. You're on the edge of your seat constantly and there is a great supply of thrills. The action direction was also very good. The lack of shaky-cam worked well, and even when it was used, the scene wasn't ever jarring or jerking. The sequences stayed enjoyable and you CAN actually see what's going on. These types of scenes were also shot brilliantly and the cinematography was simple but effective.There were some instances where a couple of scenes went on for too long however, and the runtime could've been shortened by about fifteen minutes. The pace was also sometimes clunky and jumpy. It rushes the ending but spends too long on a couple of scenes in the second act. However, the majority of the film stays consistent and smooth.There is also a lack of character development, and there are no real arcs to follow. We don't see any of the characters change throughout except for the end scene, but there is no gradual shift of attitude toward each other, they just start off disliking each other one moment; then just start loving each other...The film also suffers from a painfully weak villain, who we learn very little about nor do we know why he's there in the first place. He isn't particularly fear inducing or scary, and is just a complete cruel idiot for no reason whatsoever. The climax is also rushed, underwhelming and a slight let-down.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is great fun and the comedy is brilliant and clever. The actors are excellent and their perfect for their role; they're most definitely likeable! The action is great and so's the chemistry between the characters, but does suffer from typical action clichés, however in the end, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is absolutely great!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought it was a reboot, which I usually don't care for but it's more of a sequel. And like reboots, sequels also often suck but this one doesn't. Not only is it very funny but I thought the acting was pretty good as well; this time Jumanji is a console game and the main characters get pulled into the game and get the body of the avatar they chose but they still have their original personality which doesn't always match the persona of the avatar. So as an actor you have to do a credible impersonation of a fictional personality in the body of another fictional personality. I also liked the fact that they really managed to incorporate a lot of console game features into the movie so it really feels like they are in a game; each player has 3 lives and different strengths and weaknesses, there's a map of the level and the game characters actually resemble those of a real console game. I also loved the fact that put Jack Black in the movie because that guy rocks.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The actors that play the four main characters have fantastic chemistry and impressive comedic timing. Each of them were given a difficult task of playing against type, excluding Kevin Hart who virtually plays the same character you've seen him as in countless other movies. As far as supporting actors go, Bobby Cannavale clearly had a good time playing the villain. The jungle setting provides beautiful scenery, and Kasdan uses CGI relatively sparingly, but rather effectively. The dialogue was hysterically witty, and the fight scenes were well choreographed. The only time the film seemed to drag was in the first twenty minutes before they had entered the game. Regardless, that's a somewhat minute problem for a film that more than makes up for the slow setup in the ensuing ninety minutes.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The cast are largely playing against type; the interplay between the characters is fun; the set pieces are inventive and silly. However, this movie is predictable with a very linear plot and only moments of jeopardy for the characters. Any situation they find themselves in, they immediately dig themselves out of, and we kind of know what's going to happen before they do.The introduction to the real-life version of the characters, before the Jumanji-world scenes is long and drawn out, most likely a misguided attempt to make us appreciate the resolution of their character journeys, which is predictable and superficial.It's hard to know who this is really aimed at, with a blend of teen humour and simplistic kids' movie action.That said, it romps along, has plenty of action and CGI that looks like CGI, but you don't really care, and gives a modern twist to the original Jumanji concept.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fun adventure film with hilarious characters that works in every way. I will be honest; I was not a fan of the original movie - it freaked me out as a child. But the new film minimized the horror elements of Jumanji and focused more on adventure and humor. This time instead of a board game, Jumanji has morphed into a video game that sucks its unsuspecting victims into its deadly world. Welcome to the Jungle leans into all the video game tropes with hilarious results with jokes about skills, lives, NPCs, boss battles, and more. The movie is at its best with all the humor surrounding the body-swapped teens dealing with the game's characters they now inhabit - the skinny nerd becoming the muscular hero, the jock becoming a tiny sidekick, and the funniest of all, the pretty popular girl becoming Jack Black (who is the real stand out of the film).

Unless they do this, they'll never leave the game.Good fun. Fairly original - real life people being transported into a video game, and ending up as video game characters with abilities and weaknesses and a certain number of lives. The video game setting works well and the plot is quite seamlessly developed from this premise. The disparities between the real lives of the people and their in-game characters makes for some very interesting and often amusing scenes. Very funny at times.Good action scenes and CGI too.Entertaining.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film is set up so well that it does not feel like another copy of Jumanji, but instead its own original plot. The cast is paired so well, the movie is easy to stay interested in their hilarious connection that keeps its audience laughing. The cast accurately captures their roles as high school students from many social stances.

It could've easily been an awful disaster, but I am happy to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this modern interpretation of Jumanji.
This movie knows exactly what it is and doesn't take itself too seriously, has good pacing and the perfect balance of action to character development. I was also surprised to see the amount of attention to detail, every plot is resolved by the end of the movie along with a majority of questions that you could ask. I thought the concept of the characters was interesting and unique and was utilized very well.Additionally, if you've spent the past 22 years wondering what happened at the beach after the credits of Jumanji rolled, worry not, you will get your answer.This sequel/spiritual successor has the perfect amount of nods and tie-in's into the original lore and handles that mission just as good as Jurassic World.Overall a good action adventure story with a moral purpose and a core message.This is a fun pop-corn filled roller-coaster ride for any age. It's the kind of movie that you can join mid-way while flipping through the channels and stay tuned until the end. It doesn't quite have the magic of the original but maybe that's just because I'm getting old or maybe it's because the one and only Robin Williams isn't with us anymore.You definitely can't go wrong with this one so feel free to take your kids/girlfriend/family to go see it. I promise you that you won't hate it as much as Star Wars (but that's a review for next week).I give ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" a solid 7.5 out of 10.P/S 
The original Jumanji is actually criminally under-rated and somehow holds a minuscule 50% on Rotten Tomatoes.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The average person shouldn't be going around watching movies which have no original ideas, I mean you look at something like suicide squad, a great movie btw, and you realize that nothing like that has never been done before. I mean everything about it was original and compared to jumango, or what ever the name for this movie is, you realize that it is just a movie trying to be funny by reusing every joke ever heard. Overall the acting was sub par the worst by far being Jack Black. I had high hopes for him after his performance in Goose Bumps but man he really feel apart i guess. When it comes down to it I would say that if you do see this movie try to sneak in to as to avoid giving another unoriginal movie money.","10 out of 31 found this helpful.

While we have seen some really bad films come from that, we've yet to really see one that put in the time and effort to make it worth while. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle tries to step into the ring and surprisingly keeps a great level of energy even most comedies this year haven't been able to achieve.The film takes place in modern day as Jumanji the board game has evolved into a shape of a Atari like cartridge console and is discovered by 4 high school students while in detention. The teenagers decide to start the game as a time passer, and soon realize they get sucked into the video game and become the characters they have chosen. So in order to get out the game, they have to take the jewel to a high mountain and not lose all 3 of their lives in the process.Jumanji takes alot of elements from video game nature, even down to how NPC's (non-playable characters) operate and still able to get the viewer up to speed even if you don't play video games. The film also has a great kinetic energy when it gets into the game mode and never really loses steam. The chemistry between the leads are all really solid, specifically Jack Black playing as the self-centered teenage girl who is even funnier than I would have expected him to be in this kind of role. And for Dwayne Johnson, he's able to carry the uncertain nerd characteristic well, and if you watched him as The Rock during his wrestling days, it makes his ""Smoldering Intensity"" moments that much funnier.As for any setbacks, the villain as about as memorable as any other video game villain. He doesn't have any interesting backstory and doesn't give the characters much of a challenge either. Also while all the other characters are able to play their counterparts well, Kevin Hart feels like he is playing Kevin Hart, despite his teenage character not sharing that similarity.In many ways, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a studio mandated cash-in on a familiar property, but at the same time, is able to have fun with itself. The energy is the right mix of dumb and fun, even at the same time and it's able to be a better video game adaptation than a lot of the one's we've gotten in recent history. This might not be a film remembered 10-20 years from now, but it will definitely suck you in as soon as you press Start.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now normally people reserve their first review to make sweeping negative statements on films they've just seen, or to rave about something while it's still fresh in their head and they're still full of that post-cinema buzz.This review is neither, and is more for me to make some honest remarks about a film I enjoyed, but later found it to have to unnecessary criticisms on these pages.I am no ""critique"" and when I go to see such films, I appreciate that a little bit of your brain should be switched off in order to just enjoy these films for what they are. You shouldn't be expecting Oscar performances, or epic twists etc. if you are expecting that, you shouldn't waste your time with these types of films. Why go see this film at all if that is your mindset? You do kind of know what you're getting yourself in to right?Secondly, while this film shares it's name with the original, I wouldn't put it down as a remake, rather, it's much more of a modern interpretation/adaptation. So I wouldn't really compare the old and new films directly - although people will continue to do so.So with the above in mind, this IS a good fun, action/comedy film that I think all of the family would enjoy. What I will say is that some of the humour was a bit flat and forgetful and that the general pacing was too fast. The way each character discovered their abilities for example was lame and really felt like it hadn't been given much thought. Considering this was, for myself at least, one of the main attractions of a modern Jumanji made out to be like a video game, this was a massive opportunity wasted and would have really clicked with the more nerdy members of the audience, such as myself, had they just given this area more thought. The ending was a bit cheesy, even for the cheesiest of folk, although I have to admit it did give me that happy warm feeling you sometimes get, so I won't complain too much.If you want a classic 2 hours of popcorn busting fun which doesn't have to be taken seriously at all - go and give it a watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The writing is mostly good and the actors are good, though this movie is really a Jack Black show. The guy completely steals the show, playing a superficial girl stuck inside a guy's body, which may be a little too silly to some.The action sequences and the physics throughout the movie do not make a whole lot of sense, but the movie of course always has the excuse that the whole thing is a game and is not supposed to make too much sense.The weak parts of the film are the beginning and the end, but especially the beginning, where the movie rushes through the introductions without any impact, in order to get to the main part as fast as possible. If you are watching the movie with other people, it may be easy to get distracted and talk during the very beginning and thus miss a few things.This movie is unlikely to occupy your mind long after you have seen it, but it is still a lot of fun.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Now, instead of fearing Jumanji, the audience must want to become a character in the game, since you become a great hero and gain superpowers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6544527/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","30 January 2021","Produced by Columbia Pictures, Matt Tolmach Productions, Radar Pictures and Seven Bucks Productions and distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment, this sequel to the classic Jumanji (1995) stars Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan and Nick Jonas. Always remembered for the special effects and wild animals that the evil game brought to the real world, the 1995 feature brought a mixture of comedy and suspense that sets the tone of adventure of the 1990s. More than 20 years later, the franchise is reborn without this footprint, more frantic, with few animals, video game aesthetics and focused on comedy.In Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, four teenagers find a video game that takes place in a tropical forest. Excited about the game, they choose their avatars for the challenge, but an unexpected event causes them to be transported into the fictional universe, becoming the characters of the adventure.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, thankfully, it doesn't usually appeal to cheap nostalgia or try to remind you, on a recurring basis, that this is a sequence from a 90's movie. The feature has a microcosm and a tone that is partly its own, more like current comedies than Robin Williams' Jumanji - which can be a problem depending on your expectations. The new version distances itself a lot from the original work of Chris Van Allsburg, author of the book, and only keeps small references, just to justify the definition as a sequel, and to attract the older audience that watched the original. In its second version, Jumanji is no longer a board game. In fact, the game received an update and was transformed into a video game to suit the new generation. Unlike the original film, Welcome to the Jungle is divided into two very distinct parts: one presenting the characters in the real world and the other with their respective avatars within the video game.When announced it was the fact that now, the characters would enter Jumanji through a video game, breaking all the magic of the original board. Fortunately, even this has been well worked out and the transition from one format to another is well justified, showing that Jumanji is a game that does everything to be played. In the first half hour, director Jake Kasdan quickly introduces the four characters in a fun and light rhythm, reminiscent of excerpts from The Club of Five and Mean Girls, with their respective defects established right away (and consequent defined arcs) will enter a unforgettable journey when they go to detention and end up with an updated version of Jumanji. By selecting different characters, each of the young people will be transported to the Jumanji universe and there will undergo transformations that will change their perspectives on who they are and what roles they have in real life. First of all, however, the goal will be to save that jungle from the fearsome Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), an extremely generic and boring villain who, inexorably, ends up becoming a parody of himself, clearly unintentionally.After the presentation of the real world characters, unlike the original film, the narrative structure throws us into the jungle that Alan Parrish, played by the late Robin Williams, was transported during those 26 years, without bringing, as previously done, the jungle to the real life. If the same event were repeated, we would certainly lose all the margin of originality that could be achieved, while here we have a story that deepens the forest and brings with it a sense of novelty, even exploring known narrative paths. This also opens up possibilities for Alan Parrish himself, and, of course, his interpreter, to be lightly honored with an exciting score. In the essence of Welcome to the Jungle, this is a continuation that pays tribute to the splendid figure that was Williams, in terms of his smiles and celebrations.In Jumanji's jungle, the best idea of the script is to notice how the roles are reversed creating good opportunities for humor: real-life nerds become Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) and Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillian), the strong characters of the game. Popular people receive support avatars: the athlete is reduced to playing Bravestone biologist and henchman, Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart), while the girl adored at school enters the shoes of cartographer Shelly Oberon (Jack Black). The artifice of changing the body gives good material for the actors to play with and most of the initial jokes work with it. It's fun to see The Rock surprise itself with its muscles and not knowing how to act in battle, but Jack Black is the one who steals the show in the film. Playing a selfish girl, the actor creates very funny mannerisms and delivers a comic interpretation in the right measure, with conscious exaggerations that amuse and almost never fall into the shame of others - something that could easily happen to such a character.The comedy varies greatly in both tone and quality. The duo The Rock and Kevin Hart head the film with the same kind of comedy we saw in One and a Half: lots of jokes with the difference in size of the two, Hart screaming thin in trouble, jokes with sexual organs and so on. Although not bad, the duo is the weakest comic part of the feature. Gillian's character, who generated a lot of controversy when appearing in the film's publicity photos in very short clothes, has her moments and the girl's constant dissatisfaction with the provocative look of her avatar develops a criticism of the objectification of the woman's figure in games and entertainment as a whole (Tomb Raider's reference to Lara Croft is obvious). The actress knows how to be funny, beautiful and sensual as few can.While focusing on comedy, the new Jumanji forgets a little about the action. When he does, he is unable to provide scenes that are impactful or stay with the viewer until the end of the film. The idea really doesn't seem to stick to explosions, chases or fights - the whole action part of Welcome to the Jungle is in the background. And if there is a fan of the original feature who appreciates Joe Johnston's suspense, it will come out disappointed. The proposal here is to be a light adventure, uncompromised and directed towards comedy. In addition, the missions are not very well built, and the story is beyond forgettable, with a predictable and formulaic ending, obeying the rules of limited lives and skills / weaknesses in a bureaucratic way. In parallel to the villainous blasé of Cannavale, it is interesting that much of the character's background is given through the cut scenes already mentioned.The film can be as predictable as you might think. The plot of the film does what it needs, it takes the characters from point A to point B, and that's all you need to do. The fact that the characters are jokingly trapped in a video game, not taking themselves seriously. There are many moments when Chris McKenna's script has fun with basic clichés that only make sense in games. The film laughs at cut scenes entering and leaving the characters confused, NPC dialogues purposely expository to play with the way video game characters are written, among several other virtuous games with the media.Although it does not take itself seriously, the work sins in several points: the villain is bad, there is no development and much less a motivation besides ""taking over the world"". Many jokes are repeated over and over, which makes the mood tiring at times; the writers also don't seem to believe in the viewer's ability and explain extremely basic things about the plot countless times and in the silliest ways possible. The script takes many unnecessary turns, to the point that unfounded challenges are created in the final half of the film. The few moments when they try to create a dramatic arc are also meager - and Nick Jonas' acting as Alex doesn't help. Every part where the film tries to create a meaningful relationship for the virtual characters is shallow and poorly developed and that is a huge problem in the outcome of the film.Jumanji is a symbol of childhood for many and with the reboot it should continue to be, now for a new generation. Only the name, the game and one or another creature are kept from the original. Jumanji's continuation is, above all, a pleasant surprise, extremely fun, with a wittiness that refers to both the original film and the modern video games. With good action scenes handled by director Jake Kasdan, Welcome to the Jungle is guaranteed fun. Did you need to have the name Jumanji and get hold of an already known brand? No. Unfortunately, the darker tone and the harmless touches of fear that the game brought to the cinema are neglected. Now, instead of fearing Jumanji, the audience must want to become a character in the game, since you become a great hero, gain superpowers and face threats that scare little the most fearful of warriors. The script choices, always following the easiest ways to resolve conflicts, create a film that is unlikely to mark an era, like the original feature film. It is a pastime, clearly unpretentious, which does not trust the intelligence of its viewer at various times. Despite having some Easter eggs from the original 'Jumanji', Jake Kasdan delivers an original adventure that manages to innovate, as well as the title game.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

My favorite though in that year was the Robin William classic, Jumanji. A fantasy adventure based on the 1981 children's book, it featured a board game with a magical twist, along with a typically endearing performance by Robin Williams. Targeting the Christmas holiday crowd, and with rhinos thundering down the streets, it made tons of money, even with relatively rudimentary visual effects. Given the state of VFX today, and the solid demand for good family fun in December, I was surprised that a sequel for Jumanji was not attempted all these years. Oh wait, there was Zathura: A Space Adventure in 2005. Right.Circa Christmas 2017, and we finally have a sequel starring everyone's favorite eyebrow. Set 21 years after the original movie, the premise is slightly different this time. 4 teenagers get sucked into the jungle world of Jumanji, and they need to play as game characters and win to return back home. Sounds simple? Director Jake Kasdan livens things up by getting the teenagers to play avatars that are opposites of the real life characters. So nerdy Spencer Gilpin becomes the heroic Smolder Bravestone played by Dwayne Johnson, jock Fridge becomes wimpy sidekick Franklin Finbar played by Kevin Hart, shy Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse (played by Karen Gillan) who is basically a Lara Croft rip-off, and popular college babe Bethany transforms into overweight cartographer Sheldon Oberon (Jack Black). Throw in hippos, rhinos, elephants, jaguars, and snakes into the mix and bingo you can justify the title. There is of course a villain in the mix, but it is kind of immaterial. This is a family movie, releasing in Christmas, of people playing video game characters, so we all know how it goes.In short, nothing exceptionally original- it is Breakfast Club + 13 going to 30 + Indiana Jones + Jack Black Speaking of Jack Black, he is hilarious as a teenage girl, and we all know that Johnson and Kevin Hart have awesome chemistry- watch Central Intelligence for an even better showcase. The movie is fast paced, the script is funny, the special effects are as good as it gets, but the story lacks imagination, and the characters are way under-developed. True the kids learn something about life by playing different avatars, but that's about it. I kept going back to the original, and by god that was a classic! The game coming into our lives is certainly more interesting than us in a game.Having said that Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a good one time watch. It is innocent, family fun, and that is what the season demands actually.

Each equipped with an unique set of skills but also weaknesses, they must find a way to finish the game before remaining out of lives in order to go back to their own world.It's a movie which follows about the same concept as the original flick, but also improving it in terms of visual effects. The four new characters are very likeable and funny, playing their part very well in the adventure that follows. Their evolution as teenagers and their relationship with one another is also presented in detail, presenting how each is able to overcome his condition with the help of the others. Their part is the most important, very well played by the actors, contributing decisively to the outcome. Using plenty of references to video games, this movie manages to create a very entertaining atmosphere in which the action can take part. Speaking of which, we have plenty of it, exaggerated of course as they are part of a video game, but still very enjoyable.The plot isn't much as far as the game is concerned, but it is good enough to keep it all together and make it a very good all-rounder. It's not predictable or linear, even having a mystery to be guessed, but it's not breath-taking either. It excels though through dialog, character complexity and development, making it very good in this department. The visual effects however are top notch. It truly is a delight for the eyes to see all the action sequences and all other events which are made possible using CGI.It's a movie which I truly enjoyed. It manages to create a good time for its viewers, while having some great actors who play their characters with style. It's not spectacular in terms of story but it makes up through action, suspense, CGI and even a bit of drama.

Kevin Hart, Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black all deliver strong perfromaces you have other actors that stand out, but for the most part the actors mentioned make you laugh the majority of the time. The script was well written and i thought it wasn't disrespectful to Williams and more of a honor thing they were going for.

If you're going to base a film on a classic, then don't just cherry pick the bits you like and throw the rest away!The clever bit about the original - and Chris Van Allsburgs other board game based film; Zathura - was that the action took place in the real world, and how the game would interact with the players actual lives; stampede down main street, big game hunter chasing you, monsoon in the hall. Here, as technology has evolved, so the action takes place inside a computer, yet the game play itself seems to have devolved as the graphics have improved. The NPC's (Non-Player Characters) are supposedly just programmed to interact with the players in a certain way, no matter what they do. The evil game hunter Van Pelt of the original film has been replaced with a two dimensional Professor Russell Van Pelt, who has been given so much power in the game, it would seem unlikely they could survive if he had the same intelligence as his namesake.It's lucky then that the film is more about the relationships between the main characters than actual peril. Alex Wolff/Dwayne Johnson is Spencer, a stereotypical nerd, who plays video games, is awkward around people and rarely gets into trouble. Ser'Darius Blain/Kevin Hart is Fridge; six foot tall footballer, who needs his friend - despite having been pushing him away - of seven years to do his homework so he can keep on playing. Morgan Turner/Karen Gillan is Martha; a smart but shy wallflower with a self image issue. And Madison Iseman/Jack Black is Bethany; a socially obsessed, shallow girl, who can't live without her phone. And in the game, they basically have to face their insecurities; the nerd becomes confident (and strong), the jock becomes smart (and weak), the wall flower becomes an extrovert and the popular girl becomes Jack Black!This last one is a role Black was born to play; a woman trapped in a mans body. Able to play it as effeminately as he wants, make lots of penis jokes and be self-deprecating about his appearance. You knew that as soon as Bethany was out the game she'd make a comment about how glad she was to be in her body.Just like Fridge moans about being the diminutive Hart, Spencer admiring his muscles and Martha questioning her wardrobe choices. All things you'd question if you found yourself in a polar opposite situation and had to adapt.The CGI and film locations are - as expected in the modern era - great, though this seems wrong, given the rudimentary level of the NPC's. They could have had something badly rendered or other throwback to the vintage of the game.It's a good premise, with a strong take away message for the kids, just wish they'd played with the video game premise a little bit more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I hadn't planned on watching it as it looked ridiculous, but I must say it was actually fun. The wife and I had a blast watching the movie.Following in the footsteps of the original Jumanji, a group of teenagers get stuck in the Jumanji world after playing the game. This time around to add a modern spin they get stuck in a video game world with multiple lives and all. The humor of the movie, while by no means smart was a lot of fun. It did throw a round some juvenile sex jokes and a repetition of a few comedy tropes but otherwise I found myself laughing quite a bit. They did a good job utilizing the video game concept to incorporate character skills and to add more humor with the concept of dying frequently. Without spoiling anything one of the funniest scenes involves a character's weakness to cake and explosions. Utterly ridiculous but fun.Acting wise the movie isn't going to win any awards, but I thoroughly enjoyed the character interactions. Who doesn't love The Rock, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black. All three had great back-and-forth interactions with each other.The movie was a nice mix of comedy, action, an over-the-top ridiculous. It Is by no means a smart movie, and at times a bit too juvenile. Assuming you're able to turn off your thinking caps when viewing it is a fun ride.

So I guess he was destined to star in the Jumanji remake.I admit this movie was generally enjoyable, but it remains superficial and predictable. Four teenagers get sucked into a game and have to do some kind of dangerous mission - a bit of a twist from the original Robin Williams movie, which I enjoyed a lot as a kid.Part of the problem is that we care more about the stars inside the game who are more famous and better actors than the teens in the real world. It's mildly amusing at first to see the teens react to their new bodies, but we quickly forget their original personalities. Jack Black is so good at acting feminine that I no longer found it funny and just accepted him as a ""hot girl"" in Jack Black's body.The dynamic of being in a video game with weird rules, like multiple lives, could have been explored more. There are some clever ideas but ultimately the movie falls back onto familiar cliches.Some of the action is pretty cool, but a lot of it is CGI and never feels quite real. Maybe that fits the plot, but it does mean it's less thrilling than if they did more stunts.All 4 main actors are good but the material doesn't really stretch them. It's nice to see Karen Gillan when she isn't blue and half metal. Kevin Hart is funny but only really has one note to play in this movie.Comedy action movies like this need a heart to transcend being average and forgettable. Jumanji doesn't pull that off. In fact, the values are questionable. Maybe they wanted to show that looks and status aren't everything, but the movie actually seems to reinforce that - The Rock is the hero because he's the biggest and Gillan uses her hotness to distract enemies.They simply become the cliches of the main characters rather than having their personalities shine through. It trivialises intelligence and personal achievement, as if looks and strength are just categories to be lucky enough to be born with, rather than things you can develop.Anyway, it was an okay diversion compared to most movies. But it missed the opportunity to be something special.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Beating it's drums, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle rolls into a new decade with a true video game story thats entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4021699/?ref_=tt_urv","RforFilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv","2 January 2018","Roll the dice. Say the poem. Run from the animal. Repeat. This is exactly the plot from the 1995 family fantasy Jumanji. On the one hand its simple, but on the other, it makes for a fast paced concept, that's ironically slower then you'd imagine. But surrounding it, is a story about facing your fears, growing up, and finishing something you started. Jumanji was one of my favorites as a child...and still is as an adult. A lot of that steams from Robin William's performance, which is more subtle then usual, and that the movie is genuinely scary. I even remember reading critical reviews that complained on how scary Jumanji was for children, but I think adults underestimate just how much children can take. So when it was announced that a sequel was being made, that generated a lot of responses, including how Robin Williams death makes continuing the story unnecessary. There is truth to that, and I'd be lying if I wasn't a skeptic. It changed when I found out that the characters were going into the game. Believe it or not, this is partially the plot for the Jumanji animated series from the nineties (which is pretty good if you can find it). So let's see if Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is just as entertaining. In the modern era, a group of high school kids are given detention. We have a hyprocondriac nerd Spencer (played by Alex Wolff), a sports jock footballer Anthony ""Fridge""(played by Ser'Darius Blain), a self centered Instagram star Bethany (played by Madison Iseman) and the shy bookworm Martha (played by Morgan Turner). While working, the kids find an old game console (think Nintendo 64) along with a playable game Jumanji. When they decide to play, they all select the chareters they want, and they get sucked into the game.Waking up in a jungle, the kids find they have changed into their chosen characters. Spencer is now Dr. Smolder Bravestone (played by Dwayne Johnson), Anthony is a zoologist Franklin ""Mouse"" (played by Kevin Hart), Martha is now a commando Ruby Roundhouse (played by Karen Gillan), and Bethany is Professor Sheldon (played by Jack Black). They find that if they want to escape, they have to finish the game of returning a jewel to a mountain. They also find that they have to succumb to the rules of video games...including that if they die three times, it's game over for good.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle succeeds in two areas. First, it does feel like an expansion of the world of Jumanji. I like that they show that the animals are just as intimidating...if not more, as they can be possessed. They have villages, airports, and of course, various enemies that are what's you'd expect from video games. Secondly, the movie works as a video game movie. The script makes a lot of jokes when it comes to how they work. Certain characters repeat information; our heroes know things will only get harder towards the end, and they even have certain weaknesses. The best part about this movie isn't even the jungle, but our main actors. That's because since their just video game avatars, guys like Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan play against their typical roles. Jack Black gets a lot of laughs as he plays up the idea that he's just a teenage girl on the inside. The only one whose playing himself is Kevin Hart, who doesn't do enough to act like a football player whose now shorter. But regardless, it was fun to see these four make the journey into the jungle, making this a lot like an Indiana Jones movie. The film does fall in certain areas. First of all, I was worried by the intro as I thought it was terrible. We get a scene of the Jumanji board game change itself into a video game just so people would play it (does it even know what video games are?). The high school parts are pretty stock. Just bland geeks, bland jocks, bland teachers, bland lockers, bland everything! It's clear that the storywriters cared more about the jungle sequences then school. I'll also say that parts of the film can be a little too heavy CGI (though it's a big step up from the effects of the original Jumanji), but it lacks a lot of the scares from the old movie that I loved. Oh well.I'll give this seven Jumanji board games out of ten. I'll admit that I was surprised by what I did enjoy out of this. It's different from before, but I'd rather have the sequel take more chances then to do a rehash. Families and fans of the original Jumanji will find plenty to like.

"7","/10","A Fun Ride For Fans Of The Original","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4022449/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","3 January 2018","It has been over 20 years since the release of the original Jumanji, and quite honestly, I never once thought about ever needing a sequel or revamp of that classic material. I mean, just over ten years ago we saw a great little film in Zathura, so I had my fill of this type of movie. That being said, I never thought I'd be writing a review that tells people to go out and see a film that completely altered what the original film was, but here I am. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a really fun time at the movies. I won't be comparing it to the original because they both fit their times. Although it's not without its issues, here's why I believe Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle deserves to be seen in theatres.Being a fan of the original film, I wasn't too keen on the video game aspect that this sequel was injecting into the franchise, but it really worked for me in the context of the story. As the film follows four very generically-stereotyped characters in Spencer, Fridge, Bethany, and Martha, they find themselves stuck in detention after school hours. Coming across an old video game console, they plug it into the television and are sucked into the world of Jumanji. Yes, the question everyone will be asking is how the board game is now a video game, but the movie does a solid job in nodding to the fans about that.After being sucked into the game, they become the avatars they chose. The characters, played by Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan are all fantastic here, playing though they're still their outside selves. This aspect is what makes the movie worth it because it allows them to discover new things about themselves, either giving them bravery or realizing life is just fine for them in the outside world. The morals of the story and the climax itself has been seen in thousands of movies throughout the years, but it's all about how a movie is executed these days, and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle sucks you in with these characters and provides a very fun adventure, for the most part.This film asks you to pretend that you're actually in a video game with these characters, so repetitive dialogue from secondary characters can become hilarious if you're thinking with that mindset, but also odd for those who are unfamiliar with video games. This brings me to my biggest negative about this movie, because a video game follows either one or multiple characters at the same time, making discoveries along the way. A video game never cuts away to show other plot-lines forming, but this movie does feel like an actual movie at times, cutting away to the villain of the story, who's also the weakest aspect of it as well.The villain, played by Bobby Cannavale (who I'm actually a huge fan of as an actor), is far too over-the-top in this role, which can be funny at times, but it feels out of place when placing random scenes of him and his henchmen throughout the movie. Personally, this portion of the film annoyed me and I couldn't wait to get back to the central characters.In the end, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is fun for fans of the original, providing winks and nods to the first film throughout the movie, as well as providing a fun adventure for all newcomers. From bumping into characters like Alex (Nick Jonas) in order to add some emotional aspects, to having some pretty cool action sequences, to providing humor that both adults and kids can laugh at, I didn't have any glaring issues with the film itself, aside from the incredibly annoying villain subplot. Overall, although not complex in the slightest, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fun time at the movies, plain and simple.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was certainly surprised that Jumanji became such a hit despite all the factors working against it from the start. It managed to out-gross SpiderMan: Homecoming, Justice League and even Wonder Woman. How did it get so big? I think it's all to do with it being a retroactive video game film, that respects and loves video games without BEING a film based off one in the first place.How does Jumanji hold up against the stack of other family-friendly films that have come out during this decade? I reckon it's got some legs in terms of audience appeal and longstanding on home video. It certainly helps with the nostalgia factor people have for the original Jumanji.You want brisk family entertainment that's essentially a family-friendlier Indiana Jones movie but from Sony? Jumanji is that movie. Go ahead; it's good fun all on its own anyway.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The actors playing the ""Jumanji characters"" such as The Rock are doing so very well and very comedic about it.This film is a success, unlike many other Hollywood B films which take themselves seriously whilst being bad.

I was very excited as the first movie was a big hit for me and I had really enjoyed it. Because of this, I had very high hopes going into the theater.The 4 main characters are sent to detention where they find a videogame changed from a board game that sucks them into it. To get out they have to play the game as a regular video game as their avatars, and not die while doing so. Dwayne Johnson is very well known and has a lot of credit in movies, but in this one he didn't have that click that he always does, perhaps because he was playing a nerdy kid. Kevin Hart's character was funny and entertaining to keep up with, and laughs went all around the theater when he cracked jokes. But Karen Gillan and Jack Black really kept the amusement going. Karen Gillan played another nerdy character but showed extraordinary character devolpment in a hilarious way. Jack Black was a gem as usual. He played a popular teenage girl with classic high school problems, and this really clicked for me.Meanwhile, I had also hoped that there would be some ties back to the first film in 1995, but unfortunately there were not many, only a couple here and there. Something that disappointed my inside kid was the fact that this board game changed into a video game, it didn't seem very realistic and I believe there could have been a lot of success if they had kept it as a board game and been sucked into there the same way Alan Parrish was.Either way, the film was entertaining for what it was and I would recommend for all who enjoy action with a touch of comedy!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

'Jake, find some whiskey, will you,' he said, and when I came back with Jack Daniel's and shot glasses and started to pour, Grandpa pulled over another stool. 'Make room, men,' he said. 'This might as well be the night.'""Some stories open with an initiation rite-as here did Frank Baldwin, *Jake & Mimi* (New York: Little, Brown & Co., 2002, 161.) In ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" the 1996 night goes to teenage beachcomber Alex (Nick Jonas) after discovering a strange board game in the sand and disappearing when he plays it.""'Nobody misses the war, boy,' he said. 'You understand?' I nodded. ... Every glass of beer was your last. Every letter home. So you got drunk any chance you could. And when you wrote, you made your words count. ... It isn't the war you miss. It's the spirit of those days. Some of us, who got lucky and lived through it, learned how to live. Like we'd be gone tomorrow. Because a lot of us were.' He looked at me. 'You got me, boy?' I nodded. 'Okay, then,' he said gently. ... 'Find something that gives you that charge, Jake. That fires your blood.'"" (Ibid., 164.)Four students at Brantford High School, Spencer the nerd, Fridge the jock, Bethany the fox, and Martha the wallflower, are given detention and admonished to, ""Think about who you are at this moment of time and who you want to be."" Getting bored with their assigned task, they pick up the board game Jumanji and start playing its electronic version.The word *jumanji* can be rearranged thus: break it in two to get Juman-ji. Migrate the 'm' in the middle to the end thus: Juan-Jim. Juan has an alter ego Jim. Each player will discover himself in a game avatar unlike his real life persona. Jumanji having a funny time line, and Alex having a twenty year jump on the others, turns it into a metaphor for living as their adult selves to come, or at least to think about it. As often happens upon graduation the nerd suddenly finds himself in a strong position career-wise, while the football jock's a has-been, to become somebody's lackey. However, in Fridge's case he discovers his calling (zoology), not history that was never his forte. Bethany who was a total manipulator of men now experiences life in a male body, with all its excitable equipment. She'll learn the value of friendship. Martha has game strengths involving martial arts and dancing, good disciplines to develop one's self confidence that was all this babe-in-the-making needed.The game portion of ""Jumanji"" borrows heavily in its graphics from Daniel 2 in the Bible. There was ""a great image... and the form thereof was terrible"" (31). There was a powerful king, ""the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven ... given into thine hand"" (38). In Daniel ""a stone was cut out without hands"" (34) which will eventually smite the image; in ""Jumanji"" a jewel was plucked by hand out of the image's eye socket, which needs to be replaced. The image in Daniel does the same disappearing act as do the Jumanji players when they're transformed: ""like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them"" (35). The story in Daniel 2 represented a great prophesy, but in Jumanji it's just a matter of thinking through life decisions when on the cusp of adulthood. Daniel and his three friends (17) had to interpret the king's dream in order to get themselves out of their ""detention"" unscathed.The story seemed to me pretty juvenile, but then that was the intended audience. The CGI was none too subtle. The tom-toms work well if there's lots of bass in the sound system. The black mamba snake was more realistic in ""Kill Bill"" than in this movie. Spencer comes out with the occasional Yiddishism (""Oy veh!"") Jack Black was adorable playing a female in a male body. Dwayne Johnson struggles to play against type. The rest of the acting was okay; they weren't challenging parts.There are two serpentine lip-action scenes you'll likely want to forget--if you can--of the I've-never-done-this-before variety. Good close-ups if you can force your eyes to remain open.It was based a children's book. It's good kiddy fun.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This version takes a more modern twist and has the kids in a video game instead of the board game. The foursome is a typical Breakfast Club like group of a jock, a nerd, a beauty queen and a social outcast that doesn't realize that she's pretty all in for a detention. Their job on detention is to clean up a storage room in the basement of the school. They soon stumble over an old video game system and all 4 get sucked into the game.Hilarity ensues as they all end up as opposite characters in the game than the really are. The nerd becomes The Rock, the jock ends up being 5 ft nothing Kevin Hart, the beauty queen is Jack Black and the social outcast a hot Lara Croft type character in skimpy clothing. They have to work together to make it out of the game and back home. Lots of laughs along the way in this very entertaining film","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The rest of the cast added their humour as well which just made it an amazingly funny movie overall. It's not one that is so focused on the plot as much as it is just being plain funny, which is alright with me and great for anyone looking for a good laugh.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Which essentially made the movie not overly reliant on being a CGI special effects galore.I was initially a bit concerned about having Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black in a movie such as this, but they actually carried the movie quite nicely.If you enjoyed the original ""Jumanji"" movie then you definitely should take the time to watch ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"".","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This reboot has four teenagers being transported into the video game world of Jumanji, and they must beat the game (playing as the game characters they chose) in order to escape it. The film stars Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, Nick Jonas and Bobby Cannavale. It was directed by Jake Kasdan, and it was written by Kasdan, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner. The Box Office hopeful has received mostly positive reviews from critics, but I found it to be pretty routine and mostly a bore. Four teenagers are put into detention together, and assigned to cleanup the basement of their school. While doing so, they find a video game called Jumanji, and decide to play it. The teens are then transported into the game, and become the characters they picked to play. They soon learn that in order to escape the game, and return home, they have to beat it.The film is mildly amusing, because of it's cast primarily, but all of the lead actors can do so much better than this (and I wish The Rock would stop doing silly kids movies like this too, and do more serious action flicks instead). Other than the cast though, there's little to no redeeming qualities in the whole movie, and it's mostly just a bore. It should entertain kids at least though, and it could be a decent family flick to see for Christmas (there's still much better out there though).","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

"8","/10","One of the few standalone sequels that is better than the original!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9802114/?ref_=tt_urv","jph-65157","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur158656882/?ref_=tt_urv","22 May 2024","Okay, so first off, before anyone says anything, I just want to clarify something: I do like the original Jumanji. The story, the action/adventure, the visual effects and of course, Robin Williams is what made that one a classic and it always will be.Now, as for Welcome to the Jungle: the premise is about four high schoolers who get sucked into the world of Jumanji (much like how Alan Parish did in the first one) and become avatars within the game. As a team and using their avatars' traits/abilities, they have to work together and play through the game in order to complete the game's mission and return to the real world. After seeing this, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this turned out to be. To be honest, I was not expecting it to be all that good, but have to admit, it was quite enjoyable and in quite a few cases, an improvement over its original source material.First off, I think the premise was pretty cool. Instead of the board game premise, having the game be a videogame is a little more interesting and a little more up to date. Plus, it adds more features to the game that the regular board game did not have (i.e. When a avatar dies, they only lose a life and get revived, and the avatars have traits/abilities is pretty cool too). Also, having all the main characters, instead of just one, get sucked into the game and being an avatar within the game is pretty cool too and makes the storyline more interesting as well, as they have to learn to adapt to their character. Lastly, there were some pretty cool twists that you didn't really see coming and made the plot more interesting than the original as well.Secondly, the humor was pretty good and hilarious as well. Yes, the original had its humorous moments (especially with Robin Williams), but here, it was a little more present and made the movie more enjoyable. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart are obviously great as their characters' avatars as they always are, especially when it came to them bashing each other (both verbally and physically!), but Jack Black was probably the biggest standout of them all. Having him pretend to be a spoiled teenage girl whose avatar is an older man in the game itself was a genius move. I swear, I never laughed so hard at Black in a while for that goofy performance and personally, I think this role is what made him funny in live action roles again (he's great in the Kung Fu Panda movies, but those are voiceover roles, and he hasn't been in a good live action role in a while, in my opinion). Also, Karen Gillan was pretty good too playing the awkward character of the group and kudos to her for giving comedy a try. Nick Jonas was pretty funny too, especially when his character made some old fashion jokes (that's explained in the movie). So definitely, I thought the humor was better in Welcome to the Jungle than the original, though that was probably intentional as the first movie was meant to be more of a drama.Also, the action/adventure aspect was done pretty well too. Having more characters and more battles is what made this movie more exciting and intense. Sure, there were not as many animal encounters as the original and there were more human encounters, but still, when the avatars encountered any predators, it was pretty cool and done well. Plus, having it all take place inside the game is what I think allowed for more battles, rather than in the real world, and works out better. Additionally, the villain (played by Bobby Cannavale) is pretty cool too and to be honest, a bit more interesting and sinister than Van Pelt, as he does not just shoot a gun all the time!Lastly, I like the fact that this was more light-hearted than the original as well. Kinda going back to what I mentioned earlier, this one is more of a comedy rather than a drama and that works out perfectly here. This is also where I have a bit of a qualm with the original: the drama made it a little gloomy. Yes, Robin Williams does add humor and lighten the mood of that, but some moments are just kind of depressing, dark, or too intense (i.e. Alan's bad relationship with his father, Judy and Peter's parents being dead from accident, Peter nearly getting crushed by an elephant and nearly swallowed whole by an alligator, and Van Pelt shooting at Alan recklessly and nearly shooting others). Here, with Welcome to the Jungle, I personally thought the writers/producers did a great job of making this more family friendly and more enjoyable and already having a light-hearted tone that makes everyone feel comfortable and engaged in the story/adventure.I could go over more details, but those were the main points that I wanted to cover about why I liked about Welcome to the Jungle. I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece per say, but it's still quite enjoyable and exciting and worth a watch. Now, I still do like the original Jumanji for sure, but Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is definitely one of those rare standalone sequels that works and is an improvement over the original source and if you have not seen the movie yet after all these years, I recommend you watch it and you will more than likely enjoy yourselves.P. S. - The tribute that Welcome to the Jungle does for Robin Williams was a nice touch and shows some good respect for the original movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

As a family film it ticks all the boxes it needs to. The humour works on all of the necessary levels and kept the children completely engrossed in the entire adventure. 
A couple of nods to the story of the previous movie keep things on track, although everything happens a little too quickly in the very early scenes.

He made King Kong (2005) bearable, and was perfect in Tropic Thunder, and I liked the semi-serious turn in The Holiday. Here like in most of his films, he helps with the comic turns but in an usual way that almost makes this his movie. Kevin Hart plays Kevin Hart. The Rock likewise plays the Rock. In this turn the game is amped up to being a video game but you know the drill. It's a pretty much mindless romp that I would have waited to see on HBO or Netflix but that a friend had passes. I guess I am tired of CGI and loud booms and plotless films. I suspect if you are under thirty you will enjoy this and have some laughs but the studios are really pushing Jumanji to the breaking point but I'm sure they will squeeze another film out of this franchise depending on the profits.

"7","/10","""JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE"" - MY REVIEW","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4054960/?ref_=tt_urv","Alanaji_16","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur72519805/?ref_=tt_urv","6 February 2018","Jumanji: Welcome to the jungle, directed by Jake Kasdan, is an action adventure movie and by no means a direct sequel to the original Jumanji movie released in 1997.
The plot of the film is about four High school teenagers, who while serving detention, comes across the video game and get sucked into it. By doing so they adopt their own 'Avatars' and have to complete the mission given to them to safely reach home.
Director Jake ensures that the audience are entertained throughout the film. The highlights of the movie are it's action, Cinematography and a bunch of good actors. But the film is not without it's share of flaws. The villain's role could have been more tight. That might have made the movie a bit more thrilling. 
Now to the performances. The characters in the game were just enjoyable. Dwayne Johnson works well in the action scenes as well as in the comedy. Kevin Hart was terrific. Kareen Gillan was good especially in the action scenes. Jack Black was sidelined even though he was good in some scenes. The actors in the real world did'nt have much of a role but have made their presence felt. Bobby Cannavale ( Villain), as I mentioned before, could have been provided with a more good role.
All in all Jumaji:Welcome to the jungle, is a fun ride with well excecuted action scenes and witty one liners. Just give it a shot and u won't be dissapointed. 
My rating- 3.5/5","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The chemistry between the cast is amazing, coupled with some good punches it manages to keep the movie afloat.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie was simply awesome. At first, I was very skeptical about it because I knew how good was the first Jumanji movie, however I decided to give it a try and it was absolutely worth it. The story is very well constructed as the audience can quickly understand the plot, without being puzzled or confused which would've been frustrating, of course. From the very beginning you can see the main cause that leads to the entire action, which for me is awesome, because I hate movies who need like an hour in order to get into action and they are boring the audience until then. I appreciated the combination between the entire action and comedy elements which were extremely well introduced and executed by the actors. The dialogues between the characters are cursive, without many ""dead moments"" and easy to follow. The characters are also very diverse and well-constructed as we have some stereotypes here: the nerd, the hot girl, the tough guy and the shy girl. Exactly this diversity between them helps the characters to form a team and fulfill their objective: rescue Jumanji. What's even more interesting is that this stereotypes are switching between them as soon as the characters are entering the game.What could've been done better about this movie is the CGI which is rather acceptable, than good, but oh well, you cannot have them all in a movie, right? Overall, this movie deserves your time and I recommend it, especially to those of you who are gamers.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Less dark than the original.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4258499/?ref_=tt_urv","siderite","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3146136/?ref_=tt_urv","29 July 2018","I can barely remember the original Jumanji, but what I do revolves mostly about the performance of Robin Williams and the somewhat scary parts of it. In the sequel (well, the sequel is Zathura, but you know what I mean) the focus is on the players and less on the ""lost guy in the game"" while the dark elements are kept to a minimum. The movie has been updated to 2017, with a girl obsessing over her body and smartphone who has to play the game as Jack Black, but her character felt really artificial and the jokes related to her were the most cringe worthy. The other three characters are more timeless: two opposite sex geeks and a football player (the American sort). Together they must overcome the challenges of the game to end the movie. Now, the story you know, so the details of the plot is what is important and I thought they were OK, however I must say that the game itself made little sense, with a pointless villain and a ""curse"" that affected literally no one. The actors did a good job, their chemistry, as noted by some, worked. Yet it seemed like a waste of Rock in this movie while Karen Gillan made more entertaining just by appearing. Overall a fun movie, but never more than what it was intended to be.I wonder how no one touched on the implications of entering a game then returning into a world that has changed dramatically from what you remembered going in. I mean, just telling Alex to buy stock in Bitcoin would have added a whole new layer to the Jumanji usage :)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A waste of my time and money. I should've trusted my instincts about the trailer and clips to not to set foot in the cinema watching this crap. Unfunny recycled jokes, lame story and kindergarten level villain. Jumanji suppose to be exciting, emotional, funny and a little scary, but this movie failed to achieve none of it. The screenwriters probably wrote the script in the bathroom on toilet paper and forgot to wipe with it their ass. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart are from now on my official kryptonite. Arnold S. had more charisma than both of them together. Even Jack Black who I dig, gave a goosebumps level performance.Robin Williams is probably turning in his grave.","9 out of 35 found this helpful.

Jumanji is fully aware of what sort of film it is and what it's audience wants and it sticks to that formula unashamedly. But that's why Jumanji is a surprising success. It's got enough old school ""Indiana Jones"" style capers to appeal to the nostalgics, whilst incorporating plenty of modern gaming references and in-jokes to entertain a new crowd. There isn't a weak link in the cast (Black and Gillan both comedic standouts) and although highly predictable Jumanji even has a credible moral core. I'd happily play it again.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is a sequel, sure, but while paying clever homages to the original, it is completely doing its own thing with truly likable and relatable characters, some real tear-jerker moments and a few scenes that actually do get slightly intense (nothing like the intensity the original created, but while that movie was quite dark, this is a comedy, plain and simple).

The writing and storyline is so funny and entertaining and the acting is off the charts.The CGI isn't amazing but it actually makes the film better because it gives you the sense that the characters are in a video game and it's supposed to look a little automated.Even though there is a lot of profanity and sexual references in the film they're actually really obvious and as a kid I knew to ignore them because they're very up front and easy to notice.WATCH THE MOVIE NOW !!!!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even the stuff that is sorta good. (Which is the chemistry between the cast.). The original is a masterpiece of good news v bad news in an action story. Robin Williams gave an iconic performance. The jungle sequences were insane. This film has almost no good jungle sequences and it's just the characters who do a lot of bad jokes. Everyone involved who made this project disgusts me.","6 out of 23 found this helpful.

Topping OG Jumanji? Impossible. Not wasting my time with a remake/spin-off that would tarnish an iconic Robin Williams classic. Robin Williams would have begged for a cameo if he'd been alive to read the script. Jack Black playing a teenage girl? HILARIOUS. They managed to build a sequel that not only holds its own against the original, but isn't really a sequel. I wasn't constantly comparing it to the original. Aside from the backbone of the original Jumanji (the name, the character trapped for 20 + years in the game, etc) storyline, they managed to make it better yet still pay homage to the original. I didn't feel like I was watching a rip-off of the first movie. I haven't even watched the 3rd movie yet but I'm already hoping there's plans for a 4th in the works.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Thankfully, Jumanji video game movie was better than I expected.I don't have that much memories of the original besides scaring me as a kid, so this review is not fan-based. The trailers for this one didn't grab me, but because I'm spending time in Utah with family members over Christmas break we decided to see Welcome to the Jungle. Overall it's a fine, fun bit of fluff that probably won't stick with your memory for very long. The film had some clever gags about video games and their levels and how an AI character repeat the same sentences unless you say something important. The action is serviceable. The cast has a lot of chemistry, and Jack Black nails it in every scene he's in. Even if the Instagram-obsessed girl with no phone joke gets old fast. Kevin Heart annoys me, and this didn't change my mind. :-\The story is pretty simple: make it outta the game by returning this to that and beat all the levels. It's a pretty fun concept, and the film does have it's creative moments. But the humor is a mixed-bag. Sometimes it's funny, and sometimes it's childish and pays out far too long. There are some decent character moments, but overall there's not much emotional investment or stakes. It's just like a video game: it doesn't focus on character development too much, just making it to the next obstacle. And for that alone, it's exciting and entertaining enough.Maybe I'm missing out some of the fun when picking all these flaws, but I do know that Welcome to the Jungle was fine far what it is. It's amusing, sometimes funny, at times creative and always action-packed. It doesn't want to be a masterpiece and never tries to reach beyond what it is. I smiled, but quickly forgot about a lot of scenes. Maybe I'm too snobbish to enjoy anything, but can we at least agree that this was one of Sony's best films of 2017?! I mean, they've made Emoji Movie which felt more like a dull advertisement than anything else. At least this didn't feel like a full-on cash-grab.5.5 or 6/10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

And I am happy to report that this movie was everything I hoped for and more! When I first saw the trailer I already knew this movie was gonna be an enjoyable ride that I can watch easily with my friends. Or if you don't have friends, well guess what?! This movie is perfect still for some self-indulgence! I had no idea why some people were saying that this movie was going to bombed because it clearly won't to me at least. It has a star-studded cast who were all excellent in their respective roles. I was actually surprise to see Nick Jonas here! Haven't seen him for a while and he putted up a great act. Jumanji captures all the essence of old school video games and the 90s. Since this movie is made by Sony Pictures you will see tons of Sony games like Uncharted 3 in the kid's room. That was really cool that they put it in there being a Sony fan myself. ALL IN ALL GO OUT AND BUY A TICKET FOR THIS MOVIE NOW!!!","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

I noticed the Rock is in the remake of Big trouble in little China, another classic sure to be destroyed. I'll be sure to stay away from Jumanji 2.","6 out of 28 found this helpful.

It's a great fun/fantasy movie, and Robin Williams is awesome. There is a little story from the first movie that is needed but for the most part, this movie stands on it's own.I've seen other movies try to use video game physics or logic, only to come off lame and corny. But the crew on Jumanji absolutely nail it. They use a significant amount of video game logic and actually turn this into a far better movie than it would be without it. Every one of the main 4 actors are incredible.I loved the chemistry between The Rock and Kevin Hart in Central Intelligence, and based on those two alone, I wanted to see this movie. But the whole movie turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. The story line of the movie is pretty predictable, but they way they get from the beginning to the end has significant new twists and turns that are entertaining, and just downright hilarious. I doubt you can watch this movie without being entertained.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Having hit the reset button, does the 'Jumanji' from the 90s adapt as well as it does in the present day?1. Picking up where we left off from the original 1995 film with the board-game buried under the sand on a beach, it is discovered once again. Neglected by its finder, the game transfers into that of an obsolete video-game system which is jump-started by four students serving detention at a local high-school. From that point, they all are sucked into the world of Jumanji and embody their respective avatars they choose to serve as in the game. Keeping this spoiler free, the premise within the game itself is nothing special or original in the least. The players are tasked with finding a certain sacred object of which they must journey and deliver to at a certain sacred place in order to return to the real-world. They all have their respective strengths, weaknesses and abilities which they must use and work together while on their journey. The plot may be simple, but it serves its purpose well enough.2. This movie should be the blueprint for future comedies to show that raunchy, vulgar and excessive sexual humor isn't always necessary in making a film funny and entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the same as I did with the original as a kid growing up. Though the presence of the late Robin Williams will surely be missed, I think he'd be proud of this film. Williams was a comedic genius during his time, but the humor delivered by both Jack Black (Prof. Osbern) and Kevin Hart ('Mouse' Finbar) will have your stomach in knots. Black in particular steals the show more so than Kevin Hart, seeing as his charter is embodied by the self-centered teenage girl Bethany (Madison Iseman). Black's acting and portrayal of his real-life counter-part was nothing short of outstanding. His gestures and voice in particular sold me on him being a girl trapped in a man's body. Don't get me wrong, Kevin Hart has his laugh-out-loud moments as well.3. The action was surprisingly good for a family film. I'm not sure how well younger audiences will fare watching this as there are some frightening sequences as well as brief sexual references and innuendos throughout. Unlike the first, this sequel is PG-13 as it takes certain and surprising liberties I wasn't expecting it to. Whenever there's action....call Dwayne Johnson, who literally delivers a knock-out punch with his performance as the daring Dr. Bravestone. I must say, I enjoyed Johnson's comedic chops in this more than any other film I've seen him in thus far. Never having been a fan of the Jonas Brothers back in the day, Nick Jonas (Alex) actaully surprised me as to how good of an actor he is. I used to cringe at his acting during his Disney channel run, but I'm glad to see he's finally bettered himself. I suppose there's no point in hiding my undying love for Karen Gillan. She's beautiful, deadly, funny and a joy to watch on screen.4. My only complaint and first major flaw of this film is the villain. Bobby Cannavale has proven himself as a good actor, but here he falters as the treacherous hunter/explorer Van Pelt. This movie would have been close to perfect had they not failed to include a worthy antagonist. Van Pelt could have been played by any actor to be honest. The character himself is weak and his goal is like any other cliche in which he wants the thing which the heroes have so he hunts them down to get back the thing that will give him power instead of the other thing happening. Apart from that, the cinematography and editing was phenomenal in this. The breathtaking scenery and shots of the various Hawaiian isles blew me away. Though not as cinematic in scope as 'Kong: Skull Island', it still urges me to want to visit Hawaii. If there was one other minor thing the film was weak in was the score. I felt Henry Jackman could have composed music more exciting.With his last film being the atrocious 'Sex Tape', Jake Kasdan has redeemed himself and proven to also be a good action director. If you're hoping this film to be a tribute to Robin Williams in some way, it really isn't, although it mentions subtle ties to the first. 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is by far one of the best comedies this year and is certainly on my top 10 list of best movies of 2017.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

When it was first announced, everyone has low expectations for the stand-alone sequel to the late Robin Williams's 1995 hit. Everyone believes it's going to be a massive failure..Then BOOM! Defying everyone's expectations, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a surprisingly fun, enjoyable movie, that manages to stay true to the originals, while at the same time, might be one of the best video game movie so far.For starters, Dwayne Johnson once again proves that he's likable in every role he recieves, and his role as Smolder Bravestone speaks for itself. Kevin Hart literally plays himself, and he did a great job as Franklin Finbar. Karen Gillan did a great job as Ruby Roundhouse, despite being in a uncomfortable (and controversial) outfit. Jack Black is also really good in his role as Oberon. Nick Jonas also did a good job as Seaplane. The teenagers (Alex Wolff, Ser'Darius Blain, Morgan Turner, and Madison Iseman, playing the real-life counterparts of Dwayne, Kevin, Karen, and Jack's characters respectively) did a great job as well.One of the things that made this movie works really well, is the ""fish-out-of-the-water"" story. Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan, all play a role that's not familiar to them, and they really did a great job. The pacing is perfect, explaining the plot right off the bat, resulting in a more fleshed out and more interesting story. Also, as the game is essentially a video game movie, there were plenty of video game references that some people might don't get it, but for those who understands, I think that it's a great throwback and a cool easter egg as well. The humor in this movie, it works perfectly. There's surprisingly plenty of sex jokes that works, but also not overused. The fight scenes are also very entertaining and over the top too (again, it's a ""video game"" movie, real life physics don't apply).Unfortunately, the movie does suffer from several aspects. The villain, played by Bobby Cannavale who btw did a good performance, like any other movie, is a simple, 1D character, who is simply evil. Though can be menacing, it doesn't change the fact that he's nothing more than some really evil guy who wants to rule everything and destroy anything stands in this way, etc. I also noticed that Kevin Hart's character is the only one of the main characters that is, seemingly not affected by the fish-out-of-the-water situation. I wish Kevin's performance were more out of his usual persona/fish-out-of-the-water performance, rather than playing as himself. Also, Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan has little to no chemistry whatsoever in their really odd awkward romance subplot, and the movie didn't take the more risky route, which is a shame since the final act is, personally, is kinda anticlimactic.Nevertheless, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle proves that Hollywood actually can make a good sequel to the old classics that brings something new to the table, while at the same time stays true to the originals. Fans of the original movie, while could be dissatisfied by the change from the board game to a video game, should watch this movie and came out satisfied, because I believe Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle captures the spirit of the original very well, and I'm really happy that it's actually really good and not just a bad attempt at milking money.Final Score: 8/10","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It was not bad, but just did not click for me. When I first heard about this film, I had no desire to see it; however, when I saw the trailer and saw that it was now a video game and the people became their avatars I thought I would give it a go. Suffice to say, it was a rather amusing and action filled adventure that I was not disappointed in at all. Not the best film I have seen all year, but still rather good. I figured the whole video game setting would make it more enjoyable for me than the whole crazy stuff happening in the real world setting of the first film. The film is a mixture of comedy and action as I would say it is nearly a 50/50 split with maybe a dash more on the comedy side. The cast all did a good job as the actors and actress playing the avatars within the game all were able to pick up on the teens who they supposedly were traits very nicely and made up a lot of the comedy in this film. The story has the Jumanji game found on a beach. A young man picks it up and opens it up, but immediately dismisses it and goes to playing video games. Something happens within the night and the board game becomes a video game and soon the young man disappears. Years later, a nerdy guy, an athlete, a popular hot girl and a bit of an awkward girl get detention. They are charged with cleaning out a room, but happen across the video game Jumanji. They soon decide to play and each of them is plunged into the game and become the avatar they have chosen. The nerdy kid is now a brave and muscular explorer. The athlete a small and diminutive zoologist and backpack carrier. The awkward girl becomes a very attractive and hot video game heroine and the popular girl becomes an overweight professor and reader of maps! They are charged with getting a strange jewel back to where it belongs; however, they have limited lives and seemingly unlimited dangers awaiting them in the jungles of Jumanji. They have to cross the dreaded jungles, get through a bazaar and try to outsmart the villain of the piece and try to stop themselves from being killed in the process! The actors in this all do a really good job as they make the film. If not for the way they act, this would be kind of just another generic jungle action piece. Dwayne Johnson continues to be a solid actor and still the best wrestler turned actor as he has to play a guy who looks huge, but the actual person being a very insecure and scared individual. Karen Gillian does a really good job at being super hot and sexy, but also extremely awkward. Kevin Hart is very funny, but the actor that stole the show was Jack Black as the professor who the popular and self absorbed girl became as he actual seems like he is that girl. They all are what make this movie extremely good and funny. The villain though is bit of a throwaway, almost seeming to be no threat at all. So I enjoyed the film, at times I thought it did get a bit too serious and I did think it ran a bit long, but overall I really enjoyed it. I think it is the only non comic film I have seen so far this year at the theaters other than John Wick 2. The first film just was not for me, but I enjoyed this sequel quite a bit. I do classify it as a sequel and not a reboot as it is just a new setting as the game itself has evolved over time to become something new. The actors were great and though the ones playing the avatars are in the majority of the film, the ones playing the 'real' them were really good too. The film had a mixture of comedy and action, but though it was nearly even I would still say that at its core it is more of a comedy film. It was a nice change of pace and I enjoyed watching it with my parents and they enjoyed it as well so well done to Sony for making a very enjoyable film.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

The four teens are taken out of their world and dropped into the Jungle as recreated in the form of a video game simulation. The Jumanji game box updated itself, presumably with the same magic that allows it to create a world of its own.The actors did a lot here to play as the 'game' characters as if played by the younger cast. The nesting of characters inside characters was very clever and allows some real exploration of the young characters and the predicaments of being stuck in the game.The visuals are excellent, the action is paced out well and the plot is unravelled as a simple action adventure, but with the character work between everything it is very entertaining. Also very funny, a lot of the material is delivered excellently and this had a lot of very funny moments.I can't speak to the older film, it was one I watched as a kid. Anyway, this is a clever rework of the material and I think they did an excellent job. Something that a lot of modern movies lack is 'soul', but I have to say this film has it in spades. The ending was moving.8/10 excellent escapism in the style of classic adventure such as 'Indiana Jones' but set with some interesting concepts and twists with modern technology.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

They select their characters and they teleport inside the game with the characters they chosen and must figure out a way to get out!The jokes were great as they made me laugh a lot.

Being a big fan of the Original Jumanji film, I was very disappointing that they were making a sequel that no one asked for, and that somehow the Jumanji board game turned into a video game.Now seeing the film I have learned that we should be less judgmental about the trailer of a film because there is always a chance of a bad trailer turning into a good film. Even though I almost can't believe that the Jumanji board game was just able to turn into a video game, for some reason watching the film, I just let it slide, because when it does turn into a video game, they handle everything so well that even though I still don't know how to explain how a board game turned into a video game, I was glad that it turned into a video game. The environment was really cool when they got sucked into the game, the cast was also really great, especially the actors playing the video game characters, because they had to play video game characters but have the personality of there teenager selves. Like Jack Black who was a popular girl in High School, but in the video game she is middle-aged fat man (which is one of the funniest parts of the movie). The comedy was also very great, the special effects, everything! I really enjoyed this movie and I regret hating on it when the trailers were out.In the end, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a great film, with a great cast, great environment, cool plot, nice special effects, and many more. I recommend seeing it yourself, with your friends too if you wanted to. I give this movie an 8/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

There was great action scenes, some humorous bits of dialogue and enough of a plot to keep things moving.This is obviously not very deep (which was exactly what I was after) fairly predictable and does play to stereotypes - but none of that matters.If you are after some easy family fun then is perfect!

These four high school students, get pulled into a video game called Jumanji. They also get turned into their respective game avatars. Now, Spencer(Dwayne Johnson), Fridge(Kevin Hart), Bethany(Jack Black) & Martha(Karen Gillan) have to finish the game, to return to the real world. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a thoroughly entertaining film. Director Jake Kasdan has successfully introduced Jumanji to a new generation, while also honoring the 1995 Robin Williams classic. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is immersive(especially in IMAX). The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. My favorites are the helicopter scene & the climax. The effortless camaraderie among the four main cast members is another strong-point of the film. Dwayne Johnson is spectacular as Spencer. Kevin Hart is hysterical as Fridge. Jack Black is hilarious as Bethany. Karen Gillan is outstanding as Martha. Together, Johnson, Hart, Black & Gillan make the audience guffaw uncontrollably, with their histrionics. Rhys Darby is impressive as Nigel. Bobby Cannavale is great as Van Pelt. Nick Jonas is amazing as Alex. Alex Wolff, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman & Morgan Turner are awesome as Young Spencer, Young Fridge, Young Bethany & Young Martha, respectively. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a must watch, for fans of Jumanji(1995) & newcomers alike. Go & have a great time with your entire family!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I'll admit I had very little hope for it going in. I wasn't a big fan of the original and I'm not a big fan of Kevin Hart's brand of humour. I had almost no anticipation for the film whatsoever. It started out a little slowly (there's maybe a 15 minute period before the big stars actually come into the movie), but after that it kicked into gear and was a very fun two hour ride. The set up for the film is done perfectly. The lull at the start is completely necessary and makes every thing so much better later on. Knowing who these characters are before going into the game compared to what they become once they're in there is the best thing the film has going for it. Jack Black's character arc in particular is especially hilarious. In fact in what was an incredibly strong performance by the entire cast Black would have to be my stand out. Dwayne Johnson continues to be Hollywood's most improved comedian. Compare what he achieves now to his work early in his career and it's worlds apart. These days he's almost becoming a sure sign of quality. Kevin Hart was the surprise for me. I rarely enjoy his work, but here he was hilarious. Whoever wrote his one-liners did a fantastic job. They were almost always effective. The whole movie is just put together very well. The three lives per character structure was very clever and allowed so much freedom for the story to progress. Also I loved that there was no mucking around with the aspect of getting them into the game. They're in quickly and boom, the fun can begin. Too many films draw this process out in an attempt to be clever or create believability. I would happily recommend 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' to anyone looking for a good laugh and a fun time.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This movie is miles better than the original but it's still a mix between being average and just plain bad. All humour comes from dick jokes and screaming and swearing and whilst it does get some decent chuckles from the NPC interactions it isn't enough to carry a comedy/adventure movie. Also, it's way too cheesy. I don't go to see a movie rated PG 12 for cheesy heartfelt lessons. Lessons in movies shouldn't be taught like this. Why not make it endearing instead of forced? Is it really that hard? Disney has been able to pull off endearing and meaningful messages for decades so why has no one been able to master it yet? The only actor I could tolerate was Dwayne Johnson as he seemed to actually pull off a decent performance instead of just screaming and being obnoxious like Kevin Hart in this movie. I couldn't STAND any other character/actor here. Over all this movie is stupid. It's decent fun for teenagers or fans of Jumanji but I couldn't stand it. Absolutely obnoxious.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is an adventure-comedy film directed by Jake Kasdan. It is the third installment of the 'Jumanji' franchise, after 'Zathura: A Space Adventure' (2005) and a direct sequel to 'Jumanji' (1995), which was based on the children's book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg.
This is a fun, hilarious adventure family film, what more can you ask for? The chemistry between all the actors are on point, bringing a fun adventure film to life.
Set twenty-one years after Jumanji, it follows four teenagers who are transported into the video game world of Jumanji and play as their chosen characters. Joining another player, they must beat the game to return home.
Every character in the video games world was played to perfection. Dwayne Johnson basically retires his wrestling persona for this film and instead, provides a smoldering and intense performance, riddled with good-natured hilarity as the lead in this film. Kevin Hart was great as the sidekick, I think he was involved in every funny moment in which I laughed the hardest. Karen Gillan was perfect as the badass who was played by a shy teenage girl. Finally, the master of the whole film, Jack Black plays the teen beauty queen with 100% commitment and to perfection.
The jokes are nonstop and witty. Characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of Jumanji. A little homage is paid to Alan Parrish throughout the movie, which I liked, and the movie continues, 20 years after the events of 1996.
Overall, it's a nearly perfect family comedy that rises above lowest common denominator humor.
4/5","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is a throwback movie down to the epic music. This is just a plain fun movie. Despite the fact that there are missing elements from the original, this movie boosts the dusty board game concept into the video game concept (it's like the movies ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" both are good, but you just need an extra jump start).
It was then no surprise to see Jake Kasdan direct this, as there is smart set-up (their abilities and weaknesses) and payoff (not going to give it away). I am going to bet right now, he is going to direct some ""Star Wars"" movie in the future (as his dad Lawrence Kasdan, wrote arguably the best one so far).

The only thing this movie have going for it is the name for those of us to remember the original classic, and that's about all. I gave it three stars because it's not a remake, it's a first time mess up and even thou it screws up the premise of the entire first movie, it will never compare or even be as close to be funny, Robin Williams was a Comedic Genius, Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson is only in it for name recognition. the girls, don't know what they are suppose to be, but they should have stayed home on this one.Anyway, if anyone reads this, let me say you some time, it sucks, it sucks so bad, the dog is hiding under the coffee table, oh my gawd, with his paws covering his eyes, if you have time to waste, this yeah, I recommend this, it can't get much worst, or can it????

"5","/10","Better than I expected, but still, very cheesy.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4038342/?ref_=tt_urv","letande","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22587864/?ref_=tt_urv","20 January 2018","OK, first of all, I expected this one to be absolutely, completely awful. I can't call myself a big fan of the original Jumanji, but it was a very heartwarming movie, while Robin Williams is just impossible not to love. It was one of his movies that used to make you feel a little better about life as a thing. This one, though... I expected it to be a complete joke. Like one of the worst movies ever that will ruin the whole name completely. I hated every second of the trailer. And yet... out of curiosity I decided to see it. And guess what? Surprisingly... it wasn't THAT bad.Actually, they made a sequel (yep, it is not a reboot, it's a direct sequel) and even kept the original heartwarming formula. With how Jumanji may be a scary thing, but it makes players' lives better in the end. It's that exact heartwarming formula and I totally didn't expect that. Here and there it really did feel like they tried to pay some respect to the original. Unfortunately, yes, in the end, it's one of those cheesy movies with a lot of stupid jokes, a lot of stupid action, etc. Where the original Jumanji was more like a soft horror movie with comedy elements, this one is more like a typical action comedy with Rock in spotlight.In other words, even though beginning and the end of the movie do feel like Jumanji, the middle part is pretty different. And I can't really say I liked it. It was OK here and there, but some jokes were way too dirty for such a movie (say whatever you want, but Jumanji should be more like a family movie, jokes about penises and breasts feel totally out of place here), adventure part feels pretty boring (when you think about it, nothing really happens in this movie, just some action on the way to the end), while effects weren't really that cool. I mean, the original Jumanji used to have pretty impressive visuals back in the days. This one... it even looks dated here and there. With $110.000.000 budget they didn't even try to hide cameraman's reflection in Jack Black's glasses. There's also not enough variety. Using those motorcycles again and again... It felt cheap. It actually felt like those cheap old Japanese TV shows. No budget? Get some guys in helmets, put them on bikes and make some action. In this movie 1/3 of action is like that. Feels dated, feels boring and I almost fall asleep during some parts. Which is pretty much a failure for an action part. I can't even name another recent movie that made me fall asleep during the action parts. This one did.I kinda liked how actors did, though. Usually, I can't stand Jack Black (there's something about him that I find extremely unpleasant), but he did pretty good as a part of the team here. And, of course, Karen Gillan (insert joke about Pond in the pond here) was really amazing. Loved her both in action and talking parts. They did really great with Rock. Their scenes are like my favorite. I also liked Morgan Turner. There aren't many scenes with her, but she was able to create a certain mood around her character. Just by certain moves and gestures. It was pretty cute thing to see.But in the end it's a 50/50 to me. Welcome to the Jungle feels like one of those cheesy sequels from 90s. Like, you know. Back in the days, when there was a good and successful movie, there often was a chain of sequels. With the first one that wasn't really that bad yet (the following movies used to become worse and worse progressively), but still, it wasn't even close to the original. In other words, this one isn't Lawnmower Man 2, but it's something like Jaws 2. Not too bad yet, but... not really as good. Kinda fun how in 2017 we've got a cheesy sequel to 1995 movie, but... that's exactly what it is. If you aren't really Karen Gillan's, or Dwayne Johnson's fan, this movie is pretty much skippable. Even for those, who loved the original Jumanji. I certainly don't want it on my shelf, but... I don't really regret paying for a ticket. It was a solid one time movie with a heartwarming ending. Some jokes, some action, a heartwarming ending... Don't expect much, and it can make you a nice evening. But if you want proper Jumanji 2... Sorry, won't happen here.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I don't know who screwed up and accidently made this movie extremely watchable, but someone dropped the ball big time. It's a sequel/reboot of a robin Williams board game movie, starring The Rock, Jack Black and Kevin Hart. We all knew the score. So, I ask you - which: only got the job because their dad is a producer; over achieving; still believes in the magic of cinema, bastard!, didn't get the memo that this was a simple cash grab, and decided to lay it on the line and make something worth seeing instead?!This movie wasn't revolutionary. It didn't change the course of cinema or alter my perspective on reality. Instead it did the one thing I hope for every time I sit down for a movie in this genre - It entertained. For the two hours I sat looking at the screen, it didn't matter who the president was or wasn't. it didn't matter what pronoun you should refer to me as. It didn't matter how much my allergies were acting up, or how big of a douche my boss is. For two hours on a Thursday, thanks to this movie, I was just simply enjoying the ride.Look I'm not claiming this was highbrow shit. A football stud named Fridge morphed into Kevin Hart. A shallow Instagram selfie obsessed blonde transformed into Jack Black... I get it. I'd probably fire the guy who pitched me that. But they make it work. The casting was surprisingly perfect. Black fell off my radar about a decade ago and Hart hasn't made a good film in his career, so that teamed with the fact that The Rock will sign on to do anything didn't have me coming in expecting much, but they all delivered career affirming performances and reminded me why I fell in love with the movies to begin with.There were some bum notes. The four high schoolers were a little stereotypical and not well rounded, and the videogame girl was dressed like a videogame girl. But honestly, I had precisely zero problem with any of that. It was funny and silly and one of the first films in a long time that I can dub ""fun for the whole family"" without secretly meaning 'if you're not a kid or a grandparent, bring a flask.' Plus, the lack of character depth made it all the more powerful when it took them becoming archetypical videogame characters to truly figure out who they were as people and what they were individually about. 
They knew exactly what they had with this set up. By putting the characters in a videogame, they were able to forego a lot of the story structure red tape that tends to bog down movies like this. Clunky exposition scenes became fun, and to the point. Because each character had attributes that were clearly stated from the beginning, the world and rules were set from the get go and we just got to enjoy how they used the bag of tools to get from A to B. And since each team member was a piece of the puzzle, we didn't have to worry about that obligatory sequence that makes its way into every similar film where the characters have a big falling out and go their separate ways for 15 minutes to pout in a puddle somewhere. Instead, they just kept the train moving and never looked back.This movie could have been made without any ties to the Jumanji world and not many would have been the wiser, and because of that, new audiences, ignorant of the original, can watch this and feel as though they've missed nothing. At the same time, they tied in some fun nods to the 1995 film that made fan boys like me feel like we got just a little more bang for our buck. 
I would have felt a lot less bad for Alan Parrish all those years ago about the dice never coming up 5 or 8 if I knew being stuck in the jungle was this much fun!Prescriptions

I honestly thought that it wasn't going to hold a candle to the 1995 classic with Robin Williams and that it was going to crash and burn at the box office. How wrong I was. I had a great time, and there were plenty of laughs. This movie fits perfectly into the modern day era with a lot of updated aspects of the story as well as a completely new cast.The movie starts off with in 1996, when teenager Alex (Mason Guccione) is given the Jumanji board game after his father discovers it on a beach following the events of the previous movie where it was dropped into a river. Alex is originally uninterested with the game however once he finds that it has transformed into a video game cartridge, he starts to play it. Alex then disappears and is never seen again. Fast forward to 2017 where teenagers Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany (Madison Iseman), and Martha (Morgan Turner) are unceremoniously given detention and their principal orders them to clean out a storage area at the school as punishment. Upon discovering the same video game cartridge, the four teenagers start to play the game and find themselves sucked into the world of Jumanji. To their horror, the teenagers find themselves as the four characters they picked to play the game. Spencer is the muscular explorer Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Fridge is the short zoologist Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart), Martha is the lethal commando Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), and Bethany is the overweight cartographer Dr. Shelly Oberon (Jack Black). The four characters are polar opposites to the teenagers. Spencer is a weak willed nerd who is academically clever, Fridge is the tall football jock who shows no interest in school, Bethany is beautiful but very self centered, and Martha is socially awkward. As their four respective characters, they learn from their guide Nigel (Rhys Darby) that to survive the world of Jumanji they must band together to complete the game. They also have to battle the possessed evil explorer Russel Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale).You couldn't have picked a diverse cast with Dwayne Johnson (San Andreas), Jack Black (Tropic Thunder), Kevin Hart (Ride Along) and Karen Gillan (Guardians of the Galaxy). All four are awesome in their respective roles and fit into the movie perfectly. Rhys Darby (Flight of the Concords) does a good job in his small role as the guide Nigel. I still think of Jonathan Hyde's Van Pelt from the original Jumanji movie however Bobby Cannavale (Boardwalk Empire) takes up a different version of Van Pelt in this movie and runs with it.As I said at the start, I didn't have much faith in this movie after being indifferent to Jumanji being resurrected. I didn't think much of the original trailer either. After rewatching the original movie which I have loved since I was 12 years old, I came across the trailer to the new movie and decided to give it a second go. I was completely wrong in thinking that this was going to be a box office failure. I was in absolute surprise to see how fun this movie was going to be. And it was absolutely fun from start to finish.If you liked the original Jumanji, you will not be disappointed. If you haven't seen the original Jumanji, still watch it. If you seek adventure, I guarantee you will have an amazing time. Sit back and have a blast.8/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

They are making another Jumanji but this time it was going to be set in a video game. I rolled my eyes at that. I read reviews for it and the reviews were overwhelmingly positive. This piqued my interest and I decided to give this movie a try. I was wrong. My initial response was the right one. I had a hard time getting into this movie. The characters are all insufferable right out of the gate. I imagine them being put into Jumanji will bring them a full 180 to being better people and learning valuable lessons. This of course is exactly what happens. This plays on the tropes that video games adhere to. There are some funny moments that go along with this. Something didn't feel right though. Honestly this movie didn't need to be called Jumanji. It had little or nothing to do with Jumanji in any way. It had a few shout out moments to remind people that hey we are actually making a Jumanji movie. You could see all the jokes though coming from a mile away especially anything done by Kevin Hart or Jack Black. It was simply too obvious and Kevin Hart was just relying on his schtick again. I understand that a lot of comedians do this when they make movies until they get tired of it. I haven't seen too many Kevin Hart movies and I'm already tired of it. Jack Black was the same way. I know it seems like it would be funny to watch him act like a teenage girl but it was funny when it was done by Rob Schneider in the Hot Chick. They made the usual jokes you would imagine they would make in that situation. They didn't draw it out in an uncomfortable way but it was touched upon.This was really standard issue stuff slapped with a name that the studio thought would sell and sold it did so we can expect more of this but I;m checking out. I give this movie a D.","3 out of 15 found this helpful.

Making most of the setting being in the video game, this movie keeps nice balanced tension. When I was a child, Jumanji was rather a horror movie than a comedy. Although its ratio is completely reversed, the essence of the horror in this series seems to remain unchanged. That is to say, fear of death. This existence makes the jokes shine much more and prevents the tension from going away. However good what the principle said is, in ordinary situation, it won't impress you. It is not until you realize the end of your life is inevitable that the lines of the principle win the hearts and minds.
I appreciate the actor's fabulous act. Everybody well played each high school student in it. I like the awkward kiss scene the best out of every kiss scene.

We then find ourselves in Jumanji with the four teenagers who have now turned into their avatars. After getting over the initial shock of the situation, they realise that each of their characters have unique strengths and weaknesses and they must work together and use their abilities to complete the game in order to go home. The actual plot wasn't as terrible and sort of worked as a loose sequel to the original. The scenario plays out like a computer game which which was pretty cool and mostly well done. Like a computer game each character gets a certain number of lives. There were also details like non-player characters repeating certain phrases because they only have very specific roles to play in the game. I thought that side of the film was well written. However it's the performances that make this movie so good. In particular Jack Black, who almost steals the whole film. His impressions of a teenage girl in a middle-aged man's body were hilarious. We know he's a funny physical actor and he takes full advantage in this film to have fun with the scenario. Dwayne Johnson is also really good. His characters real life persona of Spencer is a geek who's afraid of everything. Yet that kid is now in Johnson's body with the strength and charisma of Bravestone, who literally smoulders. Kevin Hart is also hilarious. Karen Gillan doesn't exactly play against type, but she does become a badass character who is also very funny especially when trying to flirt.
On the whole, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is packed full of both terrific action and comedy, and superb performances.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In my opinion, this was still a win for my money in terms of, Humor, presentation, and of course the generalization of trends that are starting to pop out of the ground in many parts of the world.It seems to me that this sequel really outdid the first one in terms of special effects and storyline. And it seems like there could be a third one.Jumanji 2 is still very warm to the touch and it's sort of got that Breakfast Club feel to it.

I recommend it with no restrictions.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4022189/?ref_=tt_urv","terrsgc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4905729/?ref_=tt_urv","3 January 2018","Unlike most reviewers seem to feel, I like this movie a little better than the original Jumanji, which was an excellent movie. Both are silly, of course. You have to suspend disbelief a lot. This is unavoidable with the genre. All of our protagonists are flawed but like-able enough that you care if they die. Granted, deep-down you know that it is unlikely for the primary characters to permanently die, but on the surface you can't help but think, ""just maybe ..."". And, the multi-life game limit allows you to watch them suffer some horrible fates, anyway.Another complaint I read a lot has to do with Karen Gillian's attire. She's dressed like Lara Croft Tomb-Raider. Get over it. Her cheeks aren't hanging out of her shorts. Her cleavage isn't showing. Yes, her midriff shows, but I see far skimpier walking around the neighborhood often enough in the summer time, and far FAR skimpier at the beach. Is it appropriate for a jungle? Probably not. But, then that's the joke, isn't it? She's a character straight out of a 90's video game. The action scenes are fun, the comedy is fun, the location exotic enough. The game plot is as inane as the typical 90's video game, which it should be. What's not to like? And, I see nothing that most parents should find objectionable, with the possible exception of a curse word and some very minimal potty humor.This movie does what it is supposed to. It entertains me for the duration of the film. And, it does it well. I don't recommend this movie as some great work of art that will win any awards. It's just FUN. Enjoy it and let the critics be critical.Note: I removed the spoiler warning. I don't believe I've revealed anything that isn't in the trailers anyway.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" doesn't have the same charm as its predecessor, but it is a fun adaptation to the modern world.Packed with a great cast, ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"", not to be confused with the Rock's earlier movie with the same name, gets an ""Avatar""-like treatment where a group of teens plug in an old console from the 90's and are teleported in the jungle world of Jumanji via different video game characters, in the likes of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan, each with their own special set of skills that should help them retrieve a magical jewel and end the game.The movie is action-packed with an amusing approach to a sort-of video game adaptation of a fictional game. You will definitely be entertained by the silliness of the characters and how the teens react to their full-grown adult bodies.It became apparent that ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is Jake Kasdan's freshest movie since his directorial debut ""Zero Effect"". It's one of those rare moments where a sequel to a comedy movie surpasses expectations and turns out be a crowd-pleaser, judging by the almost $1 billion box office revenue.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Direct sequels to films that are released a loooong time after the original don't have a tendency to do that well at the Box Office ('Basic Instinct 2' - anyone remember that?). Most times it appears that the original fan-base isn't in the cinema-going demographic and the film doesn't click with today's audience. However, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' not only does well to differentiate itself from the original, but also succeeds without the inclusion of the man who (arguably) helped make the first instalment so special - the ever excellent Robin Williams.'Jumanji' was about a magic board game that sucked players in and made them play the game 'for real' in order to survive. Well, in this day and age, the producers of the film obviously realise that no self-respecting kid would ever play a board game any more (sadly, in my opinion - I love a bit of Monopoly!) so they've brought it right up to date and turned the board game into a computer game. So, when four high school students find themselves in detention cleaning out the school's dusty basement, they stumble across the 'antique' console and decide to kill some time playing a quick game (this never happened to the 'Breakfast Club' did it?!).Now, this is where the film gets a bit different. The first ten to fifteen minutes are spent introducing us - the audience - to our young heroes. However, as soon as they enter the computer game, all of them acquire 'avatars' i.e. in-game characters who are all older, hunkier and possessing skills required for completing the game. Therefore, pretty much the entire film is spent with the kids' 'adult' incarnations, but seeing as one such incarnation is Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, that's not so bad. So, our young heroes quickly become 'old' heroes and have to save a fictional jungle-land from a tyrannical regime. I guess that's a pretty standard plot for either a modern action film or a computer game. I suppose that's what this film is - a standard action film and it's enjoyable enough if that's all you're looking for or expecting. However, if you're a fan of computer games and the clichés that come with the medium, you'll get a lot more out of it than just a few action set pieces. It does brilliantly at poking fun of all the silly things you can expect from video games - everything from entering the game with three 'lives' to owning a backpack which can seemingly fit numerous ridiculously-large items in and never slow its owner down.But, however many 'in-jokes' are included for us gamers and no matter how impressive the action scenes are, the film would be nothing without the stars and I have to hand it to the four (adult) actors who take the reigns for the majority of the film. It's because of them that this film succeeds, for they don't just have to play 'their' characters - they have to play their teenage incarnations playing adult characters who are, in turn, playing clichéd computer game characters. And, as much as I love Dwayne Johnson in everything he does, I have to say that the star of the show is Jack Black. This is because he's - technically - playing a spoilt teenage girl. No, seriously. And he does it perfectly, stealing every scene as he goes. Also, you may not expect much 'character development' in a film about kids being drawn into a computer game, but I thought there was actually a decent enough 'journey' for the youngsters (albeit in their adult bodies!) to go on and they ended their story as different people to how they began it.So, if you're only looking for a run-of-the-mill action film to put your brain on hold to, then you'll certainly find it here. However, if, like me, you're a gamer and want to see a film that lovingly pokes fun at everything we hold dear, you'll definitely find that here to. Special mention to something that happens at the end. I expected something to happen between a pair of characters and it didn't. Something more 'realistic' happened instead and I found myself awarding 'kudos points' to the film's writers for not taking the predictable route at the end.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's not my absolute favorite comedy ever, but it was entertaining and fun. Then I heard of the cast - Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, and so on. All have a pretty good track record for being very funny, so my hopes were lifted.So, this film basically broke box office records, remaining in my dinky hometown theater for at least 2 and a half months (and that's a big deal for them). And then when it came to DVD, it was impossible to get for weeks - all copies were rented constantly. When I finally rented it, I thought, ""This must be a REALLY good movie!"" Then I watched it...At first, I was surprised at how not funny it was. But it was still only the beginning - the characters were still just kids - so I waited for the real stars to show up. And they did... and it still wasn't funny! Jack Black was hamming it up way too much as a teenage girl, and The Rock was only given predictable lines to work with. Karen Gillan was a dull character. The only actor that solicited any out-loud laughs from me was Kevin Hart, whose character suffers from a hilarious cake weakness. But most of the joke writing was lazy, as if it was whipped up in a hurry and the writers spent more time on mind-boggling action and not laughs.Aside from the performances, the plot was flimsy and predictable. The villain was stereotypical, and the film was mostly ""normal"" action, not many animal stampedes (other than one scene of rhinos) or living vines.Also, in the original movie, Jumanji is portrayed as a rough place and the game sends animals and monsters to terrorize our world. But now, suddenly the players are compelled to SAVE Jumanji from the villain's clutches so it can be restored to a place of beauty. Why?Lastly, I felt the Guns 'n' Roses song wasn't used enough - it was only played once during the end credits. When you've got a great song like ""Welcome to the Jungle,"" and it's IN your TITLE, it should be showcased more and be the movie's ""theme.""In short, if you value your time and energy, you just might want to skip 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' and see the original from 1995 instead.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Mostly because on top of being a very effective kid fantasy movie, it uses cinematic language in a way that calls for very careful viewing. Something I didn't expect, and loved finding. (I always love this sort of a surprise). You won't find this clever usage of cinematic language in this one, but eventually it does make up for ir in a more straight forward manner, while not being any less clever. This one is a very well done movie. Superb acting, even though its often done in an underhanded style or maybe I should use the term subtle in this case. Anyhow, the greatest acting bits aren't obvious or spectacular, but are still there. When Dwayne Johnson ""smolders"", when Jack Black is being Bethany, when Karen Gillan is being Martha. I can't say any more without revealing too much, see the movie - you'll understand what I'm speaking about. Beyond the acting, this one is very carefully crafted to force actual teamwork, not just an instinctive support that was there in abundance in the original movie. In this one the group actually plans its moves repeatedly. I'm not saying there's no instinctive ""light bulb"" moments, but they too come as part of the story - it's a very well written story. The pacing, the editing, the CGI, and all other technical aspects of the movie are well above par. Bottom line - great fun movie with some added value to boot. Go see it, you'll have a blast.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie was entertaining and the jungle never had a dull moment. I looked forward to every conversation between the characters and I appreciated the bond that developed within them.
The movie does have its flaws though. For example, the movie is predictable and lacks even the slightest bit of suspense. Also I found it more comedic than emotional. Nothing in the movie actually made me feel emotional towards any character, well aside from Alex naming his daughter after the girl who saved his life. 
The pre-jungle part of the film isn't the most interesting thing in the world. The movie starts to get interesting after Dwayne Johnson lands on his feet in Jumanji.
If you're in for a really good time, and you wanna have a couple of laughs doing so, go watch this movie. Aside from the flaws I listed, ITS THE BOMB","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Some nice tear-jerking moments. If you're a jaded movie-goer - especially if you.ve seen the first Jumanji - you'll find the movie very predictable, and you'll be very happy about it. It's very rewarding to figure out whats going to happen ahead of time. You'll be telling yourself yep, I knew that was going to happen. You'll also have a big grin on your face. It's a pleasant movie, what else can I say? The best part is the chemistry between the actors. The main cast is amazing. All of them are at their best.

Now, two decades on, comes a sequel-slash-remake, ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle."" It's a lazy, thoroughly unoriginal bit of storytelling, but it has just enough cheeky humor and bass-thumping action scenes to be a potential crowd-pleaser.In the original, all the mayhem was controlled by the roll of the dice. Now it seems the game has dispensed with any notion of fair play. After gathering dust for decades, it's discovered by another teenager in the 1990s, but this time it gets tossed aside in favor of the latest video game. So it promptly transforms itself into a Nintendo knockoff to kidnap yet another victim.Flash-forward to today, where we meet a quartet of teenage stereotypes out of central casting: two nerds, a jock and a cheerleader who spends her time composing selfies for her Instagram following. After landing in detention together, they stumble on an old console and fire it up, only to find themselves transported to a jungle island and transformed into characters from the game.
Boy nerd gets to marvel at his newfound muscle mass as Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), while girl nerd becomes Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), a scantily clad hottie whose specialties include ""dance fighting.""Meanwhile, the football star loses two feet of height but gains the smart-aleck wit of Kevin Hart as zoologist Moose Finbar. As for our poor cheerleader, she's stuck as Jack Black's ""overweight middle-age man,"" Professor Sheldon Oberon, a true nightmare, at least until she discovers how much easier it is to pee in the jungle with a little extra, um, equipment.And why do video-game characters have bladders to drain in the first place? Shhhh. This isn't the kind of movie you parse for plausibility. Besides, every 13-year-old loves a good penis joke. Or, you know, any number of bad ones.Basically, the ""Jumanji"" sequel is all motorcycle chases, CGI monsters and sticky comedy, with a few half-hearted efforts at character development and plot twists that will be easily forgotten tomorrow. In other words, it's Hollywood formula at its most generic. But if you're into ogling Dwayne Johnson and laughing at Jack Black's insulting caricature of adolescent narcissism, well, don't let a critic harsh your buzz. Turn on, plug in and Rock out.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The girl using her smartphone during a test and gym class was totally unrealistic and annoying. I usually like both The Rock and Jack Black. They were also well cast as the jungle hero and professor. If they had just teamed up the teens with the guys, it might have been a decent movie. But the concept of the teens stuck in adult bodies completely ruined it for me. Unfortunately this made the portrayals of The Rock and Black more ridiculous than funny. Overall, the charm of the original 1995 film was completely missing.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It had a good idea and an excellent actor (the late Robin Williams) but it never reached its full potential. Its scenes often felt like the story was dragged along, the humour was weak and I didn't get attached to any of the characters. Given that sequels rarely surpass the originals I was wary of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.Needless to say, I was pleasantly surplussed. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle features characters that are actually likable and we want them to win, the action scenes keep you at the edge of your seat and it was actually funny. Jack Black was hilarious as a self-absorbed teenage girl trapped in an overweight man's body and he truly stole the show. The morals of the story that are addressed here are timeless and focus on issues that teenagers try to resolve, such as breaking away from the modern-age dependence on social media, the rekindling of friendships that had gone cold over time, and overcoming personal insecurities of inadequacy.Overall, it is a feelgood movie and a fun swashbuckling adventure. I actually walked away from the cinema with a smile on my face.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Since the due date was the next day, we decided to watch it. I knew I wasn't going to like it. Sometimes I'll think I'm not going to like a movie before I watch it, and I usually end up being wrong, but I was right this time. Basically, a group of high school kids get sucked into the Jumanji board game after being sentenced to detention. Once they're in the game, they become the adult, albeit opposite, versions of themselves. There were so many cliches and stereotypes. Right off the bat the teens were unlike-able. They had no moral compass whatsoever, and to be quite honest they came off as spoiled: a nerdy kid who had an iMac in his bedroom (I'm 29, work full time, and can barely afford an HP desktop!), and is helping a classmate cheat by writing his paper for him; the aforementioned classmate who is a jock that bullies the nerdy kid; a ditzy blonde girl who only cares about social media and boys - and then you have an awkward, non-blonde girl who thinks people are always judging her. I am so over the my-life-is-hard-and-no-one-understands-me attitude that Hollywood always writes teenagers as having. Things don't get any easier after high school. In fact, I personally found my 20s to be just as confusing as my teen years. At one point I even wondered if I had obtained the right college degree and thought about going back to school. The teens in this movie are not portrayed as having a difficult life. The nerdy kid has a $2,000 computer in his room, and the blonde girl drives a Mercedes. The jock is a bully, and the other girl is just miserable for no apparent reason. So when they start breaking the rules at school, are we supposed to feel sorry for them?? The pacing of this movie was awful. The beginning was slow. It didn't even seem like it was about anything that had to do with Jumanji, but rather a bunch of teens who were acting rebellious. When they were in the game I got so tired of them stopping on and off to bicker with one another. I felt like I was watching a movie that was geared towards kids. It's rated PG-13, so the target audience was teenagers, but that's an insult to their intelligence, because the action sequences were so phony and stupid (people riding motorcycles through the jungle, and the one girl's power being dance fighting, meaning she can only fight people if music is playing... Really?), that it seemed more entertaining for 10-year-olds than teenagers! It was also mis-casted. Nick Jonas did not fit the role of the kid who had been stuck in the game for decades. And then having Tom Hank's son play the grown up version - that was just nepotism. There are so many people in Hollywood who were born to famous actors, but that doesn't mean they can act. Most of them probably just rode on their parents' coattails (not trying to sound like a hater. I legit cannot think of one actor who is related to famous people, parents or otherwise, that can act. Kate Hudson, Scott Eastwood, Patricia Arquette, Luke and Owen Wilson - I don't think they're talented, but that's just my opinion). The ending was silly and contrived. When they come out of the game, all of them are so well-behaved and kindhearted. As if being trapped in a board game where they got chased by wild animals and repeatedly fell off of cliffs helped them to become wise? Give me a break. It would've been nice to show them apologizing to their teachers for being disrespectful. Of course they have the nerdy guy and awkward girl fall in love. They have a passionate and ridiculously long kiss, which I thought was quite inappropriate for it to be a teen oriented film. I don't know why they can never show boys and girls just being friends. Why does there always have to be a romantic interest? Or better yet, why does the couple have to be a male and female? I can't believe in 2017 screenwriters were still using the same material from the 1980s.I don't plan on watching this again. I had to get up early the next morning for work, and I completely wasted my whole evening. This movie was incredibly lame. The language and sexual content were so unnecessary. I'm surprised there wasn't any toilet humor. After roaming around the jungle for hours on end nobody ever had to pee? And what was up with the girly blonde chick who actually liked having male genitals when she turned into Jack Black's character?? It wasn't outright stated, but it was implied a couple of times. That was disturbing.Do yourself a favor and skip this one. I don't want anyone to waste their time like I did.","2 out of 14 found this helpful.

I am not particularly a fan of the 1995 film but I would still say that I had a good time watching the film. The announcement of this film quite astonished me and the trailers for the film seemed OK. I was actually surprised as to how much I liked the film.Plot: Spencer, Martha, Bethany and Anthony are all sucked into the video game Jumanji where their only way to survive is to finish the game.Story and direction: Sony is mostly famous for taking something that is famous and turning it so commercial that the profit is earned but the quality is very bad. But this film understands that it has to deliver, quality wise. I wouldn't say the story has groundbreaking elements or things that we haven't seen before, but the film manages to entertain. I liked the way we have troubled characters that are sucked into one situation and their only way out is if they work with one another. Also very nicely incorporated is the video game aspect of Jumanji. WE have a life bar, character strengths and weaknesses, non player characters, exposition that helps us understand what the game is. This entire world of Jumanji seems very much believable (because of it being a video game world). The action sequences were good and nicely done. However, there were one or two places where horrible VFX (or green screen) has been used to execute the action sequences. The score by Henry Jackman also adapts to the situation and adds something refreshing to the film. My other problem with the film is that certain scenes are not explained very properly. They seemed to have just let that go for the sake of it. Performances: Dwayne Johnson is good what he does. Kevin Hart did add his touch of comedy to the film. Karen Gillian's character was different and I liked it. I didn't understand the casting of Nick Jonas since he wasn't acting at all. Jack Black was the surprise package. I know he is good, but in here he is the highlight of the film. Rhys Darby, Rohan Chand and Bobby Cannavale did provide good supporting roles. Even the teenagers in the real world delivered compelling performances.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Bethany (in Sheldon Oberon's body) teaches Martha (in Ruby Roundhouse's body) how to flirt with someone. I can seriously say that I laughed so hard in the scene because of its awkwardness and absurdity.Verdict: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is a good follow-up to the 1995 film. I was highly entertained by the film and had a very good time. I don't know what the sequel in 2019 will consist of as no room was left for a third instalment.I am going with an 8/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was gladly proven wrong! This film is based after Jumanji and is through a video game which is more with the times rather than board games, not only this but it is based around two people who are more nerds/geeks (one male and one female) and two of the popular group (one male and one female). As you see them coming to terms with their new characters and making it so that the popular ones are the more weak characters who aren't as popular and vice versa it made the film something for everyone. The casting for this film was amazing and having such amazing actors who made this film hilarious making me even cry with tears at some points. Not only this but there later on in the film there is a part where there is a mention of Alan who was Robin Williams character in the original film. To me this was a perfect way to honor him and the film franchise by acknowledging this and not trying to make it a remake but just a more modern film which shows where Alan was trapped within the game and why he was so scared about what was inside the game itself. This film is amazing and I couldn't praise it high enough and it is a film that is perfect for the whole family.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Bringing the board game into the video game age was something I was at first skeptical about, but ultimately it worked very well, in addition to casting adults as opposed to a majority children cast.Having two separate generations come together between the 1990's culture meeting 2000's culture was a another brilliant idea.This is a movie I could watch more than once.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The reasons I didn't give it a 10 rating are the CGI for some of Ruby Roundhouse could have been much better and the penis jokes didn't make the movie any funnier so they could have been left out, movies parents and their children would like to watch together don't need that.
As for some of the bad reviews I've read, I don't know what they are looking for in what can be defined as slapstick comedy. One reviewer was talking about plot holes and others just said it wasn't funny at all. This isn't a movie that makes you ""think"" so looking for plot holes is a waste. If you don't think this was funny then you don't have a sense of humor.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Jumanji Turns into a New Generation of Games","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4098401/?ref_=tt_urv","iamianiman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur58447224/?ref_=tt_urv","20 March 2018","It has been over 20 years since the release of the original Jumanji, and quite honestly, I never once thought about ever needing a sequel or revamp of that classic material. I mean, just over ten years ago we saw a great little film in Zathura, so I had my fill of this type of movie. That being said, I never thought I'd be writing a review that tells people to go out and see a film that completely altered what the original film was, but here I am. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a really fun time at the movies. I won't be comparing it to the original because they both fit their times. Although it's not without its issues, here's why I believe Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle deserves to be seen in theatres. Being a fan of the original film, I wasn't too keen on the video game aspect that this sequel was injecting into the franchise, but it really worked for me in the context of the story. As the film follows four very generically-stereotyped characters in Spencer, Fridge, Bethany, and Martha, they find themselves stuck in detention after school hours. Coming across an old video game console, they plug it into the television and are sucked into the world of Jumanji. Yes, the question everyone will be asking is how the board game is now a video game, but the movie does a solid job in nodding to the fans about that. After being sucked into the game, they become the avatars they chose. The characters, played by Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan are all fantastic here, playing though they're still their outside selves. This aspect is what makes the movie worth it because it allows them to discover new things about themselves, either giving them bravery or realizing life is just fine for them in the outside world. The morals of the story and the climax itself has been seen in thousands of movies throughout the years, but it's all about how a movie is executed these days, and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle sucks you in with these characters and provides a very fun adventure, for the most part. This film asks you to pretend that you're actually in a video game with these characters, so repetitive dialogue from secondary characters can become hilarious if you're thinking with that mindset, but also odd for those who are unfamiliar with video games. This brings me to my biggest negative about this movie, because a video game follows either one or multiple characters at the same time, making discoveries along the way. A video game never cuts away to show other plot-lines forming, but this movie does feel like an actual movie at times, cutting away to the villain of the story, who's also the weakest aspect of it as well. The villain, played by Bobby Cannavale (who I'm actually a huge fan of as an actor), is far too over-the-top in this role, which can be funny at times, but it feels out of place when placing random scenes of him and his henchmen throughout the movie.Personally, this portion of the film annoyed me and I couldn't wait to get back to the central characters. In the end, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is fun for fans of the original, providing winks and nods to the first film throughout the movie, as well as providing a fun adventure for all newcomers. From bumping into characters like Alex (Nick Jonas) in order to add some emotional aspects, to having some pretty cool action sequences, to providing humor that both adults and kids can laugh at, I didn't have any glaring issues with the film itself, aside from the incredibly annoying villain subplot. Overall, although not complex in the slightest, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fun time at the movies, plain and simple.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

What really makes a huge difference is that the sequel has a consistent emotional tone unlike the more erratic original which waivered between comedy and horror and serious drama. The humor is also more rich in terms of gender bending and the solid comedy derived from the script instead of the singular efforts of Robin Williams in the original. Karen Gillian also deserves some credit for her performance and her ability to capture both her Jumanji character as well as the meek, nerdy high school girl. The only seemingly faint weaknesses come in the form of the overly dramatized motorcycle scene and the rhino scenes which could both been more carefully scripted in a more realistic formula (too many motorcycles and the practical speed of rhinos versus helicopters) and the to be expected but quite poignant moments as well as attempts at coming of age attitudinal changes that in a few places almost came across more superficially brief than genuine. Nevertheless, this sequel succeeds well in this depiction of a video game and tantalizing use of special character powers and game lives. The pacing, the fun irony, the action, the human messages, and the performances all come together in this entertaining and captivating movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

All the actors are charismatic. The adventure in Jumanji's game is fast but not so fast that you can't play with what these people are going through. They land some good jokes too, and even if the majority aren't, they don't hurt the movie.""The Rock"" acted as a different kind of guy (a nerd with his body) and he did an excellent job. And because I usually don't like him much, that fact might've help me to enjoy his presence more. Everybody acts really well as sterotypes imprisoned on other stereotypes' bodies. Its good writing.The movie manages to give you tension (like a game when you start dying) without taking away any of the fun, which sounds easier than it is.The evolution of the characters' mindsets are a bit cliché, but earned.Last: This movie shows that Karen Gillan is a real actress and not just a skinny lady. She acts the hell of the role, she's funny and weird, while she's intense and funny as Nebula for the MCU. Sold!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

RATING: 3.7/5Well that was a pleasant surprise. Definitely turned out being a lot better than i thought it would. Kevin Hart and The Rock are a good comedy duo, that are probably not going anywhere anytime soon. Jack Black was pretty good, and i actually wish they would have done more with him. Karen Gillen has the potential to be a good comedic actress, if she gets the chance. I remember how good she was on her ""Selfie"" TV show, so i know she has potential, and it's nice to see it used here to a degree.For those that don't know, i majored in Game Design, so it was really interesting for me to see how this movie played with video game tropes. They did a pretty solid job, especially for a video game with no tutorial or instruction manual. For people that don't play video games, this is a pretty decent introduction into the medium, and what you can expect from video games. It's even interesting how you see the characters use the games rules to their advantage, it's actually used in a clever way. Being that Jumanji is a video game, you also get a generic video game bad guy, which was fine because he wasn't the point of the movie. The whole point of Jumanji is to beat the game and get home, so the villain is really just a tool for the game to throw at you.I think what surprised me the most, was the movie's meta narrative choices. It had something to say about your strengths, weaknesses, team work, life. I think the one that hit home the most was the narrative about making the most of the life you have, considering the characters had 3 lives in the game. Yeah, it was semi obvious about it, but it never dwelled on it long enough for you to get annoyed or roll your eyes either. The message really hit home by the time you got to the end of the movie.I never laughed out loud or anything, but i did get some good laughs here and there, and the overall message was definitely a good one. If you want to have a good time at the movies, this holiday season, Jumanji might be the movie for you.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Jack Black absolutely crushed it as Bethany and made for some of my favorite moments.There were a few cheesy pieces of dialogue and some effects that were a little too video game-esque. However, as a whole this film was a surprise joy and a treat to watch.Additional thought: The later scene in front of the Vreeke house was one of the best moments of the film.

So, anyway, this is about what you'd expect from a Kevin Hart and the Rock movie, good, funny, kinda dumb. It's very funny, but it is simple, and doesn't give much more meaning than what is displayed directly on screen. There are quite a few good jokes that weren't spoiled by any of the trailers. It has more story than Central Intelligence, but not as many jokes. It also has more character development and more complex jokes. I honestly prefer Jumanji to Central Intelligence, merely because it is more complex than other Dwayne Johnson movies. Getting into the nitty-gritty details, the camera angles during the fight scenes are completely awful, with that whiplash-inducing cut every second mentality that seems to be becoming ever more common in Hollywood movies. The acting is good, I mean it has Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black, so how bad could it be? The writing is also pretty good as well. There was really only one joke that really grated me, as well as the fact that nothing was explained about the game itself. Being a geek myself it really frustrated me that they didn't go deeper into this anonymous video game console, but at this point I am nitpicking. I don't want to spoil anything, but the way that the game ends makes it very unlikely that there will be a remake, which in my opinion would have been cool to see.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I saw the film with the two stars at the Dubai International Film Festival.Haven't seen the first Jumanji movie, I had no idea how the movie is going to be. The film started like a usual teenage movie. Later, it was one of the best comedy adventure movies I have seen.4 students were sent to detention. They found an old video game and decided to play it. Apparently they were sucked into the game and the fun begins. In the game, they adopted the body of the characters they choose. They had weakness and power.A guaranteed entertainer. This movie will never let you down. Go ahead and watch it.

It is PG-13, not PG. And, boy, does it earn that 13. Although the movie is hilarious, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself, a lot of the dialogue is really crass. There are sexual references and profanity throughout the film. I'd say if you were okay with your kid watching the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies, it's about that same level, but I still urge you to use your discretion. I think the idea behind this was ""This is for the kids who grew up with the 1995 original and are adults now so let's make it ""edgy."""" So dumb, and so unnecessary. As for the quality of the actual film, I did enjoy it. I was worried that the jokes would get stale, especially since for the most part they are essentially repeated, but they actually got funnier as the film went on. It took the original premise, set it in modern day, and actually had a pretty good message behind it about loving yourself for who you are and making the most of life. So it's a shame this had to be so crass. What were you thinking, Sony? I thought the film was hilarious in the parts that weren't crass and those really worked, so why couldn't the whole film have been like this? It would have actually been better as a PG. Making something more ""adult"" ironically makes it more ""childish."" There was a parent at my screening who brought their young child to this film and they left halfway through because she got sick of all the inappropriate dialogue and innuendo. (Which I realize is redundant). This felt like a parody of the original, while also honoring the original, (including a mild 5-second shoutout to Robin Williams' character from the original) and had some good action scenes. It's not only a mild parody of adventure games but also the tropes of the characters from those games. (Invincible hero, smart mouthed comic relief, strong female character). It was clever and I can tell the actors had a lot of fun making it. At points, it even felt like a Guardians of the Galaxy film. So, yeah, great, hilarious movie. Just don't take your young kids to it.

The novel concept, brilliant acting & intriguing script made it one of the most entertaining films of the year. People of all ages loved it. Is the new version of the cult favorite as good as the original? 
Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is a story about four high school students placed in detention together, who discover the five player action player called Jumanji. The writers have smartly included all the stereotypical high school students - the nerd, the football star, the babe & the shy bookworm. Everybody who has been through high school thus has that one character they can relate to. They all end up choosing avatars who are polar opposites to their real life identities. Spencer the nerd, chooses Dr Smolder Bravestone - a 6 ft 5 inches tall archaeologist & explorer. Bethany the pretty & self centred cheer leader becomes Sheldon ""Shelly"" Oberon (Jack Black)-a cartographer, a cryptographer, an archaeologist . Football Jock Fridge chooses to become Franklin Finbar(Kevin Hart) - a short zoologist & weapons valet. Bookworm Martha Kaply chooses to become Ruby Roundhouse(Karen Gillan) - a commando, martial arts expert & a dance fighter. They all have three lives. If they lose all their three lives in the game, they actually die in the real world. They all have their strengths & weaknesses. They learn from Nigel, an NPC guide that Van Pelt wants to obtain a Jewel - Jaguar's Eye, which gives him power to manipulate all the animals in Jumanji. It is up to to our four heroes & another character Alex Vreeke - who chooses the character of Jefferson McDonough to return the jewel to the jaguar statue & shout ""Jumanji"". 
The movie kept us entertained throughout & kept us glued to our seats. Some of the situations & dialogues were outright funny. Dwayne Johnson sticks to his strength - action. He has several action packed scenes to showcase his bravado & he doesn't disappoint. Jack Black nails his act of a cheerleader trapped in a obese cartographer's body. Kevin Heart is funny as the short zoologist. His scenes with Dwayne Johnson are hilarious. Karen Gillan is eye candy & plays her part convincingly.
Viewers who haven't seen the original will find the reboot thoroughly entertaining. But those who have seen the original will be a tad disappointed. The anxiety viewers felt every time the characters in the original rolled the dice, could not be replicated in the movie. The board game provided much more fodder for entertainment as compared to the console version. Hence while the board game version became a cult favorite, the new one will be soon forgotten.
We would recommend you to not miss watching the movie at a theatre near you & not miss the 3-D effects. Do take kids along. They will love this one.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Rare sequel that improves on the original","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4565137/?ref_=tt_urv","jezfernandez","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37475696/?ref_=tt_urv","6 January 2019","I recall watching the original movie 3 times at the cinema when it first came out in 1995. It's an enjoyable ride and the late Robin Williams infuses the story with warmth and heart. Trouble is, Jumanji's plot was nothing to write home about. All the players had to do was roll the dice and attempt to survive whatever horrors flew out of the game.Jake Kasdan's sequel is a much smarter and involved effort - the players actually need to interact with the game if they're ever to escape and go home. In this sense, Welcome To The Jungle shares key similarities with Spielberg's Ready Player One. More significantly, both movies resonate with a modern audience who live and breathe interactive media.Kasdan adds multiple layers to this story, most notably in the way he juxtaposes the lead characters with their avatars. You don't get much bigger and stronger than Dwayne Johnson, yet the character isn't really Smolder Bravestone - it's Spencer, the nervy nerd with a host of allergies and a fear of squirrels. Karen Gillan excels as Martha, clearly appalled at having to live in the body of Lara Croft (sorry, Ruby Roundhouse). ""Why am I wearing this outfit in a jungle? Tiny, little shorts and a leather halter top. I mean, what is this?""Perhaps best of all is the genius move of having the gorgeous, self-obsessed Bethany (Madison Iseman) wind up in the game as an overweight, middle-aged male professor. Jack Black had a blast playing a narcissistic 16-year old and absolutely nails it.The film is a riot and Kasdan manages to balance the action with plausible character development. Mercifully, Kevin Hart (just about) stays on the right side of that very thin funny/annoying line. The action scenes are extremely well done and the characters are often in genuine peril. A canyon helicopter ride is particularly nail-biting and the solution to numerous life-or-death dilemmas come in surprising ways.If you enjoyed Jumanji, don't expect a glossy retread - Welcome To The Jungle truly ups the game. Go ahead and roll the dice; this one's a winner.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji--you must survive it. To beat the game and return to the real world, they'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, discover what Alan Parrish left 20 years ago, and change the way they think about themselves--or they'll be stuck in the game forever...I liked this movie so much, it's unique and better than the first Jumanji, but Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle isn't a sequel, it stands on it's own.Anyways, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is full of action sequences which were very good, very talented performances in the world of Jumanji, but in the real life, the performances were bad, and it takes to another thing I hated about this movie, I didn't see so much of Jumanji or lots of animals as I expected to see. The CGI of the animals wasn't that good anyway. The story is really good, I loved every sequence of this movie, it's like video game but a movie, I loved it! The sense of humor of this movie is really funny, I liked that , but Kevin Hart with Dwayne Johnson scene was so Central Intelligence, I didn't that, but I laughed though.I liked Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle very much and I'm gonna give it a B+.Thank you, guys as always for reading my review, I hope you liked it, and I welcome all of your comments.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What makes this film work is the script and overall character performances. Lead by Dwayne the Rock Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan, the chemistry among them is the undersell.The action blends in well with the comedy, as it isn't too vulgar and not too silly but with a well balance between clever and some silly gags. It also doesn't completely force itself like many comedies do nowadays. Most of the comedy does come from the characters interactions among themselves as well as the situation they are in.A sequel to this film was inevitable due to the amount of money this movie made at the box, which appears to be coming out towards the end of this year. Now it somewhat feels like a rush and people will of course expect something as great or on par as this film, which is why I think the sequel won't be as good. Simply because what more can they improve on, and how to keep it fresh. Only speculation but hoping for the best for the sequel of course. No doubt it will be a big success (perhaps not as big as this film but none the less it should still be a hit). Highly recommend","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The original Jumaji is so much better than this and it is over 28 years old; that means this movie should not have been made. e are a advanced society compared to 1995.

Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black are all perfectly cast and have excellent chemistry. One likes to think this likeable group had fun making the movie, but who knows really. This movie is fun from beginning to end and is rewatchable on occasion. The ending provides good closure, and the end-credit illustrations are a nice touch, acting as a low-key coda (using thoughtful references to imagery from the film).The character dialogue is a huge part of the fun (and adds to the chemistry). There are many LOL lines; some are quotable. The Rock does an excellent job role-playing the nerd inhabiting his body; similar comments can be made about the other three. All four stars are capable of carrying a film on their own, so getting them together for this production was smart and a big win. Dwayne Johnson is listed as an executive producer, so his casting choice was obviously pre-ordained. How exactly the other actors got onboard is probably something I will track down; there's got to be some behind-the-scenes trivia online.I give this INSPIRED film 7.5 stars for entertainment value (complete with many clever and hilarious details -- see review title) with a half-star bonus for Karen Gillan and her Ruby Roundhouse outfit (OH yeah). That's eight (8) stars total.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Wow, honestly was not expecting this to be as awesome as it is and while it took me a while to watch it I was not disappointed. Without offering any spoilers I will say that this film offers some really great action and all the cast offer some fantastic moments throughout that will bring a smile to your face and keep you laughing throughout. There is a simple story but its simplicity alongside some fine action, cgi work and the great cast creating fantastic comedic moments you will not be disappointed by taking a trek in the jungle with this ensemble.
Personally would like to say that Jack Black stole the show, noting against the fine work of Johnson, Hart & Gillian but for him to act like he did in this role will instantly have you in stitches.
A great family film that is fun for all ages !

Four teenagers in detention stumble across a video game called Jumanji and decide to play it. Upon starting the game, they are sucked in and discover that the only way to get back to the real world is by finishing the game.
A brilliantly written, well-executed movie. When I watched this, some of it reminded me of Raiders of the Lost Ark and it turns out that it was directed by the son of the guy who wrote the screenplay for Raiders! And he does an excellent, excellent job.
Dwayne Johnson is so darn hilarious in this movie! He is playing a scared-of-everything, ill-confident, awkward teenager stuck in a muscly action hero/leader avatar and he does it sooo well! The character is so polar opposite to every other role I've seen Johnson in that I wouldn't have believed that Johnson could do it if I didn't watch it for myself. He is utterly convinces you that he really is a skinny awkward teenager stuck in a handsome muscular avatar (no, I don't have a crush of him). The role is both for and against Johnson. I was laughing so much watching Johnson in this role. He's the only one who could do his character as well as he does.
Everyone does their roles really, really well and really fit their characters. It's funny, full of action, and close shaves.
Love it and am looking forward to the sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

certainly the reviews and the unexpected success at the box office had convinced me to give him a chance, so that in the end I joined the wide audience who decided to go and see it at the cinema, during the holiday season.
Well I must say that the first part was also convincing me of the opposite, with a good start, the pleasant lines, often zany and some of which citationists and referienzal (types of jokes that I prefer), pretty action scenes and functional gags , thanks for the most part to the discreet interpretations of the protagonists.
But all this refers only to a promising first part, let's say the first forty minutes of film, because after them the film begins to collapse like a house of cards on a windy day.
The causes are many but the main ones are a screenplay that with the going of the minutes becomes more and more tired and weak, characters to which you are not attached ever despite the attempts of the actors that between voices, visual expressions over the lines, and frantic and exaggerated stunt, try in every way possible to save the film in vain (apparently for many, however, worked), but at least they make up most of the merits of the film, especially Jack Black.
In addition in the film is missing a real villan, the film tries to characterize two, the island itself with its various challenges, and Van Pelt (interpreted trivially by Bobby Cannavale), but neither is sufficiently developed or exploited as it should , especially the second that ends up being useless to say the least.
Towards the end the film proves to be a continuous repetition of jokes and gags, one similar to the other, but less brilliant, less citationist, less amusing, the same is true for the various sequences of action that follow each other without any connection as if they were simple steps and, if for a video game this is fine, for a film is not so, making it simply not fun, not very engaging but quite boring and repetitive.
Too bad because some good ideas are there but most of them are not developed at all, or superficially developed, so in the end what could be a good comedy action movie that paid homage to the original Jumanji and to the world of videogames in a self-ironic, idiotic (but cleverly) and original way has turned into a flat, tasteless, anonymous and, I repeat, boring Blockbuster.
However, I am glad that most of the audience this new ""Jumanji"" liked, I hope in a second vision, maybe in Blu Ray and in the original language (here in Italy in the cinema the movies are dubbed in our language), that manages to convince me.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Their appearances are also changed into the video game characters.This is really a very cool movie. I love everything about it. The characters are realistic and have great development.

"5","/10","Ambitious, but ultimately fell short","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4025316/?ref_=tt_urv","chestern-80136","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur83651465/?ref_=tt_urv","6 January 2018","Before I start this review, I feel I must preface it quickly. I have never seen the original 1995 release (I was only born in 1999) so I can't comment on any links it may share with the 2017 addition. Also, I watched it in a 4D showing, and as a result, I may have missed certain elements due to being tossed around etc. With that aside, I shall proceed. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is an interesting, if seemingly confused film. Directed by Jake Kasdan, the film seems uncertain as to what it wants to be. Upon googling the genre, one can find five listed by the search engine: Action, adventure, comedy, fantasy and Family. Already, that's a handful. Romance subplots are also attempted, in addition to moments which seem to be attempting to invoke horror. Despite it's 12A rating, it seemed determined to squeeze as many curse words as they could, and while there was very little actual blood, the violence was cranked up as far as they dared. You see a man get mauled by a hippopotamus, another erupt into an explosion, a gunshot wound etc. I feel it's rather safe to say it attempted to please everybody. In doing so, it's failed to please me. I would much rather a film focus on a few things and excel, rather than trying to do everything and winding up mediocre at best.Boasting a very respectable 77% on rotten tomatoes, at first glance it may seem that i'm the minority in my low to middling opinions on the film. Upon further examination, however, it seems that many critics were instead rather uninterested by the film. Currently, it's average critic rating is a 6.1. This doesn't mean it's a bad film by any means, but it instead shows how the 'Tomatometer' can occasionally be misleading. Were it rated at a 5.9, I believe the film would no longer be eligible for a fresh rating, let alone the 'certified fresh' it has received.Overall, I feel the main issue was the writing. I feel very little effort was put into the writing, particularly regarding the dialogue. Much of it felt clumsy, and painfully cheesy at times. It was so distracting that at one point my sister, who had seen (and enjoyed) the film at a previous date, leaned across to let me know I might cringe at the next scene. for myself personally, I didn't find it any more painful that the rest of the film. For other viewers, however, it may be an issue.The performances, overall, were actually one of the stronger points of the film. While the actors had to deal with the previously mentioned poor dialogue, many of the actors were able to do their job well. Jack Black, though I found his character infuriating at times, was consistent, and the audience I was with seemed to enjoy his antics. Karen Gillan portrayed a shy teenage girl notably well, and I was even pleasantly surprised by Nick Jonas (yes, I had to google which brother it was). Jonas's character of Alex was even given a mature, bittersweet ending. Without spoiling specifics of the film, his character's end was different to the rest of the team. Unfortunately, it also raised some questions about the other character's conclusions, and the specific rules within which this world operates. Regardless of the confusion, I also found the ending unsatisfying, and feel the film would have benefited by cutting off the last three minutes or so.Many of the CG effects were rather disappointing, that may be attributed to the budget. Hiring a handful of big-name stars presumably took a big chunk from the $100 million or so budget. The animals looked poor at times, and some of the CGI stunts were lacklustre, rather ironically looking more at home in a video game. Additionally, the villain was entirely forgettable. Bobby Cannavale's portrayal wasn't bad, the writing just made him feel almost entirely useless. The plot would have worked just as well if he wasn't present.With this being said, many of the shots were actually quite impressive. The one that stood out to me was quite a simple one. At one point in the film, a row of torches light up through the jungle. Though simple, the contrast between the blazing torches, and the inky blackness of the jungle at night was truly impressive, particularly due to the staggered ignition of the flames. It seemed as though the pathway was carving itself through the trees when the film cut to a wider shot.Overall, I found this film a real mix. Ultimately, out of ten, I feel I have to give it a five. That isn't to say it's a consistent, comfortable five, however. At times, the film sinks to a three. At others, the moments you'd go to see the film for, it raises to perhaps a seven. I'm simply giving what I feel would be an average for the film as a whole. If you're a fan of the cast, I'd imagine you'll enjoy the film; both Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart barely seem to be playing characters, and while I don't particularly enjoy them, they have good chemistry and work well off of each other. Obviously, if you're looking for a serious film with a strong moral, this film isn't for you; it ultimately boils down to 'be happy with yourself'. Whether you look like a WWE superstar or not.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

Everyone shines in their own way. You would think one of the actors/actress would not play the part of the teens that well but boy did they succeed. This movie is hilarious with its constant jokes. I laughed at every joke. The adventure of getting there was also fun. It feels like you're actually playing the video game.
Dwayne Johnson plays the nerdy kid who shines as the leader. Karen Gillan plays as the introverted kid who is awkward but cute. Kevin Hart is the funny jock who has lost half his height and is now taken down a couple notches. And Jack Black is honestly the best of them all. He made me laugh and smile. He plays the teen girl who is self absorbed and is phone dependent. He aced playing her. He was exactly like almost every teen girl today. Nick Jonas was a great surprise too.

And, when I heard that they were making a sequel to this film 22 years later and starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, I thought ""no thanks"" and even skipped seeking it out at movie theaters over the winter, even after I heard that it was ""pretty fun"".I finally caught up to it on a recent flight and I have to admit - I was wrong for skipping this film JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is a fun romp with The Rock ably filling the lead role, aided by a strong supporting cast.JUMANJI was about a board came come to life. JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE has the same board game that morphs itself into a video game and when 4 High Schoolers stumble across it while serving detention, well...comedy - and adventure - ensue.The four high schoolers are typical THE BREAKFAST CLUB stereotypes. The nerdy boy, the hot girl, the jock boy and the dorky girl. When these four are transported into the game they take on the outward appearance - and skills - of their video game characters - the nerdy body becomes the dashing hero (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). The hot girl becomes the dumpy (male!) professor (Jack Black). The jock becomes the un-athletic short kid (Kevin Hart) and the dorky girl becomes the kick-ass girl (Karen Gillan). It is the 4 actors playing their high school counterparts in their bodies that is the core of this film - and the center of the charm and fun of this film. All 4 shine. Johnson and Hart (back together after CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE) show that the chemistry they showed with each other in the previous film is no fluke. Gillan (Nebula in the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY films) shows that she can do kick-ass well - and with a wink in her eye. But it is the performance of Black that steals things. Someone said to me that Black was made to play a ""hot high school girl"" and I would have to agree. He almost steals the movie.Director Jake Kasdan (the TV series NEW GIRL) understands what kind of film that he is making, so keeps the fun and action going at a superficial, almost cartoon level, never really stopping to breathe (or to think). He keeps things light - and family friendly - with just enough ""almost"" dirty jokes to keep young and old alike interested. It earns - but never crosses the line - of it's PG-13 rating. There is talk of a sequel, and I, for one, am looking forward to it.Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I see all these terrible reviews (about half) and can't help but wonder what those people were expecting. Seems like a bunch of hoity-toities who probably should go watch Titanic some more and stop trying to ruin the fun for would-be viewers.This movie had me laughing pretty hard. Those who said ""stereotypical characters"" obviously missed the point. Jack Black and Dwayne Johnson stole the show early on and everyone else rocked it as well.I can't help think but the ones who left poor reviews either don't like comedy or maybe don't enjoy the cast, which blows my mind. Maybe there was a little to be desired from the story, but it seems mainly for a younger audience, so...
Take it for what it is and try not to take it too seriously: IT IS A COMEDY, and it is very silly.I like the video game implementations and yes, that made it a little predictable, but didn't steal anything away from the possible enjoyment.
Killer movie. Not to be compared to the original movie, which seemed more aimed for kids, where this new version/sequel (?) was more aimed for comedy. I loved it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

He brought the kooky, hilarious and sweetness of Robin Williams and put it on display for us all in a wonderfully hilarious performance.
Years ago I used to also think Jack Black was only good for slap stick comedy. But he has become one of my favorite actors. From The Holiday, to The Clock Hidden in the Wall, to Jumanji, he is so versatile.And I thought they did a great job continuing the Jumanji story. Honoring R.W. with the side note to the home he made in the Jumanji world. And they did a great job exploring how devastating the game can be to ones left behind, and to ones left inside.It was so funny, I can only imagine Robin looking down and laughing like crazy as well!So proud of a Sony for doing an amazing job at making a movie worthy of the original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It knows what it is and what it wants to be and executes it very well. The humor actually lands and makes you laugh, and it was really fun to see all of these actors out of their type casts' (except for Kevin Hart). I remember not really liking the original as a kid because I thought it was boring, so I didn't bother to watch this until four years after it came out, and its MUCH more entertaining. It moves at a fast-pace, with the perfect balance of team-building, comedy and action. And yes, they could've gone a little deeper with some of the relationships, but you aren't here to watch that. You're here to watch a cool, action-packed adventure movie, with high stakes and entertaining dialogue and humor. The only real fault I see, is the villain who was pretty boring and just creepy and one-dimensional in my opinion, but it makes sense considering that most video game villains are one-dimensional guys, which is cool. All in all, great movie, highly recommend.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can honestly say the original gave me nightmares and I can't imagine that happening to the kids who watch the new franchise because there's a care to make sure the fun scenes aren't too fight-inducing. This leads me to believe that the original intent of Jumanji wasn't just as a nightmare-delivery vehicle but had aims for more wholesome entertainment.Like the old version with Robin Williams, this modern version runs the risk of simply being a star vehicle since Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and the Rock are all name brands that consume movies with their own persona. It's a pleasant surprise that the film can maintain an ensemble feel. The film's humor rarely relies on Kevin Hart's stand-up persona or Jack Black's stoner persona. Instead, the two are stretched outside of their muscle memory (Black has been doing this for ages but it's a bigger surprise in a good way Kevin Hart that he can do this) to serve a larger story.The film wisely begins with a breakfast club feel but moves away from it pretty quickly and doesn't necessarily make the characters antagonistic enough towards one another that they would need major walls broken down before them before the game starts. One of the outcasts and popular kids, in fact, used to be friends with one another.The film is full of adventure, camaraderie, and a certain amount of humor. It also has a lot of world-building or internal logic that can make a Summertime blockbuster deep enough to lend itself to multi-layered thinking.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While some click, most of them crumble under the pressure to shake off the barrage of comparisons that would be thrown at the movie. Last couple of years saw such horrible reboots like Jurassic World, The Mummy, Kong: Skull Island. But much like Spiderman: Homecoming, Jumanji succeeds to impress the viewers. Jumanji gets a modern age makeover where now instead of a board game it is a video game. Four teenagers with varying personalities are put together in a detention. Here they discover the Jumanji video game and enter the world of Jumanji as their avatars. Then starts the fun ride. There are enough plot holes like how did the video game end up in a high school from Alex's freak house. The movie uses time tested cliche - Four teenagers with some flaw realize their shortcomings when (literally) seen from some other's point of view. But the fun parts of the movie makes us forget them, at least till the movie ends.The movie does not take itself seriously, and that is a huge plus point. The plot of the movie is crazy, there are man eating albino (what?!) rhinos on one side and villainous henchmen with crazy mud racing bike skills on the other side. But such craziness has been ridiculed in the movie itself, which makes you fall in love with it more.The bigger plus for the movie has been the performance of the lead actors. All of them have created niche for themselves in the film industry. Jumanji has used such niche beautifully and built very funny characters. Parts where Dwayne Johnson(Spencer) stops to admire his own physique will have you in splits. Not to mention his hilarious display of 'smoldering intensity'. Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart and Jack Blake as a women in a man's body is perfect. Karen Gillan, who is this mean Nebula in MCU, comes up with a very charming performance.All in all, Jumanji is a movie that you can watch without any regret. It will make you gasp, wonder and laugh hysterically. It is definitely worth a watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If they did the same board game then people would be comparing and complaining.I like these kind of sequels, other movies that try to different than original were Cars 2, Ralph Breaks Internet; but those weren't great themselves but Jumanji:Welcome to the Jungle stands on its own feet.Great casting choices. Jack Black has so much fun playing Bathany and the pee scene is one of the best comedy scene I have seen in a while. Rock and Hart has great comedy ( btw I hated central intelligence). Karen Gillan, her introvert counterpart, trying to be sexy and kick ass was hell of a lot of fun. Her complaining about tiny cloths are some great meta jokes about entertainment industry.Story and plot progressing were bad but its a video game and the writers have so much fun taking liberties with it that I have no problems with that.Some good thrills were brought with the concept of 3 lives and game over. All 4 characters finding about themselves and discovering the new rules and mythology with the audiences were great. Rock,Karen and Jack brings something new to the table but Kevin Hurt plays himself, while some jokes did land pretty well.One of the most funniest, highly entertaining comedies of this time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Jumanji sets a great standard on what all to do in such a movie. First and foremost, this is not a movie that is related much to the original Robin Williams movie. The game itself is the only thing in common between the two, and that too is a cameo. So the game transforms itself into a video game to lure the young of today who are no longer interested in board games. So we have 4 high school kids who happen to find this game and end up being stuck into to, having to win it in order to get back to their real lives.1. The first thing that will impress anyone is that the characters are independent of what your true self is. The characters in the game are the avatars which the players choose to be. So we have a nerdy, thin, afraid, kid Spencer transform into D. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) and so on. The characters are pretty well developed. They take time to adjust to the reality of the game, akin to Neo in the Matrix. They realize that they have powers they can harness and only need to be confident. At the same time they also have limitations set on their avatars by the game. So we can see Dwayne Johnson transform from being Spencer to Dr. Bravestone. The best of the four was perhaps Jack Black who did a great job at portraying an avatar (Prof. Shelly Oberan) of a girl, Bethanie, and all the learning that comes with the change of gender.2. The story line is pretty gamish, which is perfect. The game has not just transformed, it has evolved into a video game. There is a back story to the game that they are stuck in. And this game has levels which need to be cleared. Plus there are side characters in the movie who behave like characters in the game, in the sense that they only have a set of responses to give.3. The music of the move is somewhere in between of an action movie and an adventure movie, which you need if you have The Rock in an adventure film. It isn't grand, but gets the job done.4. First time movie director Jake Kasdan does a great job as far as the action part is concerned. The chase sequences are awesome, in particular the where the gamers have a herd of rhinos on their back. The sequence will get you on the edge of the seat and bite your lips! It was amazing to see how the characters evolve and they each have their strengths which come into the play. The best thing he does is make the movie very unpredictable. The riddles which the game gives to the players sound like one thing, but mean something completely different. And when the true meaning becomes clear to you and the characters, you can't just stop going ""WOW!"" The only thing I found lacking was the use of 3D and I think this would have made just as much impact in 2D. But maybe 3D is the thing to make action movies in these days.Overall it is a great movie to watch and do hit the theater to enjoy it the best.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Yes, it's full of clichés like the nerdy and shy guy becoming the muscle who saves the day and the real-life muscle becoming awkward and insecure and then they realize that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses and so on. There are also two girls who seem to despise the other's way of life and they also realize that the other isn't that bad after all. So yes, it's really basic setting with all that ""emotional growth of characters"" and ""putting totally different and stereotypical people together and they learn to solve problems together"" but still the film manages to be entertaining and great fun.The actors are great, they seem to have good connection and they work well together. Jack Black does good job as ""Bethany"". I usually don't like that much Jack Black's films, but he was really good choice for the role of irritating teenybopper. He really nails this part. I also liked Dwayne Johnson as Spencer. Dwayne Johnson is your typical video game hero, so he fits this role perfectly but I'm glad that his character wasn't just the flawless hero as such but made fun of him being such a beefcake and laughed at the stereotypes. If you are going to make a film with this stereotyped setting, you should be able to laugh at yourself and those stereotypes and this film does that. All those clichés weren't that annoying at all, because the film laughed at them also.For 9 or 10 stars this film should have had also some touching moments that make you cry and the characters should have been more compelling and real and not so stereotypical but all in all, this was entertaining, I liked the jokes and humor of this film and the actors do great job. Good family film that makes you laugh.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Seriously?"". I'm so glad they proved me wrong!! You should not compare it to the first Jumanji, since this movie stands on its own. There are one or two references but that's all and it's ok. Jumanji now turned into a videogame that sucks players into it. It's not explained how or why this happened, but it's a magical game and if we can believe a stampede can come out of it, we can imagine suddenly turning itself into a videogame as the times changed. The teenagers are pretty much stereotypes, the jock, the nerd, the popular blond and the shy one. But once they are in the game, they change. The movie used this change for comedy and surprisingly, it works great!! Dialogues are really funny (and not dumb and cliched, and that's practically a miracle nowadays). Credit goes to the actors who play the videogame characters. They totally make you believe they are the teenagers in those avatars. And the game play is very well done. It's an old school adventure game, where characters have a item box where everything fits, the 3 lives are there, the non-player characters that repeat the same thing, secret passages, hints, the big boss, the map and stuff. It also has a ""smoldering function"" which comes out hilarious on screen. It's not as dark as the first, the animals were more dangerous and Van Pelt was vicious. This is a light comedy, and it works just great!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was a largely depressing experience, it was painfully predictable and the slapstick humor was right out of an episode of Tom and Jerry. Jack Black brought the crude element to this which managed to force a few laughs out of me (the reason why this film made it to a 4).Watching Dwayne Johnson neck on with Karen Gillan (this was too predictable for anyone to consider it a spoiler) made my sick in my lap and hopefully some went in my mum's popcorn.As for the Rock and Kev combo we are seeing lately is overrated, and actually it should be left there because it doesn't deserve anymore thought.

But I found the movie to be fun & fresh while still keeping the spirit of the original, it's a great balance of humor, adventure & action with an intriguing story. Jack Black is by far the best & funniest character, he totally nails the part as a self absorbed teenage girl, yet brings something real to the character so she's not just your basic ""popular high school girl"" we've seen 1,000 times. Where Black brought depth to his stereotypical character Kevin Heart did the opposite, he played the high school jock character just as that, an arrogant jock who thinks he deserves everything handed to him. He's completely unlikeable & compared to the others his acting skills definitely need some work, he tries way too hard to stand out while the others shine effortlessly. I'm not typically a fan of the Rock's movies but his portrayal of a vulnerable nerdy kid stuck in this hyper masculine body is well rounded & believable, I was pleasantly surprised by his performance. Karen Gillian is the perfect as Ruby Roundhouse & has what is probably the funniest scene in the movie, her ""sexy flirting"" with the soldiers followed by her then kicking their asses is hilarious & awesome at the same time, it really sums up her entire character. Overall it's a fun movie I highly recommend, would be a 10 if it wasn't for Heart's performance.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I saw the first Jumanji, that was okay, even though I don't like Robin Williams. But seeing Dwayne Johnson was in this sequel my expectations were not very high, because he's not one of my favorite actors either. So the least I could say was that my expectations for this movie were very low. And it didn't begin good at all with the very annoying character played by Madison Iseman. But once they all been sucked up in the game it all became different, and in a real good way different. The genious about the story was putting the younger characters in totally opposed characters as grown-ups. The Rock as the shy nerd Spencer, the little Kevin Hart as the normally big popular athlete, the fat Jack Black as the highschool blonde sex bomb Bethany, the martial art expert Karen Gillan as the normally shy nerdy girl. Their characters were just hilarious when discovering their new abilities and body transformations while in their minds they were still the teenagers they were before. That is the best part of the movie, it worked very well, and it goes on during the entire movie. The story is more than enjoyable, with a good plot and very good special effects. Definitely better than the first Jumanji, and that's rare that a sequel is better than the first movie. For the moment Jumanji has been the surprise of the year for me. Not by being the best movie I saw, but by the fact I was expecting an average movie and that it turned out the quite opposite that I thought.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

How can someone in good faith give a positive review is an insult to the previous generation of movie creators that have worked to their best to give moviegoers a quality time and not just please the average Joe and make the most money while doing so. As a movie Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle does not make your money worth at all, nor does it have anything artistic about it, and as long as everyone gets their paycheck movies like this one will continue to be made. Whatever passes is good to be shot as a movie I guess, and even more worrisome standards have gotten to record low in the industry, and have been doing so for some time now. I obviously discourage anyone to go pay and see this movie. Acting was alright, but the story and the script are as hallow as they get, and the movie is barely children friendly as well.","1 out of 18 found this helpful.

When I got out of the movie theatre, I began to debate if the new movie or if the original was the better one. I now feel this movie is better than the original.The first Jumanji movie didn't even bring us into the game, but rather had the game in the real world. While I do like that idea, the new Jumanji movie did better in the grand scheme. They actually brought us into the game, and they give us a goal to achieve in order to win. There is a lot of comedy, but they know when it's necessary. The action is great, and the actors do great. It's nonstop fun, but it also tells us a good lesson that is actually thought out for how they can put it in.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The whole idea of a movie poking fun at the tropes, clichés, and stereotypes of video games seems like the type of humor that would get old quickly, and the fact that it came out the week after Last Jedi made it seem like they weren't expecting a financial success. But lo and behold, it won 4 weekends at the box office and grossed $400,000,000 in the U.S alone. Given that popular franchises have been dominating the box office lately, it was nice to see something so original. Granted, it is a sequel, but it doesn't have many connections to the 1995 movie. It really is much more of a standalone work. It immerses itself in its own world and doesn't connect very much to the original Jumanji. It doesn't feel like a sequel to anything.It features the talents of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, and Jack Black. What's so great about these characters are how well they act like the kids who are controlling them. At the beginning, the kids fall into the stereotype zone: the nerd, the jock, the valley girl, and the shy girl. Despite that, the way they interact with each other in their in-game avatars makes up for it and makes them fully fledged characters as opposed to just generic tropes. Most of the humor is stemmed from the idea of someone being in the body and role of someone completely different from them, which is why it works. It's really just classic role-reversal. As for the story, though, it's kind of generic. They need to find this mystical gem and bring it to a jaguar statue before some generic bad guy does. But it's the story isn't really the appeal of this movie, it's about the characters. The jungle looks nice, which is an added bonus.Another thing this movie does very well is how well it represents the video game aspect. You don't need to be a gamer to understand or enjoy this. Anything that general audiences wouldn't understand is simply explained, meaning that anyone can enjoy this. Also, the idea of the NPCs just repeating lines of dialogue to the Rock was very accurate to the idea of a real RPG, making it seem like Jumanji could very well have been a game from back in the day.This is a movie that's on the verge between ""guilty pleasure"" and ""legitimately good."" I'd say it's the latter, although it does have elements of the former. It knows exactly what it is and does a very good job at it; it's just a fun comedy about teenagers taking on a new set of roles and forming new bonds as a result. It's fun, it's satisfying, and there's really nothing more to it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is a very enjoyable, fresh continuation to the first Jumangi movie that, instead of being a straight up carbon copy to the original, it merely takes the concept and expands upon it in a new, interesting way. We see a group of teenagers get transported in to a video game and the adventure that ensues is as engaging as it is funny. The only major issue I had with the movie is that they had a very lackluster villain. I think Bobby Cannavale is a good actor, but there was absolutely nothing interesting for him to do with this character, there was no scope or development put in to him whatsoever. The cast is terrific and all deliver performances that are immensely unique to what they have done in the past. Dwayne Johnson as a nerdy teen, Kevin Hart as a nervous jock, Karen Gillan as a shy girl, and Jack Black as a loud, confident teenage girl all made this movie extremely ridiculous and impossible not to enjoy, they all brought it 100 percent to their part, and looked like they were having a good time. A very honorable reboot. An unexpected delight, Jumangi: Welcome to the Jungle is great fun that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good family film. 
Four tennagers get transported in to a video game and must save the island of Jumangi to leave, but they only have three lives each.

I mean, firstly, who the hell did they think they were taking a well loved classic and giving it a reboot anyway? And into a Video Game no less? And then . . . And then they populated it with actors that 9 times out of ten I am really not a fan of (Not Karen Gillan, she's great!). These are people who play caricatures of themselves all the time. But do you know what? That worked perfectly. I can't think of any other actors that could have taken on these roles and made them their own like Dwayne, Jack, Kevin and Karen did, taking the pi$$ out of their own ego's and ""flaws"" throughout.In some ways this edition of Jumanji is superior to the first. It has far better CGI and it actually takes you in to the game instead of the game coming out to you, but it would obviously be nowhere without Mr Williams and that team leading the way.I really like the Video Game references that even an old fart like me can recognise and it is incredibly fun. Just as easy to watch as the original and I'm sure it will last the course just as well.It's a look so really strange that 'Baby I Love Your Way' by 'Big Mountain' fits in to this film in such a great and fun way.There's action, there's comedy, a bit of romance and a general feel good vibe.I am a bit concerned that they rushed into a further sequel so quickly and I am prepared to be disappointed when I get to see it, but I would also love to be surprised as I was by this one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In essence there is nothing wrong with that. It can still result in a wonderful family film. But it's problematic when the movie feels like its made with an easy ingredients recipe by a chef that forgot to put some flavor in.All the elements that made the original film a succes (and to some a classic) are present, but the narrative is put together with so little imagination that I felt like I was watching a movie I'd seen a hundred times before. And you know what, they could get away with it - if the gags were better and the character's weren't made out of cardboard.Don't get me wrong. There are funny moments. I laughed hard a couple of times, but regardless this whole movie felt like a missed opportunity. The Rock is great as Spencer aka Dr. Bravestone, an anxious nerd made jungle hero. The way The Rock pulls out some signature looks and plays with insecure mannerisms made me think back of his hilarious performance in Be Cool. Kevin Hart has his funny moments, but he's essentially playing himself, not getting much further than delivering some sas and tiny man rants here and there. Karen Gillan gives us the best performance and Jack Black is trying hard to be funny but the whininess of the high school princess he plays makes it a difficult task to pull off. How did you screw that up guys? Jack Black is inherently hilarious.The characters lack grit and the friction between the protagonists is too weak. It's not because you're making an adventure film that kids can go see that the emotional world of the characters shouldn't be tangible. It all feels very childish, the dialogue and the performances. It's clear that this is because of the script and the direction, The Rock and friends didn't get much to work with.I was also pretty disappointed in terms of cinematography. It's all kind of bland, just like the characters. The bad guys and the ending get the coolest lighting.When you can work at a story that puts teenagers in the middle of a magical adventure land, that gives you the opportunity to play with animals, bad guys, friendship and time in an interesting way, you need to do more with it!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

First of all I did like the first Jumanji but did not nescessairly think it deserved or needed a sequel. Then I wasn't quite sold on this sequels potential even when it became a major hit I just thought it as just another Hollywood cash cow. 
Now I finally gave it a try and I am glad I did. The film turns out to be one of the most entertaining features of 2017 with a major rewatch-effect.
The story works because even though it is modern and works on modern action and humor it still has something nostalgic added to it which made it very appealing. Also the way the characters are written is that they could easily have been of a 90s film (more or less). I loved the idea that some kids become their total opposite Avatars in the video game. Also their relations made the film more interesting than its special effects which is another reason it worked.
The adult actors played well and most of them actually played with their own image. There was. lot of self irony attached. Really loved Dwayne Johnson who gives one of his better performances. Kevin Hart was sometimes a bit annoying but it worked with his character. Jack Black was easily the MVP. He cracked me up every time he was on screen. Such a clumsy performance, but in a good way. Karen Gillan was also great and totally unlike her most famous Marvel character. The special effects were good. The action worked. The ending was touching. All those elements made it to one of the best adventure flicks of last year.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This time around, four detention-prone high schoolers stumble upon a retro cartridge gaming system and somehow are transported into the land of Jumanji, where they must lift the curse of a stolen jewel known as the ""eye of the panther"" if they are to have any chance at an escape.Unlike the Robin Williams-starring original, which was a bit more serious than it was silly, the crew here ratchets up the funny factor thanks to the likes of Kevin Hart, Dwayne Johnson and a flamboyant Jack Black (as the young Bethany is stuck in his avatar), while Karen Gillan tries to balance things out as Martha (a.k.a., Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men). Of course, half of the humor comes from the fact that the four teens are caught in bodies that aren't their own - with some of the gags feeling either over the top or severely immature (see Bethany as Black's Dr. Shelly Oberon). There are a few scenes that are worth the cost of admission, namely one that involves pound cake, but overall the movie is a wild ride of laughs that are targeted at adolescent boys and unnecessary casting of Nick Jonas targeted at adolescent girls.What's missing in 'Jumanji' is the magic from the first entry in the series, which was a bonafide action-adventure ride that really sucked you into the game. Sure, this one was a massive hit with audiences, and is spawning a sequel. But it's nothing really special - even the attempts to show there are learnings and lessons of acceptance, bravery and living the one life we have to live come across as being afterthoughts, or at worst, hollow.'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' isn't awful - there are highlights here and there, but it's definitely overrated and a wasted opportunity.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

What we end up getting is just run of the mill characters with no depth, acting as stand-ins.

A real adventure starting with an unknown mysterious object was an invitation to a kids Adventure.Now , more than 20 years later they turned that into a silly over the top action movie with literally no mystery. A terrible start with the rejection of the original Board Game which had to be turned into a videogame - why? Is a mysterious boardgame not appealing to children these days? If so, Is this not a children's movie but a silly want-to-be-comedy for adults that remember the old gem of a movie? And if that is the case, why is the content delivered as dumbed down as possible and with actors mostly middle aged men can relate to (exception to the rule is the hot girl Roundkick for sure). Come on, why not give new actors a chance? I for myself cannot imagine showing this much useless action and harsh violence at times to my kids below 12. So are Teenagers really only engaged if they can knot ties to a video game nowadays? Isn't there ""Ready player one"" for that genre already? Please enlighten me on what the target audience is supposed to be.The plot is really easy. Straight line which resolves itself when stuck. Not much more to say about that. The movie ties action scene after action scene without real leverage or mystery. That reminds me, why was the game changed, if the source of all is the old board game. Weird.In between make the world more understanding and aware of young people problems. Of course the writers had to rub in some morals of sexuality, self conscience, friendship and what not. But... oh no, don't let the audience think for just a second but deliver all with cringy dialogues at absolutely the wrong timings.What else: They should have used a different title for the movie, like: ""This is not Jumanji as you know it"" or ""Jumanji - watch the original""What was good: The budget. One scene was remotely funny.

It was at times frightening, with the creepy idea that you could be sucked into a board game and have to survive in a merciless jungle until someone sets you free. Much like the original Jurassic Park, it perfectly balanced fantasy and horror with a bit of comedy peppered in to alleviate some of the more tense moments. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle throws all of that out the window, and turns it into a cartoony, campy comedy film. While the film does have laughs and can be entertaining at times, it's just a shame to see such a fun idea turn into a joke with no consequence or terror to anything happening to the characters. While it may seem nitpicky to say, it just has no heart. The original was fraught with sadness for Alan as he returns from the horrifying jungle to find his parents died pouring their life savings into finding their son. I don't want to see the Rock flexing every other minute while Kevin Hart quips in between for an entire film. This film is a Jumanji film by name only.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

And by being pulled in these two directions it ends up sitting directly in the middle and ending up being almost entirely bland. The uninspiring locations and effects don't even have the zip and pep of Zathura, Jumanji's semi-sequel, and it carries none of the atmosphere, dread and unique tone of the original Jumanji. It's another in a long line of 'videogamey'-inspired films written or producer-curated by people who have absolutely no below-surface knowledge of actual videogames.
The cast is wasted, the gags and concept potential untapped and there's absolutely no subtlety. It sort of seems like a weird joint jungle comedy central roast where everyone is making fun of each other. It's by the numbers, unsurprising, and no less flaccid than any of the trailers made it look. Also the music is rubbish.

Second, I may be a bit harsh because I am grading with no curve - the first installment had Robin Williams, a master of comedy. This one had Kevin Hart and The Rock, who together could never be as funny as Robin Williams by himself.
Third, there were so many political intro's in the film that it felt a bit smarmy.
Fourth, I totally get the CGI bit in modern movies, but it has to make SOME sense on SOME level. Several fails in this movie here.
I guess asking for any character development is a bit much for an action/comedy, but I will still ask, and there was minimal, if any, chemistry in this movie.

Also, they figured out the premise really fast. The game flops back and fourth between the characters acting like their real world selves and having the abilities of their video game selves whenever it is convenient for the plot or comedy.

Unfortunately for them the video game is much more than it appears to be and they're ""transported"" into the game world where they're forced to make the most of their precarious predicament. The formulaic approach and clichéd themes aside, this is actually a pretty good showing with laugh-out loud humor, nifty visual effects, clever plot twists, and thrilling action scenes, elevated by the work of an excellent cast, especially Johnson and Black who are deliberately ""uncomfortable in their own skin."" It doesn't cover much new ground, but it's still pretty fun regardless. **½","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This film is not a remake, it is a continuation and begins with a link paying homage to the original. We then see that as technology gets upgraded so does the concept of Jumanji. Whereas we first saw the board game unleashing its malevolence on the world, this time the players are sucked into the jungle world of the game itself. There are echoes of The Breakfast Club in this production in that we have a group of high school kids who are very far removed from each other socially thrown together in detention. They are then sucked into the game where they discover they have to work together to survive. They are transformed into characters that are the exact opposites of the real them and each one has to realise that being this far out of their comfort zone is the key to utilising their assigned skill sets in order to survive. This film was fast paced, gritty, humorous and very cleverly written bringing out some great performances from the main characters. Dwayne Johnson isbecoming a darn fine actor and Jack Black never fails to please. This is definitely one for the DVD collection.e","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's not an epic movie, but it is very good, it's silly but in a good way and not cheesy, it's classic but not cliché and it makes fun of a certain group of people that's been zombie'ing around society with their phones for years.Story is straight up, on the rails but what some fails to understand that this is the story of an old video game thus you were herded quite hard in to a certain line of action and you just had to go with it without much freedom. Humor is funny and the actors compliment each other quite well, good crew and good directing.For those of you that are weary of today's Hollywood I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie as it'll make you feel the past two decades didn't impact it at all. Great, light, fun with lots of laughs. Enjoy. :-)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Despite its insipid premise, this adventure-fantasy works, thanks to the camaraderie & witty banter between its cast.Directed by Jake Kasdan, the story sounds like a recipe for disaster on paper with really dumb moments in store and yet the director is able to derive a pretty good mileage out of it in the end. The tone remains lighthearted, there's a sense of fun to how the events unfold, and the cast sure seems to be having a blast as evident in their respective renditions.As for the performances, the sum of parts is greater than the whole here and it's the actors' collective effort than any individual act that steers the movie past the finish line. There are stakes in play but since all characters are one-dimensional & uninteresting, one doesn't really care. What gives it a refreshing touch however is the dissonance in who they are & what they are supposed to be.Overall, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle does what it set out to do and makes for an amusing, entertaining & fun-filled extravaganza that will satisfy most if not all. The film doesn't aim for anything big, never takes itself seriously, is well-aware of its limitations, and delivers a lighthearted romp with honesty & passion. A far cry from the disaster I was anticipating, this blockbuster is more pleasant than it had any right to be.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The answer, as it turned out to be, was to treat the story entirely differently: after a nod to the original concept by showing the original game in the (once again, ""resurfaced to the sound of ominous drums"") original box, let the next re-opening of that same box show a 1990's game-cartridge. And then, let the fun begin again.But this treatment went much farther - and, much better - than ""just that original trope."" The players are now trapped in a video-game, and when they arrive in that game, not only are they adults but one of them (played by Jack Black) went from female to male! (Yes, there are the expected nods to that anatomical change ... both of them ... but, they were tastefully and cleverly done.)The concept that the actors were stuck in a video game, and that all of them knew it, and that all of them remembered throughout where they had actually came from and who they really were, was expertly done. In short, this is a very well-crafted SCREENPLAY.The actors - both youth and adult - were well-directed and played their respective parts to the hilt, never forgetting that ""it is all in fun.""The musical score is also well-conceived, right down through the final credits-roll. (But I admit that I was hoping to see ""a hidden scene,"" not just a final beating of the drums, when the film finally ran to its last frame!)In short - ""I thoroughly enjoyed it, far more than I thought that I would."" It certainly stands -alongside- the previous movie, when I very frankly came into the theater anticipating that it could not. ""Well done.""","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
