It is just bad. And not just the main storyline which makes little sense and the villains are comedic, but almost every interaction ends up with the viewer asking ""but, why?"" or ""how does it even make sense?"".The assembly of heroes (what the movie is about) is also rushed as hell, and the motivation of the people to join is straight-up nonexistent in most of the cases and is simply skipped entirely.As for the villain who comes to find mysterious troubling rebels, apparently every single person knows who are the rebels and how to find them and shares that information to the first stranger they meet. It's not like they are even hiding.Next, combat and action scenes. Blasters that penetrate people in armor through, but can't penetrate a thin piece of wood. Remember when in the new Star Wars trilogy a red guard could strike Ray but was just making dumb random moves to simulate action? Well, it's absolutely the same here. Maximum drama, lots of slow motion, frequent switch of the scenes every few seconds and very little sense.The acting is ok, but it's difficult to judge the actors if they do good because the script tells them to follow an unnatural character arc in the first place. I'd say Sofia played Kora well, but Kora is just a poor character which is out of place in the very story she's central.It's not all bad. The picture is nice.I'd say it's the most disappointing Snyder's movie so far.","510 out of 638 found this helpful.

No character connection. Vulgar scenes to force emotions. Weird cheap cocktail of Star Wars and Dune. Felt like fan-made university project with a multi-million budget that was only spend on slow motion CGI scenes. I doubt that the extended edition will have more movie magic since this one already fails in every sense.Not even the world-building or the design felt worth watching since it felt like the characters were in costumes rather than authentic dresses. No scene composition gave the feeling of a profound world with deep history.Too many unoriginal ideas that were thrown together with the hope of ""Let's hope it will be the next movie success"".I wouldn't say that the actors were weak, rather the error or lack of writers in the writing process of the movie show how important dialogue, character building arcs and real emotional value are in movies rather than gross tasteless blood baths, torture, explosions and one-dimensional characters.","233 out of 288 found this helpful.

Maybe it's because it's a Netflix thing, I am not sure. There's so much borrowing from several other popular movies that I just wasn't invested in the story because it was all tooo basic and predictable.You had the Thanos and Gamora moment in there, you are the Starwars Resistance vs The First Order moment in there. You had the Darthvader type figure in there. You had the Kylo Ren character in there. And the worlds looked like something from a Starwars episode.Also the whole story was just weak, too weak for a director like Zack. I mean we've seen it done so many times from Lord of the Rings, to Game of Thrones, to even The Avengers. You are threatened by a bigger force, so you go around recruiting people to help you fight this force. That's basically it. There wasn't any rich subplot like we see in eg. Dune. Just very basic.Does it warrant a part 2, I strongly don't think it did. It's lazy writing and directing and shouldn't be encouraged.All in all, it's an ok movie. It's not bad like some reviews are saying. The effects are spot on, I loved the cinematography. The only drawbacks for me were the weak storyline, the awful fight sequence, the casting could have been better and the all too familiar scenes.","404 out of 526 found this helpful.

""Rebel Moon Pt. 1"" could have, and the movie would have been ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960, 2016, 1998-2000 as a TV series, or indeed ""Seven Samurai"" of 1954), because the plot is err.... identical. And I expect the plot of the second half will be identical too. So if you have ever seen any of those and a spaceship taking off, you don't need to see this movie (OK, some of the spaceship imagery is very good). But I have to wonder whether anyone was actually paid for ""writing"" the script :-)","78 out of 114 found this helpful.

The parts of the story were just thrown in as backstory or someone explaining the bleeding obvious.

There's too many characters and in its current state there's not enough time to give them meaningful depth so it feels rushed despite clocking in at over 2 hours. However, this is Zack Snyder going full Snyder in a way that is uniquely him so it still has plenty of stylish highs.Clearly inspired by Star Wars and Seven Samurai and so much more. All of these ideas and borrowed visuals create a new world that's genuinely interesting and consistently striking. The second act just has the core cast planet hopping between set pieces which are just so committed to looking cool in a way only Snyder could pull off with this level of seriousness.Sofia Boutella gives the best performance. Being the lead character means she gets the most depth which helps and she nails the general stoicism of her character. Even with the dodgy accent Charlie Hunnam is still able to be a loveable scoundrel and Anthony Hopkins voice work gives the film its most human performance.Everyone else is wasted. It's especially shocking to see how late into the film Djimon Hounsou is introduced and how little he gets after that, he really is just kinda there. Staz Nair, Bae Doona and Ray Fisher all do quite a lot with a little whilst facing the same issue and are hopefully given a lot more in the extended cut and sequel.Once again being his own cinematographer, Zack Snyder creates gorgeous imagery destined to become wallpapers. His action remains really good even in the currently butchered PG-13 state and the slow motion is present without becoming grating. The CG is hit and miss but considering the budget, it's a lot more excusable here than in most of the other big blockbusters released recently.Unusually for a Zack Snyder film, there are no needle drops, unconventional or otherwise, which isn't a huge problem thanks to Tom Holkenborg's score which fills the gaps nicely. It's very reminiscent of their previous collaborations, especially with Holkenborg's trademark percussion heavy flourishes that still haven't gotten old.","178 out of 298 found this helpful.

This requires exactly no more suspension of disbelief than any of the blockbuster comic book hero movies flooding the market. Do you want to put the same filter of realism on ANY of those? Do you think, any of the Marvel superheroes make any sense at all? Its all emotions and action which this movie has plenty of. It's bubblegum. So just get your emotional rush and leave it at that.

We get to know each recruit a little bit as they are approached by the woman.So, this movie is watchable for the special effects, but not much else. It's basically an introduction of all the characters and a basic background of the woman's story. It doesn't offer much by itself.

There are a lot of them, and they could have been really good. But the editing are just a bunch of normal speed, slow speed clipping to make it look good, and the bad guys just stand still doing nothing while the ""hero"" spends minutes moving around in the open...CGI/Greenscreen galore.. but very well done.

There are movies and directors that know how to use slow motion sequences in a movie, and then there are this movie and director, that did not take that class... it's just a waist of time.In summary, if you are able to ignore all the writing, dialogue, acting/directing issues... its a passable scifi action movie.The movie could have been so much better, because there is a decent enough story underneath.. and they obviously had enough money to do what they wanted...I'm assuming Netflix payed for this. So I'm guessing that there where a big payday for writer/director and no requirements for quality on the delivered product. So they just cut from the budget anyone that could have given the director feedback on the uality issues.","555 out of 808 found this helpful.

It is truely a first episode introducing the characters and the world's. Yes it could have been better, but all in all I was entertained enough to give this a 7. The acting fine, the story interesting and the production value is good. The franchise deserves a good part two before we give a final judgement. I have hope that it will be good. So all in all check it out for yourself and give it a chance until the second part is on Netflix before final judgement. I enjoyed the film and the characters and I hope you will enjoy it also.

It's not Star Wars, but more Flash Gordon (1980) without the cheese in visual style.The plot is pretty simple following the template of Seven Samurai, but suffers from too much world building exposition. They say ""it's much better to show than tell"", but Rebel Moon counter acts that statement. Sometimes a single sentence will do. Look at Star Wars as an example. George Lucas didn't have the money to do tons of flashback sequences and used dialague, which was just as good or even better leaving it up to the audience's imagination. We didn't need a 10 minute sequence for Kora. That time could have been used to develop the other characters, who are sorely lacking in depth.I know that Snyder loves to use slow motion to highlight moments, but he went a bit overboard with some shots. It was used where it really wasn't needed in some stituations.Overall the movie is good, but it's very hard to digest in one viewing. It's like Underworld where it takes 2-3 times to absorb it all. If anything I'm looking forward to the longer R rated version.","118 out of 223 found this helpful.

My name is FeastMode and I'm a sci-fi junkie. After watching this movie, I'm ecstatic to have witnessed the creation of this beautiful sci-fi world. I'm immediately invested. I want more.

That's fine. Every crowd likes their own kind of music.Objectively this is what Snyder produces: gritty, dark, unhappy, overly serious, tedious stuff. Most of its average, with a few exceptions. But there's always cool stuff to look at. The usual Snyder-verse effects are on full display: long establishing shots, fight scenes using slo-mo and speed shifting, and massive objects being viewed by terrified onlookers. He's kind of a poor man's Villaneuve.The rabid followers can say what they want about ""The Snyder Cut"" Justice League, but the reality is there's no broad market for unrelentingly dismal sludge. Why isn't there a Judge Dredd movie coming out soon? Or another Punisher film? Dark and too serious isn't fun to spend money on. Especially when it's not all that new.I do have to laugh though, at all the media hacks that are pissing and moaning about how derivative this is. And it is. But it mostly feels that way because Snyder wrote a script for a stand alone Star Wars story and was told by Lucasfilm (or maybe it was Disney) ""thanks, but no thanks"".So he went to the streaming giant that loves to produce expensive projects so they can cancel them before they can develop any traction. This is that script brought to life. Or death, as Netflix may have it.It's not nice to hammer on creatives. But I for one am sick and tired of the waif-ish 90 pound girl warrior movies that have been all the rage lately. And while Boutella (Kora, the protagonist in Rebel Moon) was excellent as Jaylah in Star Trek Beyond, I'm over it. Other than Gunpowder Milkshake (which was hilarious) it's all a bunch of BS. I don't care if Maggie Q or Daisy Ridley (both decent actresses btw) are in it or not (they aren't in this, in case you're confused), it's stupid. It was bad enough when Arnold, Sly and Bruce were ignoring the laws of physics in their various franchises, but we're all a little more savvy now and wouldn't buy that stuff from them in today's market either. But maybe I'm wrong, because there are now 4 Expendables movies in existence. God save us from the people who are buying tickets to those.The review of the performances? Boutella? Strictly two note delivery. Honsu? Not bad, dour and angry. Hunaam? Possibly the most nuanced.The plot? Star Wars excuse aside, it's a mess. The preposterousness of engaging with their Seven Samurai recruits at moments when each is faced with a crucial test is just lazy storytelling.The villains? One dimensional and very unconvincing. One, the most visible, a bizarre space nazi foil, is so predictable and poorly written that he could be dropped into any of a number of other films. The other? The supposedly all powerful Big Bad who apparently has the power of life over death is a comic book trope of a villain. Evil for evil's sake. And the dumb resurrection of the former by the latter begs the question: how do you threaten a subordinate that you just brought back to life? And instead of original visuals, Snyder dips deeply into the visually obscene as replacement for creativity.Here's a thought: (which the trailer for Part II indicated might really be a thing) the very last image is of a rogue droid, having gone ""wild"" after killing one of its ""masters"", standing up in a field, wearing a crown of deer antlers. Now that would/will? Have been (might be) a story worth exploring.There are much better choices to spend two hours on. Watch Rogue One, which at its core, this movie wishes it was.It's free to subscribers now, so have at it. Can't wait to see those reviews pour in.","521 out of 826 found this helpful.

You know what the character is going to say nearly before they say it, and it's not anything witty or poignant. There is a scene early on that perfectly encapsulated the tone of the film. See through curtains, they are there look ok but pointless. I watch a lot of sci-fi and various movies and TV shows. But this is not at the standard you'd expect.

I appreciate a lot of visuals I haven't seen before (maybe these are lifted from obscure media from years past, but its new to me). I enjoy Snyder's pacing and action scenes.I'm not a Snyder fan per se, and going back to my first comment I'll agree all day long that he should never be writing because he couldn't even come up with an original story for his dream sci fi project, instead doing the extremely tired 7 samurai story. But, I do think he's polarizing, and there is undue criticism here simply do to his style and clichés being so well known. So many people are so well versed on Snyder criticism that it's all they can see, and they can't just settle down and watch the movie first. I think it was Lincoln who said you will always find bad if you look for it.There is plenty to enjoy here, and I think in years to come Rebel Moon will be appreciated more. There have been a few movies that on first watch I had a lot of criticism for, but years later I found I enjoyed them for what they were and they became favorites. I get a lot of those same feelings with Rebel Moon, and I think there is enough of interest here to give it legs. Realizing there is a part 2 coming, and extended versions of both films, there will be a lot for future rewatches, and I think that will help it.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

A lot of it is very good and a lot of it is also very clunky and not delivered well enough.Third is the excess slow mo. It's Snyder signature move but like in the Snyder cut here it's also unnecessarily overdone.Overall Rebel Moon is not Snyder's best effort, but it's also nowhere near as bad as the critics make it out to be. Hopefully part 2 is better.I think Snyder is similar to James Wan in the sense that their strength is in action more than dialogue. James Wan leans into this strength while Snyder tries way too hard to write something philosophical. I would like to see more action from him. It's why I loves his previous films, especially 300.","14 out of 29 found this helpful.

John Wick revenge for his dog is way more compelling. The over use of slow motion and fish eye lense. The positive viewer score on Rotten Tomatoes goes to show how far the Snyder faithful will go to skew the rating. I came into this movie with hopes it would be great. Who doesn't love another SciFi epic. STAR WARS KILLER? NO. I have been vocal about my distaste for the sequel trilogy, it is far superior the the trash I just watched called Rebel Moon.

Rebel Moon is definitely good enough, I had extremely high expectations, and it did not meet all of them, and it is a VERY different movie from what I was expecting and in some ways that's very good but in some other ways its not as good. I definitely think the story, settings, visuals, plots, side plots, performances, & characters are all fantastic. Where I think the movie could have benefitted more was if more of its limited runtime was spent with the character interactions and just how they get along with each other. It almost feels as though we are in a similar situation to when Batman V Superman came out and we only had part of a movie, but this time I feel it more with this specific one. All in all, it's worth a try, has enough huge enjoyable moments that balances the bad with it and has huge potential. Looking forward to the directors cut that hopefully fixes these issues.","292 out of 552 found this helpful.

A good watch.I enjoyed the movie. It had a great visual style that pulled me into the movie, from the farms to the mining planet. It felt very real, less fantasy and more scifi.There were moments that pulled you out however. Some of the story was very heavy handed in it's quest to throw you off the scent. Some seemed not well thought out (like shouting at fighter pilots instead of using a communication device or fighting with a sword for ten minutes when there are people standing around behind you with guns watching you.) But to be honest, the most distracting thing for me was the overuse of the slow-motion, moving comic book panel-esque shooting style that made 300 so much fun to watch back then. I'm over it. Over it in the same way I'm over lens flares in J. J. Abrams movies. Sam Raimi rolls his eyes when he sees these.That's the bad.The good is that I genuinely liked the story and the main characters. A few supporting characters as well. You want to root for them. They're mostly likeable with easily understood motivations, for the most part. And while I felt like some of the broad story is just given away with overly obvious clues that leave little to surprise you, it still feels good to be right (a cynical person might think that was the desired result) and see the ways it's made to happen. Like being given a full outline of a story but no ending and then reading the book in all it's detail.What intrigued me most was what I believe is foreshadowing of things to come. I won't indulge any of my theories but I'm looking forward to seeing if I'm right.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

On a moon deep in space a group of farmers have to give these German look dudes their grain otherwise they get angry. But kora and gunner two that live here don't like that so they set off to other planets in order to collect rebels to fight against them. Those bits were good to see as each character they bring brought something. The cast did well. I thought the action was paced well but there was just some of this film that fell flat at points probably because of the length.

Main villain is parody white evil man, completely incapable of anything but pointless cruelty as all of the other white characters.

I'm no stranger to waiting for resolution and character arc development.PG-13 Rebel Moon was good to me, but well short of great. Definitely felt like stuff was trimmed for the sanitized PG-13 rating so that Netflix can sell stuff. Apparently the PG-13 version is part of the deal in order for Zack to go nuts with the R-rated cut. Some things were predictable, but couple took me by surprise. Slo-mo didn't bother me too much, but I can see where some areas could've been in normal speed. Unfortunately, the sanitized and basic PG-13 version may turn some people off, so it's a questionable strategy by Netflix.Looking forward to Part 2 where we WILL get more information about the characters' background and the R-rated Director's Cut where Zack said it is different. Director's Cut Intro will be different as we get more of a main villain, and we get more Jimmy (Anthony Hopkins).","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

There is nothing that compensates for the disjointed story.And I am actually tired of female protagonists being portrayed as overpowering significantly taller adversaries. It simply strains believability - take note how Korean ""Ballerina"" brilliantly tackles this issue.The villains are stereotyped as white male and one-dimensional. Its tiresome. Even the pacing is problematic, oscillating between slow and hurried, with too many scenes feeling unnecessary.The writing, particularly the misunderstanding of ""IP"" versus originality, reflects a superficial approach.The film's reliance on slow-motion action scenes is excessive and lacks genuine impact.There is nothing original here. Its use of clichés never stop. It is everything we have seen just remixed poorly. There is no fresh take.Snyder failed big time - the lack of depth in world-building, the bland charachters, the use of tropes and the poor execution in general.This movie misses the opportunity to be a self-contained, satisfying narrative, and I'm skeptical that a director's cut or a sequel will resolve these issues.","42 out of 63 found this helpful.

However, when I saw this trailer, I was looking forward to watching Rebel Moon - Part One - A Child on Fire. Was I blown away? No. But I enjoyed it enough; I'm looking forward to Part Two.I will say when this movie started, it was hard to follow - as the setup was terribly done. It even took a minute to figure out who were the bad guys. That's on the director. But about 20 minutes in, Revel Moon kicks into high gear, and began to grab my attention.This movie does borrow from other movies. And parts of this story should have been rewritten. But for the most part I enjoyed Rebel Moon - it really has its (good) moments. It's better than most Sci-fi movies out there. The special effects are top notch.Something else that I liked, that allows it to stand out, is it's clearly not a Disney production. It has no problem being a little graphic with the violence. This makes it possible to create certain tones and drive home certain points.I actually recommend this. It's not a bad watch.

I very much liked it 🙌 it was so much better then I had expected and I guess I kind of need to thank all you who dissed it because the contrast from my own experience really launched it for me.Of course some of the ""constructive"" reviews have some core to them as well. I as well would have liked to have some more time for character development, but at the same time there was something refreshing about the straightforwardness of the story. It is not complicated, and yes we have seen the like before but not in this package.My advice is to watch it and make your own judgement.

Anyways it wouldn't be the first movie to follow this path.The characters are likable enough (some better like Kora/Artelais and Nemesis), some worse like the bad guys (no one can match a good villain like Darth Vader, just to mention one of the greatest).Nevertheless it's a above decent ecent movie to watch, it keeps you entertained.Definitely awaiting next chapter, which seems to be coming on Spring 2024.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The answer was ""Yeah! It's Seven Samurai!""As an adaptation of the classic, it was quite disappointing. The whole movie was basically the recruiting of the samurais. The pacing was good. Even though it was more than 2 hours long, it didn't feel that way. However, it lacked exposition on characters' backstories, except for Kora's. The other ""samurais"" backstories were given through dialogues.I don't know how a movie that's more than 2 hours long have touched so little on characters' backstories. If the ""samurais"" backstories aren't as important for now, as in it will be divulged later on like squeezing toothpaste, then why make the recruiting process so long?And this is only half of one movie. Knowing that, the climax felt forced. It felt like it was forced in so part one could end in a high note.Netflix should've released this as one movie instead of splitting it into 2 parts. It might've made more sense and a much better movie. But for now, at least we still have Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, even though it's in black and white.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

This Rebel Moon part one (I am terrified by the fact that there will still be a part II, and even more that Snyder plans to make a ""director's cut""! What a nightmare!) is boring to death, very hard to pay attention. There is a space political situation that is obviously copied from Star Wars (kind of a Zach Snyder's justice league of star wars), but with a crew being assembled like in Magnificent Seven or Seven Samurai. However, all characters are very uninteresting, all the scenes are pure predictable and previously watched clichés, presented in a chaotic sequence in an attempt to anaesthetize spectators (what dod not work, considering the bad reception). Additionally, all that happens with the cheesy narrations, excessive videogame slow motions, and all the crap set we may except when it comes to the new boring sluggish expensive shallow cheesy pastiche released by Zach Snyder. If at least the film had half of its length, pehaps a good edition could make it a generic but at least acceptable flick, but Zach Snyder could not allow it. He wants hours of cheesy scenes with bad dialogues, clichés that copy everything one has watched previously in a better version elsewhere, and tons of annoying slow motions. Pehaps I am repeating myself too much in this review... Sorry, I am still inpacted by the slow torturing looping of uninteresting obviousness Snyder and Netflix punished me with.","32 out of 51 found this helpful.

For some reason they will hate watch anything he does just to because. I enjoy his movies for what they are. They are not always perfect. But you will definitely get great cinematography and nice action sequences.Rebel Moon has all of that. The story may be a bit out there. But. It is a fantasy sci-fi story. I am looking forward to the R rated version. I am sure Netflix forced this pg-13 version out quickly so it could be here for the holidays. I am not here to convert anyone to love this movie. Do not care. I loved the characters. The visuals were great looking. At times the cgi is a bit blurry around the edges. But. It's leagues better than most movies that have a higher budget. Anything Disney has put out over the last 5 years or so looks way worse. If you like sci-fi or action. You'll like this movie. It entertains and that's all I want from a movie such as this. Looking forward to the conclusion. Still think that Snyder receives undeserved hate and criticism. His cut of the Justice League was amazing. Wish we at least get the chance to see what he had in store for the conclusion of that universe. For better or worse. This is spoiler free review. So. If you like action sci-fi. I think you will enjoy this movie. Looking forward to the conclusion and the R-rated cut.","164 out of 306 found this helpful.

What he has is really cool and frankly, it should be able to stand with or above Disney's lastest Star Wars films. But it doesn't, because the editing is too damn messy.There are moments that end as abruptly as they begin. Characters who are introduced without a word and after join la Resistance, there is scarcely any focus on them. While Kora, the protagonist gets a substantial role as does antagonist Atticus Noble, this makes the other characters characters feel even more absent.And it kills me because I know there is a longer version of the movie, so why didn't Snyder find a way to keep the character expositions and instead speed ramp some of the action scenes?The other issue was the rating. PG-13. I can tell that the film's violence would make it stand out, but this mandated rating by the studio makes it feel like watching Dune but even slower.Even so, there was enough to enjoy that I want to see more. Perhaps that's WHY I am really frustrated. If this was just a trash movie, I wouldn't be complaining. I'd just move on.I can see the where the missing scenes would fit. I even remember moments from the trailer that were absent in the film. While some of those moments are saved for the sequel, the rest are definitely meant for the extended cut. And the thing is, I am not a fan of this ""sanitized"" cut.This film had some killer action sequences in spite of the slow-motion. Similar to 300, but without the blood. There were also some really fantastic set-pieces, some of them CGI, but some also practical. The village of Veldt was hand-built ALONG with a field of wheat!And Jimmy. The Robot Jimmy is so incredible. Design-wise, and character-wise. We just needed more of him. He's not a discount C3P-0. He's actually more interesting in my opinion.Netflix and Snyder should have put their best foot forward. Quantity over quality. You can stream this movie as many times as you want, but why bother streaming this one if it's only OK at best and there's a potentially even better version coming?This film is far from soulless. I can feel it in the score of Junkie XL. In the quiet scenes on the farm and especially during the final battle. Hell, even the villain might bring something unique to the mix, going forward.And I actually was a fan of how it ended. With this being Part One, I think the sequel can actually build off this film and go a lot bigger with the action and the characters.This is a 6.5/10 for me, but I rounded upward because I am optimistic for the future. It's definitely worth a watch. Don't expect to be wowed though.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Princess Issa is believed to have the rare gift of healing and resurrection. She is expected to return the empire to a kind rule until both the King and her are assassinated. The ruthless new ruler has sent sadistic Admiral Atticus Noble to the far reaches of the galaxy to hunt down the last rebels fighting against the empire.Director Zack Snyder brings us Rebel Moon. He wrote the story and probably does everything else. This is probably his attempt at Avatar, another successful director trying to make his own space opera. He has jumbled all kinds of stories, influences, cultural identities, and all his slow-motion action together. At first, it has the Star Wars info dump without the slanted text. Then I'm getting Dune vibes. There is the Star Wars cantina with Japanese influences. Snyder is definitely borrowing heavily from Seven Samurai. There is a Roman world, an Imperial Russian world, a skyscraper world with weird creatures, a cowboys and Indian world, and an Asian world with a giant spider. Snyder is a clunky writer and the lack of restriction in sci-fi brings it out in him more than most. It doesn't make sense that this gigantic empire is so interested in that tiny village. It's bad, but it's still fun for some reason. It's like a game of spot the influence and it's got lots of fun outrageous action. It does have a surprise or two up its sleeve. I thought maybe Snyder could have some restraint and do a small story about humanizing a robot. That's not in his genes. He needs his grand epic.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

It is not a Star Wars killer as Zack Snyder intended, nor does it hold a candle to other sci-fi franchises such as the more recent dune film. However, it is a much better attempt at a wholly original story than the reviews make it out to be.There are lots of things people can nitpick and complain about, but the only bad that I want to mention is definitely the dialogue. It's hard for a person to take a show seriously when they have stilted and unnatural ways of talking. I also feel that Zack was so focused on making ""new"" sci-fi he just kinda started putting random sounds together and said good enough when naming things. Like ""here's the planet zlerpenstop, home of the karmentites"" could be a line in this movie.The good is that Zack really did make a film with deep lore for that does feel (mostly) authentic. Yes, it's very clearly Star Wars thinly vailed behind a sci-fi seven samurai, but that's ok. I enjoyed it more than I did the rise of skywalker, so I guess in that sense, maybe it is a Star Wars killer? Probably not, but maybe Star Wars is too weak to defend itself.When alls said and done, this movie is worth at least an apathetic watch. Maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised, or maybe you won't. I know that's how I watched it and I was happy with it.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

Good Visuals and cinematography are another factors that makes the whole film watchable.Still this movie goes nowhere despite a promising start. It just turns into intro of some characters from here and there worlds. Moreover characters are wasted in the name of plot twist to provide a forced climax. Meh that climax is basically the cringe twist in every universe.In the end Zack Snyder attempt creates a visually massive new world but falls way short with purpose and its ripoff characters.","76 out of 136 found this helpful.

This was going to be a Star Wars film, but happened and what is happing at Lucasfilm, it did not work out, so now Netflix have it, in cinemas now, then on TV.Do try and catch it in the cinemas, as it was filmed for it and you will miss plenty if you don't. Sofia Boutella, takes the lead, and is good at it, getting into all sorts of trouble and looks. Djimon Hounsou, Charlie Hunnam, and the great cast mix it up well, floating along the weird and wonderful universe that the film is set in. A great deal of alien creatures, the locations of the different worlds, meeting all these good and bad people, mostly bad, with lots and lots of travelling. But is it any good, yes it is, I can't wait for part two and three.","375 out of 733 found this helpful.

The secondary action shots, most notably the Harry Potter meets John Wick flying scene looked ridiculous and the poorly acted hodgepodge of a cast led by the wooden performances of Sofia Boutella, Charlie Hunnam, Michiel Huisman had me wondering who might of turned this down before they were hired. Snyder now saying he has a version that's ""not suitable for children"" as if brief scene involving sexualized leech-like creatures is just another head-shaking moment proving this paired down version isn't suitable either.

So everything Below this Paragraph was reviewed at that time.19/12/2023 - Let's Get the Positives out of the Way First -Characters - There's only 3 Good Characters in this Film so Far in my Opinion.🔫 1. Sofia Boutella as Kora - Her Performance and Screen Presence was Strong Enough to lead this Film. I liked her Backstory, it was Interesting. On top of that, She looks good for the Role, Gorgeous Fit Body and Beautiful Face 💕🤠2. Ed Skrein as Atticus Noble - I feel he Nailed his Role as a Menacing Admiral with no Remorse.👱3. Stella Grace Fitzgerald as Princess Issa - She's interesting, more so in what a Pivotal Role she Could Potentially Play in the Future of Motherworld.🎂 Themes - I liked a couple of the Themes in this film.💘1. The Theme of the Motherworld Losing the Spirit of Compassion.👱2. The Theme of Princess Issa being the One To Reignite that Lost Compassion and Drive the Motherworld into a New Hope. A New Future.🎨💐Visuals - Some of the Visuals were Eye Gazing. Tons of Gorgeous Shots. That Opening Shot was Beautiful. The Huge Scale Galactic Landscapes are Stunning to See at times. That Scene when they are Riding the Elevator downwards at the Lightsaber Womans Planet was a Breathtaking Shot. What a Stunning Shot. 😮⌛Slow Motion - Some of the Slow Motion Battles were a Treat to Watch. That First Slow Motion Battle when the Young Girl is Being Captured was Pretty Good. Sofia Boutellas movements and Manoeuvres and her hair swaying around as she attacks each guy in that Scene were Great to See.🎵 Neutral Note - The Score was Ok, it wasn't Bad.That's where the Positives Stop. 🚫Negatives -📜 1. The Script - Who is Checking and Greenlighting these Scripts? Are they Writing and Reading these Scripts Thoroughly? And When they are Writing these Scripts, are they Concentrating Whilst Reading and Writing these Scripts? There's not Enough Meaningful Dialogue between Characters and there's No Development of Almost Anything. Good Lord🙋2a. All these other Characters - Charlie Hunnam, Tarak (Still looks promising to be fair), The Farmer Guy, Djimon Hounsou, Lightsaber Woman, BloodAxe & Bloodaxes' Sister(both looked and sounded promising and then completely wasted), Robot Dude. 🤖🤦🏻 2b. All those characters I just listed were either completely Underwritten or Useless. They might as well of been 2D Cardboard Cutouts.🌆 3. Where's the World-Building? We visit too many damn Places when we could of Explored a Few of the Places(Especially that place that the Lightsaber Woman was from, Some Stunning Shots there) and got to know more about this particular world and what the view is from them about the Imperium Situation. The Story about the Royal Family of the Motherworld, I wanna see more of that, I wanna see the Scale of Imperiums influence Across the Galaxy. Do others See them as Great because of the Love they once conveyed? Or are Others mounting up attacks and Revolts against them just like Bloodaxe?🤷 Overall, Rebel Moon Part 1 was a Great Opportunity to Build, Build, Build, this Fantastic World and have some Very Good Characters and Storytelling, as I said, there are some Great themes here. Let's Hope that Rebel Moon Part 2 Strengthens and Hones these Elements and really Gets things Going.","171 out of 345 found this helpful.

Yes there are comparisons to Star Wars, Seven Samurai and Magnificent Seven etc but they are also great films. And there are many films that are similar to each other. But Rebel Moon actually had lots of interesting characters with an actual good female lead. At the risk of getting shot down there was alot of aspects I preferred compared to the Star Wars series and given enough time it could be a very interesting new world. Its about time we got a new fresh story rather than another rubbish attempt to continue a Star Wars film or another Marvel film trying to continue a dead franchise or an awful Fast and the Furious film. This was filmed in a great art style although a little CGI heavy. But yet again it would be hard to get this visual art style in true real life sets. As for the comments on over use of slow motion i didn't mind it. It was very similar style to Sucker Punch which also got bad reviews but I also didn't mind that. Although I may have compared it to past films try to go into it not comparing it to other similar movies and try to enjoy it as something new. I enjoyed it and look forward to the universe growing and hope all the negtive reviews don't win leading to it getting cancelled before it can grow like so many good things do.","117 out of 216 found this helpful.

He is double-downing on the same techniques and framing that have dominated his past endeavors (the slow-motion action sequences do little the 10th time around, like when the Transformers 17th movie keeps showing and extending the slo-mo transform... we got it the first time.These are not trademarks of Snyder's, they are crutches.

While undeniably captivating, the film does encounter a few narrative speed bumps, but its overall brilliance is a testament to Snyder's unique vision & style that may not be fully understood by all, leaving audiences with a taste of an epic space saga that promises even greater wonders in the next installment.The film masterfully blends elements from iconic sources, creating a narrative mosaic that feels simultaneously nostalgic & fresh. The echoes of Dune resonate in the grand scale & intricate world-building, providing a captivating backdrop for the unfolding story. Seven Samurai's influence brings a sense of camaraderie & heroism to the forefront, enriching the character dynamics with depth & emotion. Mass Effect's impact is felt in the futuristic & intergalactic elements, creating a universe that sparks the imagination with layers of complexity.Rebel Moon, however, is not without its flaws. Some portions of the story feel rushed, leaving audiences yearning for a more thorough exploration of certain plot points & character arcs. Despite these pacing issues, the film manages to redeem itself through moments of sheer cinematic brilliance. The visual spectacle, combined with intense action sequences, delivers on the promise of an epic space adventure.The criticism directed at Rebel Moon seems somewhat perplexing, especially given the film's ability to seamlessly incorporate influences into a cohesive narrative. Perhaps the detractors fail to fully grasp Zack Snyder's unique filmmaking approach. Snyder has a distinct style that blends visual prowess with thematic depth, it's possible that some critics are not attuned to the nuances of his storytelling.In conclusion, Rebel Moon stands as a testament to Zack Snyder's ability to craft visually striking & emotionally resonant films in his own inherent style. While the narrative pacing may stumble at times, the movie's overall impact is undeniably powerful. Those who appreciate Snyder's distinct cinematic language will find much to love in Rebel Moon, it serves as a reminder that sometimes, criticism may stem from a lack of understanding rather than genuine shortcomings in the film itself.","145 out of 274 found this helpful.

The story itself isn't much of a copy of Star Wars, like others have said, but it feels like more of a copy of seven samurai minus the scene where they help defend the village. Which will probably be the next film.The characters are pretty shallow in my opinion. The main character was OK with no story whatsoever. Her character development was good, but that's about it. The character development of the other characters are very shallow as well.The production value was good. The visual effects were good, but he uses Slo mo was way too much.

While the film has its moments of grandeur and spectacle, it is not without its flaws.Positive Aspects:Visual Spectacle: Snyder's cinematic flair is on full display, with breathtaking visuals that transport the audience to a mesmerizing cosmic landscape. The space battles, alien worlds, and intricate set designs contribute to an immersive viewing experience.Action Sequences: The film doesn't shy away from intense and well-choreographed action sequences. The combination of practical effects and CGI creates a thrilling and dynamic spectacle, with Snyder's trademark slow-motion shots adding a unique flair to the combat scenes.World-Building: ""Rebel Moon"" introduces audiences to a vast and intricately crafted universe. The various planets, factions, and cultures are distinct, providing a rich backdrop for potential future installments. The lore is expansive and hints at a broader narrative waiting to unfold.Negative Aspects:Thin Character Development: One of the film's main drawbacks is its lack of substantial character development. While the protagonist, played by a charismatic lead, is intriguing, many supporting characters feel underdeveloped, making it challenging for the audience to invest emotionally in their arcs.Pacing Issues: The film struggles with pacing, especially in its first act. The narrative takes time to find its footing, and the exposition-heavy dialogue can be overwhelming. The film's ambitious scope sometimes leads to uneven pacing, with moments of slow contemplation followed by frenetic action.Predictable Plot Elements: ""Rebel Moon"" relies on some familiar sci-fi tropes and plot twists, making certain narrative beats feel predictable. While the film attempts to subvert expectations, it occasionally succumbs to genre conventions, leaving viewers with a sense of déjà vu.Exposition Overload: The film occasionally leans heavily on exposition to convey its complex universe, leading to information overload. Some viewers may find it challenging to keep track of the various factions, histories, and relationships presented in rapid succession.Conclusion:""Rebel Moon Part One: A Child Of Fire"" is a visually stunning space epic that showcases Zack Snyder's directorial prowess. While it falls short in terms of character development and pacing, the film's potential for future installments and its captivating universe may redeem its shortcomings. It's an engaging watch for fans of the genre, though there is room for improvement in the storytelling department. As the title suggests, this is only the beginning, and the promise of a more refined narrative in subsequent parts leaves room for optimism.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

It raises a question about the state of contemporary filmmaking - a realm seemingly entrapped in the formulaic clutches of predictable narratives.The lamentation echoes: What has become of the fertile ground where original ideas sprouted, nurtured by writers who dared to traverse uncharted territories of imagination? The current cinematic landscape appears to be a desolate space, bereft of the daring minds that once breathed life into innovative concepts.Gone are the days when directors aspired to propel the medium forward, pioneering new narrative techniques and visual storytelling. Rebel Moon, rather than breaking new ground, seems to fall into the shadow of nostalgia, trying to expand upon things by copying them?The disheartening realization persists - where are the auteurs who once embarked on a journey to redefine the boundaries of cinema, to challenge both themselves and their audiences? Rebel Moon becomes a symbolic epitome of an industry seemingly entangled in the allure of familiar tropes, forsaking the spirit of exploration that once defined its essence.Perhaps, in the search for blockbuster success, the industry has momentarily overlooked the vital spark that ignites when originality collides with artistic expression. As audiences yearn for narratives that transcend the mundane, one can only hope that the cinematic realm rediscovers its appetite for risk-taking and the untamed territories of creativity.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Almost unwatchable in places. Clunky dialogue only adequately delivered. Distinctly dodgy attempts at British regional accents (for whatever reason that was required I don't know). CGI that appeared to date back to the phantom menace which gave the whole film a video game quality. A story line we've seen many many times before - the 7 samurai, the magnificent 7, the dirty dozen, oceans 11. Goodies that speak in reverential and serious tones (and hence are boring to watch - where's the humour?) and baddies that were so over the top that I almost expected Roger Moore's James 'bond to appear in scenes with them. And why did Antony Hopkins agree to voice a robot, and be the narrator up front? What was he thinking?And above all.....it was actually very slow and boring. 2 hours (there are 15 minutes of credits at the end, and no I couldn't be bothered to check if there was a hidden scene contained) to assemble a team and yet fail miserably to give any of them (with the exception of the main protagonist) any back story whatsoever to make us care about them. I was delighted it stopped 5-10 minutes earlier than I'd feared.

This movie is about a tyrannical empire wanting to take control of a small farming village for it's resources, and how the villagers react and respond and fight back against this vast empire. This movie came to past because Zack Snyder went to Disney with a proposition about a Star Wars movie. They ultimately turned him down, but he went ahead and made the movie anyway. So naturally, I can't watch this and not think of it as a Star Wars Story. If you put it into the light of Star Wars and imagine it as being part of that universe it enhances the plot greatly. It gives meaning to this rebellion that would otherwise have no prior emotion to it. But as a stand alone Sci-Fi film the plot is pretty basic. A runaway powerful protagonist decides to fight am evil antagonistic Empire and assembles a team to help.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 5/10
It doesn't disappoint if you are looking to be entertained for the full film. The action sequences in particular are quite engaging and suck you into it well. However, the classic Zack Snyder unnecessary and overdone slow motion really kills this vibe, and pulls you out of what could be some very cool action shots. In the middle to end of the second act get kind of slow and boring. It tends to be the same ""find someone to help us by helping them first"" over and over again for each character.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 5/10
Nothing in this movie grips you and pulls out your emotions. This being like a semi Star Wars movie helps a lot with the investment. If you imagine it being in the Star Wars universe against the Empire then you have more of a leg to stand on and care about the conflict. But as a stand alone it doesn't do much to make you want to care about the conflict.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 6/10
The theme is really to not just stand by and watch people suffer when you are capable of doing something about it. A lot of small good can come together to defeat one big evil.5. Characters - 7/10
There was a lot of difference between each character, and they were fleshed out decently well. However, there just enough time to understand each one's back story well enough. For the short time they spend with each character it feels like enough time, and they executed teaching about their characters well. Each of their actions seem very justified and true to their character.6. Acting / Writing - 7/10
All of the actors were very good, and were good choices for their characters. The writing wasn't perfect and kind of cheesy at times, especially with the classic hero speeches. But mostly it felt good with each character.7. Cinematography - 3/10
This is a Zack Snyder film, so it is filmed like one. The whole film is very dark and grainy. It is filmed in a way that had most of each shot blurry and out of focus. There is one singular focus point and the rest of the shot is blurry. I despise these kind of shots, especially when combined with the whole film being pretty dark for most of it.8. Score - 4/10
Wasn't anything crazy or emotional. Didn't really notice or think about it while watching to be honest. Nothing really stands out.9. Editing / Pace - 5/10
It was edited fine. Nothing to spectacular or bad. The camera would cut a lot during fight scenes which I don't particularly like. Fight scenes are always better when you can see the whole fight clearly with good choreography. The pace was pretty slow. Especially act two. The setup in act one was slow, and then in between act one and two it sped up a bit. Then slowed down quite a bit before the climax.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 5/10
The CGI in this movie wasn't great. It honestly could even just be bad. It looked like it came out of a TV show budget. But a lot of the effects were really good. Like all the blood or closeup shots had good CGI to them. But wider shots is really where it struggled. And things like backdrops just looked terrible and almost cartoony.Average score:
5.4/10My Overall Ranking and Final Thoughts:
6.75/10
I really do like this movie and would recommend it. Especially if you like Sci-Fi films. Just be prepared for A LOT of unnecessary slow motion shots, and fast cutting action sequences. It left me excited for the sequal and to see where the story leads.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I personally liked his work on ""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole, 300 and Watchman"". But as a whole, I just didn't care or connect with many of his works. I won't say I hate his works cause I do believe he has some talents. Rebel Moon is a new project from Snyder but unfortunately, it really feels like a rejected version of Star Wars that feels derivative and extremely boring.The visual effects, productions and costumes are pretty good as the costumes and productions look colorful. Although there are some bad CGI effects. Snyder direction and the writing feels all over the place as if Snyder was implementing many different concepts and ideas but wasn't really sure how to put it together well and makes it messy. I do appreciate that Snyder is trying something different and following his vision but the narrative feels unspecial and messy that it didn't really grasp my attention. The performances are okay but it's a shame cause many of the cast members are actors I like but unfortunately their performances felt a bit underwhelming and were provided with poor dialogue and uninteresting character arches.For the action and thrills, it's messy. I did find some of the action moments to be interesting but the use of slow-motion and the convoluted style causes the action and thrills to fall apart. The editing, soundtrack, and the pacing is pretty off and the tone feels unbalanced.Clearly Snyder fans are going to enjoy this movie which is great for them but I personally didn't care for this movie.","201 out of 426 found this helpful.

World development was too rushed along with the back ground/flashback stories. As much as it is exciting to introduce a new world of different si-fi that isnt the big 3 there is a lot that is needed to unpack here.The only hope I have of this series is to see the future Warhammer 40k series that Henry Cavill and the production company take notes from this series... what ever this was.Beyond that I do hope that second movie at least in editing wise can pick up what happened in this movie.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I feel it needed to continue rather than finish where it did. It feels a bit lacking because in 4 months the second part comes out. This gives us the problem in that essentially we have an epic length movie split into two parts. The film maker walks the line where we are teased with the story and given enough to keep us interested, but they don't want to give away too much in plot and action or the second film will suffer from a kind of the avengers thanos syndrome (the second film just couldn't quite live up to the storyline and action of the first) and this feels like a story so far film...The effects are beautiful and there well done as you'd expect, Did remind me slightly of 300 with the slow motion action screen in parts, there are some beautiful scenery, touching scenes that are hopefully in place to set the future story. - i would have liked a little more storyline flushing on rest of our motley crew rather then just the main hero flashbacks. A little more back story for them to help us build our relationships and perhaps build bit more emotional connection to the characters would be good so when the story continues we are bit more invested.So I'm left asking would it have been better to just release it all at once and see it in it's completed state? I guess we'll have to wait and see. But my instinct is yes this will be much more appreciated when you can back to back both films and see the story in its entirety.One line review: All in all worth the watch but do hope more to come in part two.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

That is exactly what happened here.I can list a few things.1. The casting is totally off. The lead actress did not suit for the role nor she is charismatic to pull this off. Her dialogue delivery just made me less interested. She randomly goes to a new world and tells them directly that she wants to fight mother world(What if they are spies?). Hey, her dialogue gets rebels to leave everything behind and fight for her. So who am I to say her delivery is bad?2. The CGI is not really great at many places.3. The action sequences are boring and on screen looked ""TRY HARD"".4. Predictable villains and their villainy. Nothing new here.5. Most of the movie carries a shade of grey. He ruined Super Man and he did in this again. I swear I hate grey and grey shades from now on.6. The primary cause of all this is ""grain"". You have technically far too advanced and those civilisations failed to work out a smart way to produce food? Snyder's creative mind alone can answer these questions.7. Right from costumes, dialogues, hair, lighting, editing and direction are mediocre.Snyder is one of the directors who thinks his imagination and vision is on another level. Watch his interviews. The thing is visionaries already did all these with less budget and more creative output. A man should know when to stop really. If you are going to design your main villain after Nazis for a sci-fi film in 2023, you should really hang up.","126 out of 260 found this helpful.

At points, transitions felt like time jumps, the story was so challenging to follow. Was it an attempt to be economical with the total length, to the detriment of storytelling?It's also disappointing to see a talented and beautiful cast robbed of the opportunity to display their skills in one dimensional characters whose relationships have to be articulated explicitly through dialogue rather than exposition and development. As a viewer, I didn't care what happened to them because they seemed connected to nothing. The villains are driven by greed? Power? Evil? The protagonists are fighting to preserve only their food supply? Where did this conflict start? Nothing had enough backstory to give the viewer any traction.

This film is an edgy mishmash of the most generic sci-fi and fantasy tropes with some of the most flat characters I've ever seen in a film. While many have pointed to Star Wars as an obvious point of inspiration, Rebel Moon seems to be biting off of Seven Samurai very blatantly: as its premise revolves around a former imperial officer has to recruit a number of other notable fighters across the galaxy to protect a village from an impending force that will kill them all if they do not supply them with grain in 10 weeks.Besides the narrative plagiarism, Rebel Moon also has no real sense of originality in the universe it inhabits, as so many of the locations in this film are straight up lifted from other films/genres. These include your average dusty farm planet serving as both a Tatooine/Western townsplace, a Blade Runner-esque cyberpunk planet, and a Roman coliseum planet that looks like it was a leftover set from Gladiator.The characters are even worse, as they all are absolutely devoid of any personality and give absolute no reason as to why they would want to fight for these villagers that they barely know. Despite this, Zack Snyder desperately wants you to think that they are cool so he gives them ultra-edgy names like ""Bloodaxe"", ""Nemesis"", and ""Decimus"". This even applies to the villains, who are the most generic evildoers imaginable. Their outfits are the most on the nose Nazi parodies, with the main baddie Atticus Noble being the worst offender, looking like a wannabe Hans Landa with a Richard Spencer haircut.Despite the edgy dark tone that Rebel Moon is trying to go for, the action is surprisingly neutered, as the camera seems to be afraid to show any actual blood beyond just a quick blaster wound. That being said, this film has a remarkably high number of attempted sexual assault scenes that only seem to be in the movie in order to reinforce that this is a ""mature, adult sci-fi"" movie despite its PG-13 rating.","49 out of 94 found this helpful.

If you realize it's an overly stylized fairy tale, it's a fine enough watch. Everything is childishly direct: the strong female hero with a dark past, the Nazi-cliché-like villains, the heroic... heroes forming a party, the quest, the good king and queen and princess, the rogue, the traitor, etc. This is a fantasy story, a very simplified one, in space. Once you get that through your head, you can relax: no need to think, well... anything.And what did you expect? I loved Watchmen, but other than that (or maybe even that), every other thing from Snyder is an overly stylized party of heroes quest thing. In history, in space, in the future, in the mind of an abused child, in the DCU, there are always some muscly men and some fierce women plus the occasional robot fighting stupid physical fights for justice. This film is exactly this.And yes, things are ridiculous when people fight physical fights against starships and future soldiers with future weapons. This crap works best where it belongs: in fantasy feudal lands with swords or where superheroes can fight modern weaponry with magical superpowers. But you turned off your brain, as I instructed, right? So you can enjoy the nice CGI, the terrible formulaic plot and the twists you can smell a mile away. I am even looking forward to Part 2. It's not like I want to look at some foreign film where people have real dramas and real emotions that they can't punch away.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Fight scenes were done well also.I won't get too much into the plot since other reviews go into that in detail.I will say that I really enjoy most of Snyder's other work, so maybe take this with grain of salt, although going into the movie I didn't know he directed it.IMHO this is worth watching, although maybe not at the same level as classics such as Rogue One.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

The lynching of this movie is obviously not related to the movie, it is a decision taken before the movie for populism or other reasons. I have no respect for audiences who cannot form their own opinions and make judgments under the influence of others, or critics who comment on films based on their own financial interests.Does the film have any visual value to offer? Definitely. Grand storytelling? Tried. Action scenes? It will do. Does the world of the film feel big and deep? Mostly. Are the decisions the characters make meaningful and logical? Not really, but this is the first time I've seen people who can't get enough of criticizing this movie attach importance to this. I wish you could make this criticism on other movies too.The movie is not really a masterpiece. But does it deserve to be so criticized? Not by our people, who have been praising much less valuable works in the last decade.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

It's a simple one. But the world building and stylized nature of it still provide a wonderful and epic experience reminiscent of a vivid dream or a Greek myth of heroes and villains like The Odyssey. I believe Zack Snyder, like James Cameron with Avatar, set out to build a world unlike any other rather than tell a completely new story. I see value in that. Cinema isn't JUST about story, otherwise there would be no reason for the medium. Just read a book. The world building and character design are equally as important in film. So, is Rebel Moon Pt. 1 perfect? Far from it. But it does a lot well.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's beautiful looking garbage. It's as if someone made a movie entirely out of movie trailers. It's like the director asked AI to create some sci-fi fantasy images and then they found an excuse to get all the required characters into the scene to recreate the AI images.I found myself completely uninvested in any of the characters. I couldn't tell you the name of a single character if you offered me a million dollars. I mean there is no-shirt guy. I like to call him 'Space Spartan from the movie 300"". And ... well, insect spider lady that had mammal boobs for some reason. And... well.. that's it.It is steals, sorry... ""borrows"" from so many other franchises. Star Wars, obviously. And Seven Samurai--but in a way even more obvious than how Star Wars borrowed from Seven Samurai. Even the ship looks derivative of the ship from Firefly--complete with large two story cargo bay where characters hang out and chat.The ""plot"" is that this lady is going around trying to gather Seven Space-Samurai to defend their space-farming village from the very WWII nazi-looking space-empire soldiers. Soldiers that are so comically evil and incapable of following orders that I couldn't suspend my disbelief and kept wondering how anyone could lead these troops. How could they could accomplish anything? I mean, it would be total chaos all the time.Anyhow... I feel dumber for having watched this.

The acting is solid, not groundbreaking, but it gets the job done.Now, the plot may give you some déjà vu vibes, especially if you're a Star Wars buff or into the whole galactic warfare scene. It's like we've been here before, right? But hold on, ""Rebel Moon"" throws in a curveball. Sure, it feels like we've seen it all, but it's got its own groove going.I was half-expecting this to be another Marvel copycat, but surprise, surprise! It swerves away from the usual Marvel formula. The plot's got more layers than your standard superhero flick, which is a breath of fresh air. It's not just about the explosions and flashy suits.Now, before you jump to conclusions and think it's trying to outdo Star Wars, just hit the brakes. ""Rebel Moon"" ain't aiming to dethrone the classics. It's got its own flavor, and you've gotta taste it without expecting a Star Wars rehash.I'm already eyeing Part 2 because I'm hoping they'll keep building on the characters and the story they've got going.

You can tell there's a gritty, down and dirty sci-fi gem hidden in there but it's been neutered to get an appropriate age rating. I understand why it was done - larger target audience etc. But first impressions count for a lot. Netflix and Snyder have played a dangerous game by realising a sanitised version.I may be biased as I enjoy the whole ragtag band of misfits trope, but the film isn't as bad as most reviews make it out to be. The film basically takes that trope and runs with it for 2.5 hours. Then it ends. There lies the main problem; we now have to wait 5 months for the pay off. Would a 4 hour long R-rated offering rather than two (essentially four when the r-rated cuts are released) 2.5 hour long films really turn people off?

Ok, it won't win any prices for the screenplay or acting but it was a fun watch. It's a weird world with strange characters blended together, true, it's a bunch of everything but it's a fun watch, isn't that what sci-fi is supposed to be? It's way better than any of the disney star wars sequels for sure. It's got the classic by now split of the the evil white guys that are the negative characters and the diverse group of positive characters with a minority woman in the lead and the strong black men, which noawadays are mandatory, so it got that checked. The visuals are great, it has action, honestly a fun, brainless watch, for the weekend when you don't feel like thinking but just enjoy a movie. It feels like it crams a few too many things together and the way the characters are introduced feels forced, like it would have been better as a series with a full episode dedicated to each character. This is why I took points off mostly. The acting while not great is not horrible either, it just feels like a series more than a movie, I guess that would be the feeling it gives me. Still, worth a watch if you want a basic SF that takes you to a strange new universe without making you think, just a relaxing watch.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

There are some things that are a bit burdensome, such as the constant use of slow motion, some rushed cuts to the next scene without an interlude and then the choreography in the fight scenes is also a bit crooked... The effects and scenery are different but cool enough. I actually think the personal gallery is fine too. And Ed Skrein is always good as hell. I agree that it doesn't bear comparison with Dune and probably not Starwars either. The story is not innovative either, but honorable and all in all I was well entertained. I'm actually looking forward to seeing part 2.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Zack's slow motion moves gave 300 an added edge especially in the action scenes, but now it is in danger of becoming a parody. Why the urge to have slow mo shots in even non-action scenes, e.g. Hugging, planting a flag? And even in action scenes, doesn't Zack get it by now that, too much of an ingredient can actually spoil the taste? I'd wanna watch action scenes flowing smoothly, and while I don't mind the occasional slow mo, having one too many just yanks at the adrenalin build-up within that scene.Underneath Rebel Moon is a plot and narrative with good potential. Maybe the next Dune or Star Wars. Unfortunately this is wasted with poor acting, and poor character and plot development.Having a wooden lead in Sofia Boutella, who fails to project a commanding screen presence is probably the biggest bug. This is nowhere near her turnout in Star Trek, which was probably her best screen role to date.While there are some big names in the acting department, most of them have inconsequential screen time other than when they are showing off their respective fighting skills when called into duty by Boutella's Kora. For e.g. Djimon Hounsou's General Titus is supposed to be a fearsome and skilled warrior, but I can't even recall his fight scenes. It's the same with the rest of the team that make up the rebel warriors, they end up being remembered more for their painted faces or exposed upper body. The final battle scene too, doesn't last long enough to register; in fact, the one scene that I thought was worth the effort was when Donna Bae's Nemesis faced off Harmada. But after that, Nemesis too, slips into the background.The few moments that lit up the screen was when Charlie Hunnam and Ed Skrein were on it. Hunnam's experience probably helped elevate an otherwise short screen time who pretty much stepped into the background until the final moments. Whereas Skrein chews it away with relish playing the baddie, carrying it off as well as he did with his Zapan in Alita Battle Angel. Take these two away, and the rest of the cast are mostly forgettable.And, what's with Irish brogue? Gee whizz, this is supposed to be taking place in a galaxy far, far away, and yet, they sound like they're hanging out at the streets of Dublin? Why mess up whatever dose of realism that exists?Rebel Moon has potential, and while I'm not sure how Pt 2 is gonna turn out, but if it's more of the same as in Pt 1, then it's not going to give us anything fresh or new.And that means we don't really have anything to look forward to.","32 out of 60 found this helpful.

That being said, however, it is by no means a bad fillm and an average rating around 6 or so would have been honest, but given the excessive criticism it received I preferred to give it, though not on merit, that extra half point...The story is absolutely clichéd however I find that, at least in this first part, it is particularly well rendered and all in all it holds up well, it does not shine but it is okay and manages to entertain.The real highlight of the film is the aesthetic compartment, extremely bombastic and visually charged, which considering the genre and the settings fits perfectly with the atmospheres that the film proposes which, combined with Snyder's direction (which I dislike a lot but in certain contexts like this one in my opinion works) gives the whole thing an ""epic patina"" with a certain visual display, even vaguely stylized (really in certain aspects it reminded me of the illustrations on the covers of old sci-fi books) which in this case doesn't hurt.So overall I would say it is by no means this bad movie as much as it is a perfectly enjoyable good entertainment film.... Perhaps it could be coming across as pretentious? But is the film itself more pretentious ho who has particular demands from the film in question?","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

The reason this movie has such a low rating is a bunch of Star Wars snobs are expecting something it is not. I love Star Wars and this movie is not Star Wars. It only similarity in the end but that is it. There was no force, no Luke, no Yoda... It was a very good action movie that has potential to be a really good and unique series. The lead actress does a good job and her fighting is very entertaining and the supporting cast were good as well. The main antagonist was excellent, his best roll since Deadpool. One bad thing about the movie was the amount of slow-mo action was a bit too much.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

The action is quite impressive, the worldbuilding has the potential to tell interesting stories and cultures. Unfortunately, the characters are bland, the story feels like a mix of ""A New Hope"" and ""The Last Samurai."" Unfortunately, the enemies also come across as a cheap copy of the Germans from the Third Reich, both visually and in terms of the plot. If a more creative story had been told, perhaps not so diluted (in the form of a series?), it could have been a lot of fun. I will watch the second part, but I'd be surprised, if the second one is better or different than the first one.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

These scenes depict a totally Earth-like world, some wears T-shirt, some wears necktie (!), there is no even costums. There is no fantasy, no invention in it. It is no a magical world but a tasteless, boring scene.But there is bigger problem with the the antagonist. Star Wars' Darth Vader was an alien-like, mighty, frightening character, full of mistery, but in Rebel Moon the enemy isn't enough daunting and interesting, it has no strong personality, no face with definite contours. Noble is a miserable clown, his soldiers are small-minded, stupid men with only dumb sexual motivation. You can't feel the power and the threatening presence of the evil, as you did so seeing the Star Destroyers and Death Star in Star Wars. So there is no true, gripping conflict in this film.At the second half of the film Kora is hopping from planet to planet. The problem is that none of this worlds and their people is interesting enough, they are underdeveloped, you don't know anything about them. The characters (Nemesis, Tarak etc.) have no personality (or, only in visual appearence), no background story, no any motivation - why do they fight with Kora? Their presence is only a flash on the screen.There are few interesting landscapes and buildings. Backgrounds are empty, in most of the cases you can see only the gloomy sky or some blurry tower, walls. Colours are greyish, it should be more light on the screen.Only Sofia Boutella is great, she is so charismatic, beautiful like a nymph and agressive like a soldier at the same time. She would have deserved a better film.","81 out of 171 found this helpful.

The visual effects are also very good, especially when called upon so much for a sci-fi film (recent Disney releases have been much worse). The plot although not groundbreaking is easy to follow and makes sense, although is clearly a set up for the 2nd.If you want an easy viewing sci-fi film to just sit back and relax to then this is worth a try.

This movie is heavily influenced by much better media, and yet somehow fails to capture even a modicum of it's influencers brilliance. The main character is dull and uninteresting to watch (not the actress' fault). The side characters just seem to appear as the plot demands, no real reason for why we need them other than to make the film feel seven samurai esque. The dialogue...oh my God the dialogue, who the heck talks like that? Nobody.Now Zach is known for his amazing action scenes, but they were no where to be found here, the frequent use of slow motion, plus the unnecessary need for cool shots really turned this movie's action scenes on it's head, matter of fact i got so bored with some of it that i had to skip, skip again, then hyper skip. (Thank God for that netflix skip button).There is also a twist in this movie that even a child could see coming, it's a wonder how a trained soldier and her lackeys couldn't see it too. All in all, this movie is dreadful and Zach should not be allowed to write his scripts alone or maybe even at all. 3/10.","40 out of 79 found this helpful.

Borrowing elements from Star Wars, Chronicles of Riddick, and Battle Beyond the Stars, Snyder excels in blending this diverse mix into a visually hard-hitting, coherent, and entertaining ride that holds potential for the beginnings of something special.Sofia Boutella as Kora is notable, alongside the likeable cast ensemble. Ed Skrein as antagonist Admiral Atticus Noble makes for a memorable character. Both Charlie Hunnam and Michiel Huisman deserve a mention. Anthony Hopkin's dulcet tones as the voice of mechanical knight of Jimmy is a fitting addition.Granted, there are moments of overkill, along with lingering slow-motion scenes. While the costumes are intricate and beautifully made, they never distinctly define the differences between the players, especially in the case of the rebels Nevertheless, with a few twists and an abundance of flashbacks and exposition thrown in, the synergy between acting, special effects, Tom Holkenborg's score and staging contributes to the film's overall compelling and immersive nature.Highly recommended science fiction -take a look for yourself.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Honestly, you can create a better character story by skipping up and down channels on freeview and calling yourself a directorYes ok, the Borg Queen with a spider body is a nice effect, although nothings we haven't seen before but, no amount of Firefly Class & Battlefleet Gothic knock off ships could drag this movie out of the black hole left by the reported £130 budgetThe only close thing to a saving grace are the occasional fight sequences which, if not for the horrendous over use of super slow motion, Judge Dread guns and laser swords would almost make a salvageable 15-20 minutes of viewingBut hey, if you get bored, you can always just pretend you're watching literally any other B movie spin off from pretty much any sci-fi universe that takes your fancyI've never written a movie review before, which I hope tells you how abysmal this time theft dross is.

I love Zach Snyder and thought his Justice League cut was a masterpiece. I think this movie had a lot of great potential but it just unfortunately doesn't live up to the hype. It's got incredible visuals and special effects. Musical score is good. Performances are solid. Character building is minimal. I really didn't feel like we had enough time in 2 hours to understand any of the characters enough to truly care about them other than Kora herself. Writing was subpar. Costume design was a bit off. Why are the soldiers wearing what looks like tortoise shells? Why is the arch nemesis wearing a simple white dress shirt and black tie? Why is his most menacing weapon what appears to be a simple cane? Why do the soldiers speak in a US military style dialect? And for the love of God can we please move on from these movies depicting what appears to be a skinny female waif sustaining on 1200 calories a day who we're supposed to believe can defeat a room full of fully armed and muscled super soldiers? No offense to Sofia Boutella...I mean, she's gorgeous but am I really supposed to believe she's some sort of Seal Team 6 assassin? Do something like Felicity Jones in Rogue One. That was more believable but this was just...way over the top. Some of those fight scenes had me rolling my eyes. All that being said, my wife enjoyed it much more than I did. I think the best performance was probably Ed Skrein as the bad guy. The most interesting performance was the robot voiced by Anthony Hopkins but he's barely in the film. I'll come back and re-vote after I get to watch the director's cut. I really hope it's much better and fleshes in more details.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

No. It's entertaining and its populated with actors I really like, including a nearly unrecognizable Corey Stoll, Michiel Huisman. And Sofia Boutella. I enjoyed it. So if you like sci-fi, give it a try and you also might be pleasantly surprised. I really like Boutella a lot, and I enjoyed her as much in this as I did in The Kingsman and Star Trek.

The main problem starts with the poor storytelling. From the beginning there is no real character development, the audience gets introduced to a bunch of protagonists, species, worlds and conflicts with some flashy recaps, not understanding what's the overall framework/role of each one and which leads at the end to more unanswered and open questions. The movie also feels like a copy of different previous works by mixing elements from Star Wars, dune, Harry Potter mixed with Conan (LOL) or other movies, trying to create something better.

The plot is 100% inspired by the 1954 movie Seven Samurai, and the mmany copies of it like the more American 1960 The Magnificent Seven. History truly repeats itself.Movies 4, 5, and 6 of star wars did not have the great dialogue, yet I had a ball in the theatre, even with Jar Jar Binks.No, no oscar awards here . This is a live action comic book movie, akin to the silver age. Think Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers. Gang, it is just plain fun and I did not mind all the slow mo scenes Snyer adores to use. It was fine.My picky 15 year old jaded teen daughter liked it, and my ancient self did as well. At times it is fun to watch a movie with a super simple plot, where good and evil are super defined unlike Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning and that convoluted layered plot that requires an evidence board to keep semi straight. Not in this movie, poor falmers good, nazi looking gestapo storm troopers bad. Easy.That this was supposed to be a Star Wars movie that Disney turned down is very evident. Too bad, too. Better than the force awakens trash. There is zero wokeness in this movie, and the female lead is not unbeatable or all powerful . She knows she needs help.This is the pg13 version. There will be Snyder cut that will be about 4 hours long with more meat. Not kidding you. I heard it will add all the character development that was removed from this version. The biggest weakness the movie has is lack of character development. First though we need to get past part 2 in early 2024.

I was going to watch it either way. The people who are giving this movie ratings of 1, 2, 3 stars clearly were not watching this movie with the intent of just kicking back and enjoying a new sci-fi movie. They went into it with all the knowledge of what brought it about to begin with, who made it, and I believe had already decided that they were going to watch it with a super critical eye, and they had great fun tearing it apart when it was over. I feel it is being judged a bit too harshly.Are there plenty of cliche' sci-fi tropes here? Of course. Can you draw parallels to other fairly recent characters and themes from other big name movies? You bet. Nowadays I think it is nearly impossible to find any TRULY unique and original movies of any genre anymore. Everything has been done. So now the studios are just redoing them.Honestly I enjoyed it. I popped my popcorn and I put the movie on and I relaxed and watched a pretty solid movie. It's a Netflix movie. It was never going to make a billion dollars. But it's a decent popcorn flick with plenty of action, okay storytelling, and one or two characters you might begin to care about. The special effects were solid. The world building was fine, you can only do so much of that when trying to stuff as much into two hours as they do here. A bit overwrought and melodramatic too much of the time, but it is dealing with heavy stuff.To be honest with you, about the only thing that REALLY annoyed me were the uniforms of the villainous and ruthless Realm officers, which you will see relatively soon in the movie. Stylized SS uniforms or maybe Soviet era uniforms. Long jackets, jackboots, peaked cap hats, skinny ties, and tall collars, it's all there. No imagination at all. Change the SS or Hammer & Sickle on the collars and hats to some other squiggly lines and you've got innovative costume design. THAT is cliche'.Will I watch part 2? Yes I will. Is this the beginning of the next huge sci-fi universe, destined to spawn numerous sequels and huge fandom? No it is not. Relax, eat your popcorn, and watch with an open mind. Don't let others overly influence your enjoyment of what is ultimately an enjoyable movie.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

It was taking so much just to keep my expectations reasonable. So I kinda have a lot to say.Now in case you don't want to read the whole thing I'll condense it into a paragraph: basically the premise of the movie, the creature concepts and the characters types were great, visually it's a marvel; but when it came to the story and giving characters depth, it falls flat. Zack had a great vision/idea, he just should've had great writers to go with it. For screen play and dialogue. Cinematography was great, because if you watch this on mute this looks cool af.I loved the Zac snyder's justice league so I was hoping this will be like that and just kill it on first try instead of waiting for the directors cut, but it just feels like so much is missing in terms of character exploration and just has expositions in general where it's just narrated, mostly Kora.The initial world-building in the movie was great, providing a vivid glimpse into life and setting the tone visually. However, things only started took a turn after the characters left the moon/village. The film start with Anthony Hopkins' prologue and a score that felt of Game of Thrones-y. The beginning gave me immense promise, establishing a dark and captivating sci-fi ambiance. Visually, it was stunning-abounding with hero shots and scenes that seemed like they could be turned into paintings. The film showcased a strong vision in terms of creativity, featuring intriguing characters, creatures, and inventions. I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of creatures like the small blue-brained parasite thing, the imposing spider lady, and the eerie witches in red cloaks. While Zac apparently did everything, I think additional writers could have strengthened the overall narrative.Also a random thought, in the past, movies and series featuring AI or robots often portrayed them as inherently malevolent, leading to conflicts or wars. There was a prevailing assumption that any intelligent being other than humans would pose a threat. However, in recent films, there has been a shift towards showcasing the humanity within these AI entities, depicting their capacity for goodness or possessing a soul. One of the earliest movies to explore this perspective was Wall-e. Prior to that, many movies like the Terminator series portrayed AI and robots as antagonistic forces. Anyway I loved the robot, writing a paragraph about someone that only featured at the start and very end.Charlie Hunnam was great, Sofia boutella wasn't as bad ass as I thought she'd be when she wasn't in fighting scenes. Michiel Huisman looked like he could've been played by any other actor. Djimon Hounsou wasn't as good as I expected, felt like he was overcooking it in his intro. Ed Skrein felt very natural for the role, and I can't wait to see more of the robot. But I think the issues I had with the character was how they're written.The characters lacked depth, making it hard to form strong feelings of either liking or disliking them. Throughout most of the movie, many characters didn't have background stories, leaving us in the dark about what makes them 'them.' Then, in a rush at the end, their backgrounds are hurriedly revealed all in like 5min. Even for the few characters with backstories, it feels like a hasty summary, meeting them midway through their journey and abruptly asserting, ""You can trust me because I used to be or am this person."" This universe felt established, but lacking the sense of a franchise's promising beginnings.The first part of Rebel Moon could have significantly been better by dedicating more time to building up the characters and properly introducing them, instead of hastily summarizing their backgrounds in just 30 seconds or less. And me saying 30seconds is generous, because all one of them had was ""hey this is a prince of a planet"" and the story moves on. Like when were you gonna tell us?? It felt like when your spouse, in the middle of a random conversation, tells you 'oh by the way I mortgaged the house and the kids changed schools' then proceeds on with another conversation. Don't just gloss over that. Give us context. Also, the characters were recruited far too easily, as if the writers hurriedly pushed them to agree or trust others solely for the sake of advancing the plot without ample justification.A recent movie that's a good example of a ""part 1"" movie done well was dune. We got to like the characters and be in awe of this new foreign worlds, we got to really know them while still keeping intrigue and mystery on the part 2. But Zac Snyders movie felt like he kept too much a secret for too long, and you leave with all these thoughts of what's what, what's next and why something was the way it was but only because it feels like the movie is missing pieces.The story was a bit generic as far as rebel movies go, but the plot offered up a little switch with about 30 minutes to go but the climax ends pretty quickly. And Oh my god I was so hoping they didn't blow up the village at three end, for a split second I thought on the walk back to the village a ship would drop a missile.I didn't emotionally feel attached to the characters. Honestly if this didn't say ""part 1"" in its title I don't think they would green light another sequel. As something that's meant to start a franchise, it follows the same trope from many other sci-fi's that revolve around rebels, while lacking any spark or magic touch. I do hope that the sequel will be more inspired and creative story wise, with a more thrilling pace. I am glad that we don't have to wait too long, the ending showed that there's so much more history and lore that this universe has to offer.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Action Choreography is so good.5. Background scores is amazing, I really enjoyed it.Negatives :-1. Story is not interesting, and it's like mixture of star wars and justice league.2.

Truly. But where to begin with this abomination? Let's start with the story: it's a hackneyed good vs. Bad origin story laden with cringe worthy tropes. I regularly felt like I was watching a bargain bin mashup of the worst elements of Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy. The pacing of the story is also dismally narcoleptic. The film just trudged slowly forward and felt remarkably boring for what should have been a fun adventure.Then there's the characters. Or the lack thereof. They're trite, unrelatable, stereotypical and consistently at the mercy of a ghastly script that's regularly, unintentionally funny.The direction is no better, I'm afraid. The action sequences are clumsy and severely lacking in both panache and credibility. There are countless B-movie-like green screen shots that just didn't work out in creating the art style and atmosphere the Snyder achieved in 300. Then there's the use and abuse of tired old bullet-time moments that looked great in the Matrix 20+ years ago, but not anymore. And notably, considering it's a Zack Snyder film, I was surprised by how poor the photography was.The acting is, of course, subpar across the board. With this script, these people never had a shot, but they couldn't even live up to poor script expectations. Not a single one of them delivers a credible performance. There's an overarching feeling of everyone phoning it in throughout the film.Sadly, nothing came together in Rebel Moon. This is an absolute train wreck of a film, even below par for Netflix, which is quite the accomplishment.","46 out of 97 found this helpful.

The heavy use of slow motion feels uninspired and is more distracting than anything else.None of the actors performances are worth mentioning.

I started losing interest during several backstory monologues, but I kept watching. I turned it off several times to do other things. After three days, I successfully completed the film. Sofia Boutella's look and fighting style kept me interested. They didn't do much to humanize her, which would have helped people connect with her more. She was all tough all the time. I could appreciate her skills and bad assness, but I had trouble connecting to her backstory, because her character wasn't written with much depth or vulnerably.I can appreciate the scope of the project, and it was worth watching to see the special effects, some of the aliens, and well choreographed fight scenes. One scene with a giant spider mother was a cross between a Witcher monster and the Borg queen from Star Trek. If you like sword battles, one of the characters who is added to the team about mid way is pretty awesome to watch. There was an awesome flying sequence with a large bird creature that reminded me of flying with a dragon. I hope they bring the bird back for Part 2. I would have liked to have seen the giant bird more in Part 1.There were too many unoriginal elements to give this a strong recommendation. People familiar with the genre will recognize an alien saloon scene and bad guys dressed in WWII German uniforms. That being said, I will most likely tune in to Part 2 in April. The chemistry between actors, fighting skill levels, and some interesting aliens are enough to make me think I will tune in to see more.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Convincing onscreen action and plot requires attaining a level credibility (albeit increasingly combined with a certain amount of viewer incredulity), this is what drives audience investment in story, and I'm afraid in this department Rebel Moon, although it tries hard, misses the mark. Perhaps Part 2 if it gets made won't have this problem.Rebel Moon suffers from too much clichéd character and context building. Yet despite this we don't really know enough about the main character, nor her band of combatants - this is a problem, the story requires us to be rooting for them.The script and story telling needed a much lighter touch with more consistent pace and oomph, and more depth - the bones are there, but the flesh fell off them - which is a real shame, as I can imagine a version of this movie that is exciting and engaging.It's still reasonable holiday fare, not a complete right off, but if you were hoping for a new peak experience sci-fi movie, or indeed for top-shelf Zack Snyder, this aint it.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The film is a blatant rip-off of several classic films, such as Seven Samurai, The Magnificent Seven, The Hidden Fortress, and of course, the original Star Wars trilogy. The film lacks any creativity or innovation, and relies on clichés, tropes, and fan service to appeal to the audience. It is poorly written with a predictable plot, shallow characters, and cheesy dialogue. The film tries to be dark and gritty, but ends up being dull and boring.The film's only redeeming qualities are its visual effects, including some stunning landscapes, spaceships, and battles, which are enhanced by Snyder's signature slow-motion and stylized cinematography. However, these aspects are not enough to save the film from its many flaws and, ultimately, Rebel Moon is a forgettable and uninspired film that does not live up to its own potential.Would have been 1 star for being such a staggering disappointment, but extra stars awarded to all the crew for their hard work and skill, especially in light of being given such awful material to work with.","40 out of 84 found this helpful.

Neither script, actors, costumes, music, effects, NOTHING. Its like watching a car crash in slow motion. How bad can it really get? Speaking of slow-motion, the use in here is so over-used its ridiculous. The style and rythm is completely broken with the use of it. Worst Ive seen in 23.","28 out of 57 found this helpful.

Right now they are ghosts from their past, and they are starting a new journey now, so there is a lot of room for story and character growth.","25 out of 46 found this helpful.

This film is all set up for the second one where the action is featured. You should treat it like the first batch of episodes of some miniseries; very episodic and setting up for an epic second half. The pilot introduces the farmlands, then Kora and Gunnar have to assemble warriors one by one, then a mid-season finale for the climax. And as someone who's more a series person, I very much enjoyed it.It's got a nice setup with the traditional farmer community, and while the rest of the film as said feels episodic and doesn't feature much action, they manage to make it not boring and neither filled with worldbuilding distracting from the plot. I also found it interesting that Kora manipulates the last two warriors to join the fight; we see her motivate the general with revenge, right after hearing Nemesis preach against revenge as a driver, and then she talks to the Bloodaxe as if their trade with the village was detected by the Motherworld, rather than the truth.As a downside, there were some tropes I personally did not care for, though I can see others liking them/not being bothered by it. Think for instance the one 'good' young soldier who tries to stand up for Sam. Kora's backstory was revealed too early, too much at once and perhaps too elaborate and specific to begin with. For instance the shot with the child hands taking the gun out of the dead adult hands is really powerful, that's kind of enough for one flashback moment and the audience can fill the blanks or come back later to hear more. And lastly, the climax has these warriors going from helpless and outmanned to badass fighters in 1 scene. I didn't feel that fit the scene to be honest and would have preferred an escape in a followup scene. That doesn't change that this is an overall decent setup with a fair share of action preparing an actual action movie.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

All the characters in Rebel Moon are one note and boring. Some of them have cool names, balisarius, general Titus, revenge samurai lady, prince blah blah blah, but we don't get to know any of them beyond artificial dialogue given to each character. Each ""Rebel"" has a few minutes of screen time, haphazardly edited together.I read a critic review saying Zach Snyder made this movie to make a cool looking trailer, couldnt have said it better myself. Zach Snyder must be immune to criticism because he never learns from his mistakes. Sucker Punch, Rebel Moon, Batman vs Superman, Justice League, Army of the Dead all have the same issues. Poor stories, boring characters and empty spectacle. This is Rebel Moon in a nutshell. Another massive disappointment from Snyder and another big budget bore produced by Netflix.Don't even get my started on the eye rolling ending.

Of all the Sci-Fi films made, there's no way this one is in the bottom half. But that's what these rating suggest.Why should you watch it?1) Effects are up there, nothing worse than watching a film with substandard cinematography. 2) Most Sci fi films these days have terrible acting, this is definitely better than the Netflix norm. 3) There's no top rated Sci-Fi films out there at the moment, so this is as good as it gets. Then who cares about the story if there's a bit of adventure mixed in.I wouldn't watch it again, but I'm glad I've seen it and will look forward to part 2.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Even if not a world shattering blockbuster.Comparing to Seven Samurai, of which this is heavily based, the only significant problem and difference is that Rebel Moon run time isn't long enough to adequately show the recruitment of its protagonists. (Just imagine cutting Seven Samurai down by an hour...)The movie would have been better if it were long enough to fill out the character development in the middle act. But you can easily look past this and follow the story without difficulty.---I don't understand the comparisons with Star Wars.This has almost no connectable references with Star Wars whatsoever.This feels like it actually is in the Warhammer 40k universe.That Snyder actually had the audacity to pitch this for Star Wars is probably the biggest farse this movie brings. And thankfully, that never happened.Snyder has never been good at making movies, so I really do think that the actual qualities in this movie have nothing to do with his abilities, and are a fluke.The actual world as built in the movie is fun.This movie is reminiscent of much older writing styles in simplicity and linearity. It is a casual action flick that delivers on action, and is effective at bringing a new spin on the Seven Samurai framework. Even if a little rushed.This would be better rated had the character development been more fully realized, they're an interesting group of protagonists, and the acting is on point. The antagonists are excellent however, and the story between the main protagonist ""Sofia Boutella"" is very good. Boutella's performance holds a lot together that otherwise would have been lacking.A second part will hopefully bring us to a conclusion that ties and holds it all together more fully. If done right, a second half could make this an excellent duology. There is enough in the framing that this movie has brought to make that possible.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

We all knew this would be largely a computer generated movie, but the CGI is atrocious and embarrassing. Layers of digital imagery that don't even remotely appear realistic. The action sequences are trash as well; still using bullet time and stop motion mechanics from 25 years ago. Each semblance of an action scene has a pause to hone in on the digitally created or altered sequence making it more ridiculous than it would have been had Zach never slowed the shot down. Characters are standing in the middle of rapid machine laser fire and not even taking a single hit. People are overly melodramatic for no reason. There is a guy wearing more bronzer than an entire tanning salon owns, and Zach chose to have the bad guys resemble Dutch Neo Nazis. Nothing about this is really inspiring at all, nothing is redeeming at all either.

The first 20 minutes are very good, but the movie gets lost in a mega-boring second act full of pseudo-world building.For a story that needs to introduce about 10 central characters, it spends almost no time developing them. Djimon Hounsou, who is an excellent actor, speaks 2 or 3 sentences in the whole movie and appears in a handful of scenes... the rest doesn't do much either.Is it well directed/shot? I'd say so. But it feels more like a music clip than a movie. I'm not talking about the slow motion, Snyder is a pro at that. But many scenes are so artificial that you feel the actors aren't fully immersed in the narrative. Charlie Hunnam, for example, is very cartoonish here (in a strange way).I don't understand why Zack Snyder keeps releasing bad/mediocre movies even though he has complete creative control and astronomical budgets.Heck, this guy made Watchman and 300, which are really great and recent cult movies. His Director's Cut of Justice League got me excited for this one, but unfortunately I'm going to have to wait for another Director's Cut to find out if this movie can be any good or if it's just another average movie like Hollywood likes to release these days.I'm afraid Zack Snyder is turning into Michael Bay...","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Everything feels lived-in, characters occupy a life - they're not a character card in a 90's fighting game. What makes Dune great as a movie and a book is a sense of scale and scope, with vivid characters and bizarre McGuffins.Rebel Moon has none of that, instead opting for exposition dumps and cliches in the service of a setpiece here or a melodramatic dialogue there. It feels like back-to-back cutscenes in a videogame where the plot wasn't the point, but without the videogame that held them together, which might have been where the world building was. It is lifeless, empty, and devoid of any joy or wonder that is so crucial to get right.From a plot standpoint, the script never rings true - the main drive for the bad guys in this specific scenario is taking grain from farmers, yet repeatedly we are told and shown how they destroy whole planets without so much as stealing a sandwich. Our heroes fly around in a ship eveyrwhere, except for when it would be cooler for them to ride space horses through a field of wheat, so they're on horses now for some reason. The bad guys intend to execute the good guys in a very specific way but refuse to shoot them when all hell breaks loose and a gun fight ensues right over some of our captured heroes. A gunner on a massive space ship is also its pilot (??) and the cockpit of this gigantic space faring vessel is made of regular glass so thin you can smash through it with a stick (???). Some dude is holding a hero as a slave, and when the heroes show up to free him the dude just sets his own slave against some Train Your Dragon lookin CG cretin as a wager, for no good reason just so that a wonky CG fight scene can happen.It is SO underwritten, it makes Sucker Punch look well thought out. The characters are so flat you can't help but remember - this was made by the man who doesn't understand what motivates Superman or Batman, some of the most ubiquitously beloved & relatable characters of their genre. This thing screams ""Snyder Script"" because it is a failure to understand motivation, arcs and what keeps viewers interested.And visually? It's just slowmo after slowmo, blatant green-screens and bad CG, and an abundance of close-ups leaves very little visual world-building, except for when a scene is set up. I am uncertain what eye-candy people refer to, it is all completely flat and derivative, dour and smudged and often too dark to enjoy like every other terrible Snyder film.Nothing works. Not a single thing.There is an upside though - it is so needlessly edgy, so cringe, so pathetic in how self-important and smug and stupid and flat it is, that while we set out in the hopes of watching an enjoyable film we loved hate-watching it. So if you enjoy to dunk on terrible, ugly, stupid movies for a couple of hours - boy are you in for a treat, because this has a chance at becoming a trash hate-watch classic.","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

Snyder didn't get a chance to direct his own chapter of a Star Wars movie. Disney didn't want to give him the change so Snyder did what he does best - went to another side and directed his own version according to Lucas' vision.It has (almost) no light sabers, but the protagonist and antagonist are almost the same, you've got your fair share of struggles in a depressed world, post traumatized ruling of a king, which was fair and kind. On the bright side, the story is very simple and got no politics and boring sequences in it - on the down side, it is one of the most recycled ideas you've seen in cinema - and you won't have the chance to see it on the big screen, because is streamed into Netflix almost right away.It has Snyder's iconic and unstoppable or uncontrolled slow-MO's scenes, it has a lot of pathos in it, mainly from the main protagonist character that is played in an exaggerated way for almost most of her part. She is a mediocre actress and not build to lead this scale of a movie. Wherever Djimon Hounsou is participating, you know that it is going to be not that good. You can say it also on most of Charlie Hunnam's movies and to say the truth also on last years performences of Cary Elwes and even Anthony Hopkins. It has a lot of small-scale stars that get small and unrememberable performances, but there is one you will not be able to forget and it is the new baddy of Hollywood - Ed Skrein performance is marvelous.The concept is familiar, the visual side is very rich and colorful, the script is a minor-minor part of the movie and the aspiration is high, very high even... Snyder shoots to capture a new fan base audience for his market and Netflix is the correct platform for it. Not sure his followers will follow, but when you don't have anything else to see and you don't want an actual mini-Series: make your own from Snyder's movie.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The biggest letdown was the dialogue. It felt like someone skimmed a thesaurus of generic action movie phrases and strung them together with minimal effort. Imagine a ten-year-old tasked with writing a cool movie script - that's the vibe I got.Then there's the runtime. Two hours should be enough to tell a compelling story, but Rebel Moon felt stretched thin. Large chunks of the film were filler, dragging the pace and leaving me checking my watch. It felt like they were desperately trying to justify the hefty budget.Now, let's talk about the action. It was, in a word, atrocious. The choreography was clunky and lacked any real impact. The lead actress, bless her heart, clearly wasn't comfortable with the fight sequences. The solution? Slow-motion everything! Every punch, every kick, every dodge was stretched and distorted, turning potentially exciting moments into snooze-fests. It felt like a desperate attempt to mask the lack of skill and choreography.John Wick, for example, sets the gold standard for action films. Keanu Reeves' dedication to mastering fight choreography shines through in every scene. There's a rawness and intensity to the action that Rebel Moon simply couldn't capture. Here, it felt like they were relying on slow-motion to create a sense of coolness that just wasn't there.The film also stumbled with its attempts at character development. We're supposed to believe that a few generic motivational lines can completely change someone's life path and inspire them to join a rebellion. It felt unearned and lazy. Where was the emotional depth? Where were the moments that made us truly care about these characters and their fight?Rebel Moon had the potential to be an epic sci-fi adventure. It had a decent premise, some cool visuals, and a talented cast (who deserved better material). But in the end, it was a shallow spectacle with forgettable characters, nonsensical dialogue, and action sequences that felt more like parodies than genuine thrills.If you're looking for a sci-fi film that delivers on all fronts, you'll want to steer clear of Rebel Moon.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

So was it good, it was because there was no 'forced messaging' was it bad, no, there are far worse crap out there (I am looking at you sequal trillogy) The biggest problem is, there was ZERO originality in any thing in this show. You can CLEARLY see all the Star Wars characters and zero effort was made to divulge the plot lines, they just changed the names and costumes. The plot is stolen right out of Bugs Life/7 Samuri/Magnificent 7 etc. The problem is, they would have to be all superhuman to pull this off. It would be like if Obiwon and Anakin singlehandedly took down the Seperatists.Now lets talk about the costumes. They were horrible and took me out of the immersion. It felt more like I was watching a documentary on the British occupation of Ireland than a science fiction. The native clothing was too familiar even Firefly managed to do better on a limited budget and they are actual humans whose history is closer to ours than in Rebel Moon. However far in the future this is from humanity (or a long long time ago) they dressed like 19th century Irish. The imperial uniforms were better but also very reminiscent of 20th century Huns.I don't mind the buildings and structures looking familiar because let's be honest, a good design is a good design anywhere you live. The only difference is style, and they probably should have put some effort into making the buildings 'style' more alien and less Viking settlement.Again it wasn't horrible but I predicted virtually everything that happened, there were no surprises (AT ALL) so it was like playing a game when you know all the answers or playing a video game on Godmode. It was just boring.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It was a slow-motion shot from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice of a flood survivor reaching her hand desperately to Superman, cape billowing in the sky.Initially, I thought, is it unnecessary to hold a visual for that long? Wouldn't it be more economical to have a montage of Superman saving people from the flood instead, like how Christopher Nolan might do in his more left-brained approach?Then, it hit me that Zack Snyder's artistic intention is akin to a still painting, or a comic book splash page, and the audience is meant to bask in the prolonged moment and imagine the story behind the image, filling in what happened before and after.I've since accepted Zack Snyder's visual storytelling style and his alternative way of thinking, even its flaws, and have retroactively enjoyed his films on a whole new level. Zack Snyder's Justice League is his best work to date.Snyder's latest film released on Netflix, Rebel Moon, is an uninspired space adventure that indulges in long stretches of world-building and showcases its characters like a collection of action figures, before getting the audience to care about them.Rebel Moon, pitched as ""Seven Samurai set in the Star Wars universe'"", originated as a story treatment Zack Snyder wrote in film school and was unsuccessfully pitched to Lucasfilm as a Star Wars movie. Following up on his partnership with Netflix after 2021's Army of the Dead, the story pitch has been reworked and released as an epic two-parter.The film's biggest sin lies in its unoriginality. The script does little to repackage or find alternative original moments of its own. It feels like stepping into Zack Snyder's subconscious and seeing everything he's a fan of all clumped together.Its cinematic influences are so blatant that film fans will immediately spot which movies the script is pulling from. There are droids, lightsabers, the Mos Eisley Cantina, its own version of Han Solo, and a familiar sequence from the first Avatar.As the screenwriter, Zack Snyder also has a perplexing understanding of ""show, don't tell"". He can compose fantastic breathtaking visuals but still chooses to give exposition through words in the most boring way possible.Shockingly, every character is introduced exactly the same. As the two farmers set off to recruit its ensemble of warriors across the galaxy, the routine quickly becomes repetitive.Enter character. The character displays fighting ability and their backstory is verbally told. The character says yes. The recruiters move to recruit the next warrior on another planet. Repeat.Snyder's trademark slow-motion shots didn't work as there was no emotional attachment to any of these characters or any substance behind the story for the audience to truly bask in. And at times, I was eagerly waiting for the next shot.Rebel Moon re-highlights the lesson of Sucker Punch: Zack Snyder works better when he's working with a screenwriter, namely to do the plotting and keep him from his worst tendencies.Ironically, or unironically depending on how you look at it, the film plays out exactly like what it sounds like on paper: Star Wars fan fiction. It truly can be enjoyed as the more mature and violent version of Star Wars.That's how I ended up enjoying Rebel Moon. It's gotten up to 63 million views on Netflix within ten days of its release, so I cannot be alone. Certainly, there must be lots of people enjoying it in this way as well.George Lucas' idea behind manufacturing toys was to allow fans to tell their own stories in the Star Wars universe. Admittedly, I wrote Star Wars fan fiction as a 12-year-old in a Creative Writing class, which were John Woo movies set in the Star Wars universe.Rebel Moon would have certainly satisfied my 12-year-old self. Donna Bae, Snyder's version of a Jedi, wielding dual red laser swords battling Jenna Malone as a villainous arachnid cybernetic alien is truly metal.All that said, can I say Rebel Moon is great and everybody should see it? No.Did I enjoy it? Yes, I found enough pieces to enjoy it for what it was, though I still cannot defend it.Will I watch Part 2? Yes, but only as more Star Wars fan fiction.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Cinematically, the scenes of the different planets were varied and intriguing. Sofia Boutella was the perfect choice for the lead role... she possesses such confidence, beauty, mysteriousness, femininity, and strength all at the same time. I am not quite sure how Zack got all of these qualities in one actor... but Sofia hit them on the nail all at the same time.Again, I respect everyone else's view...

I always make an effort to avoid anything I plan to review (as best I can in this age of social media shenanigans), but Zack Snyder has this strange ability to whip online pundits into a frenzy. So, my timelines across the board flooded with unwavering loyalty and gleeful hate, leaving me frankly terrified to step into Netflix's new space opera epic.That's not what angers me, though. No, what angers me is, as much as A Child of Fire gets right, it's a smorgasbord of plots done better...and I still had a damn good time.Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire is a frustrating experience that hasn't met a sci-fi or fantasy story it doesn't like. It's worn, overly reliant on tropes, and far too indulgent in layering slow-motion scenes on top of slow-motion scenes...
...and I still absolutely loved it. Visually stunning and satisfyingly punchy, Part One of Snyder's new franchise is a fun watch and potentially potent foundation that just might reach the cult status it so desperately wants to skip to.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The storytelling feels lackluster, like a tale narrated without passion, leaving the overall experience somewhat dull.

However, within these drawbacks, I glimpse a potential for greatness, indicating that with thoughtful adjustments, Rebel Moon could ascend to the epic heights it initially promised. Strengthening character connections and refining the plot might just transform this cinematic venture into the captivating journey it has the potential to be, at least from my perspective.""","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Rebel Moon brings nothing narratively fresh to this archetype. It's the classically engineered, emotionally manipulative core designed to easily hook viewers rather than challenge or subvert their expectations.Our protagonist heroine follows all the tropes of gathering a ragtag group of resistance fighters we know will obviously band with her based on overly convenient writing. Oh she's searching for specific skilled allies across the galaxy? What fortune they all happen to reside within quick succession in plot-necessitated locales!The story arcs and character purpose feels pre-ordained to serve shoehorned themes of unity and overcoming rather than developing meaningful stakes or reveals that shock or intrigue.Sure, Rebel Moon checks off the fantasy action adventure boxes, but with hardly any innovation or directorial panache that made Snyder's best works iconic. Unless craving a processed, binge-able intergalactic quest, I'd recommend numerous deeper genre films instead of this been-there-seen-that freshman storyline without heart. Snyder has lost his rebel spirit churning uninspired content now backed by Hollywood casino financing.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Charming space pirate is he a good guy or a bad guy? Robot with a soul. Fantastic space beasts. Big CGI battle at the end. Dune like power squabble and race of master soldiers. There's even a character with mythical abilities weilding what might as well be light sabers. The only thing thinner than the plot and character development appears to be the CGI budget.

Since this movie stands on its own, it's allowed to do such things, and I think in the end it was appreciated. Yes the action is mostly slow and boring and done before. The movie is entirely too long for how much time it spent on said slow action scenes, yet still rewatchable. The dialogue and story were all over the place, choppy and a flat out mess. The characters are mostly unlikable, but still enjoyable to watch. You're actively exploring them as people and in some cases watching them explore themselves.I'm glad this was made. If I have to watch another franchise movie other than Dune, I'll scream. We don't need more marvel movies or more Star Wars movies, we need movies that take from those, fix their flaws and make them better. This movie is a start.

Borrowing whole hog from Akira Kurasawa's Seven Samurai, Snyder has fashioned a tale of a lost scion, played by Sofia Boutella, from a militaristic empire now found on a homey back world toiling away as a farmer's assistant but when Imperial forces find them to replenish their food piles (which they'll do by force), Boutella comes to the rescue of an endangered maiden killing off all the stationed troops. Gathering the village elders together, Boutella formulates a plan to gather warriors to fight the good fight when the shock troops return sending the narrative into familiar (wildly familiar!) territory as Boutella corrals her soldiers to fight on different worlds w/a shady trader, Charlie Hunnam, as her guide & one of her cohorts from the farm planet, Michiel Huisman (who carries an obvious torch for her), tagging along. If you know Kurasawa's magna opus (which I do) or even John Sturges American remake from 1960 or even the Denzel Washington retread he made w/Antonie Fuqua a few years ago then you know where this story is going w/an ending leaving it wide open (in Kurasawa version's this is where the intermission title card comes in) for a follow-up (which is expected in April) but where am I in the critical state of things w/Snyder's take. It was fine for what it was & for those who are of the initiated w/the previous iterations may find it epic, new & enthralling but applying the template w/a sci-fi flavor (hell this was done by Roger Corman w/his Battle Beyond the Stars in 1980) & claiming this is something novel is one thing when a simple remark of taking Kurasawa's fable & giving it a try would've been enough but unfortunately in the press Snyder has gone w/the former explanation which has made him a punching bag for critics unless it's a sly ploy. Who knows but if you want to have a passable time killer running in the background at home, saddled w/o new Star Wars product on any radar, this'll do.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Though there are a lot of plot holes, one could pick out more, even in the Star Wars trilogy. Also needs to be considered that Disney refused Jack Snyder's offer of making the film in the Star Wars universe.So he went ahead in creating his own universe that is dark and senseless. There are a lot of questions and lot many are left unanswered. Yet it's universe that's worth visiting just to forget the universe we live in.Yes, the film takes you on a cinematic ride. A ride on a grand canvas though arguably riddled with holes. But which you might miss if you just let go of yourself and enjoy the spectacle unfolding in front of your eyes.One thing you won't regret is the action, especially the breathtaking fight sequence executed by Kora, as she saves Sam.The creatures in the movie seem a bit outlandish and a product of imagination gone wild. Yet they do give the viewer some vibes of the the old Star War movies.There are a lot of similarities with Star Wars. Like the character of clueless Gunner which looks similar to the one played by Harrison Ford. Character Kora feels deceptively similar to Jedi, of course without the force. And not forgetting rag tag band of rebels.It's a fast paced movie with a lot of characters thrown in, with little time for character development. May be we might see more in the the next movie.Watch it, enjoy it, who knows there might be a beautiful journey ahead waiting in the sequels. And even if not, it's worth watching as a stand-alone movie.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The main actor should not be leading a film, she's not good enough to carry any scenes. The most disappointing part of the movie to me though was the action. I expected non stop well choreographed action and instead got some of the worst fight scenes that I can remember.

So it's a mix of star wars and suicide squad. It's true that the green screen is not as high quality as the Mandalorian, clearly there is no comparison, but still... The alien creatures who show are really well done and ships and the battles are really oky. I must say there was plot twist that left me... say whaaaat. So i definitely did not get bored and i can't wait to see the second part. Basically in the first part you get to know the characters, a little bit of their stories and you have a background of the story. My boyfriend mentioned they tend to overdo it with the slow motion for dramatic effect but i wasn't bothered by it. The main character really does a good job in portraying her story and reason to fight. Definitely deserves more than 5 this movie. Don't compare it with star wars or other classicals, just take it as it is, a sci fi fantasy rebellion maybe in a universe parallel from star wars.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

Kudos to the concept art team.Now the bad: the story was straight up boring and full of cliches, the characters were cookie cutter and lacked any development - i really feel bad for the cast of great actors that had nothing to work with - it says something when the most interesting character is Jimmy the robot that appeared in 3% of the movie. The whole story is disjointed and feels like it was written with chat gpt.The lenses choice had me raising eyebrows, i get the reason was to get an unique look but unique doesn't equal good looking and combined with the high contrast look the out of focus background was a distracting mess most of the time.The overuse of slow motion was another thing that greatly ruined the action scenes, just why? Feels like an overenthusiastic kid was allowed to play with special effects when editing.I wonder if Snyder is proud of this movie.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

The film's biggest problem is that it doesn't spend enough time with each of its characters which robs the climax of the weight and spectacle it was trying for. Fortunately, that problem is very likely to be fixed in the three hour R-rated cut of the film expected to be released in summer of 2024. I can understand wanting two cuts of the movie, but I do not understand the decision to release the inferior version first.With that said, this movie is visually awesome, the characters that we get sufficient time with are great, and the world we are shown is fascinating and intriguing enough to make you want to see more. It's a Zack Snyder Star Wars movie, for better and for worse. In my opinion, it's still better Star Wars than 90% of what Disney has been giving us. Don't listen to critics and haters, watch the movie and decide for yourself because I found myself having a very good time with this one even despite its issues.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

There is not a single character that this movie managed to get me to care about, everyone was so cliche, every storyline, every dialogue, every trope has been done before. Sometimes media manages to depend on this formula so that it generated some guaranteed revenue, but it just feels like there's no emotion, originality or creativity to be found in this. It just felt like a mash-up of famous media, like a movie I've watched before a million times.There are so many things you can do with the sci-fi genre, so much space to create any time of story you want, you are working with a literal blank canvas if you so choose to. So it baffles me why you would just make a star wars imitation without any of the things that make star wars actually watchable.I only gave this four stars cause the actors and the visual effects teams deserve better than this, ever tho all the performances felt dry, I choose to attribute it to the script this time around, as it was clearly lacking in every other aspect as well.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Snyder has gone on record stating that his agreement with Netflix involved making PG-13 movies AND unfiltered/rated R versions of said movies. The results stemming from this decision are noticeable.Although the diverse group of characters have intriguing backstories, the film doesn't have enough time to fully delve into the formation of the team. You just have to accept these are tough people fighting together because they hate the antagonists for one reason or another.The action is surprisingly tame while simultaneously pushing the boundaries of the PG-13 rating. It's easy to imagine more intense firefights and gory brawls had there not been a ""leash"" on the filmmakers' vision.Naturally there are a lot of exposition dumps to explain the lore of this new sci-fi world. There's a lot more telling than there was showing when it comes to narrative but all the performances somewhat alleviate this shortcoming. The spectacular visuals and stylized action also makes up for it to a certain extent.Rebel Moon is an enjoyable film with a fair amount of shortcomings. This sci-fi universe is fascinating and has a lot of potential for growth. If you're a fan of Zack Snyder's work or sci-fi in general I'd recommend at least checking it out but I think the better version of this film is unfortunately yet to be released.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Kora rallies warriors from other planets and starts her own revolution in this space opera co-written, directed and produced by Zack Snyder.Zack Snyder has openly stated this franchise will be his version of ""Star Wars"" and I believe it does have potential for growth as there are ambitious creative decisions behind the screenplay such as the world-building and the established lore which I would have loved to see fleshed out.

The CGI and VFX are top-notch for a Netflix production as we are exposed to various new planets, with insight on the intricate character designs of the creatures that populate them. But this universe rings hollow due to all of the characters being under-developed and their motivations feeling contrived. This is why it does not seem like an organic transition when the rebels form a camaraderie. Their chemistry is nonexistent. Not to mention, many of the cast members deliver wooden performances which only concludes that the direction was not as sharp. The redeeming qualities lie in the cinematography which can be visually enchanting in certain scenes and the action sequences that are minimal yet remain engrossing including the slow-motion shots.One can hope that the issues mentioned will be
improved upon in the sequel. Slated to release next year. But I will be keeping my expectations at a minimum.IG: thecinephilereviews.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The most glaring issue lies in its storytelling, which feels amateurish and lacks the depth and nuance necessary to truly captivate.Equally problematic is the shot sequencing and editing. It's evident that the team behind these aspects had a limited understanding of the craft. Instead of bringing a fresh perspective or innovative approach, the film resorts to standard tropes. However, these tropes are employed without a clear understanding of their underlying mechanics behind what works and what doesn't, leading to see the team behind the film as newcomers and out of place for a production of this scale.On a positive note, the CGI work in ""Rebel Moon"" is commendable. The visual effects are one of the few aspects where the film manages to meet expectations, providing some respite in an otherwise underwhelming production.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

A problem with the story was that they borrowed a bit much from other Sci fi movies. Not enough to be destructive for this movie, but Sci fi fans will recognize the borrowed pieces. There were some good actors who could have done more with an overall stronger story, but the acting was ok enough to keep me engaged.

Again, some were and some missed the mark completely. It's as if the effects were done two completely different ways so it half worked. Was the storyline unique, solid and/or told well? I split that down the middle as well. The storyline itself reminded me of several other movies that were done better such as The Magnificent Seven (old & newer versions), Star Wars, and another that slips my mind right now. So it wasn't unique. I also got the feeling that some of the story got left on the editing room floor because there were a few ""huh?"" moments. Was it predictable? Parts were; some were not. So that left me with a rating near the middle. I gave it a 6 because at the end, I did want to see where part 2 will go.

"4","/10","IMHO: It feels uninspired.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9514687/?ref_=tt_urv","pzuidema","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39853436/?ref_=tt_urv","24 December 2023","I am not a filmmaker, so before I write this review, I will explain this is purely my own opinion. I am not in any way a fan of Mr. Snyder's work. I do have my favorites; I still like Man of Steel. 300 was a visual masterpiece at that time. The stories themselves, to me, are lacking.But I was interested in watching Rebel Moon. The promise that it was Mr. Snyder's vision of what he could do in a Star Wars-esque setting sounded intriguing.I read in many reviews, also from critics whose opinions I value, that the movie borrowed a lot from movies like Star Wars. I don't think that is a bad thing. It is not that SW has to sole proprietary on an epic space opera. Put Ben Hurr, Spartacus, and Gladiator next to each other. Good movies are allowed to have their work to be the inspiration of other work.My issue with Rebel Moon is that it feels uninspired. I certainly believe that Mr. Snyder has been brooding on the story and world-building for decades. And that is what I miss. It doesn't show.It doesn't feel like this has been the passion project from someone who wanted to tell an epic story because - to be fair - this is a very basic story that lacks the grandiose. It feels more like this story was told through concept art, and it never got a chance to be told in words.Visually, it is ""not bad"". You could even call it great at moments. But it feels 'upscaled'. Watching it on 4K, I never felt I got a sharp image. It felt too blurry. But still, it has good visual moments. Some smart design choices here and there. But it still feels like I have been reading through the book 'The Art Of Rebel Moon. ' Which, I suppose, might be really good.But here is where I think a lot of filmmakers think that it is easy to create a world and a story like Star Wars. To be fair, it, too, is not a deep story. But what it had was excellent characters who you cared for. Building upon great characters was a pretty thin story, but it didn't matter; you wanted to spend time with your 'friends' to have a good time.Rebel Moon lacks this connection. The back stories of the characters feel flimsy, and there is no real connection to the viewer. There is no one you can identify yourself to. This makes you a spectator who is not influenced by what you see on the screen.It doesn't help that the dialogue is mediocre. There are no great, passionate conversations. No expression of emotion that is heartfelt. The pace of the conversations is edited to make it feel like every character is waiting for the other one to finish their sentence properly.Where most people and critics claim the film to be a copy of Star Wars, I actually think it is not that bad, even if they do sometimes refer to the 'bad power' as 'the empire.' Not smart. I actually see much more of a direct link to the game Mass Effect 2. The story is very similar: Outer world human colonies are threatened by a massive power, and you, as the protagonist, are being told to build up a team of misfits across the galaxy to stand a chance against the impending danger.As I referred to earlier, the difference is that in Mass Effect 2, the characters are so well-written and likable that the same flimsy story is just the glue to get you to unique places and situations.I did finish the movie simply because I wanted to see it through to the end and write a review while watching it in its entirety. Besides all the other things I described here, the only thing I really disliked was the slow motions. This is hugely understated in other reviews. This might have worked in Mr. Snyder's earlier movies when this was still a novel idea. But we have seen good action scenes before, and there often was no reason to pay attention to this. Other reviewers have described it as, and I agree, the action being paused. It takes away any feeling of urgency and totally takes you out of the pace of the combat. If all the slow-motion had been taken out of the movie, we would have been given 15 minutes back - and I honestly think I am not kidding.My word of advice to Mr. Snyder is (but who am I to claim he should listen to me): If you are given $115m to bring your movie to life, do research. Don't squander that money with the idea that you know best. If you think you have a great story, get the best writers to take your good story and make it amazing. When you are the director, listen to feedback from your editors and directors of photography, and use all their skills to make a good movie. It feels like the story was amazing in your head, but it did not translate like that to the viewers.I hope that part two will redeem itself in April 2024, but at this moment, it will feel like a chore to review it. And that is different from how you want people to start watching your movie.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Essentially a Star Wars movie pitch he made that he then repurposed into its own saga, this movie, like the original Star Wars, mashes together numerous genres, influences and imaginative ideas around some stunning action scenes and a solid soundtrack. A young woman living a simple farmer's life on a nowhere important world is caught up in a galactic war when the empire enslaves her village, forcing her to seek allies to protect it. Essentially Star Wars meets the Magnificent Seven.Sadly, this film lacks the charm, earnest performances and basic ""wow"" that propelled not only Star Wars but most of Snyder's previous movies to greatness. There's nothing obviously wrong with what anyone's doing, and the set pieces, action scenes and cinematography are all technically excellent, but it doesn't all come together to get you invested in the characters or their story. The main characters are more C list than the supporting characters like Djimon Hounsou and Charlie Hunan and seem to be going through the motions, while Sir Anthony Hopkins is wasted briefly voicing a droid with performance issues. He may have thought he was playing a Transformer after appearing in one of those movies. The assembled heroes are given little development and have little chemistry in the brief time they are all together, while the story doesn't unite the influences it taps. And the villain is no Darth Vader. It's clear that pieces are being assembled for the sequel due to arrive next year so it doesn't stand on its own as a complete story like the first part of most trilogies do. If the conclusion answers some of these issues then this first chapter's impression may be revised higher but for now It's like the poor Star Wars sequels for adults, of which George Lucas said ""They're well-made (but) There's nothing new.""Snyder's landmark films were all adaptations of seminal comic book tales (300, Watchmen) or screenplays written by noted writers like David Goyer (who wrote the Nolan Dark Knigjt trilogy) and Chris Terrio (Oscar winning Argo). This one however was written by Snyder as was his previous low scoring movie Sucker Punch. It seems that the magic formula is for Snyder to continue to add his signature polish to someone else's script and bring their characters to life. Which is all the more reason for Netflix to buy the rights to finish the Justice League saga from bankrupt Warner Bros and get the squad back together.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Undoubtedly, he is a master of visual design and creating intense action scenes, and also skillfully conveys emotional depth. However, I liked only two of his projects: the epic story ""300 Spartans"" (2006) about the battle of Thermopylae and the dark and gloomy film ""Guardians"" (2009).The director invariably follows his style, and we never cease to rejoice in a pleasant composition with a bright palette, interesting characters and colorful conflicts. However, sometimes his visual solutions are just annoying and tiring to the eye.Formally, the film aims to become an action adventure with elements of a space western and the Japanese cinematographic style of ""tumbara"" in a fantastic medieval neo-futurist entourage of a space opera.In general, this is a pleasant entertaining movie, in which there are many exaggerations and exaggerated emotions. From a visual point of view, it is not inferior to ""Star Wars"", and in the semantic aspect, perhaps even surpasses them. However, for me it is just a beautiful cosmic fairy tale with bright and strong female characters. The women in this series get a huge space to reveal their strength and fill them with muscular images. It seems to me that this is the highest point of matriarchal visual perfection, which can only be compared with the dazzling beauty of women. This is something like the Trinity visual syndrome, which makes you fall in love with the bright dreams of a Crocus immersed in sadness.Among the male characters, three roles can be distinguished - Ed Skrein, Charlie Hunnam and the Irishman Fra Fee. The rest of the male roles are a dim shadow in this starburst of ""Snyder's vision.""I must admit, I hardly watched this movie. Perhaps it is aimed at a teenage audience, and throughout the entire viewing I watched it embarrassingly, but with respect for the master. However, it's not for nothing that the finale of the picture turned out to be the most interesting and fascinating, it deftly holds attention and arouses curiosity. This is a very skillful, addictive ending.The plot of the film is too fabulous, and some scenes are greatly exaggerated. The acrobatics of the main character leaves much to be desired, but we must pay tribute to Zack Snyder - as always, it looks beautiful!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Like Lucas before him, Snyder borrows ideas and imagery from the classics of his day, from the magnificent seven to Excalibur and of course, Star Wars, but all done in his own signature bombastic style.The visuals and action scenes are as usual immaculate, and the universe Zack has created looks amazing, with a price tag of 80 million it still manages to look better than movies with three times the budget.The big flaw is that you can tell the movie was cut down for a shorter run time. The hour or so cut content would explore the characters more deeply and elaborate on their stories.Still, the story that did survive is great and serves to whet your appetite and pique your interest.

I know that it is extremely difficult and takes a lot of imagination to create a world and bring it to fruition in any sort of medium.With that being said, this was simply a bad movie. The characters were bland and underdeveloped, the plot was paper-thin, and the movie was heavily-reliant upon many slow motion action sequences. There were many times at this movie that I laughed out loud at the absurdity of some of the slow-motion shots.I think we need to take a step back and ask why Zack Snyder has been continually given all of these large budgets to make his ""visions"", which all turn out to be versions of CGI-reliant, slow-motion plotless ""epics"". When 300 came out and that technology was someone new everyone loved it, but here we are almost 20 years later and he is still playing his ""greatest hit"" to the tune of a $90 million budget.","17 out of 33 found this helpful.

Acting is probably a 2/10 and Zack Snyder's use of blurry visuals throughout scenes and the screen edges is a 1/10 (just like in The Army of the Dead, although RM was a tiny bit better.) As far as the story is concerned, it's a simple one, not confusing at all.....a few people from a village under siege go searching for fighters to help them....so easy 9/10 for the story....nothing complicated. The fight scenes are a 9/10. Those are done right! Yes, there are the typical Snyder slow motion scenes, but he didn't go too overboard this time around (he didn't pull a full Michael Bay if you know what I mean!) Some of the CGI was a little off, but not bad....7/10. I went into this movie with a low expectation given all the bad reviews and hate surrounding it, but honestly, it wasn't that bad of a movie. It was entertaining, not too much fluff between the action, and again, the action scenes were pretty good. I get that it's getting flake for being more of a stylish movie.....quantity over quality.....but it's still entertaining and the lead actress, although not the best actress, is very good in action movies. Is it worth a try....yes.... I say so. Maybe one and done, but worth a try.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Rebel Moon lacks this. Instead, we have an ensemble of shallowness, with interactions that either laboriously describe some aspect of the story, or that simply tick off a few stock character traits. We are left with mannequins, and it's a shame. Just the lightest smattering of heartfelt moments between some of the characters would have helped. For example, the protagonist saves a young woman from an unpleasant situation. Foreshadowing this by showing the two of them sharing a friendly moment would have helped lift what was otherwise a set-piece action scene. What we have is a souless rendering of tick box sci-fi, people, conflict, environment, but no characterisation.It's a shame. The special effects are great. The story as a whole is reminiscent of the Seven Samurai inspired Magnificent Seven, and offers a creative interpretation of it. It is well-made, and the universe is believable, in as far that Star Wars is believable.Its factory made sci-fi. If you crave laser pistols at high-noon, give it a go. If you are looking for fully conceived characters, try elsewhere.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Such a shame as if it wasn't for all the pointless matrix style effects I would have been able to get through this. I really did try to like and watch all of the film but I couldn't. I'm on my christmas holidays and shouting at the TV is not how I'm going to start it. Very nice looking film, the bonus is you'll get to appreciate it so much more as its in slow motion. Also a very strange blur affect is used around the edge of the screen on certain scenes, there is a robot sitting down talking to a girl, the legs are blurry and the edge of the shot but not the center of it.

Why is Netflix commissioning a producer to make a multi part movie that are multiple hours each, then completely changing the directors vision. They may as well hire a 10 year old to make the movie and edit it the way they want, rather than hiring a phenomenal director and butchering his work to oblivion.If Netflix thought they were making their own version of Dune, I cannot express enough, how they made the exact opposite of it in every single way shape and form.

This film suffers from a lack of character development and plot. For about 90 minutes, the film is just a series of scenes where the main characters travel from planet to planet, recruiting allies for their cause. These scenes are somewhat unnecessary and boring, and they don't advance the story or the characters. Such as the one with the flying creature. What was the purpose of that scene?Some scenes are also disturbing and offensive, like the one with the gay bar and the sexual assault or the grape scene. What was the purpose of these scenes? How did they contribute to the film?The main problem with this film is the lack of plot. It doesn't feel like a movie, but rather a collection of random events.

If that is the case, while this could have easily fit into that universe, I am glad it was spun off into its own thing, rather than being tethered to another property that comes along with too many expectations of what it should be. Also, I am not interested in seeing ""A New Hope"" recycled for the third (fourth?) time by the powers that be at Disney.The visuals are incredible, something that goes without saying for any Zack Snyder film. Not many directors can build visuals like this guys does. The story is strong and doesn't lag anywhere. The movie easily sets up what could be a broad new movie universe and does a great job of exploring themes of oppression, rebellion, the horrors of war and the reality of wartime economics.The actors are top notch, I could easily watch stand alone films with Ray Fisher, Charlie Hunnam and Ed Skrein's characters in them. If I've seen Sofia Boutella in anything else, I am not aware of it, but she was fantastic as well. The way most of these characters are portrayed, makes me want to see more of them, particularly Ray Fisher and his character.The only thing that I felt was lacking was some of the character development. I understand that it is difficult to introduce a new world full of these interesting characters to an audience within the span of 2 hours, but still, there are some fantastic characters that are introduced here, that we just don't get enough time with. Some motivations could have been fleshed out a bit more.I'm looking forward to the sequel, I enjoyed this one a lot.","27 out of 58 found this helpful.

Missing were those short meaningless moments that help build the story for each person.

Yet, if you want to know if you should put this on, my answer weirdly is yes. It's worth the watch for Sofia Boutella's performance, although ultimately the film itself is lacking. Now you know, let's dive in deeper.Rebel Moon is a mix of too many influences. Warhammer 40K springs to mind, as well as The Chronicles of Riddick for the fascist display of armies. There's some Greek mythology. Star Wars is heavily copied. And Alien is a reference for its grittiness in technology, which does work well. There is a bit of 'Avengers Assemble' to it, which is cool actually. And there are Zoë Saldana's action performances as an influence, of which Sofia Boutella shows us a new, slightly rougher version that is very, very likeable. She is hands down best part of the film.And that's saying something, because the writers made it incredibly hard for her and all the other actors. The script is on the nose and Sofia's character Kora is used as an instrument for heavy exposition, which is a waste of talent and quite baffling really for a production of this magnitude. Instead of us experiencing the story, it's basically explained to us.The weird thing is, the moment everybody shuts up and the action starts, the film is quite good. In some moments, it even nails the feel of the combat with fantastic shots, moves and sound design.What comes out is too much noise and too little signal. Like many of Snyder's films, the plot is predictable, the dialogue more like boring monologues. It would be nice if he would realize an audience can handle a little bit more intelligence. With 160 million bucks... we love your camera Zack, but please hire an extra writer man.All in all, we are left with a mix bag of extremes. The writing is bad. Yet the action is pretty good. And the cast - including big names Hopkins, Hunnam, Huonsou and plenty of upcoming talent like Huisman, Skrein and awesome Bae Doona - do really manage to shave off the worst thankfully.So, I can't say the film is a pass. But I did find it an interesting watch. Here's me hoping they all get better lines in part two.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

and character development.Finally the movin took its shape at 90 minutes past, when most of decent to masterpiece do that in 15 minutes because otherwise audience would go comlete boredom, which this movie went.There is nothing new. That is ok for me if the character, visual, pace, lines, or battle is interesting enough. This one lacks all of them.And from Part 2 trailer showed me exact rip off of the seven samurai. How original!I don't know which one is worse, Army of the Dead or Rebel Moon.AotD is messed up nonsense where every character did what they shouldn't in zombie movie but at least sequences were cohesive.On the other hand, for this one, decisions made by characters were understandable.But I don't see why they made those choices other than the sake of keep movie going forward.CGI is alright.

His movies look good, very good actually, even though he tends to use slow motion one too many times. I was genuinely interested in what a Zack Snyder Star Wars film would look like. Turns out the answer is ""just boring"".It's the definition of style over substance, and as much as I enjoy his style, it's nowhere near enough to keep me interested for 2 and a half hours, let alone 4 (?) movies, I think. I don't care.After the first hour, which I think was pretty decent, I started zoning out big time. Two characters in act 2 had an overly long introduction, from which the main takeaway, if not the only one, was that they were cool. That was the extent of their character development. I am sure they must had some lines in the film, but I remember none of them. Didn't even get their names to be honest, the only thing I know is that one of them is played by Doona Bae and the other can tame creatures. When you are not invested in any of the characters, you are also not invested in anything that is going on.This is for me the worst kind of movie, the boring one. Competently made, takes itself very seriously, not bad enough to laugh at it, just tedious.","44 out of 100 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Worst Zack Snyder movie I've ever seen","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9517250/?ref_=tt_urv","maceman1220","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur56475557/?ref_=tt_urv","25 December 2023","Let me start by saying that in general, I am a fan of Snyder. Do I subscribe to the idea that he's one of the best directors ever, absolutely not, but I think he's certainly done some solid work and in general creates some stunning visuals and thrilling action, and good or bad, I am always curious when a new Snyder film releases. So understand me when I say this may be the worst film he has ever made, I am saying this not as a hater, but one who always watches his work with fingers crossed.For starters, the main criticism I see for the film is that it's heavily derivative of other films. Now, that isn't the biggest problem with the film, but those complaints are also not overexagerated. In short, the film is a mix of Seven samurai and star wars/firefly. The evil Empire (cleverly renamed ""The Imperium"") looms over the galaxy, bending all who live in it to its fascist will. A small band of rebels, lead by a former stormtrooper, spark the flame of rebellion to fight against their oppressors. Sound familiar, yeah, thought so. Also there's lightsabers.But make no mistake, beyond the blatant lack of originality in display, there is plenty more to criticize here.My main issue, the characters and pacing. Our lead, Kora, is fine. Sofia Boutella does her best with the material given and is suitably badass, as she has proven in the past repeatedly. Her character is nothing we haven't seen before, but certainly the one who we get the most development with. Every other character, forget about it. At a certain point (after the end of the first act), the film enters a formula. Go to new location, meet new character, action scene, said character joins team.This is where the pacing becomes a major issue as well. The character introductions are incredibly abrupt. With some, we don't even get an introduction, just a character suddenly appears and now they're part of the crew. No side characters ever get a chance to show any personality beyond whatever generic trait they are introduced with, and every scene just feels completely disjointed from what came before.Now, on to what Snyder is best known for, his visuals. To his credit, there is some beautiful and epic imagery. The first shot of the main character's home in particular is a beautiful sci fi image that can only exist in a film like this. Unfortunately, for every cool visual, there's also quite a few that are very drab and boring. Bland and brown desert planets, desaturated brown worlds, lots of brown. Occasionally some variation but largely just plain stuff. And the action is not all that exciting. The first fight of the film is arguably the best, being the most hard hitting and well made, the rest are just either rapid cut or filled with sudden slo mo (I know it's a Snyder film, but my god is there SO MUCH SLO MO). Nothing that really felt especially impactful imo.In short, the film is a rushed mess with no attention to characters or story, and blatantly rips off dozens of better films. The visuals are fine, but nothing ever amazes me. Perhaps the directors cut (which should've just been released from the start, what's with this weird planned directors cut on steaming) will fix stuff, until I see the proof I am not holding my breath. Snyder says he wants this to be a massive franchise spanning movies, games, comics, etc. As it stands right now, I think they're lucky they're getting a part 2.","12 out of 22 found this helpful.

Overall, I liked it, but at the same time, I was left wanting more.Allow me to explain.What I Liked: Visually, it's a treat, creating a world that's immersive and visually stunning. The action, especially with Sofia Boutella, is a thrill. If you're into Zack Snyder's style, you'll probably find something to enjoy here. It's got that Snyder touch, for better or for worse.What I Didn't Like: The film feels rushed, like a longer story chopped to fit the runtime. Some scenes and characters could've used more depth, which made the action less impactful. It hovers on the surface without diving into campiness or complexity.Maybe there's a better version out there held back for marketing reasons. Netflix might have missed the mark with this one.Critics giving it one star might be too harsh, but a perfect score is pushing it. For me, it's a 6 out of 10. It was enjoyable, but I wished for a bit more polish and depth.Overall, it's a sham, it had the elements for a great flick but ended up as a decent afternoon watch.I will definitely watch Part 2.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

If the movie just wouldn't go in slooooooow moooootion all the time for absolutely nooooo reasoooooon...It's baffling why Netflix wasted an impressive 160 million dollar budget on this when it must have been obivious to them that the script isn't good.

This is nothing you want to draw attention to, if you want to attract new subscribers.

But I think this movie should be reexamined for what it is. Which is first off, classic Zach Snyder, you cannot deny the graphics, the action scenes, the overall beauty of the creativeness in each scene. Now, with that being said let's examine what everyone is truly struggling with. It feels like a rip off, so much that appears and feels like stolen storylines from some of our most popular and beloved Sci-fi stories. Yes this is very true, but look at it like this it's an homage to all of us Sci-fi nerds. Zach took some of the best, scrambled them up, added to them, and created new worlds, new characters, new reasons to love the best stories in Sci-fi.I recommend you watch this movie, or rewatch it; with new vision. Accept it for what it is and you just might discover you like it more than you thought. Trust me there are things in the movie that will surprise you. Things you really didn't see coming.For those saying it's a rip off of Star Wars, it's a rip off of so much more than Star Wars. I see Dune, Pitch Black Series, Indiana Jones, Gaurdians of the Galaxy, Clash of the Titans, and several others.Appreciate the movie for what it is. I for one am looking forward to the release of part 2.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Decently fun with great visuals, but cliche and subpar acting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9513596/?ref_=tt_urv","namob-43673","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur60195330/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2023","This is something we have seen many times. A stranger comes to a village, the village is attacked by some dictator/bandit with hordes of disposable henchmen. The stranger gather a bunch of misfits and great fighters, get the village to fight with them and yea, well, there you have it.Despite the cliche premiss this has a lot of greatness too. The visuals and general cinematography are great. Sound design is excellent, and the world building is pretty good. Several of the characters are also fun and interesting. This feels like a real world/s in a distance galaxy far, far away.Were this fail is mainly with dialogue and acting. The core cast is good enough, but many others are not and a lot of the side- characters are even awful. I also fail to see how much of the dialogue could have made it past any pre screening. I also dislike the overuse of slow-motion. Every fight scene, every shooting, and even people walking need to have slow-motion. My final complaint is that this feels rushed and together with the other negatives, especially the acting, it make this feel like a 1990s TV episode rather then the epic space opera it aspires to be.This is not bad, it is watchable. But so cliche you will know what happens before it does, and that make this kinda boring.I give a generous 6/10. That is probably too high of a score, but I kinda like this and it is good to have some new scifi to watch. Sadly this was not as great as it could have been, but not too bad either.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Homage is one thing, and is often great, but this is something altogether more dull and predictable. Even a direct rip-off can be done in a way that at least feels fresh and stylish, but that doesn't happen here either.There's no fun, no richness of character, no light or shade in the dialogue - the script hangs at the same tonal grey all the way through the movie.Visually the movie is quite nice; that's something we come to expect from Snyder, but even here, there is nothing really new or unexpected.If you're going to admit to not being given the permission to do a Star Wars movie, then going ahead and doing it anyway, you really need to deliver something that proves that Disney/Lucas Films should have trusted you with the project. If anything it would have benefitted from being part of a larger universe that we already knew. As a world that had to stand on it's own, each location felt like an echo of a generic type rather than a specific place that acted as a character in the narrative.Story wise, 'A Child of Fire' has its origins in Seven Samurai, but in terms of space remakes of that story, while Battle Beyond the Stars may act as a less sophisticated visual remake, it tells a more compelling story. Along with the Star Wars rip-offs there is also a character taken blatantly from a Doctor Who episode spliced together with one from Star Trek. It's a you'll know it when you see it situation.Rebel Moon does have a few interesting religious references in some name meanings and one small sub narrative borrowed one of the apocryphal Gospels, but doesn't really seem to do anything interesting with those references.Ultimately, Snyder had the potential of a whole new universe to explore but ended up rehashing all the old ones. Let's hope that Part II does something a little more interesting.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Visually, it is good. The acting is OK. Not the worst, not the best. It does however feel like 3 films squished into one. This leaves it feeling a little like Zack Snyder is throwing everything at the wall and hoping some of it sticks. We have a full party of characters thrown into the mix with very little back story or origin at all, other than ""this guy is a good soldier"", ""this guy is ripped and rides gryphins well"" and ""oh look this lady fights with definately-not-lightsabers"". It made it really difficult to care about any of them more than ""oh I guess that's kinda cool"".I would say one stand out performance is Ed Skrein as the main villian. He's got the smarmy bad guy role down to a t. The other actors do a passable job with Charlie Hunnam being quite decent also. Unfortunately Sofia Boutella was a little one note, but wasn't terrible.All in all. It's a bit of a rushed and cheesy mess, which is surprising as it's only part 1. Really it should have been stretched out to part 1, 2 and 3 in itself. That said it is somewhat enjoyable and worth a watch, especially for the visual effects. I'd say if you enjoy the Michael Bay type, transformers action movie, then you'll like this. Lots of big explosions and excessive use of bullet-time and characters action sliding under stuff. If you are looking for a strong plot, and interesting characters then you should probably look elsewhere.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

But, having lost its king, it is now under the sway of more nefarious forces. Well, one of the Moterworld ships show up at the farming community in search of rebels and to appropriate the communities crops. One person, an outsider with a mysterious past, Kora (Sofia Boutella), fights back - tremendously. So, that leads to her and the crop master, Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) to leave on a quest to gather an army to protect their village against the Motherworld's forces. At this point, you can pretty much mail the rest of the script in as the two of them gather together a motley crew of killers, all with a grudge against the forces of the Motherworld, and proceed on their rebellious mission.Like many reviews will have stated, this is not a very original film. Most every scene is a copycat from some other sci-fi film. However, I really enjoyed it and found it engaging for the over two hours running time. And, while I have a pretty good idea what is coming in part two, it is definitely a follow-up film that I'll watch.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's really hard to tell whether all of that should've come first or not without contemplating the complete story, and it's not complete yet. Just from the runtime of 2 hours and the artistic style that involves a lot of slowed down scenes, it's not possible to put a lot of story into one movie.That said, the Part One looks gorgeous - every location, every character, the weaponry and the costumes, it's all neat and detailed. Not without downsides though - it does look uninventive and derivative in many aspects, down to a light-ish blades and a robot voiced by a famous British actor. Perhaps that's the largest issue with the movie (again, so far), that it feels like a combination of existing space universes, and not much unique ideas like weapons or animals (yet). There are few, but not many.Actors are mostly doing a great job, especially the lead ones - in my opinion they all depict the situations they're in quite well. Save for maybe the merchant/smuggler character, but that might be my personal dislike in Charlie Hunnam's acting in general.So to summarise, it's a beautifully made chapter in the story, and whether the whole story is great or dull - remains to be seen.","17 out of 36 found this helpful.

This result is very shallow dialogues to introduce any depth. Missed chance, seeing there are multiple parts.Some characters are being launched by other characters but first character haa no background so it is nearly impossible to emphasise with any motivation.It is easy to compare with star wars especially based on the trailer, but that does not do any justice.If there would be an 4 hour extended zack snyder cut, this could and probably would be a 9.

This could have been one of the best sci-fi ever create. However despite its chunky budget, lots of good concepts, it fails to deliver.The first 30-40 minutes seem generally pretty good, from there is goes downhill quickly and doesn't stop until you get to the end. The initial setup creates some sexual tension between 2 of the lead characters, then it is pretty much ignored for the remainder of the film. The other characters added as the film progresses join with little or no resistance. There is little backstory on who they are, nor do you get any attachments to them to care enough if they live or die. Despite being over 2 hours it really needed another hour to flesh out the characters and give you a better scale of the universe. Talking of universe, some space travel would have been good but for some reason travelling to another planet was achieved by simply showing some text on where they magically transported to.Then there is the camera work and cgi. Everything seems to have a deliberate blur which does little other than to irritate or distract you. All it did for me is to create a lack of depth perception almost bordering on claustrophobia. For a film which is always going to be effects driven I am unsure who signed off to say they were good enough. Generally poor in most areas, and worse than films from 20 years ago in others.Overall this could and should have been so much better.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

In a TV series, they could have explored the nuances of the story in more detail, allowing for a more thorough and comprehensive exploration of the plot. By turning this into a season one, and then subsequently releasing a season two, the story could have been fleshed out much better. Currently, it feels rushed, with the plot jumping from one place to another. The main antagonist is unimpressive, and the overall quality is mediocre. It's not a fantastic watch, but if you find yourself with nothing else to view on a lazy Sunday afternoon, it's worth a watch. It's not amazing, but it's also not as terrible as some critics are making it out to be.

There is something special here and I am looking forward to the extended cut and Part 2. Great visuals and world-building. I enjoyed the casting, costuming, and aesthetics.On the other hand, you can feel the missing content. After the opening act concludes, the film progresses at a breakneck pace and never stops to let you take in the world or the characters. All of the characters outside of the two with the most screen time are left very undeveloped. The script and even the action can feel underwhelming at times.So why a 9? I ultimately just liked it and want more. It is always easier for me to voice critical bullet points than cheerleading ones. I think if you are interested enough to be reading the reviews for this movie, it is worth watching. There was enough to like here when you realize this is only 1/3 of the project. It will be interesting to see if Netflix regrets not putting their best foot forward from the beginning. I plan to watch all 4 releases, but the consensus review score makes it appear like some people will not return even if the extended cut and Part 2 are better reviewed which would be a shame.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's a running theme with him, Watchmen was the only one that landed the execution, although ZSJL is faaaar better than the Josh Weedon version and this film is no different unfortunately. I'm writing this review a little over half way in and it's as follows;Effects: Sometimes 8/10, creatures and aliens look amazing. Other times 5/10 and looks like an early 2000s game. You can really tell it was shot on green screen sometimes.Acting: The acting talent is there, they are all competent actors, but they either overact or under act and end up looking like a low budget fan film. They try to hit ALOT of emotional beats, with big music swells, and they just miss every-time as we just don't care about the characters.Story: Pretty generic, no deviation from a much used storyline...so far, this part 1 after all. It's a bit paint by numbers with typical story beats. It's definitely not changing the genre.Filmmaking: Typical overindulgence from ZS. Slow mo, gritty muddy look, 10 different angles of the same shot.The film suffers from a major identity crisis, it doesn't know whether it wants to be Star Wars, 300, Warhammer 40K, live action anime, Destiny or Dune. ZS has cherry picked the ""best parts"" of all these and done them worse then the respective properties. Plus there is a massive overuse of anamorphic lenses. Some shots are just plan out of focus.Overall I was intrigued when the adverts and trailers arrived and was left wanting when I watched the film, as with the budget of the MIGHTY NETFLIX and such a high profile director, this should have been a home run. Netflix still has a way to go to deliver a film on this scale of the aforementioned titles.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

After eagerly awaiting the second part, I still crave more because of the intriguing storyline and presentation. While the concept of sunrises and sunsets may be familiar, the film's beauty is captivating and worth experiencing.In my opinion, it's stunningly beautiful despite its simplicity; some scenes are truly enthralling and worthy of revisiting, and the music adds to the overall experience. Special mention goes to the song performed by the general.These are the kind of space operas that resonate with me. They're like the Star Wars I've been waiting for.A unique blend of Beauty, Humanity and Reality.What's refreshing is that it's not male-centric and lacks the usual machismo.The film manages to avoid being boring or excessive.If you're open-minded and appreciate diverse representations, then this film is for you. Each character brings their own story and cultural background, enriching the overall narrative, rather than feeling like forced diversity.To me, it's like a snapshot of modern society and human existence. It highlights the eternal struggle against oppressors who seek to subjugate and erase those they deem unworthy, while also emphasizing the importance of preserving one's identity and cultural heritage.Thank you to everyone supporting Ukraine and other nations resisting tyranny.Remember! Nobody wants war but when conditions allow for the rise of an empire it's inevitable unless individuals stand up against it and fight for their rights and freedom.

However, after watching the film, the more I think about it, the more I realize 'Rebel Moon' is just this decades 'Jupiter Ascending'. That is not good company, though I did like 'Rebel Moon' more.I feel as though Snyder has good ideas, but he just hasn't perfected the art of how to actually tell a good story. The characters are okay, but most of the acting is atrocious with a few exceptions. Hunnam, Boutella, and Skrein are fine, but not great. The CGI was decent most of the time, but sometimes just looked weird, or a bit off. Zack really needs to calm down with the slow motion action moments; they're cool if used sparingly and in the right moments, but not twenty times in every action sequence.It also felt like there were not many original ideas. Lucas did Nazi's, so Snyder did the Soviets. The whole warmongering and even look, reminded me of Necromongers from 'The Chronicles of Riddick'. The creatures looked good, but again felt like knockoffs ie. Buckbeak from 'Harry Potter'. I liked the robot Jimmy the most I think, but again, not super original. Oh, and that double cross could be seen from six miles out.On a side note, it was kind of funny realizing that both of Khaleesi's boyfriends who played Daario in 'Game of Thrones' were in this film. I always preferred Skrein's version.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I believe the problem lies in the fact that nobody bothered to put two and two together, or to understand that the first part of the film Rebel Moon would look like a wrinkled shirt (very nice, but still quite wrinkled).The film could have been much better, but as it is, it's watchable and provides decent entertainment for a rainy afternoon.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's derivative and the characters are underdeveloped but it's reasonably entertaining. It wears its influences on its visual sleeve, including Star Wars, Blade Runner, The Matrix and Harry Potter 3. The story is like the first episode of a streaming series. There's lots of exposition and superficial character introductions that are left to be developed in later installments. I'm not usually a fan of Zach Snyder's plodding, overcooked style but this is an improvement since he's often cutting and pasting from better directors/movies.I think 6/10 is a fair rating, although anywhere from 4 to 8 would be reasonable. What isn't reasonable is the absolute hate this has gotten from professional critics. Professional critics have dogpiled this movie because: they're corrupt, effete creeps; and they think they can get away with it since Netflix didn't really indulge in divisive identitarian marketing despite a very diverse cast. If this had been marketed as a Disney/Amazon/MarySue Pictures Production featuring ""the First Nonbinary Aleutian Furry in a starring role,"" it would have a 10,000% critical rating on RT. But it's Zach Snyder and it's Netflix, so around 20% is about the best for which anyone could hope.Is this a great movie? No. Is it better than most of the gutter trash that professional critics half-heartedly endorsed this year at the behest of their corporate masters such as The Marvels, Rings of Power, or Indiana Jones And The Destruction Of A Legacy? Yes, absolutely.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The good:Setting is intriguing;
worlds are interesting;
Most actors are pretty damn.good except for protagonist;
some graphics are good;The so-so:
Action scenes are ok;
world-building;
plot-line = premise of finding a whole rebel army to defend a village of 30-40 odd souls? Makes no sense.. village should be of at least several thousand people....
the pacing.The bad:dialogues are poor;
relationships between characters hastily built;
feels like a movie for teenagers;
the protagonist really can't act, not a bit; every line is torture;
some graphics are bad;
in a high-tech world, why are people fighting with clubs and swords?To sum up, worth watching, but it is not memorable. If you like sci-fi like Dunes give it a chance. Don't expect masterpiece.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

and for once more IGNORE all the toxic fanboys/girls that have caused so much harm..to so many Sagas and Gems..,
and watch it..Stunning visual effects, great atmosphere, sceneries, great action with nice slo-mo scenes, good soundtrack and an interesting fast moving story. Also good performances from most of the cast.Some new interesting ideas..and characters, very good villains.., and an overall captivating and tense atmosphere of mystery.., sci-fi and fairy tale..I dare to say that this movie is a successful mix of Dune, Star Wars, 300, and Blade Runner put together, in a very interesting sci-fi mix..
I also liked the Nazi-like.. appearance and colors of the Empire's officers, generals etc. I believe it prepares.. you subconciously.. for how brutal they are..Can't wait for Part 2!..
hope there will be even a Part 3!..Thank u Zack Snyder!, (and Netflix..),

This story would have muuuch better benefitted from a TV series that allowed each character and backstory breath as some of them sounded interested; also we teleport from planet to planet sometimes.A good twist involved, basic boss fight at the end. All in all alright but more excited for part 2.Music: seemed cool but can't remember a stand out, maybe one but need to recheck the soundtrack to fit but the music did fit in well into the universe.Design: Very cool, mix of practical and CG that blended quite well giving quite phenomenal shots. This universe looks well lived in, very cool already iconic weapons and ship designs.Directing/photography: As mentioned in the prior paragraph, some great shots, good directing in terms of at least consistent pace, I believe Zack kept as much or the necessary scenes as needed to make the film ""work"" but it barely does as it feels rushed: defo needed a series.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Everything about it is style over substance.The nonsensical plot and setting strongly remind me of Jupiter Ascending, another visually great yet overall boring movie of the same vein. Large elements are clearly mimicking the Avatar movies, making them feel stale and recycled. And while there were promising actresses and actors cast in various roles there wasn't anywhere near enough depth or coherent story in this movie for them to do much more than recite their trite (often outright stupid) dialogue while looking dirty and sad in literally every scene.You can by all means enjoy the great visuals in this flick... but it's not good science fiction.

The poor people in the village agree to give the heroes the little they have as payment. The handful of heroes are vastly outnumbered, but still willing to make a stand.Does it sound familiar? It's basically Seven Samurai or The Magnificent Seven, but in space, even slower and split into two movies, from which this is the first. I was trying to keep count, see if they get exactly seven heroes, so at least it would feel more like an homage and less like a rip off. I'm not sure about the final count though. Anyway, it's hard to care about any of the characters.It also borrows from other sources. The bad guys are kind of the empire from Star Wars. Instead of emperor Palpatine we have the Regent. The relationship between the Regent and the main hero is too similar to Thanos and Gamora from the MCU. In short, the movie gets no points for originality or character development.The fight scenes are not bad. But they have some very obvious continuity issues and some other problems that broke the illusion for me. I won't give examples to avoid spoilers.I did like the landscapes, specially at the beginning. And the odd looking aliens are interesting too. In general the movie has very good visuals. And if you shut your brain a bit while watching, overall the movie is mildly entertaining.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Plenty of unfortunate death and destruction without audience connection or care. The special effects seemed over the top at times and made it hard to feel immersed in the movies reality. The script was boring, underdeveloped and predictable at times. Most of the players seemed wooden or forced and I had no connection to them and did not care if they lived or died. In my mind this probably needed to be a 10 part tv series with all the stories and subplots.Too much in too short of time equals too much information and not enough story connectivity.

The visuals are nothing short of breathtaking, transporting audiences to immersive worlds that set the stage for an epic space saga. The storytelling is the beating heart of this film, weaving a narrative that keeps you engaged from start to finish. From political intrigue to personal triumphs, the plot is a rollercoaster of emotions that resonates with both die-hard sci-fi fans and casual viewers.The action sequences in Rebel Moon are a true highlight, showcasing meticulous production and a knack for capturing intensity. The decision to cut the music during key moments creates a raw and gripping atmosphere, allowing audiences to fully immerse themselves in the on-screen spectacle. Charlie Hunnam's acting prowess is on full display, adding a charismatic touch to the story. His character becomes a linchpin, connecting the audience to the grandeur of the Rebel Moon universe.One can't help but draw comparisons to the more recent Star Wars films, and Rebel Moon triumphs where others stumbled. The film embodies the visual splendor and epic scale that many fans longed for in the galaxy far, far away. Despite some harsh criticism from certain quarters, Rebel Moon is undeniably watchable and thoroughly enjoyable. It's a cinematic adventure that delivers on its promises, proving that satisfying sci-fi can still be achieved on the big screen.However, no space epic is without its flaws. Some moments in Rebel Moon suffer from questionable and unnecessary dialogue, pulling viewers momentarily out of the immersive experience. Additionally, the movie's score, while not terrible, lacks the memorability and unique identity that could have elevated it to iconic status. Despite these minor setbacks, Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire stands as a testament to the power of visually stunning storytelling and is undoubtedly worth the watch for anyone seeking an intergalactic escape.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Far from perfect, but nowadays we should get our wins whenever we can.The story is simple, perhaps a little too simple. And it doesn't dodges the typical cliches seen in this genre of movies. But we can see the potential of this world that Zack Synder has created.Overall character performances were good and some even very good, unfortunately the performance of the main character Kora (Sophia Boutella) is not amongst them. I had hoped she had grown more as an actress, but it seems clear she will not be growing beyond what she has already shown in the past.And it's a shame really seeing her character played perhaps by another actress like let's say Emily Blunt, would've really shined and could've perhaps been the creation of quite an important character within the sci-fi genre.I understand why Sophia Boutella was chosen for this role, her dancing skills really come through in the action scenes. But it's her ability to show deeper levels of emotion that are lacking and for her character that's also a vital part.Rebel Moon hasn't done anything groundbreaking or revolutionary, but it's still a solid movie. Same as the story might seem too simplistic to some, to others it seems to go over their heads. Some negative critics about it are not only unwarranted but a little petty. As if they were expecting this movie to be what Star Wars or Alien were in their beginning.When even Star Wars and Alien can't reproduce their winning formula.Don't go into this movie with too much expectations and will surprise you in a good way. Go into thinking it will be groundbreaking within the genre and you'll obviously be disappointed.Rebel Moon has potential and it's a good addition to the genre, but it doesn't do anything that can't be expected from a good sci-fi movie. And that's already quite an achievement considering how little in terms of good sci-fi movies we really get.At least Rebel Moon doesn't promise to shoot for the Moon only to fall in a few meters.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The lead protagonist is a super soldier whose main ability appears to be a miraculous inability to get shot despite lots of people shooting at her from close range. I was rooting for the cardboard cutout baddies so that the mind numbing, pretentiousness and stupidity would end.As a child I had a book depicting images of various SciFi worlds, it feels like Zack tore out four pages of the book and that was the film's storyboard. Vaguely pretty to look at, in a 1980s way, but I think some decent character development, dialogue, and story & scenes that make some sort of sense would have been nice.Maybe the film is deliberately dull and nonsensical, so that in a year or two the director's cut can come out. Wait for that, it'll be over 4 hours long, so at least you'll get more dull and nonsense for your money.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

Despite not being a massive fan of Zack Snyder, the first trailer made me think something great was coming. The second trailer dampened my enthusiasm slightly, as the visuals were classicly Snyder - too much green screen done in a way which to me looks more like cells from a comic book with not enough effort to make it look realistic; maybe that's the point. I felt the same way about 300, Justice League, etc. The movie looks like this all the way through, with additional visuals such as blurring around characters in early scenes.But the real problem with this film is the writing. What little plot development there is does nothing to develop the characters, or build a world which draws you in.Someone in another review here describes it as ""soulless"". I can't believe I've never though of it before but that perfectly encapsulates this, and all of Snyder's work.I'll probably watch the sequel in April, as it effectively costs me nothing. But I would not pay to see it in the cinema were that the only way.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Let's hope part 2 brings some of the points back. But for now it will be max 7 from me.The pacing was inconsistent and the mains sequence felt very short. There was almost no buildup for main set of event and where there was some time spent on building the characters they didn't do much in the movie.Overall the universe felt short of what a space opera should have been, without the exposure to the Main places of the movie. Maybe if they had spent some more time on the history it would have proven to be success in my books. We still need to establish the most badass villian of the universe like star wars.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Did you know that slow motion is an available technology for movies these days? I had no idea but after watching this movie I am an expert on the subject. I'm not sure if Zack lets anybody give him any constructive criticism ever. He seems like a decent fellow but the only way I can imagine this poor amount of quality control is managed on such a high profile production (every single time) is if he has some serious control problems.I also really like how I am not allowed to dislike something for having abysmal writing unless I am ""only following the pack"". I very much enjoy how anytime something that isn't well made is produced we have the fanboys crawling out of the woodworks crying foul. It's okay to enjoy things that others don't, or even the vast majority don't. We ALL have guilty pleasures but I assure you ""Rebel Moon"" is about as much of one as a colonoscopy.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

The CGI was well done and the environments were rich, each frame contains incredible detail that it could almost be a wallpaper.Most also seem to forget that this movie is a part I, and like most two part movies, the first one provides context and prepares you for part II. And Rebel Moon Part One did just that.I've seen much worse sci-fis where not even the visuals are good and none of them got this amount of hate. After some digging I must conclude that they are not about the movie, but about the director.For example Dune Part I didn't really amount to anything, which is expected for a part one. I dare to say I even find the movies similar, great visuals and a bit lacking in story. Yet Dune was praised.Looking forward for part II and the director's cut.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The editing in this is worse and that was different movies chopped together. This boasts CGI creatures with no feet, blurred backgrounds, lens flare and staggeringly short draw distances. Each chopped together, nonsense scene, seems as if it is set on a pantomime stage, no scrawling vistas, no depth to the scenery. Like a poorly funded college project with a very small greenscreen. The first 20 minutes up until the posie crown on a robots head are engaging enough. Then comes a slow motion battle, oh wait here is another slow motion battle, hang on, wait more slow mo. After 40 minutes we started to narrate the film ourselves. Mostly you will ask yourself why? Why are the planets so big? Why is the universe so small? Why is there a scene from an alley in the film Gladiator? Why is there a field of corn? Why have you cast him as the general? Why did you find him near a colloseum? Why is the backstory so shallow? Why not just tell a story Zac? Why has that horse got styrofoam on its head? Why are all action scenes played out in the space of 20 metres? Why does the scale of the ships keep changing? Why is this so much fun?If you want to laugh in bewilderment and make up your own dialogue, there is over two hours of special. The CGI floating monolith city is tremendously low quality, like a CGI cutscene from the video game Timesplitters. If you are watching in any form of high definition it's like a low budget child's TV program in places. It's a blast to marvel at just how bad this is. We watched it all the way through, we survived, we are now bonded together more than any character in this movie... Brilliantly bad... No directors cut can fix this...

Nothing in this film feels remotely original; Star Wars, Warhammer, Avatar, even HTTYD are some main examples of franchises this movie rips off. There's not even any clear concept on how this world works. Inspiration is fine, but only when you are least have something new to bring to the table. Don't watch this film and waste your time.

Part 1 has tread very close to both in terms of the plot devices in use. I could understand if someone thought it was lazy because the elements are very pure and in many ways overdone at this point. For example, you might ask if we need another seven samurai tribute film.

I believe I was expecting a disaster and since it wasn't, at least to me, that made it mildly successful to me. Let's start with the bad. The movie is very thin as far as the writing goes. It was very difficult for me to care about the characters. The character development was pretty poor. Another thing was it just seemed they just hopped from one world to another, gathering heroes. Ok. Meh. The only one with a really developed back story was the main character Kora. She's cool. Other than that... meh. Now for the good, special effects are cool, and I personally am a sucker for the slow motion scenes which are a hallmark of Zach Snyder. The action scenes are beautiful and the special effects are great.Now, if I had to see this movie in a theater, I would not be happy. Considering this is Netflix, (and I do not pay for my subscription to Netflix) I would say there are way worse movies you could watch on a night. So long as you don't have to pay to see it, I think it is worth a watch. I gave it a 7 because of the cinematography. Otherwise it would have been a 5. I will also repeat what others have said. Zach Snyder is a better director than writer. He should be given scripts, not writing them.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The story developes slow as it's clearly setting up a larger interaction between our characters but like many in the the genre it does enough foreshadowing and ground work to keep you interested in the players involved. It's a solid start to this story line and I look for the second part of this drama, not sure how many are planned but it could be a large number with the amount of information included.","14 out of 29 found this helpful.

I expected it to be a slow-moving slog. It wasn't! I'm not sure what everyone else was expecting to be disappointed with this.It does copy Star Wars a lot. Even some of the ""droid"" sounds are the same (which I always thought were stupid, digital transmission at such low frequencies would be so inefficient). And some of the fights were dumb, particularly the one using bladed weapons while people with guns stood by and watched. And some of the dialogue was downright silly.But it was still all good fun, maybe coming in with low expectations is the key!","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

I know from a director friend of mine that it is always the directors fault if an actor cannot deliver a dialogue or feel comfortable in its role. So bad acting is on Zack. The bad CGI tho. I don't know who's fault is that, but the spaceships and the wide shots are looking horrible in this movie. Like some cutscenes from a 1990's videogame. Writing is also Zack, so all these clichés and copies from the original Star Wars and Warhammer are lame. Cringe. Turok...sorry, I mean Tarak the last Mohican's flight on that giant black bird reminded me of the Neverending Story's dragon flight. And that movie was made in 1984. Simply bad, man. I cannot say anything that is positive. With all these boring and lame slow motions...without it would be 60mins long not 120. Absolutely amateur. Like a cheap lame TV movie.

Yes, it has some scenes with major unrealistic situations where the main characters won't survive, but it's a movie in the end, and I can't complain.The most important thing is that the movie has a story, and it's not just special effects that you will forget the moment the movie ends.

The story was fleshed out more in Rebel Moon, which is of higher importance to me. Yes, there could have been more background story; but it wasn't a hinderance to the logic of the movie(like it was in Dune). The CGI and Filmography was better in Dune. There were a couple of places in Rebel Moon, that the CGI was kinda subpar and I would have expected better. Especially one of the scenes when they were looking out the back of a ship as it was rising from the ground. Such a simple background scene, looking out a bay door, seems easy compared to some of the other complexities.I don't know why so many people had problems with the story? It wasn't groundbreaking, but it flowed and made sense. The only reason I understood the new Dune is because I had seen the '84 version and the mini-series('84 would have been enough to understand it though). It was entertaining, I don't feel like I wasted my time watching it like I did with the new installment of Dune.The only reason I'm comparing this movie to the new Dune is because they are both kinda Epics within the same genre. I don't know any other movie I can really compare it to recently. Also I would rate this movie around a 7.5, to be a little more fair. It's got good action, it's got a decent plot of pulling the different heroes together, it's sci-fi like it says on the tin. Like I said, it's not groundbreaking; but it is an entertaining movie.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Honestly, its not even a good one either, but at the end of the day i was somehow mildly entertained. The structure of this movie reminded me of video game, were you a main quest and then do side quests in order to requite companions - literally. Characterization of those characters is also pretty bad - its basically a colorful set of characters who are good at something (mostly killing things). And as for slow motion scenes - they are fine for me because it what director did trough his carrier - it did not bother me. There are action in this movie for sure and its was done OK. Music was pretty good in some scenes and i kinda loved the bird taming sequence. And yes, this movie is also rip offs everything from Star Wars, Avatar and many more movies.Overall, this whole movie can be summed up i think in few sentences. If you really like all previous movies from this director, there is a chance might enjoy this one at least partially. Its not as bad as people say it is (well it kind of is), but for a dumb evening it might do its job.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The problem is that thist screenplay would have worked as a Star wars film (fun fact that's actually what this was before Disney canceled the project) but without the star wars factor he was forced to fall back on styles and elements that pull it right back towards the anime.In the end it is trying to force a more complex story into two short movies.The characters and their stories are laughably incomprehensible. Never mind the utterly unreasonable way they all just decide to try to fight a literal army that controls everything, without even the slightest reason.The script reads like how a teenage might right their creative writing project, using inspirational and obscure phrases and language that is meant to sound deep or clever. All it really does is sound like the writers don't know how real people talk.And then there is the design. Every space ship defies intelegent design and physics. They look like they are designed to have no corners or sharp edges to protect children. And the giant waterfall above the village which reminds me of the kind of pumps old men put in their fishponds.All in all it's a dogs breakfast.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

Gravitas and a touch of sophistication as the storyline draws allusions to powerful archetypes, which you might not grasp if you are laser focused on just the sci-fi canon (pun intended).This subtlety is lost on the negative reviewers here, but even if you don't think that deeply, it's a fun and beautiful film. The visuals are excellent, the alien creatures are conceptually interesting (love the spider thingy in the bar in Providence). And most importantly, the acting is rock solid. I cannot watch a movie if it's overacted. No problems here. Lead villain was cool, especially with regard to costume design. The lead protagonist was also cool, not to mention easy on the eyes. I think this actress has real chops...sorry for not knowing her name.

The cinematography was terrible with focal depths that were so small that much of a scene was fuzzy.I'm pretty easy to please and can find something redeeming in most movies, but I just couldn't go on with this movie.

His recent films are really just a collection of scenes,(..admittedly spectacular, at times..),with very little character development,sadly. It's like he just can't wait for the next slo-mo action scene to happen and hang everything else. I will happily watch the second part to see if he can bring it back.

The CGI space backdrops, the alien designs, S the fight scenes-- all fun to watch.Everything else is incredible predictable and trite. Whatever you think is going to happen or be uttered next, you're right.I've done paint-by-numbers that had more twists and turns than this movie, let's put it that way.Also, sweet superfluous exposition! Each character gets their time to tell us who they are, what their backstory is, what their motivation is... It's as if Zach read the character descriptions the writer did for his benefit, and was like, ""Heck, let's just have them SAY this stuff!""When Chronicles of Riddick came out, people complained that it tried too hard to create an entire space opera universe. (Probably because they wanted Pitch Black 2; honestly I think Chronicles is fantastic).Rebel Moon is what you get when you don't try at all, when your aspirations are to make a Star Wars Clone. Backworld farmer, Han Solo, British robot, Nazi empire, it's all there.Honestly, I kind of appreciate that Snyder made the Star Wars stuff so explicit, it's weirdly refreshing.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Additionally, new characters are unlocked with innovative sci-fi elements.Plot is ok, nothing extraordinary. But it depends on how it will develops.

It's annoying in almost every way - the constant slow motion, the lack of any logic. As you would expect, there are some really striking visual sequences, but they are just not enough to keep you engaged.And it all ends in an empty sequence with characters you don't care about doing things you don't care about either.And we've got part 2 coming - which you certainly aren't left eagerly anticipating.","20 out of 43 found this helpful.

When i started reading about it being bad, i thought it was a shame, but then i decided to watch it for myself, because too often i won't watch something or play a specific game if i hear bad press about it. I liked all the characters even though i'm not a fan of Sofia Boutella. I think a new world filled with potential was created. Fast googling and this was done for 166 Million for BOTH PARTS! That's 84 Million per Movie and filmed back to back to save money. And to the people Talking about star wars, Rise of Skywalker's budget was 416 Million...I think this new world is filled with potential and i'd love nothing but to see Snyder do a Star Wars movie with that kind of budget. Maybe when they finally get rid of Kathleen Kennedy :)Ps: In the meantime, i for one try to have fun with my entertainment and not look for everything that's wrong with something i'm watching. And honestly even with the simple plot i think this is miles above what's been coming out lately. But for 80 million per movie....?? Newest Hunger games budget was 160 Million and i'd rather watch this movie twice than to watch that.PPs: In every scene of this movie i did notice the dedication of always putting something else in for the CGI sets not to look too barren.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

After watching Rebel Moon, it's clear that there are a bunch of Sci-Fi and Snyder fanboys who expected this to be better than Star Wars and when it wasn't they had to trash it.The story is a bit choppy and I understand the slow mo in the action sequences was a bit overdone, but the movie succeeded in creating an original world in an era where all we've been getting is forced sequels and remakes of remakes for 20 years. I think that had to stand for something.The story is relatively standard for a movie like this, but the lead heroine was tough and as complex as they could've made her given the screen time they gave her back story. I enjoyed watching her as a main character. The main villain was both creepy, threatening and mysterious. The cinematography and world building alone make it worth a watch.I'd recommend it, don't expect Star Wars action and sci fi perfection with Godfather writing and character development and you'll probably enjoy it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Even Scorsese did Hugo) but mostly creating visual wonders. However all his original work, ie all work that was not conceptually created by someone else, leaving Snyder the sole task of adapting it to the big screen is below average.Rebel Moon is no exception, as this extremely basic and predictable story has been remade so many times one cannot even bother to care about the story. Not even Snyder himself, it seems, as half his characters appear out of nowhere, undertake a task for no reason and without any obvious motive, and proceed to the next scene.This movie feels more like an adventure game than a work of art. ""Unlock a new character, mission completed, proceed to the next stage"".However, as a visually impressive space opera, Rebel Moon does not disappoint. It can be best enjoyed if playing in the background while one is wrapping Xmas presents or decorating the house, because it is very pretty and one does not need to watch it attentively, as the story hardly matters at all. As such, it is a fun Xmas distraction and -at least as far as I'm concerned- more fun than ONE MORE mindless Santa movie about escaped reindeers, lost presents or naughty elves.I give this a 8/10 for the visuals and a 2/10 for the story and characters. This should count as a 5, but because it's the holidays, I will rate it with a 6/10 coz you know, Xmas spirit and all.PS 1: One should compare this mess to Guardians of the Galaxy to realize how great Marvel used to be before they became a populist political platform: making good space operas is extremely difficult.PS 2: Kudos to the cast for REALLY trying to act in a completely nonsensical story with a horribly idiotic script.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And, of course, Star Wars tropes are nearly unavoidable.In contrast to the unoriginality of the plot, the film is visually beautiful.The writing is mediocre. The pacing is bad. The acting is stilted--despite there being several great actors (who are poorly utilized). The action sequences are plentiful and terrific. The characters are generally one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs (although the pacifist robot who ""goes native"" is intriguing).But hey, this is Netflix, so my expectations weren't terribly high to begin with.

There was a sort of choppiness to the fluidity of acting thought. Some characters seemed seasoned, while others showed their first time on the job scattered throughout.

I see the vision, I really do, but with binoculars. Rebel Moon could have been so much more, they had gold in their hands, yet they failed to give the audience good material. This film is all over the place. ALL OVER THE PLACE. It can't stand on its own two feet, such a half-baked story with rushed character introductions, that it could not make me care for anything that was happening on screen. I didn't spend enough time with these characters to really understand them and care for them.Now, dear Zack Snyder, cool it with the slow-mo. Yes, I agree they're cool and you like them, I like them too, but only when they're earned and feel satisfying. When you're literally giving me a slow-mo every ten seconds, it's only normal that I'll get sick of it after a while. I laughed a handful of times during this movie, and it wasn't with the movie, more so AT it.But because I don't want to completely bury this film, I'd like to give props to the production design and the people who worked on the visual effects, because they are magnificent (with a few exceptions). This is Netflix's most expensive film ever, and you can tell. There's clearly a ton of work put into Rebel Moon.Sad to see Zack Snyder's attempt at a Star Wars film fail so miserably. I hope the 4 hour long Snyder cut does it justice.

And Sofia Boutella delivers a believable protagonist with a troubled past. This is what I usually call a ""popcorn movie"" - not going to set the world on fire, but entertaining for what it is.

But, this film is great on it's own, and it sets up what's to come in this new sci-fi (or rather science fantasy) franchise that's going to change sci-fi. Overall, 8.5-9/10 💯. Snyder delivered big and this cinematic & expanded universe is gonna be dope. I can't wait for the extended rated R version and Part 2.","60 out of 156 found this helpful.

motion blur in your tv settings !! And put it to filmmaker mode .Now, yes the movie is made from a lot of different sci fi movies.Star wars
dune
chronicles of Riddick
7 samurai or magnificent 7.Firefly
bugs life
clash of the titans
and mostly "" battle beyond the stars""
some scenes are almost identical, like the cantina scene. ..the lightsabers are also a cliché
I like the actor playin the villain, I wouldn't be surprised he ends up in the MCU as a super villain,But hey it was still fun to watch.Haters gonna hate.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

He's by far one of worst directors of over generation,. So out of touch with the art of filmmaking and storytelling it defies any logic how he still gets to make movies.He single handedly destroyed the DC universe and one of America's greatest icons Superman. I had thought after that disaster of monumental proportions we wouldn't be subjected to any more from him for a long time.It here we are again. Another movie in which he literally gets everything wrong. Have to admit the trailer was intriguing but the movie...yikes it's a dud right from the start. It's like a bunch of amateurs were given lots of money to produce a film.Another thing that doesn't make sense is how do Zack Snyder movies have such terrible special effects in this day and age.And wait for it...there is also going to be a Zack Snyder cut of this rubbish. Are you kidding me?It's commonly said that Zack Snyder is one of the most disliked directors in Hollywood. Why should that even be a surprise. He's clearly a con man who somehow fools studios into letting him make more movies.Zack please retire and take up another line of work.","17 out of 36 found this helpful.

Similar to the recent ""The Creator"" it avoids original content by following elements of other films. While the film itself is fine, it does feel like a copy of something that has been done better.The plot is that an evil empire called The Homeworld is a cruel overlord that can't help but murder the innocent. Innocents don't want to get murdered and have to look for a group of great warriors to protect them.The acting is good, and some of the effects are grand, however there are definitely some spots where it looks like a mid 2000s video game. While the side characters are meant to be original and unique, I did find myself uninterested. They didn't click.Ultimately, Snyder does his thing. Grand sets, slow mo action and some good tension, but he has done this all before - better. If that is enough for you, then this is fine. What it does not do is bring anything interesting to the table. With the mountains of new content out every week, this film fails to set itself apart. Entertaining, forgettable.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Rarely have I been so annoyed by a character's stupid actions and simultaneously empty but supposedly meaningful speeches.Although you could actually say that about all the characters, if you're beeing honest...I could write more about the movie now, but it's just not worth it. Because I've probably already spent more time writing this review than Snyder spent writing the screenplay.I give this movie a gracious two stars because I have hope that part 2 can at least save this movie into mediocrity after the fact.Deep in my little heart, however, I fear that Znyder will only hurt the poor souls of all sci-fi and movie fans even deeper with the release of part 2.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Rebel Moon is already slated for a director's cut so some might see this movie and it's sequel as a skip until the cut comes out on netflix.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The acting is weak for the most part and the story is a pale imitation of the story that inspired it. Anyone who couldn't see this was based off the seven samurai (as was Star Wars Ep 4) either doesn't know that story, or this story was so hard to watch that they couldn't see it.Zack Snyder definitely over uses the slow motion in his works, which simply makes it hard to stay focused on the boring script. A little slow motion can emphasize dramatic events. Constant use of it is annoying and ruins the moment and story telling.Zack Snyder also seems to try and constantly get the money shot even when there isn't one. And when there is one it is often over baked CGI.The story telling is definitely rolled out slowly. So slow that it loses me as a viewer. Even the exciting bits tend to be slow and a bit boring, often because of the over use of slow motion. It like Zack Snyder can't get out of his own way.Then there's the costumes and such. One of the villains attire is definitely awkwardly out of place. How anyone could think this was the next Star Wars is beyond me. Rebel Moon is too stiff and take itself too serious to even come close to that title.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Then find B actors and make them suffer through their pandering cliche lines. Then Voila! You have a 3 part epic saga you can sell to a streaming company desperate for content but experiencing financial hardship.

I didn't expect the anticipated fight scene to happen when it did either, that definitely caught me off guard which was nice.

Why did they believe that the audience wouldn't appreciate a slow-burning, intricately crafted storyline instead of rushing through everything just to reach the somewhat intense battle at the end?Even now, I barely have a clue about the people they are fighting for. Why should I invest so much emotion in a group of farmers whom I barely had the opportunity to spend time with?Or a motley crew of warriors who were once revered?There was so much more potential that could have been explored, and once again, it fell short of becoming something truly AMAZING, leaving me with a sense that it was only good for what it was...","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Rebel Moon comes across as cheap, cheesy and without a shred of originality. The action is well below average, I expected much more. Rebel Moon fails in story, narrative, tricks, action scenes, cinematography... and I could go on for ten more minutes. Nothing really works here, except maybe the CGI is ok. Let me put this out into the world, I've been channeling for six months. Without a doubt the worst movie of the year.

Well this is a sort of hybrid of that and the ""Magnificent Seven"" that is quite impressive to look at, but that's about the height of it. A political assassinations has destabilised the kingdom and so ""General Noble"" (Ed Skrein) is off in his Dreadnought to terrorise the inter-planetary population. He arrives on a peaceful agrarian planet, kills the town father and declares that he'll be back in ten weeks to collect their harvest of grain. Panic sets in, especially when the guards he leaves behind try to force themselves on a villager and they encounter the wrath of ""Kora"" (Sofia Boutella). She's pretty nimble with her weaponry (so we just know there's a story here somewhere) and also manages to convince the town wimp ""Gunnar"" (Michael Huisman) that they must set off to recruit some help they can use to thwart the destruction of their livelihoods by ""Noble"". What we have now are a series predicable, set-piece, escapades as gradually they assemble a disparate band of rogues and criminals who might just want to take on the general in an hopelessly one-sided contest. You might detect the voice of Sir Anthony Hopkins (""Jimmy"") and Charlie Hunnam sports a variable Irish accent as the famed ""Kai"" as this follows extremely well trammelled lines of adventure mixed with romance, political intrigue and some whizzo special effects. The denouement is straight out of ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002) and sets us up for a second instalment that you could probably just about map out now.

Well, I got meh. It's not bad by any means. It is definitely not great either. It's a decent science fiction film with an all too familiar premise that will keep you somewhat entertained for a couple of hours. The locations are done well from a distance but the movie bounces from one place to another you never get to enjoy the different worlds that are visited. Some of the characters really have no reason for being in the film. There is zero comedy. I mean zero. Maybe a smirk or two but that's it. Way too many slow motion scenes that don't make sense. I mean way too many. Quite a few eye roll moments. The scene at the end that brings down the ship is a huge eye rolling moment. If it is that easy to bring down that size of ship, pretty sure the rebels could win with some sling shots and arrows. But I was entertained for the most part. This borrows from many sci if movies so don't expect anything too earth shattering. Maybe part two will improve but knowing Zach he will do what he does, all he knows how to, the same thing, over and over and over.....","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This one is no different. Rebel Moon does suffer a bit from predictability. Let's just accept it. Putting this aside though, Sophia Boutella does a fine job as a warrior goddess (e.g., hot, sexy, athletic, mysterious, etc., all the things we come to expect from a warrior hero). Some people have complained about the slow motion elements of the fight scenes. I don't really mind. After The Matrix series of movies this cinematic style has been used a ton of times. No reason to hammer Rebel Moon for doing the same thing. The quality of special effects fall inline with what I'd expect from a feature movie. The supporting cast is solid. Overall I can't fault this movie for any egregious errors. The only downside is that you can see early on how certain story lines will develop.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The slow motion in the action is also corny...

Nowhere as good as I was hoping. Slightly better than meh. Director/Co-Writer Zach Snyder (DAWN OF THE DEAD, SUCKER PUNCH, MAN OF STEEL) originally pitched this to Lucasfilms as a new Star Wars trilogy, but when they declined, Netflix took him up and produced this lavish space opera, telling the story of a small farming village on the outskirts of the galaxy coming under the heel of a fascist high tech galactic empire. When the villagers decline help the empire (here called the Imperium) they are told they will return at the end of the season, take all of their crops, and leave them to perish. That's pretty much the same set up as THE SEVEN SAMURAI, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN , and even Roger Corman's excellent Star Wars knockoff BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS (which a young James Cameron did the special effects for). A young village woman, who turns out to be a former high ranking Imperium soldier hiding out after betraying them, goes on a mission to find mercenaries to help the villagers fight the Imperium. This sets in motion a set of vignettes, just as the earlier mentioned films did, where each warrior gets their scenes to show off their skills before being asked to help the village. Snyder as a director doesn't seem to bring much original to his material in therms of story, plot, or character, which is certainly true here, but he does have a strong visual flare he brings to all of his films, so they're never boring to look at, even if the materials is rather tepid. I'll be curious to see where this story goes following this film and plan to watch Part Two when it comes out, but I doubt REBEL MOON is definitely not going to be the next Star Wars.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The score is great, and some of the actors are a real treat for the eye, be it Sofia Boutella as beautiful main character Kora, or some of the impressively built male characters (like Dijon Hounsou and Stan Nair).But then my reservations. The story feels like we've seen it a dozen times before in this kind of epic galactic scifi movies: yet another universe with a dictatorial repressive central regime; myriads of downtrodden and exploited common people; and from the latter the rise of a resistance under the banner of some heroic messiah-like leader. It's Starwars, Dune and Foundation (to just name a few) all put in a blender.The writing felt lazy: by using a voice-over at the start of the movie I had within 5 minutes the impression that I had missed a prequel or an episode 0, pulling me into an already fast riding train. The search for the right resistance team-members felt rushed, skipping from one weird world to the next, giving the various characters hardly any depth or even motivation for their willingness to come along. The result is a succession of short anecdotical scenes without real substance.As to the acting: Sofia Boutella constantly has to keep up an almost frozen attitude, so there's hardly any room for her to shine; and Michiel Huisman sure has more potential than this role of a non-descript hanger-on. Ed Skrein does a good job as the (almost caricaturally) sadistic Atticus, but the rest of the cast is just adequate.Another annoying thing: the potentially interesting fighting scenes are all afflicted by a weird whim of the director, to vary within one scene from regular motion to slow, to slower than slow, and back to regular motion again. Who do you think to please with such mannerisms?!Anyway, maybe (as with the disappointing first episode of the new ""Dune"") this Part One mainly acts as an overture to the Real Thing in the expected Part Two. We'll wait and see, but for now I have my doubts.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Difficult... Because the movie is relatively entertaining and amusing, but by no means the smash hit you'd expect when Zack Snyder is at the helm.The story and everything around it is not very original. In fact, the screenwriters and Snyder have brazenly and cheekily borrowed from numerous SF and fantasy originals and even the 7 Ronins. And they don't even conceal it. Which of course makes everything somewhat predictable. But on the other hand: well stolen is half the battle. And it's still fun to watch.The movie is peppered with numerous stars, but (if you disregard Anthony Hopkins as Jimmy's voice) not stars of the absolute top league. More like the second division. Nonetheless, this second guard does their job quite well, even if they perhaps take themselves a little too seriously.So far, the movie has earned a 6 thanks to its entertainment value. I think that with the various loose ends that the first part left behind, there is still a lot to get out of the second part. There is certainly enough air to the top. Let's give it a second chance. But this second chance has to work....","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Destroyer of worlds - Thanos.""Daughter"" taken from a destroyed world - Thanos and Gamora.Tarak - if you think that Tarak sounds like a Dothraki then you'd be correct, because he played Qhono in GOT.The list goes on, you'll see that in the other reviews and because of that I generally found it a bit bland. I was quite hopeful for the bot storyline which may come in P2 and though that also feels quite predictable I was excited for it.

The characters you're not supposed to like, you don't like, the ones who you should like come off as (relatively) likable. And there are some truly amazing actors in this movie. The actors who fall down perhaps are getting bad direction, which is a shame.But the movie seems like a weird amalgamation of stuff from Warhammer 40,000, and other sources, et cetera et cetera. Neat ideas that, when forced together by an inept writer, come off very poorly. Coupled with that, the movie engages in a lot of flip-flopping on ""tell, don't show"" (the main character's backstory is a five minute infodump of stuff that could've been introduced as small details, and that you find your eyes glazing over at) or ""show, don't tell"" (such as Tarak's introduction, which is a five minute montage of physical prowess that your eyes will glaze over at).And, of course, we have a lot of very tired, over-used tropes.

I've enjoyed almost all of his films and this film is no exception. However, Rebel Moon definitely has its issues that bring it down from what could have been a great movie.We just didn't get too spend a lot of time with any of the characters except for the two leads. Everyone had interesting backstories, but we barely got to dive into any of them and didn't get to see much party banter. The amount of characters in the main party should have been halved to make more room for character moments.Also the structure of the story is a bit boring for the middle section. It's just speed running through new locations and gaining new characters for the party. We don't get to see any traveling and little to no time for characters to bond which just felt odd to me. Also most of them join way too easily. Literally one character joins after a one minute speech and that's it lmao.I also hated that it didn't really feel like an adventure. We just rush to new locale after new locale and don't get too see any party interaction. That's one thing Star Wars generally does well is build camaraderie with the party. We didn't really get to see anything like except for the two leads.And omg, Snyder over did it with the slow motion. I think this film could have been 15-20 mins shorter if there wasn't so much slow motion, it got annoying after a while!The positives is the beginning and ending that delivered on the setting and world building. I really liked the game village and the final fight. Each had some good character moments. The world and lore of the world is also very fascinating. There is no force in this, but there some magical powers in the world which has me curious.This felt like a film that could have easily been an 8 with some tweaking, but as it stands it's a 6/10 for me. It was an enjoyable watch though and I think the second film can be great now since the party is established.Also in a lot of ways, Jeremy Jahns is right by saying this felt like a (rushed) space JRPG.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But as soon as our bird guy entered the ship it turned into a horrible mush.One short scene after another with no connection, no depth, heart or soul. It felt as if they realized they run out of time/space, but had still soooo much to tell. So everything was shortened until all depth was gone.Also, the story is on rather weak legs. Cinematography top notch though.If you like a good picture over a good book you can stare 2h at beautiful scenes. Just don't forget to mute after 1/3.I for one will skip the next part of this.

The film boasts stunning visuals that transport you to a captivating universe, but it can't shake off the feeling of being somewhat derivative. Snyder's signature style shines through, but the narrative struggles at times with unnatural dialogues that feel forced.Despite its flaws, the movie remains a visual feast, with awe-inspiring cinematography that elevates certain sequences. Fans of Snyder's distinct aesthetic will revel in the spectacle, but those seeking a breakthrough in storytelling might find the film treading familiar ground. It's a rollercoaster of cinematic excitement, though not without its bumps along the way.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

He does not seem to fully accomplish this, as the result seems to be a well-technically structured tale, but one of those narrated to kids. The fact that the protagonists are in the center of destruction or action every time they travel to a new planet, makes it look more like a childish dream rather than a serious sci-fi.In addition, the choice to make it so, in order to appeal to a wider age range is for me inaproppriate, sacrificing the necessary realistic atmosphare.On the other end of the spectrum, the characters involved seem to have great room of evolvement and the story its self seems to have a natural flow, making the audience hold its breath for a sequel. Generally, the great condensation of time makes the director's work demanding and remarkably fragile.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

All together writing was bad, acting also, music was good but too much of it and not really following the scenes...

The Stone Quarry logo has never looked better! Rebel Moon has a dreamy retro-esque/80s feel to it thanks to Snyder's unique visual style which does allow more freedom for the VFX effects. The lense effect he has created works really well for this movie and gives us some truly incredible shots.For a budget of $80M, I thought part 1 looked incredible. The worlds we visit are beautiful, they look lived in and are populated by many unique & exotic aliens. I'm really excited to see how Snyder will expand on this in the extended cut and Part 2.I'm so happy for Sofia Boutella for her first leading role, she absolutely nailed this, she is Kora and Kora is a badass!! The cast is great, they have fantastic chemistry together. But again, I just can't wait to watch the extended cut to delve deeper into these characters, to spend more time with them and discover more about who they are.The violence was impactful, the fight scenes were awesome and the slowmotion was a welcome Snyder touch. The score was absolutely incredible, Tom Holkenborg is on fire again! The technology in this universe is something really special, it went beyond my expectations! I did think RM could have been 20 minutes longer though, just to let some scenes breathe a little and maybe extend some others.The elephant in the room... Star Wars. Tbh I'm so glad this movie isn't a Star Wars story, Rebel Moon is it's own thing and it is carving it's own path. I love the influence Star Wars has had on it but it's no more than the influence of Seven Samurai & Heavy Metal and when the R Rated cut drops it will increase the divide from SW even further.Overall Rebel Moon: Part 1: A Child Of Fire is a fantastic entry into a brand new franchise with a rich universe full of interesting characters and deep lore that I am excited to explored further. Snyder has created something truly unique here and I can't wait to see what more Rebel Moon has to offer.","47 out of 122 found this helpful.

Why is it so hard for others?""I will admit, not much of this film struck me as ""original"". But that didn't keep me from enjoying it! I really enjoyed watching the character interactions, and the exposition isn't riveting but it works well enough. I think this first movie (I hope) is just setting the stage for more action, more intense conflict, and more investment in the characters and plot. Introducing a big cast and having each person feel unique and alive is difficult, but I think RMP1 did a good job at it.Overall, if you're a fantasy connoisseur, you could skip this. If you're a more casual fan, and get really attached to characters, I think this would be a good watch for you.","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

I do not agree with the ridiculously low ratings.There's some interesting ideas and some scenes are beautifully apocalyptic. It's eye candy all the time, though they could have taken a chill pill on the slowmo. The story is interesting and the acting is good. There's some issues with the script though. Like others said, a lot of sentences are weirdly written but not to the point that it irritates me. I loved the atmosphere/vibe of this movie. A new mashup universe of Star Wars, GOT and the Matrix was created and I think it's a great base for sequel(s).I'm not a professional in moviemaking but I can't wrap my head around these ratings. How a cringefest like Stranger Things gets an 8.9 while this gets a 5.7 is beyond me. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. It's not even great. But to me it was an entertaining, unexpected surprise on my netflix account.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Does the possession of visual elements alone suffice to elevate it to the echelons of profound cinematic art, or is there an imperative for a narrative depth that authentically engages the audience?The opening sequence, featuring Anthony Hopkins' exposition-laden voice-over, beckons an assessment of its efficacy. Does this approach effectively captivate the audience, or does it risk consigning crucial details to the recesses of forgetfulness? Can the pronounced emphasis on names, places, and temporal intricacies be perceived as compensatory for narrative shortcomings, thereby limiting the audience's immersive experience?Broader scrutiny of contemporary entertainment prompts consideration of the prevailing dichotomy between depth and superficiality in narrative execution. Are discerning viewers increasingly confronted with a dearth of substance beneath the veneer of cinematic experiences? Is the intrinsic nature of entertainment evolving toward narratives that pivot on experiential engagement rather than reliance on mere exposition?The scrutiny extends to the directorial prowess of ZS, prompting a re-evaluation of his acclaimed credentials. Does the absence of compelling storytelling in this instance cast a shadow on his perceived abilities? Is the laudable exception, 'Day of the Dead,' more indicative of collaborative success than the sole merit of the director?Turning attention to Netflix's role as an arbiter of content, questions emerge regarding the platform's pursuit and discernment. Does the platform's voracious appetite compromise qualitative considerations? Is there an apparent indifference to nuances that differentiate mere visual stimulation from genuine artistic expression?In conclusion, the plea for ZS to contemplate an exit from the industry is juxtaposed with the metaphorical image of a sunlit deck chair-a symbol of respite from the demands of the cinematic milieu. The assertion that 'no one will miss' is presented as a contemplative acknowledgement, suggesting a detachment from the film maker's contributions and a recognition of the industry's potential evolution beyond his influence.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

The storyline progresses at a brisk pace, which, while keeping the excitement up, can sometimes feel a bit rushed. The film is a thrill ride of action and battle scenes that are sure to entertain fans of high-octane cinema. The cast delivers mostly strong performances, bringing depth and intensity to their roles. However, the portrayal of the farmer character leaves something to be desired and detracts slightly from an otherwise stellar ensemble. Overall, ""Rebel Moon"" is a commendable film, and with a bit more character development, especially for the farmer, it could rise to new heights. Definitely worth watching for its visual spectacle and energetic action sequences!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I have not been a fan of Disney's acquisition and destruction of such a beloved franchise with the most recent trilogy. Apparently neither was Snyder. He said in an interview that he wanted to make a Star Wars trilogy but the Disney execs shunned his pitch. So, he decided to make his own ""Star Wars"" film. This film has elements of Star Wars in it obviously with the ""laser swords"" and the ships going into space. But it also reminds me of the Chronicles of Riddick, Flash Gordon, and Serenity. I guess I consider it a nice substitute to a troubled Star Wars franchise and I'm perfectly okay with that. With that being said, the reason for my score and why I didn't rank it higher was because some of the fight sequences were not as fluid as I would have liked. Lighting and CGI was great and I really liked the brutality of the bad guy. Dialog between protagonists was a little boring at times and some scenes I feel could have been left out to help with the progression of the movie but overall I think Snyder did an impressive job under the circumstances.

Like Dutch director Paul Verhoeven, he uses right wing themes and subverts them. Unfortunately unlike Verhoeven, his work lacks the black humour that is needed.Snyder acquired a right wing fan base for his blockbuster hit 300. However anyone who knows anything about graphic book author Alan Moore,a left wing Anarchist. Snyder made a rather faithful adaptation of Watchmen.Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire has Netflix backing. It has been said this is Snyder's attempt to create a Star Wars type universe.It basically is The Seven Samurai. It self remade by Hollywood as The Magnificent Seven. Later remade by B movie maestro Roger Corman as Battle Beyond the Stars.Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) of the militaristic Imperium arrives on the backwater moon of Veldt. He warmly embraces the village head offers to buy the surplus grain of these agrarian villagers. Noble then kills their head when he is perceived to be lying.Noble would arrive in 10 weeks time and wants the bulk of the harvest even it means the villagers would be left starving.Kora (Sofia Boutella) has her own backstory with the Imperium. She warns the villagers they will either starve to death or be massacred by the Imperium. Kora and a villager called Gunnar depart for the port town of Providence to recruit warriors to defend them.Like Starship Troopers when a major character later wore a Nazi uniform and the audience seemed not to have noticed. Noble arrives wearing one from nhis grand entrance. A sign that the interstellar empire of the Motherworld are not the good guys. This is reinforced when some of the Imperium soldiers left behind are nasty white guys with South African accents. A nod back to the country's Apartheid era.Snyder does not do subtle and with a female action lead. This was always going to turn off part of the audience just like the Daisy Ridley led Star Wars sequel trilogy.Although there is a longer Director's Cut of this movie due. Rebel Moon - Part One could had done with being shorter and snappier. It needed more humour but I found it entertaining enough.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

That was my reaction several times throughout this film, and not in a good way.Within the first minute I was already dreading it, as the opening narration mentioned some generic ruling star empire where ""a thousand kings ruled uninterrupted"", which is a lot like a chain-smoking fat man with a drinking problem saying he's going to live to be 150. Or maybe it's just being cheeky and there were actually hundreds of kings ruling over the course of a couple of years, being constantly deposed or assassinated every few days.This bothered me because this felt like a lazy foundation from which to start a whole new science fiction universe, and my feeling was correct.This movie spends its first hour just on worldbuilding, except that the world it's building is bland and boring. This could easily be transplanted into Star Wars or Warhammer or any other major franchise and almost nothing would have to be changed. And this isn't in a good ""timeless classic"" way like the story of Seven Samurai (an obvious inspiration) is.Instead it's because the story's setting is so empty it's like a blank scifi RPG template was picked and Zack Snyder never actually bothered to fill out any of the details.There's tons of comparisons made by reviewers to Star Wars, and the knowledge that apparently this was originally meant to be a Star Wars film that Disney passed on (a rare Disney W). Any resemblance to Star Wars is purely superficial; there's almost nothing here.The original ""Star Wars"" had a similar initial setup of a big evil empire and a plucky band of rebels building up a resistance against them. As well, it had many different things and people happening around it, references made to things, people, and events that clearly were important to the world we were seeing, like Obi-Wan, the Clone Wars, the Jedi being defenders of the Republic, the Force, Jabba, the Imperial Senate, all these things were brought up in the very first film and treated with a sense of having some very clear importance to the story as a whole.There's nothing like that here beyond the absolute bare minimum of words to fill it in. The ""Imperium"" rules from its ""Motherworld"". They were ruled by kings, then their last king was assassinated and an evil psychopath named Balisarius took over or something. Now they are cartoonishly evil and they literally rape and murder and destroy entire planets for no clear reason. They raped murdered and destroyed Kora's planet and kidnapped her as a kid to raise her as a soldier for the Imperium until she deserted.That's it. That's pretty much the entirety of Rebel Moon's world that it took 45 minutes to set up.Without anything else to it, you'd imagine there would be some interesting characters or wild action scenes to entertain with, but there aren't. Everyone has the same sort of bland flattened affect of an RPG NPC waiting for you to level up enough to unlock their backstory sidequest. Some of them don't even seem to have names until many scenes later when another character mentions their name out loud.None of the action scenes are in any way memorable or exciting, as at best they could be described as shot ""functionally"", except apparently Zack Snyder's gimmick is random slow motion, there's constant instances where the action will suddenly go into slow motion for no reason.The slow motion didn't bother me as much as it apparently does other people. What did bother me was how the camera kept randomly unfocusing during scenes, blurring for no reason, or suddenly going into a sort of fisheye lens appearance, or one shot of Kora and The Farmer Whose Name I Forgot, where suddenly the Farmer's face started to blur while Kora's remained sharp and in focus.All of this would be laughable if the entire film itself weren't so BORING. Pretty much everyone looks and sounds miserable, even in scenes they're supposed to be feeling triumphant in, and the only actor who seems to be putting any real effort into their work is Ed Skrein, which is somewhat amusing because ten years ago he played Daario Naharis in season 3 of Game of Thrones and then was replaced by Michiel Huisman (also in this film) because supposedly they didn't think his acting skills would've been up to par for what they had planned with Daario later on (which turned out to be mostly nothing).If you told me this was a film that was written, directed, photographed, and edited all by first timers, I would believe you. It has almost no redeeming features unless you are the kind of person who likes looking at flashing lights and sweaty people, in which case there are plenty of other movies that have that that aren't as BORING as this.","25 out of 59 found this helpful.

At this point in cinema history everything can be compared to something already done and it's unfair, so let's just look at Rebel Moon in isolation.Firstly, it looks cool and there has been a lot of effort put in to that end, so we'll done on that. Unfortunately party of the attempt to look cool is doing endless slo motion of things that really don't require it to add to the spectacle. Jumping on to the griffin thing, great! Only happens once so let's give it a sweet slow mo. Every other time a gun gets fired? Nope, seen it a million times, adds nothing to the scene, just let it run. There is likely more spectacle in a well choreographed fight scene at full speed than drawing out a 20 second fight to 2 minutes by slowing everything down. That time spent in slow mo could have been used for something important, which brings me to my next point...Character Development, it's not just a term to make people sound clever in reviews, it's there to make you care for the character, in a positive or negative light. That way when the good guy succeeds you feel joy along with them, when the bad guy gets beaten you enjoy it maybe a little too much but hey, we are all human. If you don't develop characters to have history and feelings and values then we end up with a long collections of people just passing through, and that is what happened here unfortunately. There are attempts to make characters appear noble by giving them the Braveheart moment, but without earning that moment it feels hollowed and is easily dismissed with no emotional impact. It also means when the apparent good guys die there is no impact here either. It's tough to care about the life or death of someone who don't know because you haven't been given the chance to, like a fatal car crash on the news, you know it's tragic from a human standpoint, but you are detached from the emotion of it.Making Evil people SUPER EVIL with no reason except for them being part of the evil empire has a similar but inverse effect. I want to care that the bad guy got defeated but it feels more like putting down a rabid animal than defeating a nemesis. It was sort of just an end to a process than a battle of morals or defiance, it just feels empty and lazy. May as well put 2 people in a room and say ""that one is good and that one is bad"" and expect us to care who wins based on concept rather than emotion.The standard of acting was frankly not of a high calibre. That may be unfair given the level of dialog they had to work with, but you can at least deliver it like you care. The film really could have benefitted from some star power but sadly, no.Lastly the music is epic, but as the scene does not hit the emotional note for an operatic swelling of strings it just feels overblown, like playing the lord of the rings music over a visual of someone parking their car. It happens so often it becomes a parody by the end, well, the end of this part at least.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Action, Sci Fi, Space..I am in.Giant spaceships, ominous shadows, a young hero, a grizzled warrior, excessive use of slo mo. Trademarks of a Snyder film. But, it felt empty and the story segments felt disjointed. The characters are not believable.Star Wars, Harry Potter (Hippogriff), Doctor Who (Rachnoss), Seven Samurai, Wild Wild West and Spaghetti Westerns. Put those in a blender, take out character development/emotions and you get Rebel Moon. Interesting idea, horrific execution.6/10 for the hype. Definitely one of the movies of all time.

In case you are dumb or drunk one of the underextended cast talks it through every 5 minutes. Sadly it isn't even smart enough to acknowledge the spoof, like Guardians of the Galaxy does so well. The opening set was too close to Norsemen (a comedy) to get away with playing it straight. The character added to please the China market is so painful I had to pop the kettle on.

But between the 2, this is the better version. It's like comparing Dune (1984) to Dune: Part One (2021) -- but no where near the caliber of Dune: Part One (2021).Though there's a part 2 coming soon, the final fight before the ending did feel like a lackluster.However it has good production value, good effects, decent world and character building, but its periodic slow pace and the 300 (2006) slow motion action was distracting.If Zack Snyder were simply the writer and producer while bringing in -- say -- JJ Abrams, John Woo, George Miller, or somebody with their own personal touch that's compatible with Zack Snyder's story, the this could have easily by an 8/10 rather 6-6.5/10.A possible 9 if James Cameron, Christopher Nolan if he doesn't mind CGI, or Denis Villeneuve if they directed.But when compared to Battle Beyond the Stars (1980) and most of the live action Star Wars movies -- since this was originally conceived as an R-rated Star Wars spinoff -- I'd say behind The Last Jedi (2017), but WELL above the prequels, well above The Rise of Skywalker (2019), well above Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), and on par with The Force Awakens (2015) and Return of the Jedi (1983).And above Battle Beyond the Stars (1980).","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I have seen all of the movies but by no means do I identify with these films. That being said, Rebel Moon is the most fun I've had watching a SW movie since Rogue One. If you enjoy Zack Snyder's films, his cinematic touch is all over this movie. Also nice homage to the Seven Samurai.I do feel the story is rushed, as is typical in a ""lets put a crew together"" style of storytelling. That being said, I cared about the characters and I am excited to see what happens to them in the sequel. I did find some of the accents & delivery odd to the degree to made me laugh but that simply is what it is. Overall, I wish it had been 30 minutes longer to not seem rushed but appreciated the care shown in some scenes to make the moments feel real & lived in. For a SW Netflix flick, I give it a 8/10, a 6 is watchable, 7 is fun, but an 8 means I'd gladly watch it again.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's like a patchwork of different ancient classic movie plots, characters and visuals, never inventing much on its own. There is the basic seven samurai plotline, the evil totalitarian imperium (visuals having even a likeness to wh40k in addition to it copying the star wars imperium extensively) , the rebels with their gang -punkish esthetics, blade runner/mad max makeup included. Of course there must be high-tech flaming swords, and planet killing spaceships. On top of all this there is a version of the scene from Avatar(only missing the blue skin), taming a flying beast which has no true relevance to the plot, as well as the fight against a giant spider creature, like scifi-LOTR with the typical ninja character with light sabers - again with little relevance to the plot. Did I mention the is a han solo - esque character, c3po's soldier version with the same Jeeves-y accent, and a cantina full of obnoxious space criminals?However, trying hard not to pre-empt all plot twists, I managed to find enjoyment in the epic visuals the movie offers, with special reference to gun effects - for once sci-fi blasters didn't look or sound like peashooters. Forget there is a plot and consider this as a well made popcorn movie, not much more but not any less either.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Does if have flashes of cinematic wonder? Absolutely! The gems peppered throughout thrill me on the tenth viewing as much as the first. So that is what makes this something to savor over time and to come back to so often.It has intent! Zack Snyder intent and the ability translate it onto the screen. When SW lost most all its heart in its reimagining, Rebel Moon wore much of its heart right on its sleeve and did so with audacity. Some speak of wooden dialog or varying effects but miss the point as when Kora makes her will known it reigns down in a wrath of badass that will soon define all of the characters to be recruited into her quest of service. From there the deeds and the situations get very thick. I am always pulled into this ride no matter what and its one part visual feast and one part dreaded march to oblivion. Many miss that point. What never wavers though is this vision of audacity that drives the entire film. Even minor characters flaunt it and though you know they wont survive getting in Kora and company's way, they are never the less very dangerous and bring maximum effort to the story.All the cast brings what all I can describe as ""flavor"" to this journey that keeps things interesting even if not all that unpredictable or verbose. Then comes the gems that make me smile everytime. The crown flowers for the battle robot, the reaching of Kora's fingertips to feel the feathers of the Chimera. These gems of which there are many win over the cinephile in me to love this film more than I did at first.That's some of the movie magic. Of course as many have said what they do with the second part of this story will make or break it in a bigger sense of the word but to be quite honest will in no way ruin my gradually built admiration for the first film alone.And in that there is a wee bit of movie making brilliance.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The worst thing about these failed, uninspired and over budgeted monstrosities is they likely kill off any chance of filming some of the actually fantastic sci-fi book series published in the last 30 years.I don't know what they can do so save part 2 from flopping...but I do know I won't be wasting any effort to watch it as anything but noisy background viewing in the shop.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's not bad at all! Story is decent, actors are good, photo is great and the effects are good. They even did a good job of making the heroine's fighting scenes believable. First half is better than the last but the last half is not bad either. Normally I would give this a strong 6, cause I am stingy with my ratings but I am giving it a 7 to balance all the unwarranted bad ratings. Totally worth watching!

The characters are beyond hollow, the story feels like an AI attempt at mashing together star wars and the chronicles of Riddick. The movie jumps so quickly to fulfill all the well trodden beats of exactly what you would expect but forgets to give life to its tale. I went in with low expectations and this fell short of those. The CGI is also wildly inconsistent some scenes seem like mediocre work from a 2008 movie while others pass as bare minimum acceptable for 2020. This whole project feels unfinished and poorly crafted.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The effects are beautiful and I like the mash up of old meets new technology. The cast is good and storyline is pretty basic and easy to follow.

Nothing was going on. It was just her taking one step while bullets going in the background... just what!!?Also the script is bad. I think the problem is that Zack do not treat his characters like human beings... they are just playthings to make cool moments and plot to go forward.Like the shirtless dude who just ride an animal and left the animal there!? I was waiting for a guardians of the galaxy 3 moments (when Quill did a smart deception), but it never came... it just a straight Harry Potter's scene with the Hippogrift.

If you like the intro of Dune, you will like how they introduce the different planets and people around the galaxy. This is something that many sci-fi movies lack these days, the lack of details besides the main story. This part one will open new doors for a saga. The movie overall is underrated.

I'm completely in for this new story-it feels lived in for a long time, the characters are interesting, and he's earned the right to be as extravagant as he wants. This feels like extravagant sci-fi like George Lucas imagined in the 70s. But it doesn't land. Hopefully, doesn't land YET. I'm curious to see how the story continues/ends in Part 2. Maybe it will feel less rushed over two films. Knowing that this was going to be a Star Wars film originally... I kinda wish it was Star Wars. The new IP isn't interesting enough on its own at this point, but imagining it as Old Republic or post-Sequel Trilogy would make this film fit where Zach wanted it to fit, I think.

I would like to see more stuff like this, not less.Pros -
1. Visually stunning, worthy of a big screen.2. Plenty of homages to favorites of various genres. The main plot is loosely based on Seven Samurai. The planet where the story begins seems like a Norse village out of the Sagas. The soldiers from the ""Motherworld"" have a Warhammer 40K aesthetic. There are other visual elements evocative of H R Giger or cyberpunk and various other genres.3, Ensemble cast of some very good actors from all over the world.4. The action sequences are excellent in typical Zack Snyder style.5. A fascinating world and possibility of lore with lot of potential.Cons -1. The movie is extremely short, even for the first half of a duology. Every other problem is related to this.2. The story is very simplistic to the point of being insubstantial.3. No time given for character development (except for the lead protagonist), to understand their motivations or justify their actions. It feels like the second season of a TV show.4. Lot of interesting characters and concepts and worlds are barely touched upon. The pacifist robots, the fallen king, and magic princess, the dispossessed talking spiders etc. Perhaps the sequel will expand on some of it, but another short movie can not possibly be enough. We needed some good 10-20 episodes.5. The downside of so many homages is that a lot of things seem overly familiar.6. An animated production would have suited this tale much better instead of a CGI-laden live-action. Practical effects are more in vogue these days than CGI. No matter how fanciful the CGI action is, it is hard to compete with, say, a short hexagenerian with an apparent death wish doing his own stunts flying fighter planes and jumping off cliffs.And finally, I really wish both critics and average audiences would stop complaining how every new fantasy production is not Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings, or every new sci-fi one is not like the older Star Wars / Star Trek or The Expanse. Yes, they were masterpieces, but it does not mean we have constantly prove our love for them by turning our noses up at everything else that does not meet their lofty standards. There is plenty of room for glorious silly nonsense like this. Give us more, you hear, Netflix? Try to make them a bit more substantial perhaps.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I kept expecting it to get better, but it didn't. If this was a comic book and I was twelve I probably would read it...but not for over two hours. The thing is, there were obvious storyline parallels to the Magnificent Seven and other movies...but nothing original at all. The whole movie felt under developed and it missed the opportunity to make some very detailed development to the main characters. Where the heck did the robot go? Would this because there is a part two? I guess so, but it left me with a very dissatisfied feeling.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But I suspect that was because I had no expectations of it.There are a lot of negative reviews about the plot. I find this a little confusing as the entire storyline is made up of elements from other quite successful films. Basically it is ""The Magnificent Seven,"" (and by implication ""The Seven Samurai,"") combined with an awful lot of Star Wars as well as a fair bit of ""Inglorious B*sterds"" and executed in the style of Warhammer 40k.On the upside, the fight scenes are quite engaging if somewhat stylised (but far better than anything Ridley Scott could come up with). The villains are truly villainous and the heroes are really hard. And it's quite nice to know that the Ulster accent has survived to spread across the galaxy...Frankly it's entertaining and really not worth the slagging off of some of the two star reviews. Some people have marked it down for being simplistic; while others have done so for it being incoherent. Well, it can't be both!I believe there is a herd mentality which sometimes kicks in amongst reviewers of trying to outdo each other in terms of negativity regardless of the standard of the movie in reality. In actuality, ""Rebel Moon,"" no worse than many graphic novels - and a damn sight better than a lot of superhero movies.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Despite a fine cast it's dire, thanks to Synder, Kurt Johnstad & Shay Hatten thoughtlessly stuffing their dull, formulaic script with as many historic & genre themes as possible. Sofia Boutella (deserving SO much better) is a Skywalker-esque rebel who with the likes of Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou, Corey Stoll & the voice of Anthony Hopkins, battles an evil empire personified by Ed Skrein (an excellent baddie). To call it 'Stars Wars'-lite doesn't even come close to describing what a pathetic rip-off it is. Contemptible.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The negative reviews are entirely based on flawed expectations. Don't eat a burger and then complain because you wanted filet mignon. This is a hella good burger!What It Is
Popcorn flick, heroic science-fantasy (NOT science fiction, but fantasy), eye-candy, easy-going EntertainmentWhat It Is Not
Hyper-realistic, hyper-dramatic, deeply emotional, plot-twist heavy, oscar worthy character study, gritty fantasyI'm not sure that I've ever enjoyed a Zack Snyder film before. These days I typically skip them. I was in a sci-fantasy mood so I gave this a shot. I went in having seen 0 trailers. I was blown away.The Good:
Lots of fun characters. Assembling the crew feels like assembling a D&D party. If you've ever played a TTRPG this film should be right up your alley. I struggle to see why anyone would complain about the characters. Then again, the complaining people just seem miserable anyway!Cool locations. I really enjoyed the designs of the planets and cities. Obviously there is inspiration from other media and yet there are many original spins and angles too. That's the beauty of iteration in art. Watching this inspired me to go and do some of my own worldbuilding. I am saddened for those who couldn't allow themselves to be inspired in some way.Fun creatures. I love that fantasy elements are incorporated. This is NOT science fiction. It's science-fantasy. One review complained ""I just want good science fiction"". Your expectations are flawed, not this film.Great costume and set designs. Really liked the blend of cultural influences throughout. Hope to see much more, especially the non euro-fantasy aspects.Entertaining fight choreography. The somewhat excessive slow mo is obv cheesy but it actually works quite well in that you can see what's going on and notice little details, which is a pleasant break from some of the shaky cam, rapid cut choreography we get in a lot of films. I had to chuckle at a certain flag related slow mo shot but the rest of it never broke my immersion. The first fight scene in particular I thought was done really well. Unlike many films, the dynamic of the fight actually makes sense (as opposed to 12 enemies waiting to attack one by one, or charging in rather than shooting from distance, they fought fairly realistically... for a heroic fantasy, anyway. This is not a realistic war movie, so expectations are not geared for that)Pacing. I never got bored at any point in the film, but there were ample opportunities to breathe as well. Excellent pacing, one of the film's strongest qualitiesPassable Acting. I have no idea why so many people are talking as if these were the worst acting performances of all time. First of all some characters are written to be caricatures. For example, the soldiers. Their acting fulfilled that to a tee. If you don't like that, you are in the wrong genre. The characters with more depth, such as the protagonist and her allies, were played with complete competence. If anything, some of the dialogue could have been a bit smoother, but it never reached a point where I lost immersion. And you don't watch this kind of blockbuster fantasy popcorn flick expecting hyper-poetic dialogue and Oscar worthy, deeply emotional dramatic performances. THAT IS NOT THE TYPE OF MOVIE BEING MADE SO DONT JUDGE FOR THOSE TYPE OF QUALITIES. You wouldn't say a football player is a poor athlete because they can't bowl 300, would you? Well, clearly some of these reviewers probably would, but they'd be wrong.Overall Visuals. Who tf complained about the gryphon? It looked excellent. The visuals were top notch in every aspect of this film. Solid CGI, effects, lighting, etc. Perfectly fit the vibes of the film.Score. I honestly didn't notice the music too much, so it was neither a strong positive or negative pointThe Negatives
Slightly Predictable.Without giving any spoilers, most of the plot points could be easily predicted if you're even mildly aware of fantasy tropes. Is that a problem though? NOPE. Unless you somehow convinced yourself you were going to be watching shutter island? This is not a film that needs super slick plot twists. The plot that occurred was good enough for the popcorn flick this aims to be, but it isn't the selling point of the movie, that's for sureDialogue
Same thing here, pretty standard popcorn flick dialogue. A few lines on the cheesier side, actually a few very decent lines as well though.The Villains
I do absolutely feel the villains were a bit weak. Yes, the most visible of them is extremely despicable, but almost to a degree that it feels like too low hanging of fruit, even for a trope heavy heroic fantasy epic. Some of the secondary villains were a lot more intriguing than the main antagonist, though. I hope the villains improve in the second half overall.Underused Characters
A few characters are introduced that don't get utilized to the degree I personally hoped for, but that's a subjective opinion and there's also a second part plus the possibility of a franchise. Plenty of opportunity to see more!","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

I had a hard time buying into the plot of a small, medieval farming village with a small band of rebels going to war against an advanced, planet destroying tyrant overlord. 9/10's of the story is missing. The Rebel Moon story is too simplistic, like the writers were too lazy to build a universe with factions, allies, and all the other ingredients you need for a good underdog story.There's very little imagination. Rebel Moon relies too much on CGI in an attempt to dazzle viewers. The costumes were dreadful. The antagonists are literally dressed like WWII German fascists, right down to 40's era neckties and suspenders. The Dreadnaught Class Star Destroyer looks remarkably similar to a WWII era submarine. Fantastical beasts on different worlds are just horses with a goofy helmet. And different species are ripped right from other movies, like an alien race whiich are just Orcs who stepped off the LOTR set, and another species which is nearly identical to.the Twi'lek in the Star Wars franchise.Not sure what Netflix's goal is. Rebel Moon is a lazy, bare minimum effort film that pretty much rips off other films. It uses too much CGI in an attempt to trick viewers they are watching a premium Hollywood film. It's a modern Spaghetti Western where it's cheap, easy to produce, and its only goal is to make a quick buck.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The opening few minutes by themselves are worth seeing, as we are introduced to heroine Kora (Sofia Boutella), living amidst vast scenery on a moon around a huge Saturn-like planet filling the sky. Many later scenes show off Snyder's characteristic obsession with dark, brooding lighting and apocalyptic settings. In its own way, this is all sort of fascinating.It's all very watchable, but the whole problem is that even with stuff to look at, you still need to have a story to tell. All these impressive visuals, and the plot such as it is, are deployed at the service of scenes of extended violence and combat that seem to be just there as set pieces. And as lots of others have already said, this part of it is pretty derivative -- there are elements of Star Wars, of course (a plucky band of rebels against a huge Evil Empire), but also feels from Avatar, Tarzan, Game of Thrones, and other fantasy/sf adventures. It also doesn't help that the basic premise doesn't make a lot of sense: Kora's plan for fighting the Empire and its millions of soldiers is to gather a little rogue band of specialist fighters who can then do (something-or-other) to semi magically bring everything down. Of course it all has to finish up with scenes of hand-to-hand combat that go on and on in great detail. It seems like these scenes are the director's real interest. The main cast has several familiar names, and they all do OK, but most of the time they have little to work with except to keep the action going.If only Snyder would turn over the scripting and storyboarding to someone else. As Ursula LeGuin said, if there's nothing going on but unceasing physical action, it's a sure sign that no story is being told. For me, Snyder's most complete accomplishment is still ""Watchmen"" (2009), which is also pretty dystopian but has his best combination of plot, characters, and visuals.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Alas, this is a new series of its own that fails to make an impact.First of all, the story is too predictable. It feels like the script was written by choosing a handfull of space tropes and utilizes all of them. However, as the movie focuses more on the action scenes, which feel old and overused, there is no growth, no time for the audience to get to know the characters or even care for them, hence the twists had no impact.So, overall, two out of ten, for the performances mainly.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Slow MOs, potentially strong characters languishing in muddled and predictable story lines. Too bad most of the ideas and development of the story behind it (what little there is) is stolen from so many different movies. Darth Vader, Rae, Han Solo and so many more copycats. Even a couple of light sabers. Great cast but it goes down hill from there. The sets and CG are pretty good but you can tell it's all digital backgrounds. It looks as though they used the Volume to film it. I'm sure Netflix is proud but they shouldn't be.

Other than that, the movie lacks of originality in every department, leaving you wondering if you have actually watched parts of it before or if it's simply that predictable.Rebel Moon suffers first and foremost from really atrocious writing. The main plot is a collection of cliches of the genre, with a main protagonist forming the resistance against a tyrannical intergalactic empire. Unfortunately, that only becomes worse once you realise that the film spends most of the time jumping from planet to planet, introducing ""unique"" individuals who join the battle, but never allows room for character development or slow moments where we get to meet or relate to them. Once they board the spaceship, we never hear from them again. As a result, no matter what happens later in the film, viewers are left apathetic towards whatever outcome.I won't go into detail of how terrible the dialogue was, because that was truly hard to watch, but at least the actors tried their best to inject some life into their characters. Personally, I didn't find any stand-out performances aside from Ed Skrein, whose portrayal of Noble perfectly captured the cold and malicious nature of his character.All in all, don't expect to watch Rebel Moon and be inspired to investigate further into its story. It's as shallow and unoriginal as most reviewers describe it. If there's nothing else to watch, well, it's there.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

He later changed it to an ""original"" universe where he then went on to borrow way too much from other great stories but without giving us (the viewers) anything to attach ourselves to. The traces of the Star Wars Empire was all too close visually for us to even attempt to assume otherwise. The ""small village who gets -insert any amount of time- to farm rice, I mean grain, to the bad guys before they kill everyone""-plot is something that is seen not only in the greatest film of all time but in many other stories since. And that's OK. There nothing new under the sun. But if a director/writers wants the audience to feel and care for the characters there can't be a 2 minute recruitment of the mightiest war general the universe has ever known. All of these warriors lack soul and personality. I couldn't care two pennies if any of them died, and I didn't.I'm a big 300 fan, which is why I knew that Znyder's effects and music would take a centre stage in this movie and that is what makes me rate it 5/10. And don't get me wrong, the actors (most of them) did a good job, which is part of why I was so excited to see this film.This should have been a series. Everything is far too rushed. There's no build up. I'm sad because I really thought this would be something good.

Despite its stunning visuals, the film disappoints in its depth and character development, leaving viewers with a sense of unfulfilled potential.From the outset, ""Rebel Moon"" promises an epic adventure. The film's setting, a dystopian future where the galaxy is under the tyrannical rule of a dark overlord, sets the stage for what could have been a compelling narrative. However, the plot quickly unravels into a series of disjointed scenes, lacking the cohesive storyline necessary to engage the audience fully. The narrative, which attempts to weave together multiple subplots, feels fragmented, leaving the viewer struggling to connect with the overarching theme of rebellion and freedom.The lack of depth in ""Rebel Moon"" is most apparent in its treatment of the central conflict. The rebellion against the overlord, a classic trope in science fiction, is presented in a cursory manner, with little exploration of the motivations and backstories of the key players involved. The film misses an opportunity to delve into the complexities of rebellion, such as the moral ambiguities and the personal sacrifices involved. Instead, it opts for a more superficial portrayal, reducing what could have been a nuanced exploration of rebellion to a simple good-versus-evil narrative.Moreover, the character development in ""Rebel Moon"" is sorely lacking. The protagonist, portrayed as a reluctant hero thrust into the role of a leader, is a character archetype that has been seen countless times in the genre. Unfortunately, the film does little to add depth or originality to this character, making it difficult for the audience to empathize or connect with their journey. The supporting characters suffer from similar issues, with many of them reduced to mere caricatures. The villain, in particular, is a one-dimensional character, lacking the complexity and depth that could have made them a truly memorable antagonist.Despite these narrative shortcomings, ""Rebel Moon"" shines in its visual presentation. Snyder, known for his visually stunning films, does not disappoint in this regard. The film is a visual spectacle, with breathtaking landscapes, intricate set designs, and state-of-the-art special effects. The action sequences are choreographed with precision, offering a sensory overload that is both exhilarating and awe-inspiring. The use of color and lighting creates a vivid and immersive world that captivates the viewer, drawing them into the universe of ""Rebel Moon.""The cinematography in ""Rebel Moon"" is another area where the film excels. Each frame is meticulously crafted, with a keen eye for detail that elevates the visual storytelling. The camera work is fluid and dynamic, enhancing the action sequences and adding an element of sophistication to the film. The visual aesthetics of ""Rebel Moon"" are undoubtedly its strongest asset, showcasing Snyder's skill as a visual artist.In conclusion, ""Rebel Moon"" is a film that struggles to balance its stunning visuals with a compelling narrative. While it succeeds in creating a visually arresting cinematic experience, it falls short in delivering a story with depth and well-developed characters. The film feels like a missed opportunity, a spectacle that dazzles the eyes but fails to engage the heart and mind. For fans of Snyder's work and lovers of science fiction, ""Rebel Moon"" offers a feast for the eyes but leaves much to be desired in its storytelling.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

None of the characters have any story creation and join the 'team' with barely any understanding as to why. The rushed nature of the film reminded me of GoT season 8. Should have been 3 parts with better writing and acting needed.If you want a supremely basic sci-fi action film then you should watch this. If you want something original with good acting and a story line worth your time then go watch Dune. In fact that is exactly what this is, a poor man's Dune merged with Star Wars.

If you love his unique style and his ability to create visually stunning and action-packed films, you won't be disappointed. Don't let the poor critic reviews discourage you (they are shilling for Disney).Sofia Boutella's performance was truly surprising and emotionally impactful. Her portrayal of the character was nothing short of badass. She brought such depth and intensity to the role, and I was completely captivated by her on-screen presence.The score in ""Rebel Moon"" was so powerful and really added to the emotional impact of the movie. It's a shame that the film had to be cut down by Netflix. I'm really looking forward to seeing the director's cut when it comes out. I bet it'll give us even more insight into the story and characters.I totally see the potential for ""Rebel Moon"" to become a new franchise like Star Wars for our generation.","43 out of 119 found this helpful.

Snyder has proved that he is a bad writer and reminds me of Dan Weiss and David Beniof, the notorious hacks who murdered Game of Thrones because of their incompetence.A mess is a mess, even if it's beautiful to look at.PSI just found out that the Part 2 has already been produced and will release in April.

Naturally, this was about the point that the (oh so very cartoonish) bad guys showed up. That got me to decide, ""at least there's some action, inbound, I'll give it to the 45m mark.""I shouldn't have bothered. A movie that starts off with more narrator exposition than Dune 1984 is warning sign number one of what's to follow. Given that the exposition laid out a storyline that was, at best, derivative would be another warning.The casting was a who's who of ""I know that guy"" and ""we cast this guy because we could afford the guy he looks like"" actors struggling to deliver lifeless dialogue.The arrival of the bad guys didn't improve things. To call them one-dimensional is to credit them with more character development than they deserve. Skrein's character was, to be charitable, cartoonish. And while they could have gone camp with it, they chose not to. It felt like he was there to collect a paycheck and get off screen as soon as possible. His henchmen were even less well conceived: like ""what awful things can we have these guys do, for no logical reason, to these peaceful, weaponless villagers to show everyone how bad these guys are as quickly as possible so we can move the story quickly onwards""It was not long after they were dispatch and the hero's journey had begun - and with zero increase in pacing, urgency or credible story development or acting that I decided to see what else might be available.I shudder to think how ponderous a ""not edited to fit into two-ish hours"" version of this might be.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

I hate seeing futuristic sci-fi movies mix advanced technologies vs pastoral civilizations. How can any superior space traveling civilization survive without any ability to feed itself? They fly from various planets to demand food from the locals? Wouldn't it be smarter for them to use their advanced skills to either make their own food or teach the locals to increase their production. Instead they fly across the cosmos to collect ""bushels"" of grain. Literally, flying light years and expending whatever fuel energy for what amounts to a few pieces of bread.The evil commander who just happens to be a white male is dressed in 1930s or 40's era military wardrobe. I wasn't sure if I was watching Hitler vs the slaves of Egypt here. Again the implication is that a superior and advanced military force cannot beat rag tag collection of misfits.I've read this was a take on the Seven Samurai which is a fantastic story. But that movie sets the samurai against warlords of the same period. Same skills and same equipment etc. You didn't have to question every single that gets thrown onto the screen as you have to with Rebel Moon.2 Stars for CGI.","17 out of 40 found this helpful.

"3","/10","More soulless, terribly-written, blown budget garbage from ZZZzzzack","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9513055/?ref_=tt_urv","therapeuticsuicide","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur79536065/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2023","Here's a free, wonderful tip to save all you newbie film buffs the grief of wasting time watching a dud: IF THE FILM BEGINS WITH SOMEONE NARRATING THE PREMISE VIA VOICE-OVER YOU CAN TURN IT OFF IMMEDIATELY AND MOVE ON TO ANOTHER FILM, because this is LITERALLY the very clearest sign of TERRIBLE storytelling. That's basically also a free tip for any writer aspiring to NOT SUCK.A director/writer who has tact and imagination will immediately engage and draw you into a story with the plot and action elements themselves, letting the story tell itself naturally. Having to explain why you're making a movie right at the start of it is a clear sign the story is going NOWHERE and that the storytellers know that their story isn't engaging enough. Michael Bay, a very similar director, typically all glitz and glam, not much substance (with the notable exceptions of Black Sails and 13 Hours, which were phenomenal, if not, outright surprising standouts in his portfolio), employing a similar approach in Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon, with Optimus Prime or whoever narrating the beginning of the movie with voice-over, explaining stuff in an attempt to engage the viewer, and resulting in a similarly dogwater film. Explaining why you're telling the story rather than simply using the chosen medium of film to actually SHOW it is like a chef giving you mouthwash to have ready for after you taste something... You could just as soon start the story with ""Once upon a time a bunch of really cool stuff happened that you might have cared about, just take our word for it... but stick around for some nice special effects!"". Learn from the greats, and if you have something to tell the audience about your premise do so more artfully than a voice-over insert - just write a short synopsis for what they need to know at the beginning, like Star Wars, or Gladiator. But, honestly? Most of the time it's better to just jump into the story and let the audience figure it out for themselves, since it really is part of the fun, as it keeps the audience more actively engaged and invested. This applies to ALL forms of storytelling, whether it be comic books, novels, tv series or films, and writers with actual talent learn this before all other narrative devices, but clearly Zack Snyder and his team simply have none. So they lean on and rely heavily upon blown effects budgets.In this day and age it is beginning to seem as if our only hope is that some of these DOGWATER directors and writers like Zack Snyder and this utterly hopeless lot learn to rely ENTIRELY on AI to create their scripts and worlds, since the clearly have neither tact, talent nor imagination, let alone any sense of originality. Zack does very well with overall production aspects and visual capture, and I would write and creatively direct alongside him readily, but he couldn't storytell his way out of wet paper bag and there is plenty of evidence of this shortcoming.300 was merely a translation of Frank Miller's solid storyboard, and likewise Man of Steel/Batman vs Superman/Justice League and Watchman clearly had mountains of material available to translate to the screen. Dawn of the Dead was a fun ride, but, despite it being one of my favourite zombie hikes, let's not get the illusion that this was remarkable film-making, it was simply a solid re-telling of a classic Romero zombie romp. Those films I would consider passable entrees in the realm of blown effects budgets, but then you stumble upon Sucker Punch. The first film he directed with full creative control using his own ideas for a storyboard. AND IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST HAMMERED GARBAGE FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN.Zack seems to do great with taking other people's storyboards and glamourizing them on screen, throwing in his usual barrage of bullet-time effects, lens flare and colour filters, and in many of those aforementioned films does a great job of capturing lasting visuals, and I genuinely did enjoy most of those, even the Superman stuff, but his talent seems to reach the end of its rope with translation-to-screen adaptation, as he comes up with some of the most bizarre and cliched ideas when he's left to his own devices, first witnessed with Sucker Punch, and now with this alarmingly self-indulgent foray into his own saga with Rebel Moon, HEAVILY reminiscent of the shallowness of the former. (To think Netflix would commit to a saga of these duds... CRINGY). He really gets way too stuck up on this idea of what his characters will all look like when they're hanging out together, and pays little attention to anything but, adding story as an afterthought as he attempts to conceive of ways to glorify their coolness while remainly utterly oblivious to the futility of this endeavour if the storyline itself isn't similarly engaging. Piecing together action scenes and visuals IS NOT STORYTELLING. It's just shooting scenes. Scenes don't make a story, STORY makes a story. It's like he gets too focused on trying to make his characters look cool, which backfires, BECAUSE NO CHARACTER IS COOL WHEN THEY'RE IN A DOGWATER SCRIPT. PERIOD. My best recommendation to Zack, who I DO feel has a talent for capturing visuals in a particular way, would be to completely step back from any of the storytelling and writing aspects of his productions, reckognize his lack of talent therein, and leave those aspects to people with actual VISION. Here is clearly the difference between a cinematographer and an actual director and/or writer. Clearly not everybody is Ridley Scott, as much as they may aspire to be.So, we end up with another bunch of characters Zack personally thinks look cool, and he tries the typical ""put a bunch of dramatic music and slow motion and close-ups of people crying"" on top of a lot of unrelatable story, as protagonists have zero depth and villains are clearly inhuman and fully unbelievable, taking cliched actions to clarify their bad guy status, and has his ensemble cast overract all of it in minimal takes so that he can stretch his effects budget as far as possible, since he knows from practice that they will be the only redeeming quality of his final product.This film is literally just 2 hours and 20 minutes of full-on character introductions and NOTHING IS HAPPENING AT ALL THAT I CARE ABOUT. Some bad guys messed up the place where some good guys were hanging out all innocent and peaceful and now the good guys suddenly feel compelled to take action, forced to fight by little more than the whim of the directionless scriptwriter, since it would seem there's plenty of other places these people could go that appear largely untouched by these bad guys, but they can't do that because then there would be no ""movie"" to speak of, so let's have the characters embark on some inexplicable quest to go gather more characters, making sure that anyone they add to the ensemble looks maybe cool, the cast literally standing around with vacant expressions, their characters apparently looking for something to do, often just suddenly appearing somewhere else randomly as they are introduced to another trivial scene or action sequence as the camera abruptly, gracelessly cuts to it without explanation or any intriguing journey on the part of the ensemble to arrive there, then after 2 hours and 20 minutes of this presumably we have a reason we want to watch these characters do something that has some sort of story in the sequel? OH and let's not forget, a recent new standard for minimal effort sci-fi of thise variety: put a few random, derivative aliens and alien creatures here and there to remind people that they're watching a sci-fi movie, since not much else will... What are we signing on for here? Is our time and monthly subscription fee not worth anything to Netflix and Zack Snyder?Pisses me off to see garbage directors and producers getting paid big money for wasting people's time, and clearly I'm not alone.Some poor dude in another review: ""I just want to see some good sci-fi..."", I can literally read the despair, as we see trash like Rebel Moon and The Creator blowing huge budgets alongside all of Disney's armada of Marvel and Star Wars trash, literally slow-crushing the imagination of an entire generation to the point where long-time sci-fi and superhero fans feel like these genres are entirely and hopeless spent. I truly do feel that pain. The deep cold of a vaccuum of imagination and originality. Powerlessly throwing away heaps of cash at anything and everything in hopes that one day someone will finally deliver us the way Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings, and Ridley Scott did with Alien before that. Only goes to show how much praise the ACTUAL great storytellers deserve, because, trust, it IS an art, the highest form of art, one that combines all other forms of art in its final form, THE SCREENPLAY, gathering all the visual arts, technology, literature, world-building, performance, music and presentation all in one final product to feed the mind and soul in these few precious moments we have left to enjoy.","20 out of 49 found this helpful.

I'm not a Star Wars fanboy, but I do like the original trilogy. I really like some of those cheezy Star Wars clones/ ripoffs from the 70's and 80's. I really like low and big budget sci-fi movies from all eras. That being said.There's something wrong with the script and screenplay of this movie. Through out the movie it is telling what is what and not showing. And it makes this feel sluggish and boring. Witch is weird because it's a sci-fi action movie that is quite fast paced (even with all that slow motion). It also feels that scenes are just slap together.Characters don't have enough time to make their mark and that makes them meaningles. It's hard to feel for loss if you have no connection to the character.I can't tell if the actors are just wrongly casted or is the director really not up for it? Dialogue delivery is flat and actors are posing in ""cool postures"". Lead actress is frowning almost all the time and it feels weird.I also think it looks good at some occasions but effects are over used in many places. Things like lens flare and shallow depth of field. One thing about the shallow depth of field is that it looks like it is done at the post production. It is not filmed like that. Cgi is mostly good, but there are places and scenes where they should have try to make designs better.If you are a sci-fi movie fan go and watch it. Wouldn't recommend it for others.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The cinematography is infuriating, everything is largely slow motion for undisclosed reasons, the scenes appear to have no direction which leaves the viewer watching some fight scenes with bad guys literally stood by, waving their arms before moving now it is their turn to be defeated by an entirely unbelievable hero person, in whom you have no interest because you don't understand her reason for fighting by virtue of not knowing anything of her back story. I had high hopes for this film, hoping it might be another Rogue 1. What it is, is a melange of puff pieces with some cracking CGI that is framed poorly, populated by people you know nothing about and care even lass about their goals in a universe that makes no sense and is so disconnected, it feels like a riot of short, unconnected stories with no plot or resolution.

This gave me a unique perspective to appreciate the depth and nuances of Zack Snyder's latest creation. Junkie XL's (Tom Holkenborg) score elevated the narrative to epic proportions. Snyder's use of slow motion, a signature element of his directorial style, adds a dramatic flair to the action scenes, though at times it can slightly overshadow the storyline's momentum. The compact 2-hour cut of the film is a tantalizing glimpse into what the extended R-rated version, coming this summer, promises to unfold. A significant aspect of ""Rebel Moon"" is its divergence from the often-made Star Wars comparisons. While there are elements that may feel familiar to fans of the space opera genre, ""Rebel Moon"" establishes its own mythology and world-building. The universe created by Snyder is not just an imitation; it's a unique, self-contained cosmos with its own lore and rules. The influence of ""Heavy Metal"", ""Excalibur"", and anime adds layers to the visual storytelling, making it a rich, textured cinematic experience. Sofia Boutella shines as Kora, bringing a magnetic presence to the screen. Ray Fisher's portrayal of Darrien Bloodaxe and Ed Skrein's embodiment of the Admiral are performances that resonate long after the film ends. The ensemble cast synergizes to bring this imaginative universe to life, each adding a distinct flavor to the narrative's tapestry. The anticipation for the extended R-rated cut, releasing this summer, is high, promising an even more detailed exploration of this rich universe. The film is a testament to Snyder's visionary filmmaking, distinguished by its unique aesthetic, compelling performances, and a score that resonates with epic grandeur. It's more than a sci-fi film; it's a bold new chapter in the genre, promising to captivate audiences with its originality and depth.","32 out of 86 found this helpful.

I enjoy Star Wars and some of Zack Snyder's movies, so I thought this had potential. That potential is completely wasted on a mashup story of Star Wars and Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, horrible acting, and terrible action scenes.The story is never fleshed out, with every character's story being almost completely forgotten. Their motivations are either completely lost or make no sense whatsoever. Many of the scenes just don't fit in the movie, like the straight up Greek mythology griffin scene or the medieval spider woman in a cyberpunk setting. The most confusing scene is the ending, where you see the main characters on horseback in the distance while the robot from the beginning of the movie appears with deer antlers on its head.The acting, especially the guy who plays Darian Bloodaxe, is just abysmal. Every line he has is delivered as if he were screaming The Declaration of Independence in a historical reenactment. Charlie Hunnam uses at least three different accents for his character throughout the movie, and the main character starts out trying to speak with a normal American tone but switches to a Latino accent for the last quarter of the movie.The action is constantly bogged down and non-immersive due to Snyder's need to add slow-mo every 30 seconds. He goes way overboard with it in this movie, which honestly makes it difficult to enjoy in any capacity. On top of that, the choices he makes on which scenes to slow down are rather odd.Overall, it's just not a good movie. You would think the first part of a multi-part series would take the time to provide backstory for it's important characters, but you really only learn who they all are when the ""big twist"" happens with about half an hour left in the movie, and is just glanced over at that. If you can ignore gaping plot holes and apply a huge amount of suspension of disbelief, you may enjoy this movie. Otherwise, you may want to spend 2 hours doing something else.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

About the end i started to realize im forcing muself to watch this and kept looking how much time left.Truth is the plot could be filmed much better. Film is very dependent on characters but most are really uninteresting.pace is bad and makes you feel as if the plot can never have a conclusion.Using dark colors dont make the movie dark. You need realistic and dark behaviour and heart strangling scenes. You need mystery.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

I can forgive bad writing, bad CGI, if it was still entertaining but it wasn't . Visually uncreative, action choreography is so boring, plot just randomly move forward, characters don't have any development beside some cut scenes and what other characters tell about them. And weirdly, every character is hot? Like for what? Even farmers on a desert planet are buffed up. Music is uninspiring. Way too many slow mo shots for no darn reason. Like every small action like putting on a cape gets a slow mo. And because the pacing is so slow and lack of reason to root for any characters, you just don't have any will to watch this 2.5h movie. Better spend your time rewatching Dune or Guardians of the galaxy.I do always get excited for an original story. But this movie doesn't do anything to entice viewers to leaner more about the world or characters.I give this movie 1 star bc I believe we shouldn't reward mediocrity.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Well, that's exactly what I did. I had no idea this movie existed until Netflix smacked me in the face with a full screen promo yesterday. Being a sci-fi fan, I hit Play.I only lasted for about an hour before it almost put me to sleep. Even zero expectations don't help.So what's wrong? The plot, the dialogue and the characters, in short. I'm not a sophisticated moviegoer, I don't expect a breathtaking journey out of every film, and yet I just couldn't take this one seriously. It felt like someone asked ChatGPT to write a screenplay with elements of their favorite movies. It felt like a 14-year-old wanted to mash up bits of several well-known plotlines and put a ton of VFX on top. It felt like some many other Netflix productions that need to spoonfeed exposition to viewers. It didn't work for me.The story's all over the place, like a first draft that someone was supposed to process into something compelling. Characters felt clichéd and two-dimensional, with zero development, no subtlety, nothing to make me care about them or their quest.I'll give it one more try just for the visuals' sake, but I'm probably not holding my breath for sequels.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The journey to gather the classic ""elite force"" is rushed and painfully stereotypical. The antagonist is vague, lacking purpose, and overtly stupid. The entire plot of the movie is literally hinging on GRAIN, and it's a futuristic sci fi.

This movie, maybe, just maybe, could have served as an unnecessary episode of Star Wars movie collection, but if not produced at all, wouldn't have made any difference to the cinematic world.

When it leads to violence and a deadline of 10 months to fulfill the deal, rebellious Kora steps upto form an army of her own to fight back the brutal army of Motherland. How she succeeds in finding the right warriors for her army forms rest of the story.Zack Snyder has come up with not so unique yet gripping story, of the chosen one handpicking powerful warriors to form an army. It's a world terrorized by the Motherland empire and has various life forms. The idea definitely clicks but the execution falters big time. Snyder fails to deliver a single memorable character including the main lead to root for. The screenplay is as basic as one could expect and the style quotient is amped up. There were several cool shots which we typically expect from Snyder and that is all the film delivered. The action scenes remained generic and devoid of highs. There is more to the story, to be narrated in part 2 but as far as part 1 goes, the efforts didn't really set the film apart from similar films that exist.","19 out of 48 found this helpful.

The film is a soulless attempt at space opera, boasting very poor direction, a laughably weak storyline, and actors who deliver performances so artificial they make you cringe.Wooden Performances: The blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the director and writers as even talented actors are forced into delivering lines with wooden expressions, wooden language, and wooden dialogue. The lack of urgency, expression, fear, or anger on the actors' faces is a testament to the disastrous combination of direction and writing.Dreadful Visual Effects: Despite the occasional commendable visual effects, the majority of the film looks like a poorly executed high school production. It's mind-boggling how a movie made 46 years ago can outshine ""Rebel Moon"" in effects, background, and laser scenes. The CGI is downright bad, turning what could have been a visually stimulating experience into an eyesore.Action in Slow-Motion: The action sequences, purportedly the film's strength, are sabotaged by the inexplicable decision to employ slow-motion throughout. This not only drains the life out of the scenes but also leaves the audience wondering how a movie with so much action can be so mind-numbingly boring.Plot Devices and Inconsistencies: The film is riddled with plot devices that conveniently place characters where they need to be. The illogical stealth of mile-long ships and the absurd capture of the protagonist by a slow robot are glaring examples of lazy writing. The decision to cloak everything in darkness only serves to hide the atrocious action scenes.In conclusion, ""Rebel Moon"" is a disaster of epic proportions. Save yourself from this cinematic nightmare and take a hard pass. Zack Snyder's attempt at something different has resulted in a misfire of astronomical proportions.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

His Justice League cut was epic, I loved Watchmen and 300 and I even hold a smallish candle for SuckerPunch.Unfortunately, either Snyder was on some crazy class-A narcotics the whole time he wrote and directed this infinitely derivative gruel, or he's spending way too much time with Uwe Boll. Eitherway, Rebel Moon was as lazy and disrespectful to the Sci-Fi movie genre as it gets outside of the Marvelous Disney Wars Cinematic Universe.There is almost nothing to recommend this movie, especially if you've seen any retelling of the Seven Samurai or any half-decent good guys fight bad guys in space movies. I mean, it might have been better if Snyder simply admitted he was remaking Battle Beyond the Stars and stuck to that script at least.Without being too spoilery, here's a random handful of the most bilious bile Rebel Moon prettily projectile vomits at you:The most disappointing aspect to Rebel Without a Clue is its character development; everyone is introduced with such carelessness that of course, it's impossible to care about them. The only back-story is Rey's... sorry, Gamora's... sorry, Korra's... sorry, Kora's, and even that had all the depth and emotional history of a used sheet of toilet paper. No-one is likeable, except Westworld's Sir Lord Dame Anthony Hopkins the robot, which is ironic, don'tchathink?Actually, I hope C3PO winds up killing every human on the Moon in Rebel Moon Part II: The Unscargiven, because they're clearly not actually worth saving.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

Maybe you're thinking she's an augment, with bioengineered body parts, a super hero with powers that allows her to slow down time or something, there has to be an explanation for all the slow motion right? Right? Well no. You're out of luck. She just trained really hard.How does she know how to move through the storyline? Well she just does. Why these specific people?

I might venture it is to pad the runtime out but at way over 2 hours the film is far too long.The worst things though are that it is narratively incohesive and very dull, things happen for no reason other than to insert some fight scene or FX which flip in and out of slo-mo because.... I dunno.I had to watch it in three sittings as it just cannot hold the viewers attention. A good third of the movie is the protagonist building a team, during which nothing happens to progress the story.Perhaps that's why there is such a lot of randomly inserted scenes, to try and distract from the tedium, it doesn't work.A special mention for Charlie Hunnam's Irish accent, it makes me cringe for him.Snyder won't care but he has become the big budget Uwe Boll.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

There is 0 character development, everybody is so dumb and dialogues are like from Nickleodeon movie. CGI itself is not bad but composition looks strange in some scenes. Sometimes it looks like you are warching some thather play and not a movie. In some scenes there is really strange camer with like fish eye effect. You don't feel any connection with any of the characters because you barely know them, but at the end of the movie they all are like avengers. I didn't know their name by the end. There is no sense of time or urgency. They are just flying from planet to planet find exactly who and what they want to find and sk on.

I also have to blame Netflix for turning this into a watered down PG-13 moment-fest instead of a film that has a proper beating heart. Snyder and his team of writers judiciously borrow from every space franchise to ever exist, but fail to add any distinctive spins to their plot or characters.It also doesn't help that they've hired the most mid set of actors who struggle to stand out with the material they're handed. As a result, the film sticks out as a tepid origin story with a mission-driven approach, most of which revolves around a recruitment spree. This alarmingly reeks of repetition, with each character getting a token set-piece to prove their worth but having no payoffs in the final act.And speaking of that final act, the edit department has done an absolutely shoddy job. What is supposed to come off as a battle of few-against-many majorly ends up revolving around a tame showdown between Kora (a wooden Sofia Boutella) and the antagonist admiral (Ed Skrein). The only time Snyder's action choices made me look was in that first breakout set-piece which has comparatively more to do with hands and less with space guns. The heavier usage of laser-spitting guns works within the PG-13 environment, but this story, if at all, had to have some innovative knife-fights & hand-to-combat. That's now how it goes, unfortunately.Forget the storytelling; Snyder's vision of this fictional space-world doesn't bring anything new to the table from an audio-visual perspective either. This also might be one of the few instances where I didn't enjoy Junkie XL's score either. The constant orchestral score didn't do much for me.Verdict: Not looking forward to Part 2. But, I know I'll watch it anyway. Honestly, not even a ""Snyder Cut"" can save this one.","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

One of the most insulting things I've ever seen. It rivalled The Room in terms of how bad a script can be. I can't think of a movie that has a weaker plot with plot holes the size of the grand canyon. The actors in this are usually solid so it's baffling how terrible they come across in this. Career killing if I'm honest. It doesn't look the worst which is its only saving grace, but when you look beneath the surface there is a hollow shell of a movie with the worst writing I've ever experienced.Anyone who has any ambitions to become a filmmaker or writer should watch this as an example of what NOT to do.Ps, I'd fully endorse watching David Lynch's Dune 100 times on repeat while hanging upside down and getting punched in the guts by Mike Tyson before I'd recommend this.","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

He was in full control from start to finish so why will there be a ""Snyder Cut""? It's on Netflix so a longer than usual runtime shouln't be a problem. Just release the ""cut"" you wanted to make right from the start and don't wait! What did I watch now? Wasn't that also a ""Snyder Cut""?I for one won't be viewing this new version.....this ""not the Snyder Cut (?)"" was so bad I have no desire to go through that again. If Snyder thinks the new version will be better: well, to bad. You missed your chance.....should have released it right away.......it now feels like a cheap way to get viewers to watch it again, but I'm not wanting more of it.Imagine all movies would get a ""directors cut"" after it's first release. What would be the point of viewing the ""theatrical release"" anymore?It used to be a way to get people to buy the blu-ray but I guess in the streaming age that is not an option anymore.My thoughts: release the best version you can make right away and if it's any good people will want to watch it more than once anyway.....I for one don't watch a ""director's cut"" in the hope it will be better than the ""theatrical release"".....I watch it to see new footage of movies I already really liked.....","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

His version of ""Justice League"" is better than the theatrical one - but still isn't good. This though probably overtakes ""Army of The Dead"" though as the worst film he's directed.An evil empire arrives on a small farming planet and demand its upcoming grain harvest. The army, led by General Noble (Ed Skrein) depart leaving a small force behind who, following an incident, are all killed by Kora (Sofia Boutella) a warrior who has been hiding out on the planet. Kora, along with Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) leave to look for a former general, who could lead a rebellion when the army returns. They recruit several more to their cause as they travel.Not a man overflowing with original ideas, ""Rebel Moon"" once pitched as a ""Star Wars"" story, is a mishmash of moments, characters and scenes cribbed and lifted from other movies. Its derivative story is then shot through with the worst of Snyder's excesses. Whilst it often looks impressive, it's not an exaggeration to say that literally every action scene involves slow motion, so much so I bet the film would be twenty minutes shorter if those scenes just happened in real time. I also don't understand the decision to make this bloodless tame version and to artificially release a ""Snyder cut"" with the gore restored at a future date.It just does nothing better than any of the films it's trying to emulate and is so dour and obvious it's a chore to make it through it.What's most annoying is that, despite not having enjoyed this at all - come April I'm going to have to sit through another one, as I can't watch some of something and not all of it.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

He's looking for redemption in big projects after facing tough years and scorn at his old home.The project was born over 20 years ago, even before Snyder could imagine that he would become one of the greatest directors of today. His films, like ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Watchmen"", ""300"", ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman vs Superman"", are still debated and admired by the public.In ""Rebel Moon"", we see the director at the peak of his creativity, creating a stunning new fantasy world, full of elements that captivate the public's gaze. This project, however, almost had another fate. Zack Snyder presented his idea to Lucasfilm before it was sold to Disney, but he didn't make it and ended up putting it in the drawer. I think this was one of the best things that happened, as he was able to gain more experience as a filmmaker and consequently enrich his new universe even more. And yes, the film draws inspiration from the same sources that led George Lucas to create ""Star Wars"". I see this as a good thing, not a bad one.The film shows everything we already know about the director: epic scenes, as every good film should have, and that Snyder knows how to do well. The fight scenes are as good as those in ""Batman vs Superman"", where the choreography team did a fantastic job. The story is well tied up, unlike what many haters say. The film doesn't suffer from part 1 syndrome and, just like ""Dune"", it's a great start to a universe, the actors are impeccable in their roles. This makes the film go by very quickly and holds the viewer's attention from beginning to end. The development of the main characters' story is very good.The execution quality of this film is something to admire. The director managed to not only make something extremely cheap, but also with an impressive special effects quality. Amid so many bad projects with exorbitant budgets, Snyder works a miracle in ""Rebel Moon"". No wonder, the film is on the list of the 20 best in special effects at the Oscars.I had the enormous pleasure of being one of the lucky ones who watched this masterpiece at the early release on December 1st at CCXP 23. I was in the front row and I could see something that will be marked: an auditorium of 3000 people cheering and applauding this film on their feet. It was a big and beautiful surprise of the year 2023, entering my list of the best films of the year.","82 out of 251 found this helpful.

Without fail, every single movie or show where D. E. I. Is the basis for the casting ends up subpar of just downright embarrassing, and Rebel Moon seems to continue this god forsaken trend. Gone are the days where the best person for the job is given the role, the best actor, the most fitting or qualified. Now the roles are given to the right skin color, gender or sexuality, and SURPRISINGLY, it's yielding the most horrendous results. Who would have thought hiring people based on superficial traits over say, talent or merit, would ruin filmmaking this profoundly? I am truly shocked, meaning, I am not shocked at all.Every single new addition to the film was a check box of ""diversity"";White male villain? ✅
The POC FEMALE lead? ✅
Latino character? ✅
Black character? ✅
Asian character? ✅
Ethnically ambiguous? ✅(Notice how the only genuine casting is the white male villain, because we can't have any other ethnic group ever be the bad guys, now, can we?)I groaned audibly every time they got to a new planet and the D. E. I. Checklist marked off its ""representation"". Perhaps if they spent more time writing a competent story or building a believable world over obsession over how many people of color they had at any given time on screen, we might have gotten a half decent, and dare I say, entertaining film. But Netflix gonna Netflix, and their racial quotas matter more than their ratings, so they'll just sweep this under the rug and do it again with another film until they get the hit the desperately crave but will never get.Zack Snyder was a director I defended and I used to take great job in celebrating his style and vision as one of film-makings great bad boys. Now I see that he can be easily bought to make a movie that they want you to make, and will happily forfeit his artistic integrity just to see his name on the credits.There are very few redeemable qualities in this film, the character designs, set design and sci-fi design being the only ones, but everything else, from the subpar or hammy acting (except by Ed Skrein), to the SFX overload, to the ridiculous plot, to the under-baked and verbose script felt like an afterthought (why did they talk so much and why did so little of it matter?), and the ridiculously bad action scenes, which all took a backseat to the utter importance of assembling the United colors of Beneton Avengers.A ridiculous movie made by ridiculous people who focus on stuff that doesn't matter to try to build an interesting world and fail on almost every single regard. Imagine if Star Wars had been forced to have racial and gender quotas and this is the movie you would have ended up with. Netflix, we don't subscribe to your service for this. Do better, in the sense of making actual movies for people who enjoy watching them.A message to Ed Skrein; What were you thinking taking this role? You are a master of your craft and one of the finest living actors. You deserved SO much better than this film, which you carried single-handedly, might I add. Your agent did you dirty, and I suggest firing him and finding someone that will get you the roles your talent and skill truly deserve.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The trailer hints at an expansive world and high stakes. But maybe it's easy to explain why this is so forgettable: it's mostly an unsatisfying pastiche of clichés that don't really ever cohere into something interesting.It starts off promising enough. The initial scenes set the stage for a peaceful, almost idyllic setting which is interrupted by the arrival of a malevolent force. The introduction of the adversaries is at first portrayed with tension, but this quickly dissolves into just a bunch of cartoonish bad guys. What follows is an awkward hour and a half long team-building exercise followed by what feels like a climax that would feel rushed if we didn't just kind of want it to be over anyway. None of the characters we recruit along the way are given any dimension, we don't really care about any of them, and they don't spend enough time together to form any chemistry with one another.The writing here is just not very good. It's often hard to tell if the actors are really just not into it or if their lines and parts are just so bizarrely uninspired that they have nothing to work with. This is set up like Magnificent Seven in space, but statistically at least one of these characters should *accidentally* be compelling, but they're all really dull. So many things are hinted at and then never qualified or brought up again. In a film like this, at the very least the villain is usually memorable, and Ed Skrein is usually pretty good in those roles, but here even that is paper thin. This is one of those films where things just sort of happen and there doesn't seem to be a lot that connects one scene to another.Of course this is a part one, and maybe part two will somehow develop the innumerable loose threads here. Maybe we'll actually see some chemistry build between the characters and begin to care about this struggle. But I kind of doubt it. There were just too many consistently missed opportunities here and indications that the writers have no understanding of how to build a story of this magnitude.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I gave it 2 stars because the acting isn't bad at all really, they just had nothing to work with: convoluted plot and familiar tropes.

Sofia Boutella was great in the first Kingsmen movie. But she doesn't have what it takes to carry the movie as a lead. Zack Snyder has directed some worthy films - e.g. Army of the Dead, 300, etc. But he's confused his ability to create credible alternative planets and weird looking creatures with the ability to create a great film. And this falls way short. Very much a Star Wars wannabe but without the compelling story.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, the recently released film, Rebel Moon, falls short of these expectations, delivering a disappointing experience that struggles to breathe life into tired and clichéd sci-fi tropes.One of the most disheartening aspects of Rebel Moon is its lack of originality. While a few scattered sci-fi concepts manage to capture the audience's attention, the majority feel like tired reiterations of ideas that have been explored countless times before. The film's attempt to revisit these well-worn themes is not only uninspiring but also leaves the viewer yearning for something more substantial and thought-provoking.The narrative itself fails to offer a refreshing take on the genre. Rather than breaking new ground, it seems content to tread water in a sea of predictability. The storyline unfolds in a manner that feels all too familiar, with plot twists and turns that are telegraphed from a mile away. This lack of narrative innovation robs the film of any sense of excitement or intrigue, leaving the audience with a sense of déjà vu that is hard to shake.A critical flaw lies in the portrayal of the heroes/fighters encountered on this lackluster journey. Despite the potential for compelling character development and engaging story arcs, these figures are poorly executed and fail to elicit any genuine interest from the audience. Whether it's the unimpressive performances or the thinly written characters, there is an undeniable emptiness that pervades the film's roster of heroes. As a viewer, one can't help but feel disconnected and indifferent of their origins, which undermines any emotional investment in the overall narrative.Despite its shortcomings, it's important to acknowledge that Rebel Moon does have moments where it flirts with the potential for greatness. There are glimpses of creativity and inspiration that, unfortunately, never fully materialize into a cohesive and compelling whole. It's these fleeting moments that make the film's overall disappointment all the more palpable, as they serve as a constant reminder of the missed opportunities to elevate the narrative and captivate the audience.In conclusion, Rebel Moon ultimately falls short of its potential, offering a underwhelming and uninspiring journey through the well-trodden terrain of stale sci-fi tropes. While a handful of cool concepts manage to shine through the mediocrity, they are not enough to salvage a film that struggles to break free from the shackles of predictability and narrative fatigue. With its poorly portrayed heroes and fighters, and a narrative that fails to push the boundaries of the genre, Rebel Moon is a forgettable entry in the world of science fiction, leaving audiences longing for the innovation and excitement that the genre is known for.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

Zack Snyder wanted to make a new version of something like Star Wars, but first of all: The story feels completely unoriginal, and secondly, this crap just feels like a fast Netflix copy of an amazing franchise of decades. It's disturbing to watch how people get tricked to watch stuff like that, and how big production continues endless s**t! Let's talk about the action sequences. It felt like a video game, the fighting motions of the fighters looked like gaming character movements. Completely basic acting, outside the battles too. Character expressions was showed on a mediocre level, and the main hero of the film, Kora, was trying so hard to be dramatic, but it just looked pathetic on the screen. The rest of the characters that were introduced were forgettable and sometimes I forgot about them in the next scene. The story had two main villains, even though they focused more on the second (That by the way looked a little bit like Thomas Shelby) and I'm not so very proud of them. The menace and creepiness didn't feel like a true villain, and they felt quite generic, too. The scenography was the mark of the low-budget quality here. It looked more like a scenography they would use on a theatre, not on a big film like this. The camera filming was quite decent, and I can't argue much about that. The music was fine, too, and was the only thing that saved the film some stars. It was quite dramatic, and fitted the scenes, but unfortunately, it's not enough to save it. By the way, this is just the first part (The second releases April next year) and I'm not so excited. But I hope they can change something to make the continuation better.","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

From the title you might think it's a another of the endless Star Wars spinoffs but no, it's not. It's a Zack Snyder something and he's certainly not a Jon Favreau when it comes to Star Wars spinoffs.It comes across as a mix of so many films from the last 25 years that it was difficult to stop thinking, that's taken from? That's the same story line as? That's the same CGI from? It's a rehash of a rehash of a rehash. I can only think people want to watch this film just to know how bad it really is. That's the reason the viewing figures are so high.This is a CGI film with short bursts of just about adequate acting. There was no actor that kept my attention throughout or made the film as being memorable. You certainly don't become emersed in the film as with so many good films out there. This came across as an over budgeted TV movie with a director who really believes his own hype.As with some of the later Star Wars copies of the original series (Rey instead of Luke), its all been done before. For new viewers of films and TV series, this might appear to be new to them. For people older than 25 who might have watched a few actual good films to build some form of opinion, they should recognise this to be a colossal waste of everybody's time.Instead of watching this film, I suggest you watch the original Seven Samurai, the film it's being compared to in story line. Although there are so many stolen story lines being used here, it's hard to know what you're watching.One whole star given because I can't give a percentage of one star.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

I enjoyed every minute of it, it was well paced and well structured and came together well in the end.I would say that the premise is basic, ""all this for a measly farm"", but that just lends to the idea of the simple struggles within the bigger fight. There are things I want to know more about both before and after this film, hopefully some of these will be resolved in part 2 but hopefully others are left and some more doors opened for a prequel, possibly a sequel but they would need to appeal to the modern audience, spin offs, side stories, other stories within the same universe are what work, continuing on past the natural conclusion does not.I will definitely watch this again and look forward to Part 2 and if it's true, I'll look forward to the Snydercut, even if it's just to see how different it might be.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Typical Zynder theatrics make for a pleasing to the eye visual spectacle. I also appreciated that the worlds/planets feel bespoke, with their own theme and culture.The bad: Everything else other than visuals is a misfire. The plot and pacing + promises with no payoffs. The first half is the worst for pacing. With exposition dumps and flashbacks galore. Add in frequent (Zynder) slow-mo + ultra slow-mo and the film feels like a slog-fest to just try and get through it. The back half of the film does pick up somewhat (with way less slow-mo), but it's a case of too little too late. And as predicted with a part 1/2 - the movie ends with no ending, and little in the way of actual narrative progression. Finally, the ease of which the (magnificent 7) heroes are recruited really bugged me. It was super easy, barely an inconvenience (thanks pitch meeting). It's hard to care for characters that have limited conviction and/or development. One scene (literally) in most cases, will not achieve this, no matter how good the actor. Though it's possible the characters are further fleshed out in the rumoured director's cut.Should you watch it: If you like Zynder's visual prowess and don't mind watching a movie that is unapologetically derivative of the sci-fi western classics that came before it, than sure - you'll probably find something to like here. For the rest, probably not. Go watch Dune part 1 (same formula, better output). Rebel moon part 2 where I imagine the action/payoffs will be.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Besides, revisiting classic tales can be fun and rewarding and does give the opportunity to chuck in some neat inversions and twists.

They throw in some of the most generic names imaginable like ""Motherworld"" and ""Scargiver,"" even the name ""Rebel Moon"" feels completely uninspired. Certainly not the worst sci-fi I've ever seen, but so utterly disappointing. There were also some HORRIBLE CGI sequences for a movie with a $166 million budget. Where did all of the money go? This isn't the Star Wars killer that Netflix is looking for.I wanted to doubt the critics this time, but after watching Rebel Moon I can't emphasize enough how right they were. The premise of the entire story just wasn't that interesting, it worked for a setting like Seven Samurai, but it feels underwhelming in what's supposed to be an ""epic sci-fi."" Then you have to consider the over-use of slo-mo, borrowing from other franchises to the point of almost plagiarizing, stereotypical ""space Nazis,"" the atrocious dialogue and exposition, the random recruitment sidequests that feel completely disconnected from the main plot threads, the huge dip in the quality of the CGI at times... After all the flaws this film really only has some nice visuals and cool looking costumes. Everything else made this film a massive disappointment to say the least. Snyder seriously needs to stop being involved with the writing process. This movie's script was like an 8-year-old boy playing Mad Libs with all of his favorite shows, movies, and video games. I can't imagine the extended cut being much better, unless they do an absurd amount of reshoots.As a final point, I'll add that I have been a Snyder fan for quite some time, I've loved most of his films, but Rebel Moon fell far below my already tempered expectations. I'm not sure I'll be able to stick around for the ride this time.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Dune, Star Wars, Seven Samurai, etc.The acting is... ok enough, I guess? No performances really stand out as good or exceptional. Everyone was more or less one note. Speaking of one note, all the characters who are recruited do one thing and then are background characters the rest of the movie.I've heard some say the script is like chatGPT and its an apt comparison.When I say its ""low quality"", I dont mean the effects, which can be really gorgeous. I mean the 'world' itself. There is so much nonsensical stuff that it boggles the mind. Some characters wear more or less hockey pads as ""armor"" which cover like 5% of their body, while the rest wear robes and cloaks. I dont know if any of the armor is supposed to be practical, and neither does the movie. And for some reason 20th century Earthen necktie and dress shirts and trench coats??? (The symbolism is so obvious, Snyder might as well have jumped out and screamed ITS JUST LIKE WW2!!!!)So much of the movie is clearly Snyder going ""Yo, this would be so cool!!!"" and thats as far as his thinking went. Hence the 'edgelord' of it all. This goes for a lot of the characters costumes as well, which didnt feel like it had any consistency, but again was ""YO THIS IS COOL!""The dialogue and exposition are stilted, and hamfisted.And of COURSE, pretty much all of the center-stage aliens are basically humans/humanoid, because as we all know, all evolved life in the galaxy will be shaped like humans.Yes, there is the ridiculous, slow mo into super slow mo for no reason.For some reason, super powers can travel the galaxy in no time with fuel not being a problem yet no one in this galaxy figured out how to grow food with artificial lights and rely on ""grain"" (get ready to hear that word 9001 times!)In this end, this felt like a long pointless endeavor of wasted talent and budget. I have no idea why this was made, who the target audience is, or if anything besides the edgelord ""YO THIS IS COOL"" was put into the characters, world, lore, history, dialogue, etc.If you are able to turn off your brain and go ""Ohhh pretty colors"" then you might love this.Seriously, check your brain at the door before you hit play on this movie.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Tolkien or Martin, the writers are clearly not. I knew nothing of what was going on in the wider universe, nor did I learn anything about the backstory of any characters they happened to stumble across. This meant I simply didn't care about them, nor would I have noticed if they were replaced by cupboard cutouts, midway through.One thing they did achieve was ticking the usual HR diversity checklist. All except the villains, who were all conveniently macho white guys, for a change (yawn).The casting seemed totally off, as did the confusing costuming, and then there's the question... why do we have 9th century nordics in space? Nothing is explained convincingly, nor does any of it make logical sense.Meanwhile, we're once again witness to another stick-thin, attractive female lead who manages to defy physics and somehow is able to kick a load of male bodybuilders around, without taking any hits. Who needs a gym or supplements in this universe?When you're telling a story, you need more than CGI-filled scenes and Matrix-style action shots to convince the audience of a character's credibility. It's horribly shallow and has already been done to death in mindless action films over the past 10-15 years.But the biggest surprise to me is they're actually working on more parts!

With someone who gives us the ability to keep us in a state of anxiety, conflict and perhaps fear of his own evolution ??.What this particular film achieves, and I see it for the first time in this particular way that Zack Snyder presents it, is to identify us with more than one character. ""So the theory of character development has clearly succeeded.""
Distinct feelings that are transferred from one personality to another. Also another good thing is that it leaves openings in the personality of each character regarding their story. A chance to give us more explanations for how things got here. Also let's not forget it is the beginning of events.It is not possible in 2 hours and a quarter to transport us through this whole world. It is impossible. The events must somehow start and slowly evolve to open up the story and unfold everything that the director has in mind.I believe it is the beginning of a new and beautiful beginning.

Sometimes you watch a film and wonder what age group the writer was aiming the story at. But the plot here is less aimed at an 8 year old but feels more it was written by one. I'm fine with smashing together whatever genre of film you like in the hope of creating something all encompassing...it rarely works. (To be fair I never liked Firefly's constant western scenes either). But the plot is so cheesy, so painfully obvious. A scene where one of the characters is persuaded to join the effort is so hilarious in how weak the argument was. Maybe it was actually a 15 min scene that was condensed to 30 seconds in the edit?So the plot and most of the script is not good. But maybe the cinematic style is good? If you've never seen Sucker Punch, or recent Superman, Justice League then maybe it will interest you. If you have, then it may feel very tired and frankly lazy. Yes, we quite liked the monochromatic-esq comic book colour pop but perhaps it is time to try something new? Oh and while we are there, floating burning embers, is this now what we overdo rather than lens flare?The acting is fine - given the script they had to work with, some of the close combat is fun, a bizarre Viking village in space is...we'll, cheese...but okay. So it's not all bad...but mostly it is.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I like that she was not over confident. Sofia Boutella's acting was superb for action sci-fi. This film has a lot of heart. It reminds me of when I first watched Fellowship of the Ring LOTR Part 1. This movie was done correctly. It wasn't obvious. They weren't trying to promote a hero movie. They were showing how some heroes are reluctant heroes. They weren't all warriors. Kora's live interest was a simple farmer unaware of how evil and cruel man can be. There is a lot to explore in this movie. Back stories that can be expanded further.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Stupid.World building? Full of arbitrary elements.The acting? Boring.Dialogs? Plain.Characters? Arbitrary.Production design? Poor.Visual effects? Exaggerated.Music? Unbearable.There is so much wrong here.It's hard to watch this film to the end.It's really not rocket science:(a) You need believable characters with backgrounds and plausible motives that you want to root for. It has to be made believable why the characters join a fight that they can barely survive. Otherwise it doesn't matter why they join in, why they are in the movie and it doesn't matter what they do or what they want. Five such characters in a row and the attention of even an indulgent audience is broken. Why, for example, should we sympathize with the protagonist, whose backstory as an indiscriminately murdering soldier of the evil superpower is told at length while the reason that led her into exile with the poor people remains vague? Perhaps they wanted to save the clarification of the change of heart for a sequel?(b) If your set designers have no better ideas than sticking a few hoses and parts of old warships from the Second World War on the wall, then even the CGI doesn't help to make these handicrafts look more futuristic with a few flashes of light. Little fits here: the CGI team obviously had no idea what the set design was doing and vice versa. This is where the storytelling and the execution fall far apart.(c) The visual effects are there to support the action and make the alien world believable. It doesn't get any more exciting when every shot is played in slow motion with the actors using their weapons as clumsily as if they had never had any combat training.The only amazing thing is how the trailer manages to make this pile of junk look like a quality piece of sci-fi cinematography.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

I actually think Snyder is a much better filmmaker that he often gets credit for but all his usual gimmicks are dialled up to 11. It's boring, has no voice of its own, the universe never feels real or tangible with some pretty horrendously inserted exposition. The story itself is so basic which creates no sense of pace or urgency and none of these characters feel like they're given any real motivation to go on this quest Snyder is setting up. It suffers from major Part One Syndrome because the entire film just feels like an exposition dump to establish this world and never succeeds at building any intrigue. The whole thing just drags and the actual climax just comes out of nowhere and falls totally flat, as do all of the other action sequences. I've always appreciated the visuals of Snyder's films but the whole aesthetic of Rebel Moon is surprisingly washed out and kind of ugly. It doesn't have any of Army of The Dead's overuse of shallow depth of field thankfully but there barely a single memorable image in the whole runtime. Rebel Moon feels like Zack Snyder's ode to classic Sci Fi films without any of the understanding of what made them great or iconic in the first place. I have no interest in watching a directors cut when that's really the version of the film we should've been watching to begin with. The whole thing just represents all the worst aspects of Snyder as a filmmaker and it one of his worst films he's ever put out. I can hardly say I finished this with a burning desire to watch part two and with how it ends that's a pretty solid indication of the failure of storytelling that Rebel Moon is as a whole.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

Not just a Part Two that might make the story feel whole, but an extended cut that represents what the author wanted more than what the studio wanted. Then again, I keep reading that the author and the distributor weren't actually at odds during this production or even in the decision to release it in this state, but I'll get to those stories later.People aren't wrong to call Rebel Moon a hodge-podge of imagery from other tales. I almost find it sort of intriguing. Here is a universe that takes inspiration from Star Wars, Dune, Heavy Metal, and even non-sci-fi works like Gladiator and filters it through Zack Snyder -- who, for all his faults, has a style that is entirely his own. The resulting mess recalls 2015's maddening Jupiter Ascending, except it swaps the lush visuals for drab, blurry browns and greys and just doesn't have as much fun with itself.Also fascinating (to me, but probably an oddity to others) is the anachronistic design of this universe, namely in terms of tech and clothing. Some of the people look something like late 1800s farmers, others like Third Reich officers, others like Roman gladiators, and then some characters, like the robots and cybernetic aliens, seem entirely futuristic. It's not all seamless and usually feels a bit random -- as opposed to something like Dune where we understand why some aspects are primitive and others advanced -- but there's something about it that makes it a lot more interesting to look at than had he simply gone all the way in one direction.It also makes sense, I suppose, if one knows the history of this production. Originally pitched as a Star Wars film but rejected by Disney, Snyder was forced to file off the serial numbers and make up his own sci-fantasy universe in which things variably call back to Kurosawa, space ranger serials, WW2, et al. The problem is that characters like Han Solo have more charisma and characterization in their pinky than any of these new characters do in their entire person.And that's not for lack of a great cast. The movie stars Anthony Hopkins, Sofia Boutella, Djimon Hounsou, Ed Skrein, Michiel Huisman (the two Dario Nahaaris actors, together at last), Doona Bae, Jena Malone, and many more. What we get from them is the usual Snyder fare: Important Dialogue interspersed with meaninglessly stylized action scenes (with slow-motion that, even for Snyder, has little rhyme or reason to it), sexy poses, and vacuous ""cool"" moments.Sure enough, some of this is pretty cool and, like I said, sometimes intriguing in its unapologetic adolescent-mindedness -- not just the mashing together of toys from various franchises and periods but the inability to focus. As with Justice League and BvS, I also enjoyed the music. Alas, that's about the most I get out of Zack Snyder.I think it's wrong to write him off as worthless -- as many critics are hasty to do -- but as for the masterpiece I believe he has in him (perhaps a film in which we can even, I dunno, be bothered to care about anyone), well, I'll have to keep waiting. And despite Snyder's history of superior, more fleshed-out, more cohesive Director's Cuts, I'm not certain his full version of Rebel Moon will be that masterpiece either.When I saw the Rotten Tomatoes score, I was worried. Not because I thought that I'd automatically dislike the picture, mind you, but because I knew for a fact that there'd be weird discourse about ""Snyder cuts"" and whatnot. But this time, the narrative isn't that Snyder was betrayed by Netflix (a company that ostensibly gives creators more freedom than big studios); rather, the fact that the released version is incomplete and poorly received is ""part of the plan"". As in, people are supposed to make a fuss about wanting to see a proper cut, thus generating more PR -- for Snyder and Netflix alike -- until we get one. Yes, I've heard this both from people who hate the film (baffled at the strategy) and some who like it, asserting that we non-fanboys just aren't smart enough to get that the movie is bad on purpose and that God Emperor Zack is playing 5D chess with us all to prove how strong his fandom is.Snyder himself, however, has stated that both cuts are valid and that the uncut R-rated version isn't strictly the CORRECT version to see. Regardless, I guess Netflix didn't actually force him to release it this way -- to remove entire storylines and take out the blood spurts that were clearly meant to punctuate the hits and slashes (as it is, the fights look conspicuously bloodless and oft cut away quickly from the stabs; it plays as if something more was really meant to happen). So who are we fighting by campaigning for this film's completion? And how many truly care enough to save Rebel Moon from, I dunno, its own creators?","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

And finally when it releases, you want to play it the very second and you then learn what a terrible waste of time it is.The movie's story line has all the usual ingredients for a very generic plot. There is the lead character who has a mysterious past but its revealed without much ado. She is said to be fighting with her inner demons and she expresses that with a 24/7 constipated Bella from Twilight kinda face. Her action sequences although repetitive are the highlight of the movie. She lives in hiding in a farming village where they have automatic sliding doors, but their alarm system is a gong that you have to strike with a hammer. And they plough fields the old fashioned way, lol.All the men are super chiseled. Even someone who walked away from their military career and was living as a drunk on the streets has a chiseled to perfection body. There is a quintessential Asian character who is a swordswoman who runs into a barrage of bullets swishing her swords. Her action choreography was one of the lowest points of the movie.All in all, a really boring waste of money. I feel terrible when Netflix wastes money on projects like this and Archies, then spend a bomb on PR, then gets enough watches on the first day to get it trending and then boast about it. We watch these movies on the first day only because we don't have to buy tickets. Otherwise it would have bombed tenfold than the lowest grossers of 2023.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

So what the hell is this trash pile of a movie?? The only thing I can give it is that it looks okay for the most part, aside from some occasional iffy CGI. Everything else about this movie is god awful. The most flat, boring characters I've ever seen, way too much random exposition, way way too much slo-mo, and a plot/story/universe that is so unoriginal and clearly based almost entirely off of Star Wars with other franchises mixed in. I was so bored to the point where I almost turned the movie off.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

There were some really good looking aliens but then there were a lot more that looked like make-up done for a school project. For example they had a creature to ride which was a normal horse with some kind of plate armour on its head, there were lots of designs stolen straight for Star Wars and the villain was just a plain Nazi in a Nazi uniform.Zack Snyder has never been a master writer, but this is just sad. The dialogue is at the level of the original A-team and the plot is on par with an episode of Scooby Doo.The action sequences occasionally shine but most of them are generic at best and are invariably like 80s Arnold action.. you know: 1000 bullets fly but none hit the good guys and they always hit.Even the few actors I would have expected to be good were in fact pretty bad and I don't blame them. I don't know how anyone could deliver a good performance given this script.Giving it 4/10 is a kindness and is only for some of the visuals without which it's a 2/10.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The cast choices are excellent. There's real talent there. They spared no expense on the costs - it wasn't for lack of money that this movie ultimately fails.Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire - Part One just reeks of pretension. Even the title is pompous and turgid.The movie itself attempts much, but in the end simply is overly grandiose. The dialogue sounds like the script was written by a 13yo writing Star Wars fan fiction: it comes across as wooden, and is awkward coming from the mouths of these actors. The narrative is obvious and derivative.It absolutely LOOKS fantastic, which just makes it's short-comings all that more painful... and in that it's typical Zack Snyder fair. An overabundance of ""glorious purpose"" in slow motion, and action that makes no sense - but for the aforementioned ""glorious purpose"".I did want this to be good. Upon hearing about the movie's own origin story, I had intended to see this on an IMAX screen... but I am so very, very glad that I watched it at home, via Netflix.In the end, Shakespeare via Macbeth best sums up Rebel Moon:
It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Just to pick the most obvious.I originally put this at the end but I'll put it here instead because I think it's important. ***
In rebel moon the imperium is explicitly pathetic and uncool in their cruelty and some people will struggle with that.The current big budget ecosystem wans to give us an enemy that is faceless or if not faceless then cool or at least redemeable.Rebel moon offers the imperium none of these. The imperium soldiers aren't given to us a faceless enemy, canon fodder. They're are just as human as us, with names, personalities and even small acts of mercy when they want and all the worse for it. Cruel, bitter and pathetic, they are owed and offered no redemption by their victims or the story. That is the strongest political statement a contemporary film can make about the nature of empire. Some will resent this. ***The development of our lead Kora is brilliantly done, she balances bad assery with vulnerability. Her skill are earned without exaggeration and her history has pathos without being maudlin. And she also saves her gentleman in distress while defending his honor ofc.The world of rebel moon is the real secondary lead in this film. The planets and cultures we glimpse are beautifully rendered and steeped in history and I love that we see evidence of worlds that have evolved independent of each other. The set design is *chefs kiss*, the costume design detailed, well thought out with history's as detailed as the worlds they occupy.Loved the performances with Donna Bae and Charlie Hunnam being easy standouts for all they were secondary characters. Skein as Attics Nobel our villain is sinister from the start and Hopkins work with Jimmy together with the vfx team offers one of the most sympathetic performances. In fact the vfx and makeup team did a phenomenal job. Every ship had weight, felt massive and every creature felt real. I came out falling in love with a cinematic world in a way I haven't experienced since Valerian.If you've played final fantasy, kingdom hearts, star ocean, any big scifi jrpg you'll understand the building a party format that the rebel moon plot follows, from the initiating event to the final boss battle.The big critique is that the party members aren't well fleshed out this is true but it is still very much part 1 as it says in the title so I'm not sure this is fair, it's Assessing the first 2 hirs of what is effectively a 4 hr film at minimum 6hrs extended. The more valid is the choppy pacing in the 2nd act, here the pg 13 edits made from the directors cut for a mainstream audience are more obvious and can be distracting. If I came away with one big critique is that there are parts missing and more than once felt like they were missing. I don't know that I rate the strategy of not releasing the r rated directors cut alongside the pg-13 one and no, I don't have a huge amount of faith in the Netflix release strategy department.But, did I enjoy it? Absolutely. I love scifi, love heavy metal, and most of all I love art that has a strong identity. Rebel moon knows what it is, its a self serious, grounded, large scale adventure and is all the more wonderful for it. 10/10.","41 out of 121 found this helpful.

Even halfway through the movie, basic information about most characters remains elusive, as their motives and stories are poorly developed. Some characters are introduced early on but then fade into obscurity for the next hour and a half, leaving the audience completely forgetting about them. The disjointed and overly dramatic segments underscore Snyder's struggle with storytelling. Despite great cinematography in the action sequences, the choreography falls short, with slow motion and awkward transitions diluting the intensity of the fights. Despite the impressive visuals, the weak storyline detracts from the overall experience. Perhaps, Mr. Snyder, it would be best to focus on directing rather than writing for future projects.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

The movie is based on a long and complex mythos which we are not much introduced in the first part, but it can be expected to do justice in the second part. It is evident that the movie has to deal with some challenges, such as pacing, character development, and coherence.The movie is not flawless, but it is certainly different from the usual fare. It has a unique vision and style, and it creates a captivating world for the viewers to explore. The movie is a feast for the eyes, with stunning visuals and effects that enhance the story. The movie also has a good balance of action, drama and it does take itself seriously.I felt that some of the characters were underdeveloped or underused, and their motivations and arcs are not clear. The movie also feels a bit rushed at times, as it tries to cover a lot of ground in a limited time. The movie could have benefited from a more focused and streamlined narrative, and a better connection between the two parts.The movie is not a masterpiece, but it is a adventurous and enjoyable watch. It is a movie that does not aim to be pretentious, but rather to experience the cinema and delight. It is a movie that you can relax and chill with on a weekend, and immerse yourself in a different and fascinating world. The movie is a welcome change of pace, and a refreshing tale to experience. Zack Snyder's work is remarkably well done and I am very excited to experience the second part.","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

It didn't suffer from part 1 syndrome as many stated. It's fast paced but not rushed. Movie left me wanting more and more.Gorgeous set designs and locations, packed to the brim with details, with a lovely cast that once again plays off each other very well, I love the anamorphic lenses and the look! First 2.39:1 Snyder movie in 10 years that's crazy
Can't wait to watch this again and dive into a deeper review, but as is I thought it was a great movie and and I'm eager to watch it in my surround sound set up because the sound design is excellent
Zack cooked with this 10/10 banger

The story is basically Star Wars: A New Hope dressed down in Emo fashion, without any of the charming, interesting or likable characters. The dialogue is awful. The hand to hand combat is embarrassing. The feel of the film is dark, dim, out of focus and quite flat. The main character is a skinny young woman that battles huge, muscled men and monsters with ease. The main antagonist is a skinny young woman that battles huge, muscled men and monsters with ease. There are so many plot holes you can't watch for 15 minutes without falling in to 2 or 3. Because Marvel, Star Wars, Star Trek, Doctor Who, DC, Disney have all failed to bring entertaining SciFi or fantasy media I was sooo looking forward to this new adventure. It's as bad as all the rest. There is a serious lack of creative minds in charge of our media. Someone needs to develop a new industry to take over from the black hole that is Hollywood.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

If you just want some pretty eye-candy and decent action scenes (I like the spider fight and the water girl scene) but are okay with mediocre writing and angsty main character then you will probably like this movie.

But when you really boil it down, it's a remake of Battle Beyond the Stars (1980) and in many ways it's just as cheesy. Poor character motivations, unbelievable loyalties, no depth of backstory... As other reviews have mentioned, the CGI is spectacular. The movie looks beautiful... but the acting is stiff, the writing is awful, the editing is OK, and it's been done before. It's very true that it's hard to find a truly original story in book or film, but it takes a pretty good story to be better than the original(s) you're copying. As an example, when you watch Silverado (1985) you can see the influence of The Magnificent Seven (1960), but you don't dwell on it. Here, you dwell on it. This film had a lot of hype and I wanted to really enjoy it. But it's simply too two-dimensional and obviously not an original film to really enjoy. It's probably better than Battle Beyond the Stars (1980), but not enough.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

But this whole movie just feels like soulless action scene after action scene. Visually it looked good. But the storytelling was really poor. No time was taken to make you care about the characters and there was no significant relationships built on screen. The story was so dull that I wasn't engaged and really struggled to finish the film. I felt the actors did ok considering the poor script, but they still couldn't craft interesting characters. How they persuaded the great Anthony Hopkins to sign on to this, I am not sure. His character was probably the only one I found interesting, and his run time was unfortunately extremely short.It is clear the movie had a monster sized budget, and even spawned a sequel (?!). But how and why is something I do not understand. The film is way too long, has no heart and uses clichés abundantly - to the point I considered creating my own drinking game whilst watching... one drink for every sci-fi cliché! But pretty sure my liver wouldn't have survived it...Overall I was left with two key questions - how did this get made and who decided Charlie Hunham should do an Irish accent?!Netflix... just because you can, doesn't mean you should.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Is it a drama, an action-comedy, a sci-fi western? It's hard to tell, and you never really get a chance to get your bearings. As soon as the action starts, you're on a one way trip straight through this new universe Snyder has envisioned, and this vehicles does not stop.It became clear to me not too far into the movie that I was going to have to adjust my expectations if I was going to enjoy it. A thoughtfully considered and painstakingly crafted story this is not. It's more like the pulp fiction daydream of a very excitable 14 year old geek. It's less of an entree and more of an appetizer platter. It'll fill you up, but it tastes a bit strange all mixed together on your plate.That said, if you can temper your expectations with that in mind, and just enjoy the ride, Rebel Moon isn't all that bad. It has some pretty cool ideas, and the make-up work, costuming, and props are all pretty sleek, so there's plenty of eye candy in that regard. There are also some fabulous actors in the cast. They're talent is a bit hampered by the poor direction, but they're still great at what they do.Overall, I think if you can take off your critic hat for a moment, turn off you brain, and don't take the film too seriously, you MIGHT just find yourself enjoying it.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

When this appears, it looks like a giant vagina. I'm assuming this is deliberate, I just don't know why.All the scenes on alien worlds, look so much like they are in a studio, with big paintings in the back ground.The dialogue is laboured and hilariously bad. The acting is slow and over the top. I can only assume Zack was very exacting with what he wanted from the actors.Lastly the action is tame. It's full of slow mo, that shows up how shonky the fight sequences are.If you are looking for great sci-fi from recent times then watch Dunes, The Creator or Andor, these are all far superior, and their existence makes this even worse.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Character development is notably absent, leaving the audience unable to connect deeply with the protagonists. The dialogue often feels superficial, contributing minimally to the narrative's progression.

Seems like Akira Kurosawa continues to have impact on sci-fi directors (similar to original Star Wars where George Lucas took inspiration from Hidden Fortress). Seven samurai was one of the first Japanese movie I had seen, it had left an impression on how it portrayed poverty, brutality and helplessness. And that's where the story of bravery and sacrifice of few stands out. This being a Jack Snyder movie the focus is more on visuals than story. However visually and thematically it is not something new - similar to Star Wars in a sophisticated future with space hopping, there are rag tag villages, bad guys always somehow resembles nazi soldiers, and planets always seems to be nearby. Was expecting something new. This makes me feel a fresh take on sci-fi from Hollywood will take longer.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

But after more than 20 minutes everything felt so uncomfortably bad that I couldn't help but read reviews so as not to waste my time. It seems like it was a good decision.Although I can tolerate the medieval appearances of intergalactic travelers, I cannot tolerate preschool dialogue and plots as superficial as tracing paper. How difficult it can be to write something that feels like real people in real circumstances. A mystery.A shame, because I was genuinely interested in this potential new franchise. Someone get Snyder away from pencil and paper once and for all.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was supposed to be a star wars movie that then didn't get green lit, or something. You really can tell. The first 40 minutes you are painfully aware what each person's role and true appearance should have been, had this been produced as part of the star wars franchise.With the movie reminding you in most sequences that this was conceived as a star wars story, it continues to ""borrow"" (more like ""badly copy"") themes and ideas from other films.The images are painfully sterile, sometimes the green screen is more than apparent. With some films relying on well choreographed fights, paired with creative camera works, this movie relies on copying the fights from 300: a side view from the action paired with slow motion. The most creative thing this movie does is ""a slow motion of a slow motion"".Compare this to Nolan, Bay or even any Jackie Chan movie and you will crave to watch any of those movies instead of letting you get bored to death by Rebel Moon.Other imagery is stolen from The Matrix, Avatar (the Pandora one), Terminator and even LotR.There are basically no dialogues in this film. Everything feels like cheap exposition and every character talks at face value - no thinking required on the viewer's side.This movie was boring, sometimes a little funny in how bad it was (but never funny on propose).","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Well besides a lot of explotions it was boring. Lot of slow motion, when shooting, no spaceship battles and backgrounds as if we were back in the 90's. And for people thinking this complete storyline is stolen from star wars, unfortunatly it wasnt. Yes there is an evil empire and someone wielding a kind of lightsabres and there was a rebellion, but actually the main storyline is a remake of battle beyond the stars. But that one was more fun too watch. Trust me it is more useful to watch every star wars movie ever made and battle beyond the stars and all other movies this one is loosly based upon (i.e. 7 samurai, magnificent 7, 300, gladiator), than rebel moon. Yes it takes more time, but at least you will be amused a lot more. Zack Snyder you can do better than this.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The love of rooting for characters? Even tho the storytelling, script and some acting is sometimes disappointing (I was willing to overlook it), but the action is good with some very charismatic actors. So don't sit there and try to find every single failure in the film and acting, just sit there, start watching and expect nothing but a story that begins and will continue with a fair amount of action.

Its not the worst sci-fi ever made but its a bit hard to get on board a story with blatantly idiotic bad guys who are technologically advanced but cant make their own food... and a heroin who is already at the peak of her ability pretty much playing with her food most of the time, and a bunch of tragic back story tag along troops.The universe setting is essentially a copy of the Disney Star Wars trilogy with that super Jedi lady and nazi-like empire (First Reich or something?). Those were not good movies, so why try to copy them?The feel of the movie is a lot darker than star wars and remind me more of the Reddick line of films. Aside from the Storm Troopers who cant hit anything, the fighting were more gritty similar to scenes you see with Vin Diesel taking on a room of bad guys though not nearly as fun. The Reddick films didnt take themselves as seriously as this one sprinkling in some comedic scenes here and there. This had no such thing. It had a very serious tone.Overall, id say this is probably better than Disney Star Wars because those were almost unwatchable, but worse than even the worst Reddick movie. So this is maybe somewhere in between? Again its not the worst sci-fi ever made but I seriously doubt they will make a second unless they have money to burn.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, the film fails miserably on so many levels.Its pacing felt sluggish and overly prolonged-a comment I rarely make about movies. The narrative was lackluster at best, marred by subpar acting and dialogue that was just not well thought out.Visually, the movie had its moments of beauty, but there were also instances where the CGI appeared rushed and unfinished, with a soft focus that detracted from its storytelling. This seemed like a deliberate choice, but really it's questionable.The excessive use of slow motion often felt forced, over used and failed to convey the intended emotional impact.Overall, the film was a chaotic blend of underdeveloped plotlines and unnecessary scene shifts, failing to deliver on the excitement it promised. It touched on numerous storylines without giving them adequate focus or explanation and jumped between locations so much your head spins.As a fan of Zack Snyder's work, especially his version of ""Justice League,"" I had high hopes for this movie. However, it turned out to be a huge disappointment.The entire narrative of this installment could have been condensed into a 30-minute segment, setting the stage for a more cohesive story which I guess we might get in the next movie.For me, sadly, ""Rebel Moon"" rates a dismal 4 out of 10.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

From narrative to character design, it lacks any semblance of originality. The plot is a clumsy mishmash of familiar tropes, failing to offer any innovative twists. The characters are mere caricatures, lacking depth and genuine development. Despite attempts at grandiose visuals, the film falls short, unable to capture the awe-inspiring magic of the original. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, attempting to replicate the iconic lines of Star Wars but missing the mark entirely. Even the soundtrack, a feeble attempt at emulating John Williams, only highlights the stark contrast in quality. ""Rebel Moon"" serves as a stark reminder of the pitfalls of unoriginality, delivering a lackluster experience that fails to honor the legacy it shamelessly borrows from.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The worlds have so much potential. The story and background could be there. I'm really interested in some of the races and places - unfortunately we never get the details we want.The real problems here are:1. The lack of depth in the characters. They go about finding members for their team that seem to be from different reaches of the realm that we learn nothing about.2. Slow-mo everywhere. There's far too much in the fight scenes, but I can't think of any reason for it while somebody is standing still in snow. Its too bad to even be comical when they bust it out for a hug and kiss in a flashback. It doesn't increase the drama, it feels like a reason to add 20 minutes to the runtime. The choreography is so lifeless in the final fight, I found myself skipping ahead to just see how things end.3. The dialogue. Every line feels like filler that could have been written by ChatGPT. It has no life, no character, no style. It's just there to fill the silence and drive the next scene.4. Lack of any struggle. Everything just moves right along as you expect. ""There's a guy at this place that could help""... So they go to that place, and they find that guy. He say's no, they say ""aw, come on man"", he says ""ok"" *handshake*.. on to the next one.Maybe part two will be good. Big maybe.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I understand that a writer has certain works as the foundation stone for his own work, but if Zack Snyder wanted to make a Star Wars remake with different names, he could have told us.Nothing in the work feels truly authentic and all of its pieces wander freely without any real connection. The characters lack a previous story, a motivation, ideals that justify the reason for their actions, it is simply poorly written.Not to mention the annoying excess of editing such as slow-motion that is always forced into the film's visuals.

The CGI graphics are inconsistent in this film where they show moments of being impressive and other moments being a head scratcher as below the industry's average. Now as of today this movie is getting bashed by critics and audiences alike. Zack Snyder has responded by saying his Director's cut is the ultimate best viewing experience. That is my problem with Mr. Synder is that his Director's Cut is always the best version but it shouldn't be. He should be making every effort to make the theatrical release his best version for audiences. Now I won't lie there were some cool scenes throughout the film but not anything to warrant a rewatch.

However as a move, no!I will watch the second part (come on guys you ain't dune where you can justify 5 hours for this) but more in the hope that it's might serve as a spring board for a decent Netflix sci-fi series; which is much needed.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

After watching Rebel Moon, i do think it offers the viewers great visuals, cool story and also interesting characters. Overall, a true blockbuster with epic proportions. Well done, Netflix!Really hope that the bad reviews don't reflect negatively on the development of the second and third installments. I don't understand the poor reviews here and I don't get what people want from a big budget movie nowadays...
Most reviews here suggested that the story and characters are very weak, which is absolutely not the truth. Rebel Moon has similar vibe and style like Rogue One in my opinion and should be considered in the same category.Hopefully, people start watching and enjoying movies more, because right now most enjoy only critiquing everything that comes out. I was about to skip this good movie only because of the poor comments and rating. Glad i didn't!","11 out of 27 found this helpful.

I have yet to see any film by Zach Snyder that is remotely watchable. However, I decided to give it a go and was barely ten minutes in when I was already regretting it.The biggest problem is it doesn't know what it's supposed to be. With far too many elements that are a direct rip off of a New Hope, bits of Game of Thrones, the Seven Samurai and The Matrix sprinkled on top it just doesn't make any sense. Consequently the action sequences appear to be thrown in to just to try and keep you from spotting the absence of a coherent plot. Zach Snyder should have taken the hint when the makers of Star Wars rejected this, they had good reason too, it is dire.None of the characters grab you and make you root for them as they are all so one dimensional. Why Charlie Hunnam delivers his dialogue in a poor Northern Irish accent is a mystery too.It's just awful on every level. I fell for the hype with Justice League and again with this. Never again will I fall for the dross that Zack Snyder turns out. Netflix have managed to deliver a massive turkey this Christmas.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The voice of Anthony Hopkins as an orator for the story is a misscast. His voice is slow, spluttered and tired, not the start you expect from something great and exciting. It continues on from there. We are moved from a beautiful planetary view down to a field being plowed by a solitary slim 100 pound woman with an antagonism towards a friendly male. Its just odd and off.A little later a ship lands in the village but its so poorly filmed, that you can see that the shot is of a physical miniature model bcs the dust caused by the landing is off in scale. A few scenes later and the clear misscasting continues to roll in. The male character Gunnar played by Michiel Huisman performs so badly as an upset or sad man, that Im getting ready to leave the theater.Furthermore the dialects are making no sense, you clearly hear the actors are from scandinavia, south africa and yes brittain which makes no sense considering this clearly plays out thousands of years in the future and the dialects of our time would not remain. And why do the bad guys look like german soldiers straight out of some WWII movie?? I was just shy of expecting a nazi salute.Later, some soldiers grabs a girl who is screaming but the only person coming to help her is the 100 pound woman in a village filled with strong men.... I mean.. whoever wrote this didnt think this through. Its just not believable.The story continues and the 100 pound woman starts a mission to gather a
possy to defend the village. They are suddenly in a western movie with aliens and a guy offer them their ship. They find Tarzan chained working as a blacksmith.. ..noone thought to realise a blacksmith could easily unchain himself, since hes a blacksmith...
The movie continues on like this. The dialogues are stiff, the acting is off, scenes doesnt make sense or are out of place, its offputting to say the least.I dont know what happened when filming this but its clear they didnt aim high. I cant imagine anyone feels good about the end result. I doubt there will be a part 2.Dont expect much, ..in fact just skip this alltogether. You are better off not seeing this. Its shameful.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

To say that I still walked out disappointed would be an understatement.The film, writing and direction is devoid of any clear personality. Everything looks drab, and the film never manages to latch on to an identity that makes it stand on its own two feet. Synder has shamelessly borrowed story elements and world building from other, greater Sci-fi. Dune, Star Wars, The Fifth Element and Warhammer 40K have all been scraped by Synder in an attempt to painfully dress his film with an outfit that barely fits, and hangs loose in all the wrong places. It's the equivalent of copying someone's homework; while you can provide a finished piece of work, the understanding of how it was made and why is completely missing. Synder has attempted a space opera without fully understanding what makes them so great in the first place.There is no companionship or development of bonds and friction between the main characters. Instead, the film wastes well over an hour recruiting individuals across the galaxy (system, universe? The scale is never actually explained), before throwing them together and hoping something interesting forms in the melting pot.Synder also seems incapable of listening to any past criticisms of his work, and instead decided to double down. Overley used slow-mo, an over reliance on anamorphic lenses and shallow focus shots. They're all here. It makes watching the film nauseating at times, as 80% of the shots are blurry and out of focus. Someone needs to take the camera away from Synder, and give way to someone who knows how to do the job.I'm disappointed. Synder has been riding on the laurels of a film he made well over 15 years ago, but the gravy train is finally coming to a halt. While ambitious, his technical ability and talent isn't able to keep up with his ideas, leaving his films devoid of love, coherency and meaning.Avoid.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

After watching...I'm actually shocked the score isn't lower.I'm convinced the run time of this movie would be about 30 minutes shorter if it wasn't for all the slow-mo b#llsh!t.As my title states, this movie is such a rip off as other reviewers have stated.Harry Potter wants it hippogriff back (buckbeak). Star Wars wants all its ships back. Halo wants their guns. The Nazis want their uniforms. Star Wars also wants several of their characters returned. The Magnificent 7 wants their merry band of misfits. There are so many ""borrowed"" ideas it doesn't feel original at all. Zack Snyder himself imagined this as a Star Wars film and also admitted ""borrowing"" elements from many different films. Borrowed or more like fully stole. So the film is one big Deja Vu and not in a good way.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I can't even say what I liked about this film... I'm not sure I would whether I wanted to watch the second part or not, but if I watch it, it's only out of respect for Zack Sneider. The cast is very strange... I didn't like the acting... the script is simply missing...It's not clear why they should fight with these farmers if they are so technically advanced.there is little in the logic of this film that is clear... I hope in the future Zach will make good films.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

All the ingredients are there, cool female lead, amazing action scenes, thousand out of nowhere slowmo. But I just can't stand how boring this movie are.1. ACTING. If you have seen enough scifi movie and TV shows, you already know what will happen, so the only thing director can do to keep your attention from slip away is write interesting characters and creating great chemistry between main characters. I recognize almost every single characters, all of them are capable of giving actual performance. But all there interaction feel like so blatant.2. CONTENT. Feel like director extrude a 8 episode tv series into a movie. Too much checking boxes the characters have to check, rushing from one place to another, as a consequence as a audience you don't really care any of them. You don't care the good guy get killing for helping the protagonist, you don't even care the betray in the end, because you simply don't care any of them getting killed of not. I simply don't understand why Zack urgency to rush and squeeze so much plots into Part I. He should really watch Dune part I, that's how you do a proper part I.3 ACTION scene. It's alright for a Netflix movie.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

But while and after making all those okay superhero movies he seems to have lost his taste and skills. Army of the Dead was just schrott (not that kind of trash that somehow gets the blessings of resurrection by the almighty Gods of Cheese) and sadly, Rebel Moon is the same kind of formulaic and generic affair: the story grabs every cliche of sci-fi and action movies imaginable (Star Wars, Dune, Riddick comes quick to mind, and of course Seven Samurai), the characters are, to be tender, rather uninteresting, the score and sound design an underachiever. On the pro side the production is solid and the cast too. The fact, that a director does not improve but gets worse may be a sign that Snyder lost his love for the art of movie-making - I don't have any other explanation for his loss of skill and craft. Not a total disaster and watchable, but that's about it.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Fight scenes are good, action is rip-roaring and Sofia Boutella is a good lead and great action actress.

So with an open mind I pushed passed the sloppy intro narrative, ignored the lazy screenplay/set-pieces and forgave the poor visuals that make no attempt to hide what's the set and what's CGI, and tried to focus on the good. And oh boy, not trying to be dramatic, but it's never been so harder to watch a film through.The acting is not what it should be, the talent has been wasted and some scenes really are just awful. Seems rushed almost, or perhaps something else but eitherway I wouldn't be surprised if actors later come to mock this film in the same way Ryan Reynolds pokes fun at Green Lantern.But surely the story is good right? Well, yeh, it's fine i guess. If you haven't watched star wars, dune, the best of the marvel films or avatar (there's a beast taming moment that smacked of it) then yeh this will be a visual treat not seen before so fill your boots. But I guess if you haven't seen those films that suggests this ain't going to be your cup of tea in the first place! Basically, i reckon everyone involved is there for the paycheck, this surely cannot be a passion project. Lazy, boring, unoriginal rehash of greats we've already had before it.This is in the same category as Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets as that too fell short of what it could have been, but at least Valerian, I think, is still a fun watch and had originality. The negative reviews for this one were so justified. At least good actors got a decent paycheck. That's positive at least.Oh nearly forgot, what's with the obsession with slow-mo!? Expertly used if your goal is to quickly tire the viewer of something that, when used right, is awesome. Seriously, don't bother with this one. Such a shame.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

This one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever seen. At no point in your storyline, were you even close to anything that could be considered a movie worth producing.

The actors all felt wooden, the General Titus stand was a particularly jarring moment. And why are all the men shirtless? Do they not have weather, climate, or apparently clothing shops in space.I found myself wondering how long the movie would actually be if they played all the slo mo sections at normal speed, it was laughable the amount it was used. There was a firefight scene where lasers are being fired everywhere, so it was a joke to see a character suddenly stand up and do a hero pose (in slo mo) with things exploding all around them and then go and do something. The plot armour is strong in this film, main characters are not hit despite literally thousands of bullets being hurled at them in a confined space.The saving grace of this movie is the visuals, CG, set and clothing design. They were very well done.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Director Zack Snyder's pitch to Lucasfilm might've been a bold move, but watching ""Rebel Moon"" makes it abundantly clear why they passed. It's like ordering a deluxe burger and getting a soggy bun with a hint of ketchup instead.The film tries to juggle a platter of elements - war, betrayal, space politics - but ends up dropping them all. Princess Issa's plotline, with its healing and resurrection abilities, feels like a cheap magician's trick in a narrative that's already gasping for air. The characters, rather than driving the story, seem to be on a space cruise, admiring the CGI galaxies while forgetting their lines. It's like watching a chess game where the pieces move randomly, hoping to stumble upon checkmate.Admiral Atticus Noble, our villain, is as intimidating as a cat in a shark costume. The attempt at depth falls flat, making him less of a feared military leader and more like a disgruntled office manager. Kora's journey from a soldier to a reluctant hero could have been compelling, but it's handled with the subtlety of a blaster gun - loud, flashy, and ultimately pointless.The film's pacing is like a malfunctioning hyperdrive - slow, jittery, and leaving you nauseous. Key scenes that should evoke emotion or excitement are as engaging as watching paint dry in zero gravity. It's a puzzle where the pieces don't fit, creating a picture that's both confusing and forgettable.Lastly, ""Rebel Moon"" is a masterclass in how not to pay homage. Its aspiration to be ""Star Wars"" is so transparent that it feels like a fan film made without understanding what made the original so magical. It's like dressing up for a costume party as your idol, only to realize you forgot what made them iconic in the first place.In summary, ""Rebel Moon"" is a missed opportunity - a space opera that hits all the wrong notes, leaving its audience floating in a void of disappointment. For a film that had the potential to launch us into a thrilling new universe, it sadly fails to leave the launchpad.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

There's certainly a lot more to explore and a lot of character development to dive into. Thanks Snyder for giving us this peace of art!Unfortunately, anything that is not obvious is not appreciated.

No, nothing will save this.The plot is just too close to you know what, even down to the senator reference. The phrase cut and paste comes to mind, with added popular references and allusions. Note the multi coloured bunting similar to that found in the himalayas, mixed into a viking village....face-palm.Ok, the subjective bit... I grew up in South Africa and I'm sorry, but I just cringe when I see south African actors trying to act. Arnold Vossloo is one of the few who can actually act. But he's not in this.Objectively speaking, the characters played by the South African actors are of little or no importance to the central plot, so why are they given so much time? The scene with the robot reflects the typical South African macho brain dead attitude. I just found it off putting and only served to sully the film, even more. I'm glad I didn't watch this with my 12yo - the rape narrative was too much. I understand how this served as the tipping point, but let's be honest would you rather be served a turd? Or a Sunday roast?A few more objective points: far far far too much time is spent on one single scene: The Village. Virtually half of the film is like an ensemble piece set in a village. I absolutely love the Nflix 1640 series, but I get nothing from watching this. The film would benefit from depth and breadth if 2 or 3 different locals were switched between, instead of this utterly boring linear thread in one place, then the next place etc etc. More low-fi than sci-fi.The bar scene...cut & paste.Big bird scene LOR cut & paste complete with elvish sounding language.Solderan...? Alderan? Chat gpt could have done better.Come to think of it, chat gpt probably could've done the entire film better (laughing face laughing face laughing face)
Just a little aside.... why did they make the spaceships look like actual boats and submarines? Makes it look like a childs fairytale book.Best bit... When she throws sand in the guys eyes, just about the only clever and practical thing in the whole film.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, it also has a number of weaknesses, including weak dialogue and a script that is not as well-developed as it could be.Dialogue is one of the film's biggest weaknesses. Many of the conversations between characters are stilted and lacking in substance. This is especially true for the supporting characters, who are often reduced to clichés.The script is also a disappointment. The story is rather simple and predictable, and the characters are not developed enough to really engage us.In addition, the film has a number of pacing issues. The action is often interrupted by long sequences of dialogue or scenes that are not relevant to the story.Overall, Rebel Moon - Part 1: The Child of Fire is a weak film that fails to reach its potential. The film has a number of strengths, but they are overshadowed by the weaknesses.If you are a fan of space opera films, you may find something to enjoy in Rebel Moon - Part 1: The Child of Fire.

What could go wrong. Well a lot by the looks of it. Not surprisingly massively long just to be able to string it out into more than one part. Psssst here's a secret, you could probably fit it all in during one movie if you cut out all the boring unnecessary bits, just a heads up snyder.The story is either really really simple or I'm just thick and missed the whole point of the film. Revenge? In a word covers it along with freedom. Like other reviews I agree, loads of different concepts and ideas from other sci fi and action films mashed together like different coloured play-do pieces being rolled up as one. It's all just so all over the place and not individualistic. I'm blaming netflix as DC might have just tipped it over the edge into palleatable. Top marks for trying but it was all very PG and a bit bland.Careful we don't see too much blood there's children still up! Make something for the over 12s man! On a plus note it is something I would recommend to watch if there's nothing else on and you have almost completed netflix, it's not that bad and there is a star studded cast. Give it a go but don't expect too much, and don't lose the remote as there will be plenty of bathroom breaks needed.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

So many problems with that movie. Firstly plot: seems like is not plot in the story, definitely don't make sense. It looks like main story is just generic something about the universe where movie have a action and don't make sense with the characters and their stories, actually is hard to describe it because is that bad. Utterly awful.. Wild west in medieval system and Roman empire in fantasy science fiction universe story is like crackhead idea. If think Steven Segal movies don't make sense Rebel Moon take nonsense to another level..you can write big essay or a book what is wrong with this movie. To make a movie longer maker's decided to abuse slow motion scenes - is absolutely horrible use of slow motion it seems like editors guidance was ""just make slow motion, mate"". Definitely not going to watch continuation, big budgets access to all resources and making so horrible films I've completely lost my faith in netflix.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

""Ah, Warriorwoman, who once killed 16 of my men with nothing but a sharpened cheese wedge, we have not met since our last fight when I killed your entire family and made you very sad.""The villains are fascist caricatures with no depth. It reminded me of the anime Hellsing, where the villains were Nazis, but not Nazis who thought they were racially superior as an attempt to cope with post-World War I national embarrassment and scapegoat an innocent population in the process... Rather, they're just Nazis doing evil because they like doing evil, and making war because they like making war. Rebel Moon villain writing is that level of depth.Their costume design is almost as lazy as their writing, being almost copy-and-paste Nazis and Catholic Cardinals. I'm not offended by the messaging there - to the contrary, I'm fully on-board with it. I'm offended by how absolutely lazy and unoriginal the delivery of that message was.It's like Foundation if you lobotomized it. It's like an unwanted child of Star Wars... it *is* an unwanted child of Star Wars. It's the most Disney-feeling non-Disney film I've ever seen.I have watched so much scifi. Maybe every English scifi movie on Netflix, and many not on Netflix. This is one of the single worst pieces of scifi media I've ever seen. The only piece of scifi media which competes in awfulness which I can immediately think of is Dark Matter, a series which feels like you let a 12-year-old goth kid rewrite Star Trek. (I can say that, I was a 12-year-old goth kid once.)Special effects and set design are cool, I guess. I watched the whole thing. I spent most of that time frustrated by how terrible it was, but sometimes that was interrupted by a few seconds of appreciating a set or alien-animal.Go watch Foundation or Annihilation or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds or Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams or Star Wars: Andor or Tales from the Loop or a million other shows instead of this.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

3) You'll probably be bored and fast-forward anyway...
Basically this movie is littered with time-fillers, meaningless shallow plot, and just trying to build everything up to one epic battle (the second movie is pretty much the same cookie cutter). Some things just don't make sense - sword fighters in a battle of lasers, evil villains without logic, etc etc
Others mention a lot of ""borrowing"" from other movies - I don't mind that, but seems like the only recipe here is borrow as much as possible from others and mash it together - forcibly.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Part One gets a 5/10, they did nail the hell out of the visual effects, I'll give them that.Side notes: Most of the characters were casted very well. A couple of them lack the intensity they were shooting for.As far as people complaining comparing it to the Star Wars universe.

No nuance. Each scene is a quick transition with very simple dialogue. Every character picked up has limited introduction or a mini game like test to complete to become part of the end goal. Sometimes main characters just sit around while important situations need remedied for no reason than for the other to complete that mini game.Characters are so easily convinced to join one cause or the other. Not much loyalty. Aesthetic and clothing design is pretty awesome except for some random white button up and skinny tie ordeal with a bowl cut? Is this 1985 or the future? A whole movie in and don't know why people are good or bad or how people are rebels or who is in control. Don't know why they're fighting the enemy, why the enemy is fighting them.Everyone is saying star wars clone. It has more chronicles of Riddick vibes but with a new hope farm world beginnings and a goofy heat-saber. The background cgi is muddy and basic. No clean vision for what cinematography is trying to be displayed. Why does every alien world movie have a random Scottish accent??There are 3 legitimate star wars copy scenes. Now a matrix copy scene. Made it even further in. Why is all the CGI dark billowing clouds or fog in the background? Better backgrounds in 70s CGI. Snyder couldn't get over the 300 Persian/Spartan hangover it appears. It's over. Don't know what's going on really. No answers. Left with only questions. Ugh.

Unfortunately the whole effort is spoiled by a complete lack of effort on the part of the writers. The ""recruitment story"" is soo completely contrived. ( dues ex machina?? ) the characters are brutally shoe-horned into the story with almost no effort to weave them in organically. I hate to be mean, but it feels like a 15 year old boy wrote the story and dialogue (and noone proof read it for him). Looking back on Jack Snyder's writing credits before this, there is a predicable string of woefully scripted movies (in terms of dialog), wonder woman, 300, justice league etc... Its a real shame if he had employed some skilled writers it could have been a really great sci-fi film.

I can picture Zack Snyder will fix this problem with his well known ""just release a five hour long cut"" which is a joke because who needs a full five hours to pull a simple story out of a hat.I have nothing against Zack Snyder as a director in fact I think he is brilliant but his problem is that no matter how good of a director he is he cannot write to save his life. This is apparent in how his best films are all written by other people such as James Gunn. Then again I am not a fan of his overuse of slo-mo which makes his action scenes seem almost Bollywood-esque.Overall no matter how much I want to enjoy it (which I do the world it is set in looks amazing) I can't due to its atrocious writing that rips off and overuses tropes from other franchises like Star Wars or Warhammer 40k.(Gave it a cheeky two extra stars because I still feel it looks nice visually at times)","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The special effects were, for the most part really good.The actors are talented and played their parts well.The costumes, make up and set designs were beautifully done.The action sequences are great, when time isn't slowed down so you can see whatever.Cons :
Poor time management. Had there been less cloak flapping and otherwise unnecessary ""artistic"" sequences, it would have been way shorter.The story is just boring. Everything has been done before except maybe the closing scene and that would have been a better story than what was given.I genuinely doubt the director understands what constitutes entertainment to an average viewer.I understand that an original story is hard, but this was borderline a rip off of Star Wars in many places.Is there even a point to a second part?What happened to the robot?

I loved the movie ! I was in from the begining to the end and now I m waiting for the director's cut and for part 2 ! It's beautiful, the rythm is good, action scenes were alive. The trailer didn't spoil the movie so it was pleasant to discover the world in what RM is set.Just an advice : make your own idea on it, you can like or dislike it, no problem but don't trust ""professional"" critics cause here clearly some of them where really biased. More when you see some of them giving nice reviews to last MCU or DC movies ^^' clearly be smarter than what they expect from you and make your own idea :)","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

I love Zach Snyder as a film maker. Even his divisive Batman V Superman was better than this abomination. I hear there is an director's cut out there. Like 2017's Justice League was an absolute shambles, maybe the director's cut can salvage this movie from being a disaster. We got the director's cut of Justice League and though not perfect, it was a whole lot better.This was Zach's version of Star Wars which had a lot of promise but failed miserable. I'm sure there's a better movie in there somewhere. I feel Netflix really dropped the ball on this one, because l hear there's a R rated version available and why the hell didn't they show that one.

And this is another soft retread that leaves shallow footprints and occasionally wanders off the path in slow motion.The dialogue is stiff, and blunt. The acting seems oddly constrained. As with most of his recent output, Snyder makes something that feels like a video game cut scene rendered in half decent CGI.Ultimately you can watch this as another attempt at a sci-fi epic that telegraphs a wild west backdrop with homesteads and trading posts. It's something that Firefly pulled off two decades ago, and certainly did it with more heart and skill that ln here.It's not offensive, but that's damning with faint praise. As little as I enjoyed the recent Star wars films, this is no moon.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I felt like this movie was a mash-up of stolen ideas poorly squished into one. It's like the bad Star Wars (recent ones), meets a little Dune, meets Dollar Tree Guardians of the Galaxy, meets a bunch of random bits from others. The action was always the same, with the main girl running from bullet/lasers in slo-mo just to kick some butt. The plot is really terribe. It starts really slow and waiting 90 minutes just to see something ""decent"" of length was annoying. The ending was obvious just due to the title, Part One. Overall, if you are stuck on your couch and want to burn two hours of your life since you've watched everything good already, watch it. Otherwise, just be grateful you didn't pay theater price to see this.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The acting is decent, the writing is somewhat lacking when it comes to character building which results in somewhat less result than I feel it could have been. The story however is still coherent enough and the visual effects are fantastic! One thing that I did notice is that most scenes had amazing cgi but there were a few scenes that looked poor in comparison to the rest of the film. After watching the entire film I could not feel as though we were missing some scenes that were cut out to reduce the film in length. I am told that the directors cut comes in at just over 3 hours in length and Snyder said its almost a completely different film! I am betting that the directors cut is far superior to the release we did get as it would likely fill in a lot of that backstory we feel is missing.Beyond everything I mentioned above, the score is good, cinematography is top notch. The real detractor to this film is the missing back stories that were removed to shorten the run time. I feel if we were to watch the director cut it would fix all these problems.Overall the film is still good. Very entertaining if you are in to science fiction films. I feel as though this film has been review bombed by many people for stupid reasons. I am going with an 8 out of 10 for this one based on the fact that I very specifically enjoy science fiction films. The entertainment value is there, you just have to go into this one with some reasonable expectations and if you enjoy this type genre then I feel you will agree with my score also. Watch this one if you like science fiction and Snyder films!","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

1. Music was solid
2. The palpable horniness of the movie makes for a few chuckles, such as spaceships coming out of warp via ethereal space vagina, and the antagonist being very into tentacles.Cons: So many
1. Weak plot, and pacing... and writing. This is effectively Seven Samurai in space. It's a template that has already been written and executed on countless times - should be easy. Except the intros for the warriors feel rushed and sloppy. There's not a lot that makes you care about them. They also just tamely tag along with the bare minimum of provocation, and their scenes are so rushed. They don't feel impassioned to help the protagonist; they do it because the plot expects them to. Then you get hit with several minutes of ultra tragic backstory flashback that feels like it was written by a child.2. Weak acting. Sofia Boutella delivers lines woodenly and doesn't make me care a whit about her backstory. No one else who matters gets enough lines or attention to warrant their inclusion. I enjoyed Charlie Hunnam in The Gentlemen, but felt he was wasted in his role here, as were Djimon Hounsou, Doona Bae, Anthony Hopkins, and Cary Elwes.3. Weak action scenes. Snyder's trademarks abound: overabundance of slow motion, fist fighting in storms, dumb decisions. There's a tavern brawl where every bullet is fired in slo-mo, but the amount of exaggerated muzzle flare obscures everything, making me wonder what the point was (as of writing this I'm still unsure). The main character does not feel like some legendary space warrior, especially when she does things like forgetting she has a gun and running at the bad guys headfirst, with plot armor being the only thing saving her from laser fire. That kind of bravado worked in 300, but makes no sense in this context.4. Absolutely stupid sets and set pieces. There is a wooden mechanized sliding door? All the frontier stuff is made of wood despite no evidence of trees on these planets? It's the future, cement would be cheaper to manufacture. High-tech imperial cruiser, whose pilot/gunner is protected by weak glass that is pierced by a pipe? Firefly portrayed better ""sci-fi frontiership"" and had more sensible tech.It feels like Zack Snyder has gotten worse over time, relying on the same gimmicks more and more, and not learning how to deliver a coherent plot in an appetizing manner. I'd rather re-watch Sucker Punch than give this franchise another go... and Sucker Punch was very disappointing.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But this is another definite ""miss"" for hit-or-miss Snyder.First, the good. The cinematography is often stunning, and Snyder frames shots well. The artistic vision is solid and gorgeous, the overall aesthetic a mix of Mobius and Warhammer. Weird and creepy and varied aliens abound.But the visuals alone are not enough, and the story seems like something amateurly constructed to serve the visuals rather than the visuals serving the story. A perfect example of this is the -- gorgeous! -- shot of an android Cernunos near the end, apropos of nothing except the many issues of Heavy Metal magazine that Snyder, like me, has surely read.The dialogue is passable (sometimes just) but as with many poor Netflix serials where either an attempt has been made to squeeze too much material into too short of a time or the writers are just bad writers, too much is told via exposition and neon-signed Meaningful Moments rather than shown through plot and character development. Sophia's character suffers the most from this simply because she has the most lines. But I'm not sure she could pull of a bad-ass woman like Ripley or Sarah Connor anyway even with good dialogue, her demonstrated skill in other roles notwithstanding. ""Grrl power"" -- and her character wasn't the only boss babe -- isn't actually badass. It's just silly.Anthony Hopkins' combat android was actually the most intriguing character by far and we got far too little of him.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plotline worked for the magnificent 7... but it does not work for a conflict between a small village and a galactic empire.The action is okay I guess. Yet too much slowmotion. The acting is... meh... not sure how they got Anthony Hopkins involved. Should have maybe used him more often.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Decent. But could have been a lot better","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9522525/?ref_=tt_urv","pianoman-16","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2400332/?ref_=tt_urv","27 December 2023","""Rebel Moon,"" a film that recently graced the screens, is a striking example of how a visually stunning movie can captivate an audience while simultaneously leaving them yearning for more substance in its execution, particularly in terms of acting and depth of narrative.From the outset, the film establishes itself as a visual spectacle. The special effects are nothing short of mesmerizing, creating a vivid and immersive universe that can only be described as a feast for the eyes. Each frame is meticulously crafted, with attention to the finest details, making the world of ""Rebel Moon"" feel alive and bustling. The action sequences are particularly noteworthy, choreographed with such precision and flair that they keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Explosive, dynamic, and often breathtaking, these scenes showcase the pinnacle of what modern special effects can achieve. They serve as the backbone of the film, propelling the story forward with a relentless momentum that is both exhilarating and visually arresting.However, beneath the veneer of these stunning visuals and heart-pounding action, the film reveals its more tepid layers. The story, while intriguing, borrows heavily from the classic ""Star Wars"" narrative, giving it a familiar, almost derivative feel. It's a tale of rebellion, tyranny, and the classic struggle between good and evil, set against a backdrop of distant galaxies and futuristic warfare. While the story is engaging to a certain extent, its lack of originality prevents it from being truly compelling. The plot unfolds in a predictable manner, and while it manages to maintain interest, it never quite achieves the depth or complexity that could have elevated it from good to great.The acting in ""Rebel Moon"" is perhaps its most notable shortfall. Despite boasting a cast of talented actors, many of whom have proven their mettle in other productions, their performances here are underwhelming. The characters, while visually striking, often feel shallow, lacking the layers and nuances that make for truly memorable performances. It's as though the actors are aware of the film's emphasis on aesthetics over substance, leading to performances that are competent but lackluster. There's a sense that the cast could have delivered more, had the script and direction allowed them to explore their characters more deeply.This leads to another critique of the film - its apparent focus on physical appearances over acting prowess. Many of the characters are portrayed by actors with impressive physiques, which, while visually pleasing, adds little to the depth or believability of their characters. It seems as though the casting decisions were made more with an eye towards aesthetic appeal than fitting the role. This choice, while understandable in a film that places such a high value on visual impact, ultimately detracts from the overall quality of the performances. It gives the impression that the film is more interested in showcasing its cast's physical attributes than in delivering powerful, convincing performances.In conclusion, ""Rebel Moon"" is a film that dazzles with its visual effects and action-packed sequences, creating an immersive and visually stunning world that is a joy to behold. However, this focus on aesthetics comes at the cost of depth in both story and character development. The acting, while not terrible, is far from the best work of the talented cast, and the emphasis on physical appearances over character depth is a missed opportunity. The film is enjoyable for what it is - a visual spectacle with an action-packed narrative that echoes the classic ""Star Wars"" vibe. However, it falls short of being a truly great film due to its lack of originality in storytelling and the underutilization of its cast's acting potential.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Special effects can be forgiven as they are budget enforced, but simple believable interaction and conversation between characters should be a given at any level of film making. It was rumoured that this was once offered to be part of the Star Wars franchise and I am glad that it was refused (even the last trilogy was better than this). There is a part two to follow but I wonder how much interest it will create for those who have sat uninspired through the first instalment. Giving a low score gives me no joy but two stars is well deserved.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

I love sci-fi and build in a lot of leeway, but at some point I stopped watching this as sci-fi and started to marvel at how any adult director could consistently make ""artistic"" decisions that most 12 year old girls would consider childish and cliche.Maybe they'll reveal that this was actually written and directed by AI?

There are single frames here that are pieces of art. But also like a lot of Snyder's work, this film is let down by a terrible script. I know this was originally a Star Wars script and was influenced by films like 'Seven Samurai', and it's honestly better than some recent Star Wars. But the story lacks cohesiveness. It feels like a bunch of random scenes just thrown together. Half of the world building and character design is amazing and very unique, and the other half feels lame. The characters are all one-dimensional and cliched, with clunky robotic dialogue (Charlie Hunnam's accent is cringey).

"3","/10","A generic sci-fi movie with shooty things and a lacking script","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9535272/?ref_=tt_urv","Silverdashmax","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur131062286/?ref_=tt_urv","1 January 2024","A few tldr comments to make before I expand further:
""Visual effects with a small side of story""
""Sci-fi for the sake of profit""
""Generic lines lead to a lack of a cohesive character""
""Too much telling instead of showing""
""Too much story for 2 hours of screen time""
""Worldbuilding a toddler could achieve""Before I start the detailed review to save some of you some time, if you wish to turn off your brain and watch some flashy lights dance around the screen then this movie is for you, if you wish to watch something with engaging content then this movie isn't for you.Ok so starting this review I'd like to say that the visual effects are fairly good, between the group I watched this with and myself we could only note one scene where it felt the CGI was rushed and poorly done, and even in that scene the portion of rushed background effects only made up a few frames that easily could've been cut and had no real meaning in the movie. Cutting those frames would've had no effect on the movie so why post production chose to keep those frames in despite the lacking visuals? Who knows.Besides those few frames however the visuals and cinematography were stunning. Which is what leads to my first point. That this movie felt like a whole lot of visual effects with little storyline. Given that writers strikes didn't affect this film and that production was complete by the time the strikes started it's arguable that this movie stands as reasoning to not give in to writers demands as they seem to contribute very little.Elements of this movie felt disjointed like we were hopping from one franchise to another with very little inbetween leading to the thought that this movies was sci-fi for the sake of profit; get as many action figures and cool sci-fi things as you can slap them together without any consideration of whether they actually fit together and hey presto, you get this film.To add to this when a movie heavily relies on visual effects and disjointed sci-fi elements you'd at least expect the individual one-off lines to be unpredictable, fresh and embody the emotions they're meant to convey. Unfortunately the individual one-off lines that're part of this script don't even sound like something a living thing would say, the robot in this film that got 2 minutes of screentime conveyed more humanity than any of the leads as main characters were given generic lines expected of any modern action sci-fi movie.While speaking of the script I feel it's appropriate to point out that outside of these one-off generic ""I'll get you next time"" lines the script heavily leans to exposition as filler. Instead of showing us what had happened or what is going to happen the movie loved telling us, as if the audience had no brains, what was happening.For example instead of showing us a scene in which menacing and powerful character, cloaked in black, silently ignites a threatening red laser sword to then proceed in ruthlessly cut down rebelling forces in a small hallway, the director instead would chose to have a scene where the rebels sit around a fire and say things like ""they has a big red laser sword"", ""they're very scary"" and ""they're the most dangerous person in the universe"". If the movie was this review I'd follow that example with something like ""this is just an example to show the level of exposition in the movie and neither scene is actually in the movie.""
If you're now wondering why there is so much exposition in the film and the director doesn't show rather than tell, it's simple showing the audience what happens would take much longer. In the example above the hallway scene, where the director 'shows' us the menacing character in action, would take about 2 minutes, but the campfire scene, where the director 'tells' us about the menacing character, would take about 20 seconds, which leads into my next point that this movie simply has too much story for a 2 hour movie.During the span of this movie as pointed out earlier, it felt like we were hopping from one sci-fi movie to another, giving some characters lengthy well thought out introductions and other supposedly ""main"" characters about one minute of introduction that felt meaningless. If instead each ""main"" character was given a 1 hour movie to introduce them and the sector of the universe they come from, then the franchise could've lead up to something of more significance later, where deaths, betrayals, love stories and other conclusive actions would've meant more to the audience as we would've been able to relate to them and build actual emotional investments. However the movie was clearly cut short so that all of that potential emotional investment and character relation was scrunched up in a ball and flushed down the toilet.To end let's revisit the world building in this movie where we previously stated that this movie got in as many action figures and cool sci-fi things as possible and smashed them together. Well, it's just that; most of the world building feels borrowed like something that's been done before, you have mythical creatures, an generic evil army, a lost prince/princess who gives the promise of a better future, some compassionate robots and a small group of highly talented individuals that have some random reasons to fight against this big bad army. Boom big blockbuster movie goes pew-pew and bang!In conclusion this movie feels like the epilepsy inducing version of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, a weak script with some big action scenes and the audience goes ""wow look at those big flashing lasers I've never seen before"" or ""wow some cool CGI animals I've never seen before"". One thing the audience won't be saying is ""wow that story was really compelling and interesting.""If you got bored while reading this lengthy review, then trust me; the review is more interesting than this movie.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

In essence, this reminds me very much of Star Wars: A New Hope. Bad guys come and a sassy lady farmer decides to take on the whole empire but needs the help of a handful of others. So part 1 is basically a movie of traveling to pick up all the characters needed for part 2. The problem is that there is no character development. There are only back-stories and ""why this person is important"". There are some cool action scenes but there are a lot of times where you have to suspend reality and just go with it.The visuals are striking at times, other times they are dark and/or out of focus. Some of the CGI looks like it came from the SyFy channel.Most of it is just meh.As far as the actors, Sophia doesn't come across as believable in the lead role. I liked her in Kingsman but she didn't seem to have the range needed to be the main character. The other characters are a hodge podge that you'll know and 2 of them seen to be wasted in their roles. You'll see what I mean if you watch it.Don't waste your time. This movie wasted a good premise and could have been so much more. Mediocre acting, canned plot line almost carbon copied from A New Hope, and so-so visuals make it barely a 4/10.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Every fight scene has the over use of slomo and it really just grates on me.Overall: meh.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

It does not have the depth of either of them, and definitely not the scenario... which is a problem if you consider Rebel Moon is 60 minutes longer at least than the 7 samurai ! The character are most of the time so transparent that you could anticipate their moves and dialogues, except when they lack consistency : some outbursts come from nowhere and create a surprise but not in a good way unfortunately.A huge disappointment.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

What makes me most sad is the thought that Netflix probably canceled something I enjoy to fund this garbage.Is Snyder even capable of original thought? I knew going into this that it'd be bad, I mean, Snyder's track record isn't great. But this is on another level. Bad script, bad acting, boring pace. In typical Snyder fashion, he relied on visuals so much he forgot to give it substance.The movie bounces from recruit to recruit with little to no back story. It's as if he just expected viewers to care about who these people are but forgot to give us any reason to. But it's ok, because they look cool.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

After watching part one on Netflix tonight, I am so excited for the future of this series. In the first 20 minutes I was thinking to myself... This is so much better than any Star Wars story or movie I have watched. Especially in recent time. I think the directors cut will give time to character development and storytelling. This theatrical cut definitely felt a little rushed, but at the same time the heart was there. I feel like people lose sight of, and criticize Snyder for lack of story, and maybe even criticize his dialogue. But the story is told through the visuals and the musical score. Emotionality is conveyed. Everyone is allowed to their opinion. But I have always felt connected and been emotionally moved and inspired by Snyder's movies. Excited for where the story goes. It's crazy that something like this could be on Netflix given that even the movies with twice the budget like 100 million more dollars Are not up to this quality.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Snyder has taken so many ideas from other films and directors and just mashed them into this nothing of a movie. It's boring, the fight scenes seemed horribly staged, the villains were cliche and I just couldn't care less about the village or its people.So I stopped watching about 30 minutes in.

However, despite these grand aspirations, the film struggles under the weight of its own ambitions.It's apparent that Snyder aspired to join the ranks of directors who have masterfully created their own space odysseys. Unfortunately, ""Rebel Moon"" comes across as a muddled homage rather than a distinct narrative. The film tries to blend elements reminiscent of ""Star Wars,"" ""Dune,"" ""Mad Max,"" and ""Avatar,"" but this fusion results in a confusing and disjointed storyline that lacks originality.Snyder's direction, usually a strong suit, feels erratic here. The film's pace is uneven, oscillating between rushed action sequences and sluggish expositions. The narrative tries to juggle multiple themes and references, but ends up losing its unique voice in the process.While ""Rebel Moon"" boasts impressive visual effects and cinematography - a hallmark of Snyder's style - these aspects cannot compensate for the story's shortcomings. The stunning visuals, though captivating, feel like a facade, masking the lack of depth in the plot and character development.The cast delivers commendable performances, but they are hindered by the script's limitations. The characters lack depth and their motivations are often unclear, which makes it difficult for the audience to form an emotional connection with them.In his quest to create a space epic that could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the greats, Snyder's ""Rebel Moon"" unfortunately falls short. The film's overreliance on established tropes from other famous works results in a lack of originality and a confusing narrative. It's a visually striking journey, but one that ultimately feels hollow and unsatisfying. Zack Snyder's ambition is commendable, but ""Rebel Moon"" serves as a reminder that a successful homage requires a delicate balance between inspiration and innovation.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

They go to their planet, get their introduction and after that they are just background characters. So if they had done more character work the plot twist would have actually hit, the death that was played with so much dramatic effect had NOTHING going for it, because the character was in the movie 5 minutes. There's a character introduced, in the first act, we never see him again, until the end and that's just a shot, something like, hey remember him? He exists.The action sequences aren't that interesting as well, and that goes to my second biggest issue with his movie, why so much slow motion? Like, I know Zack Snyder loves slow motion like Tarantino loves feet shots, but Jesus he uses slow mo like a 10 year old who just found out what it is. If he took away all the unnecessary slow mo, there is a solid 10 extra minutes he could have used to actually make a better story or flesh out some of these characters.Story is boring and gets repetitive after a while, there are so many good ideas in there as well, but they aren't developed properly, that's why this feels more like a rip off of Star Wars or Seven Samurai, instead of feeling like it was inspired by.There are so many plans for a Universe around this, movies, shows, comic books, even Video Games, and if they do go forward at least they can do those things knows it's quite hard to do worse than this introduction.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Its resolved, done and just moves on. No feels, no growth - why even bother.So why even bother watching this film ?Well - if you can lie to yourself, there is something in it, which you can extrapolate, imagine, how it supposed to be felt, what the idea was - but the implementation is.... bad.Jupiter Ascending was better...and that one, back then, was ""bad"" - now it feels actually not soo bad anymore, after watching this.So be careful, if you rly think of watching this.

There's even one section of slow-mo included in a fight on a space station... for ... absolutely no good reason whatsoever... In particular the cinematography lets down other production values - the interior of Kai's ship, for instance, looks and sounds authentic - but even the craftsmanship applied there can't save the rest.Credit where due to the cast - Boutella makes the very best of turgid lines; Ed Skrein is up to his Zapan-era, scenery-munching best ... but even his energy can't bring this turkey back to life.Somehow I doubt people sitting through two hours of this will care enough to watch the second half.Do yourself a favour - if you haven't seen it, avoid it.

Just adding spaceships and lazers does not make Kurosawa's movie a Snyder original as I have seen it being described. The second part from what I see on the trailer will be even more close to the original, as the training and war preparation scenes are almost similar to the 1954 movie. Again, this is not a bad movie, but it is reasonable why Star Wars said NO, as this is by no means an original script. If I write Romeo and Juliet in space, would that make it my original story?

If you've not watched Rebel Moon on Netflix yet, please save yourself the bother. I could give a long explanation as to the many reasons why, but TL;DR - it's a lazy, derivative, boring rehash of every fantasy/sci-fi and western trope ever. The only potentially original character is the Anthony Hopkins-voiced robot, which is woefully underused - appearing only in 10% of the film. Bizarre overuse of slow mo served to make even some of the action sequences boring and formulaic and they are the best bits of a bad bunch. Art direction was shocking, showing how used we have got to really good sci-fi art direction (District 9, The Creator, Dune, the majority of Star Wars output) - this just felt a confused mess of styles, albeit borrowing heavily from Starship Yamamoto, Warhammer 40K, Bladerunner, Dune and even Starfield (recognise the bridge of Charlie Hunnan's ship?). Such a shame as there is definitely a place for an original, new space opera - but this isn't it.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I'm frustrated by such a demonstrably outstanding filmmaker settling for the continuous construction of uninspired & tedious mediocrity when I know him to be capable of far, far better.I mean yeah, on the one hand, ""Rebel Moon"" is a vast improvement on ""Army of The Dead"" (though that's not saying much; the bar is in hell after his previous unmitigated disaster that failed to even meet the usual standard set, merely in terms of aesthetic quality), yet that's the only viable endorsement I can reasonably give because once again, it doesn't feel like he's actually challenging himself here.Zack Snyder's basically provided us with his alternative take on ""Star Wars"" & that's exactly what this product is, in the simplest of terms... Zack Snyder's ""Star Wars"" - another copy + paste sci-fi franchise (you could recognise from countless other blockbusters / TV series), unoriginally put to the screen (with no attempt to hide the plagiarism) but with his signature visual style pasted over it - in an unconvincing attempt to assemble some form of uniqueness.In fact, it's disheartening to witness a talented individual reduce their gift to what comes across as a cheap gimmick; lensing other genres through a bespoke, superficial Instagram filter that can be tailored mindlessly to fit each project, refusing to convey anything meaningful via the transference between stories.Even the release of his latest feature feels akin to a desperate, fake imitation of ""Justice League"" (artificially endeavouring to capture that same demand / interest - borne from entirely different circumstances); rather than distributing his original cut (I can't understand why they'd withhold it intentionally now - Netflix is known to fritter away money so the notion they'd prefer a safer investment by first airing a more palatable version is utter nonsense), they're keeping it from us in the hopes of deliberately orchestrating another viral movement on social media, demanding his extended iteration... It's all so corporate & staged.Is this his brand now?","8 out of 23 found this helpful.

The pacing was great at keeping the story moving without spending a bunch of wasted time on trying to win awards with crying monologues or whatever. The detail that every place and prop was dazzling. The Candled Bartender blew my mind and then it keep going.All in all Rebel Moon a great sci-fi film that doesn't fall into the nostalgia trap of Star Wars where every world is a dessert to save money.

The film isn't terrible, but it's not especially noteworthy either. It's the kind of movie where, upon watching Part Two in spring 2024, I'll likely find myself struggling to recall what happened in the first one and thinking, ""Who are they again?"". There's nothing particularly memorable story-wise, nor are there moments that keep me on the edge of my seat.That said, considering the ambitious scope Zack Snyder is attempting - building a brand new world filled with numerous characters - a two-hour movie just isn't enough to fully engage my interest in anything, including the main plot. I'm aware that Part 2 might offer some improvement, but ideally, I should have been captivated within the first 15 minutes of this film, which unfortunately wasn't the case.Yes, the plot is your typical ""mighty empire seeking domination versus a band of mismatched rebels"" scenario. It's a trope that's been done many times, but that in itself didn't bother me. I was hoping Zack Snyder would bring a fresh perspective to this type of story, but unfortunately, he did not. This story could have been exponentially better as a series, spanning multiple 6-8 episode seasons, allowing for deeper world and character building.In other words: ""make me care"".There should be a rule: if a story features more than four to five main characters, each from vastly different backgrounds, it should ideally be developed into a series (or at least a 3-hour movie). Apart from the main protagonist, well-played by Sofia Boutella (who brings a sort of John Wick vibe), I found it hard to care about the other characters. I don't even remember their names, nor do I understand why they joined the cause. It's not that they aren't interesting; it's that the film didn't allow enough time to get to know them and empathize with them. The same goes for the main villain, who is evil just for the sake of it. I also didn't have time to immerse myself in the universe they inhabit.On the plus side, the action scenes are well-executed, except for the overuse of slow-motion (still a thing in 2023?). The special effects are definitely the highlight of this movie.So, can Part 2 redeem Rebel Moon? It's a steep hill to climb.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I particularly liked the world building, as well as the special effects.Sofia Boutella is a great choice to lead the ensemble, her performance is one that I thoroughly enjoyed throughout. Ed Skrein is solid in a, shock horror, antagonistic role (does that geezer ever play a good guy?), I've found him quite meh in other movies but here he is very much a positive. None of the others onscreen stand out on their onesies, though as an collective they are a fairly strong cast.I genuinely had a good time with this, can't ask for more than that. I'm fairly lukewarm on Zack Snyder movies, this is the seventh of his work that I've watched and 'Man of Steel' and this are the only ones that I'd actually class as exceptional.

With the large cast of characters constantly being introduced to us with no real time to flesh them out, there's really no investment in any of them, and it feels like if this was a series they could have gotten a full season out of just putting together the protagonist's crew.This movie has the bizarre paradox of being visually pleasing, while also having some of the laziest and most poorly choreographed action sequences I've ever seen, and how these scenes made it past the cutting room floor makes me think that Snyder didn't actually look at them and just assumed they would be great. Somehow, the slow-motion fight sequences are even more sloppy than the real time ones, and make it look like everything was shot in one take. This, combined with multiple scenes in which bad guys could have just shot the main characters in the face point blank and inexplicably didn't, ruined the action that was supposed to be at the core of the movie.Effects were awesome, costumes were great, but it wasn't enough to save this. A season 1 of Rebel Moon chronicling the life of the protagonist as she climbed through the ranks of the ranks of the military from war orphan to war hero would have been conceptually and visually better than the 2 minute flashback that we got muddled in the many tangled parallel subplots.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It follows the moon of Veldt and a small farming village upon it as a Motherworld warship stops to buy grain from the villagers. What follows is defiance by the villagers and the threat of them all being wiped out. The movies story follows Kora an ex-imperium soldier and once bodyguard to the Crown Princess Issa a child gifted with power and expected to usher in a new era for the Motherworld.The story follows the adventures of Kora as she tries to recruit other warriors to defend the village from the motherworld warship and it's sadistic Admiral Atticus Noble. Overall an enjoyable enough story but a bit slow, though hints at a deeper mystery surrounding the Motherworld and the assassination of it's royal family and ascension of regent Balasarius are dropped through out. Look forward to more and to seeing how the story and world continues to develop in future installments.The cast is pretty awesome with wonderful performances from everyone including Sofia Boutella as Kora, Ed Skrein as Atticus Noble, Charlie Hunnam as Kai, Djimon Hounsou as General Titus, Stuart Martin and Anthony Hopjins to name but a few.The VFX and SFX however is the biggest draw of the movie with absolutely insane visuals and a enthralling soundtrack.Overall a solid and well deserved 8/10 from me. Not everyone may agree, but I see potential to the Rebel Moon film series and I'm definitely interested in seeing and learning more about the history of the Motherworld and what happened to the royal family that allowed Balisarius to ascend to regent of the Motherworld. The movie has a decent enough storyline that once again I'm interested in learning more about, a star studded cast and brilliant VFX and SFX.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

He purposely chose Sofia Boutella as his lead since she is suited for action sequences but lacks the skills as an actor to make her character believable. Snyder also decided to employ the same tried and true images, including slow motion and stop action in fight scenes, that have been used rather than being creative. I assume that most people would rather see action scenes with extended fighting, car chases (which thankfully didn't appear in this fantasy, Sci-Fi tale) or scenes with light sabers that belong in the Star Wars World as well as unbelievable and impossible physical stunts. And, as usual, there is a Nazi-like evil character that even dressed the part and his supporting characters that were reminiscent of other films. In true Star Wars fashion there are intergalactic characters and a scene that reminded me of the Star Wars' cantina scene. Snider made the effort to establish the background story of Kora's (Boutella) fighting ability but that also wasn't adequately developed. The film actually showed promise for the first half hour with the invaded planet where Kora resided. There is a surprise ending in Part 1, however, but even that was somewhat disappointing. As a purely action film it is very satisfying but otherwise it is lacking with overwhelming cliches.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

First, there's nothing to establish this as a ""mature"" movie beyond the presence of more violence, bad language and the suggestion of sexual assault. 'Rebel Moon' might be harder-edged than 'Star Wars,' but it's not a nuanced depiction of state and rebellion. The baddies are all despicable villains with no subtleties and the heroes are all well-meaning, aw-shucks underdogs who just want to live in peace. There's no questionable morality or blurring of the lines between heroes and villains; this is a very simplistic good vs evil universe. 'Rebel Moon' might have a high body count and some genuine nastiness in it, but there's never any question of who is doing the right thing. That's not mature writing, that's just adding blood to a children's story.Secondly, we've already had an adult-orientated alternative to 'Star Wars,' and it was set in the actual 'Star Wars' universe. The 'Andor' TV series was a masterpiece; a multi-layered, intelligently written sci-fi series that rightfully, won critical plaudits and fan praise. It is an absolute must-see and one of the best depictions of fascism ever committed to film. In its wake, 'Rebel Moon' seems one-dimensional and old-fashioned. 'Andor' was ""Star Wars for adults,"" but 'Rebel Moon' is ""Star Wars for edgy teens.""Which is a bit of a shame because there are a few things to admire here. Visually, it's stunning. This is a universe of beautiful landscapes, vast spacecraft, creepy human/spider hybrids and all manner of eye-popping delights. 'Rebel Moon' doesn't engage the brain, but it does stimulate the optic nerve and it looks terrific. Plus, let's not ignore the fact it's an original intellectual property and that has to be celebrated. We're drowning in franchises right now, so to see a new one trying to poke through is worth championing. However, it also feels artificial. A lot of franchises spun out of movies that were written as one-offs, but found a huge audience and grew organically. This was written for the sake of being an extended multi-media project of films, novels, videogames and comics before it even earned a single fan.In other words, not great. 'Rebel Moon' isn't boring, but it also isn't exciting or engaging to make a fuss over. It's just sort of, there. The fact it doesn't really have an ending is irritating as well. The entire two-hour runtime consists of them gathering up all the characters for the big adventure they'll have in the next film. It wouldn't surprise me at all if Zach Snyder typed ""science fiction, I'm assembling a team, two hours,"" into an AI script generator and then filmed the results.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie is poorly reimagined bits and pieces of various Star Wars movies, The Last Kingdom, Harry Potter and who knows what else.

It will have at least one deep character (more than one would be nice) with a background that you feel obligated to study and understand.

It's a movie you can watch selectively, enjoying the war sequences where the CGI and art direction shine. Yet, when it comes to the story, there's a lot left to be desired.Firstly, it's hard to ignore what feels like another instance of Hollywood's recent trend: portraying female characters as unequivocally stronger, smarter, and more capable than their male counterparts. This approach, while intended to be empowering, often comes across as overdone and unrealistic, especially when female characters outmatch men who are physically much larger. It's perplexing to see this kind of narrative repeatedly green-lit, as it seems to feed into a stereotype rather than offer a nuanced portrayal of strength and capability.The male characters, in contrast, are often portrayed as traitorous or too weak to fight, which seems like a missed opportunity to explore more diverse and complex character dynamics. This one-dimensional portrayal contributes to a feeling of disconnect from the story.As for the plot itself, it treads familiar ground but fails to captivate. Although the film starts promisingly, it soon loses itself in an over-reliance on visual effects and hurried character development. The introductions of the protagonists feel forced rather than organic, detracting from the overall storytelling.Comparing ""Rebel Moon"" to the storytelling mastery of the original ""Star Wars"" series highlights a significant decline in narrative artistry. One can't help but wonder how the story might have unfolded had it been crafted in the 1970s by someone like George Lucas, without the pervasive influence of modern trends.In summary, ""Rebel Moon"" is a film that may appeal to Gen-Z indoctrination love.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

While it delivers on the space and the samurai-esque warrior women, the ""Seven Samurai"" part feels more like a whisper than a roar.Strengths:Visually stunning: Snyder's signature slow-motion action sequences are undeniably impressive, with vibrant neon landscapes and brutal zero-gravity combat.A strong female lead: Sofia Boutella is charismatic and fierce as Kora, the reluctant warrior tasked with defending a beleaguered colony.Intriguing world-building: The film creates a distinct dystopian universe with hints of political and environmental themes waiting to be explored.Weaknesses:Thin plot: The story feels derivative, borrowing heavily from classic samurai and sci-fi tropes without adding much originality.Underdeveloped characters: Aside from Kora, most characters are thinly sketched, leaving less emotional investment in their fates.Pacing issues: The film drags at times, particularly in the exposition-heavy first act.Overall:Rebel Moon: Part One is a visually dazzling sci-fi adventure with a promising premise, but it lacks the depth and narrative punch to truly set it apart. It's a decent popcorn flick with flashes of brilliance, but viewers expecting a groundbreaking space epic might be left wanting more.Recommendations:If you're a fan of Snyder's visuals and enjoy classic samurai and sci-fi stories, you'll likely find something to enjoy.For those seeking a more complex and emotionally resonant sci-fi experience, look elsewhere.Final verdict: A visually stunning popcorn flick with potential, but ultimately a middling chapter in a saga waiting to be truly ignited.I hope this review strikes a balance between being informative and adhering to the safety guidelines you outlined. Remember, this is just one perspective, and others may have different opinions.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

He is an incredible director. He know how to set the mood in a single frame. I didnt mind his overuse of slowmotion that definitely add drama and 'cool factor'.. But that script is uninspiring at best. It encapsulate all the cliché trope you can think of and then drag it for a solid hour for a gathering party fiesta. Go to this planet, recruit that character type, go to this planet, recruit him also... rinse and repeat until the undeserving final act. It manage to get boring, really fast despite a stereotypical but strong start. The dialogs are dumb, the story is dumb and Zack need to stick to direction if he want to be taken seriously. This was a joke, not even waiting for the second part, i dont care.. Characters are unidimensional and a parody of the stereotype the are suppose to embody. The visuals are great,.world building is good, and the fews action scene there is, are great. Hire some good writers and stop reusing the 50 years old trope we already know.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I actually loved this film! I know some negative reviews are trying to be harshly against the film because it was ""Inspired"" by Seven Samurai and most other types of films, but honestly, which other films haven't been that way before? This however is definitely not a ""Rip-off"" of Star Wars at all, it is a completely different story compared to Star Wars. It appears such expectations were too high with not enough open minds to take it all in differently. At least I went into this film just open minded, lowering my expectations, without ""Nit Picking"" on parts of it like I used to. Because I enjoyed this for what it is and that's that. It's only a story to setup more happening in part 2, which made total sense. ""Rebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver"" needs to hurry up though, because it will truly explain a lot more and go deeper. This is part 1 after all. It's a Two-Parter type of film, and patience is the key to slow-paced films like this. Hopefully more installments take place after.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

While I tried to keep an open mind, I couldn't shake the feeling of disappointment. The characters felt shallow and uninspired, and the storyline lacked originality, leaning heavily on familiar themes reminiscent of Star Wars, albeit executed in a less compelling manner by Zack Snyder.I'm skeptical about Netflix's hopes for this film's success, as I couldn't muster much enthusiasm for the idea of additional installments. The prospect of a sequel doesn't excite me, considering the lackluster experience I had with the first part. While some may appreciate the visuals and setting, they failed to captivate me or elevate the overall viewing experience.It's disheartening to witness the polarization surrounding this film, with many blindly praising it while others hesitate to voice their true opinions for fear of ridicule. However, even with an open mind, I struggled to find redeeming qualities beyond surface-level entertainment.

Given Snyder's track record with films like the 300 series, Man of Steel, and the director's cut versions of Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League, I was intrigued by his take on the classic franchise of Star Wars, hoping for a dark and visually stunning experience.However, my excitement turned into disappointment as the movie failed to deliver on multiple fronts. The weak narrative made it difficult to connect emotionally with any of the characters, as the pacing was too fast, turning the plot into a series of disjointed scenes. The film seemed to lack substance, featuring a group of characters with forgettable names banding together for reasons that didn't warrant attention.Rebel Moon felt like a continuous stream of aliens, generic sci-fi elements, and action sequences that induced headaches. The slow-motion technique, which is a trademark of Snyder's style, was overused to the point of diminishing the impact of every action scene. While some may praise the cinematography with its visually appealing shots, the motion blur during action sequences left much to be desired.Despite the anticipation of a Star Wars rival, Rebel Moon fell short, featuring few moments with aliens that were not visually impressive. The potential salvation of an extended cut was mentioned, but the idea seemed more like a cash-grab opportunity than a meaningful enhancement to the narrative. Given that Rebel Moon was released on an OTT platform, there was no need to wait for an extended cut; releasing the complete version from the start could have potentially improved the overall coherence of the storyline.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This current generation of online complainers more than likely spent most of their time on their phones typing up their complaints instead of actually watching the film, and obviously have the attention span of a fish.IF they HAD actually watched this first part of this proposed trilogy, they would have enjoyed a fantastic start to an epic space adventure.The overall 'feel' of the movie was overwhelming - gorgeous cinematography, fantastic characters and creatures, gigantic space battleships and brilliant GGI.Sure, the dialogue was definitely not Shakespeare, but it was as good as any other movie in this genre. The acting itself was more than adequate and as for the plotline, although simplistic, it held together quite nicely without falling into plotholes or sillyness.Reviewers, get over yourselves, stop being so nit-pickey!And why complain about Sofia Boutella being able to fight off the bad guys in the movie just because she's female - her character is a super trained warrior and she can totally kick ass!Guys... get over it!In fact, the whole cast was very good. No complaints. Quite honestly, it was a treat to watch and left me wanting more... now!I love sci fi movies and this is one of the good ones.

The set designs were superior. The plot line was certainly laid out for us ... easy to follow and very easy to root for the good guys and for the bad guys to be vanquished. The movie certainly had its share of good actors who knew how to carry the load. Those are the positives. The negatives were overpowering. The film lacked subtlety, nuance and was heavy-handed to the nth degree. I felt as if I was watching a B-Movie from 1965. Or maybe it was more akin to a sub-standard video game from 2000 that was geared toward adolescent boys. There was over use of slo-mo and overemphasis upon machismo without character development. Sometimes it seemed as if I was watching a bad Western. The musical score was the absolute worst. There was no score when needed and then it overshot its intended effect by utilizing short bursts of soaring vocals and kettle drums which (I assume) was supposed to transport us in a similar manner as we were by the score in ""Gladiator"". The next thing I knew, I was watching Ninjas fighting sexualized, anthropomorphic spider-monsters using demonic light sabers. What-the-actual-heck was that ? ! ? ! There is no director's cut that can save this mess. I wanted to like this film. I REALLY wanted to like it. Calling it a hot mess is being kind.","11 out of 36 found this helpful.

For me personally? I see ""Zack Snyder Movie"", I already know this is going to be train wreck... and this one is in slow motion.Because somewhere half of the movie is a slow motion, in the places where there shouldn't be any slow motion.Acting, Direction, CGI, Dialogues, Story, Universe - Everything is terrible.Characters act like total morons, going out in the open and yelling that they are searching for rebles - despite few seconds before that saying they shouldn't talk too loud cause they can get noticed...Crew members, just join our 2 protagonists because they join. We know nothing about anyone.To be fair, we get to know one line of history from their past when there is big exposition dump by the main baddie in the last 10 minutes of the movie.CGI is horrid, it's so blurry and cheap, some shots look like they were pulled straight from 90s video game cutscenes.Dialogues in this movie are written probably by AI, because normal people don't talk like this.And every time characters talk with each other in the movie they have to speak SLOWLY and take huge pauses between sentences, because ZACK SNYDER thinks the viewers are (REDACTED).I had to watch this atrocity with breaks. Because I couldn't sit through it. Glad it wasn't a theater movie because I'd probably leave.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

To describe it as long and boring is an understatement. It's like reading every word of a 2000-page novel about something very dull, and which is written in a foreign language one doesn't speak.The director is perhaps the most overhyped director in the history of directing. This movie is just amateurish. I found myself fast-forwarding through the long boring bits before realising that the entire thing is just one long boring bit. Hollywood has been taken over by people that don't know how to make movies worth watching. They only get away with it because the NPC audiences are sufficiently large. Those of us with more than one brain cell to rub together might as well just forget about the concept of the photoplay. There's just nothing worth watching anymore, especially if this soporific bilge is anything to go by. It's depressingly bad. Compare this garbage to the Star Trek movies, or Star Wars. Just behold the difference in the writing, directing, and editing quality. This is a joke in comparison. It's nothing but empty acting, empty script, and empty story. What the hell has happened to Hollywood?","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

This is a fine fun sci fi adventure of a similar story featuring a rag tag farmer warrior assembling a most unusual army to fight an over bearing evil empire taking everything in its path. This movie stands on its own and need not be compared to anything else, with exception to battle beyond the stars. It's quite fun and lots of action and visuals that are quite stunning. I'm always amazed that so many bad reviews are people who expect the first Star Wars or something they've already seen. This is just a different story of a different kind, enjoy it for what it is. Loved the main character in her movie ""the mummy"" and she's very good here as well. No questionable content, nudity or foul language, some blood and gore and some violent fight scenes, cgi is excellent and beautiful. So are all the cool various species of aliens. I'm sure you'll enjoy this movie as much as I did. I will see it again a few more times. Can't wait for the next parts.

His DC films are dull and miserable affairs with the occasional cool spectacle. With Rebel Moon: Part 1 the not complete edition, he hopes to deliver his version of Star Wars. And he did just that, without anything that made Star Wars good.All the characters are forgettable, none of them are memorable. The villains are comically evil and lack any of the charisma or intimidation required from good villains. Any new character is introduced and then shoved aside. No one gets any form of development or character arc and are all derivative of better characters. The acting is not much better, everyone appears bored. It's a shame because the likes of Charlie Hunnam and Ed Skrein can deliver fun performances, but Zach Snyder doesn't allow fun.The plot is just cliche after cliche, all of it derivative of better movies. This entire film is poorly paced with what feels like so little happening in 2 hours and yet at the same time it feels rushed. I'm sure the Snyder Cut will rectify these issues but it's just stupid that Zach can't deliver the movie he promised in the first time. What makes it worse is Snyder's massive over-indulgence in slow motion. Dear god, every scene has it and it's so pointless. It makes the movie drag and any potentially interesting action sequence is ruined by it. This film lacks any moment of halfway decent spectacle and the CGI ranges from good to laughable. The only positive I can mention is the soundtrack has its moments.Overall, just watch Star Wars. I doubt part 2 will change my opinion of Rebel Moon and I know well enough that Snyder's director's cut will not improve this film massively. A film so bad that it's not even memorable. A bad film can be fun, but this is far worse.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I didn't have extremely high expectations, unlike when we saw Avatar 2. I just wanted to have a good time, and what a great 2 hours of my life it's been. I'm a huge fantasy fan, and this is what you get. Pure escapist bliss, where you can just sit back, and enjoy a good movie. Definitely recommended, but don't expect it to be anything ground-breaking. I don't think that every movie has to be extremely meaningful, and come up with entirely original stuff. There's nothing new under the sun, and I think people need to let go of this idea that they'll get a ""Lord of the Rings""-level fantasy film 2-3 times a year. So overall, manage your expectations and just enjoy the ride, that's my tip for you. It's pointless to keep looking for thibgs that could be better, you're just ruining the experience.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

Very little to tell.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9524840/?ref_=tt_urv","mr_sharma","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4803434/?ref_=tt_urv","28 December 2023","This is meant to be a story that Disney rejected. A Star Wars story that had to be rejigged to become something ""R"" rated.I know why Disney rejected the idea.Zac Snyder is hanging on to the coat tails of 300 and to a lesser extent The Watchmen. Both based on comic book stories written by people who understand story.Snyder's skillset is trying to polish a core idea with OTT visuals.The problem is that recently he's been polishing turd.Justice League (the Snyder cut) was better than the original but that's like saying 15 day old milk smells better than 60 day old milk.To Rebel Moon then. All the hallmarks of bad story telling (of a bad story) wrapped up in unnecessary amount of wrapping paper. You open the present only to find that's there's a lot of wrapping paper but very little else.It is just Justice League really. Every character is ""bigged up"" by someone telling you. Take General Titus. He's a genius. He's a genius because someone refers to him as the ""genius"" General Titus. And.....do we see any of that genius on show?.....nope. Nothing. That's it. Pointlessly chewing up the scenery. We know he's a genius because someone tells us he's a genius.You have a character whose whole purspose is to have no shirt on. By God he has a magnificent body. And I'm a heterosexual man! But every scene he's in, I'm thinking...sorry did you say something. Every chuffing scene. No shirt. Why? Eye candy for some of the viewers but absolutely nothing for the story.And this visual splatter gun smorgasboard goes throughout the film. The overall world building is lacking. Even if you had questions, by the end, frankly, you're not bothered if they are answered.You simply don't care.And Snyder does the most Snyder thing. You think the film has ended. Long drawn out zoom out shot of our heroes standing there looking victorious.....cut....to our heroes on horseback....talking about how all is good in the universe (with that fella with no shirt still topless) then zoom out shot of them riding into the sunset. Tadaaaah. The End..... nope there is another scene.And to add insult to frankly a mess of a story....it says END PART ONE. Because the word OF is like so last decade.It's a waste of time that you would really only watch if you wanted to waste some time.It isn't good. No. Not good at all.4 out 10.Sorry.4 out OF 10.END PART ONE.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Really like this one. Solid sci-fi movie. The visuals in this movie look great. It has a good story, is easy to follow, but not overly simple. You understand the motivations of the characters, and it starts to fill out some of their backstories. The action scenes are great and feel exciting. The acting was good, and I really liked the characters, even has great villians. It felt like a big screen epic, and not like a straight to video movie. Does draw from other sci-fi but also feels like it has its own identity. I don't understand the hatred or dislike this one's getting. I'm really looking forward to the second part.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

But this movie is the worst movie I watched in the last two years.Normally you get to see a mediocre movie on Netflix with top Stars. But this movie is so bad. That the mediocre Netflix movie seems to be a 9 out of 10.So i am now still left behind with question marks how that could made it to release. Did the test audience fall asleep in the first 20 minutes of the movie and everyone then said the movie was great?Don't waste your time like I did and spare you this experience.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This is literally the plot of every samurai movie without Tom Cruise ever made. Snyder generically plucks from other genres and directors to patch together a very generic script. So it's pretty typical Snyder but it lacks the gorgeous and innovative cinematography that makes people think Zack has more talent than he does. So removing Snyder's eye for lush scenery and sexy action, you're left with a cookie cutter sci fi film that you could see on YouTube.The casting is really rough. Not only are the actors poorly chosen, but on this planet everyonr looks human but no two characters that aren't related look remotely similar. I get you are looking for diversity but they checked literally every box once.Back to the script, one mind boggling thing is why someone would fight a superior opponent for a couple minutes only to pull out a weapon that kills them immediately.Snyder needs real writers and a real editor. He loves his own stuff so much that he takes the final product for granted. Bottom line, Snyder loves the smell of his own farts and he Dutch ovens the audience with this one.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I don't know why, but my best guess is that this is the only way the viewers will actually pay attention to this train wreck's story....The whole story leaves you questioning why you started the film in the first place. Very little to no explaination is giving to explain what is going on.

Snyder really seemed to push the genre forward with this movie, it felt fresh and not just some copy pasted marvel movie that's been beaten to death at this point.Honestly I was shocked to see how reviews were so overwhelmingly negative with this movie, I went in because it looked cool and interesting and I was not disappointed! The movie tells you from the beginning that it is part one of two, this tells me that part one will be the setup, so naturally it will be slower paced which is fine with me, it's like reading the first half of a good novel. The setting the characters and the narrative are all beautifully set up in a way that had me wanting to know more, the movie doesn't give away too much too quickly so it kept me interested the whole time.My only criticism is that some of the scenes were a bit cheesy, some character tropes were a little cliche, and the slow motion scenes were a bit much. But overall didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Maybe with more breathing room Rebel Moon could easily have had a valid reason for existing besides being a space opera to fill in the Star Wars and Star Trek cinematic voids (currently).Simply put, Netflix wanted to make this as a 'rival Star Wars' franchise, but the problem is that these universes NEED depth right off the bat. And this one is waiting for either a directors cut or a clearer vision with less cliches to pick out of the proverbial raffle hat.Rebel Moon is a multimillion dollar copy-and-paste job that seems like a passion project which became a feature length missed-opportunity-and-a-half for 2023 and Zack Snyder. Maybe Part Two will be an improvement? Who can tell with these things?2/5 stars. For all it tries with its impressive visuals, the film seems like it's trying to be certain with its world building while being completely uncertain on whether to make this new world actually feel real to the viewers.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

There is little to no character development for any of them during the whole movie, we don't learn their backgrounds, their morals, their personalities. It is fast paced game of Pokémon, got to catch them all but without any substance, story or character arch. It is rushed and you don't care for them.Point 2. Bad story telling and pacing. Everything is choppy and fast paced that you don't get to be immersed into the lore and galaxy. It's like they jumped from one green screen to another.Point 3. Too many similarities to Star Wars that made the story predictable and unoriginal. I wanted this movie to give us a better or different story completely. It failed to do so, it became boring and lame.Point 4. Too many slow mo's that leaves you bored and frustrated. Many unnecessary scenes with slow mo. It would have been better to have faster paced scenes but the director went crazy with the slow mo.In all, I am very disappointed as this could have been very good if the movie had better writers, script, editing and pacing. The opportunity to make a darker Sci-Fi with an epic story and lore has been sorely wasted by Zack.If there is going to be a Rebel Moon 2, there needs to be a lot of work to correct all the mistakes the first one movie made.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The storyline unfolds on a planet filled with farmers who are confronted by a military unit that kills their leader and demands their entire upcoming harvest. An orphan among the farmers understands the ruthless nature of these soldiers and the lengths they'll go to collect on their demands. She decides to enlist the help of other soldiers on the planet to form a rebellion against the oppressors.Directed by Zack Snyder (300), the film features Sofia Boutella (Hotel Artemis), Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond), Charles Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy), Doona Bae (Cloud Atlas), Ray Fisher (Justice League), and Ed Skrein (Deadpool).This movie had everything it needed to be great: a compelling set-up, well-developed characters, a mysterious universe, and elite special effects. The science fiction elements are gorgeous, and you genuinely care about the main character, who is easy to root for. The action scenes are top-notch with great violence and shootouts. The premise is well-established, and there are some good subplots too. Unfortunately, with about an hour to go, the film takes a completely new direction with over-the-top action scenes, shootouts, and circumstances that feel ridiculous - one after another. Even the dialogue and storyline fall apart at the end, to the extent that they should abandon the idea of a sequel.In conclusion, this starts off looking like a science fiction masterpiece and concludes as a science fiction dud. I would score this a 5/10 and recommend skipping it.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Starring Sofia Boutella and Ed Skrein, it embodies all of the typical Zack Snyder tropes one would expect for better and for worse.In a faraway galaxy, the militaristic empire known as the ""Motherworld"" has ruled over the galaxy's systems for centuries. The Motherworld send their military leader Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) to the farming colony on Veldt in an effort to strike a deal with the inhabitants of a small village to sell some of their grain. After the village elder (Corey Stoll) declines the offer, a farmer named Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) disagrees with his decision, which prompts Noble to beat the elder to death and instead demand all of the village's grain before he returns. A lone villager named Kora (Sofia Boutella) reveals to the others that she is a former high-ranking member of the Motherworld's soldiers and teams up with Gunnar to assemble a group of warriors from other worlds to defend Veldt from Noble and his troops.If there were ever a more sharply divisive director to have worked in the past twenty years, it would be Zack Snyder, whose very name conjures up mixed opinions among audiences and critics alike. Throughout his career, Snyder's style of filmmaking has won him many fans while also earning him his fair share of detractors in the process. Whether you love him or hate him, there's no arguing that Snyder has definitely made a name for himself in the cinematic world. With Snyder's latest film ""Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire"", the controversial filmmaker attempts to tell his own version of ""Star Wars"", but instead it feels more like his take on ""Jupiter Ascending"".A common criticism among most of Zack Snyder's films is their weak character development, and this one is no exception. When we are first introduced to our protagonist, Kora, we see that she acts distant from the other villagers regarding her origins and won't go into detail about why she is staying there in the first place. Later when something bad happens in front of her, Kora demonstrates her physical strength on those causing trouble and is then hailed as a hero by the village. Normally, this type of characterisation works in a film's favour, but I found Kora hard to connect with due to how derivative she is of other protagonists in similar films of this genre. Kora seems like a slap-dash amalgamation of so many other heroes in extraordinary situations that I already knew how events were going to play out for her in the end, and that's exactly what happens.Similarly, when we watch the ironically named villain Atticus Noble demonstrate his cruel streak, he comes across as cartoonishly simplistic in his motivations. This may have been done to make him seem like a personification of evil rather than a potentially redeemable tragic villain, but aside from that there's nothing about Noble that makes him all that interesting as a character. There are other supporting characters littered throughout the story as well that either have little significance to the plot or are just there to peddle exposition to the audience in the most flat way possible. Practically everyone feels like a stock character, only there to fulfil the purpose of a particular scene and nothing more. Aside from Kora and Noble, I struggled to remember the names of any other character in the film that I even slightly cared about.Additionally, there are also major problems with the structuring of the plot. There's never enough time given to any world-building elements before the film cuts away to a completely unrelated scene afterwards. For instance, in one part we see Noble and his soldiers invading another system demanding to know where they are hiding any rebels. What follows is him briefly interacting with the system's leader with the latter begging not to have his people slain, a request that quickly falls on deaf ears. I would have liked to have known the significance of why Noble had chosen this specific planet during his search but before we properly learn who these people are, he's already given the order to wipe all of them out. Most of the film functions this way, with only glimpses of the different species of the galaxy's inhabitants that are reduced to being little more than cannon fodder for the villains.On a more positive side, the film does have some nice visual effects to go along with its otherwise flawed presentation. As brief as they were, I did appreciate seeing the way that the varying types of worlds looked throughout the story, as they had areas that seem to hint at what they were like before the Motherworld took over. There was this city that actually resembles a once bustling civilisation that has now been reduced to a ghetto-like slum and another desert-like planet that looks as though it has been left abandoned for some time. Had the film focused more on combining these great visuals with proper world building, then it could have been a more appealing story.Also, some of the action scenes were quite exciting at times, mainly during the third act. If there's one great thing that Zack Snyder movies usually contain, it's a thrilling climax and this film certainly has just that. Without giving away spoilers, I enjoyed the showdown near the end, as it was among the few parts of the story that actually had me invested the whole time. The cinematography was on point and the character motivations made sense within the context of what was happening. Even Snyder's signature slow motion is used quite effectively here too. It's just a huge shame this is the only instance where I truly cared about what was happening in the story, as virtually nothing else in the film elicited this type of reaction from me.As mentioned earlier, the characters are all rather uninteresting and poorly developed. I didn't really care much for Sofia Boutella as Kora, as she lacks the charisma for a leading role like this. Although she's more than capable of handling the action sequences, when it comes to the dialogue she falls flat. Boutella's accent hinders her delivery of certain lines to the point where it doesn't sound natural. It also doesn't help that her character has only one major role in the story; to recruit other people who would be potentially better at leading this film than her, like Djimon Hounsou, Charlie Hunnam, and even Anthony Hopkins as the voice of a robot.If I had to pick just one character that left the most impression on me, it would be the villain Atticus Noble. Though his character lacked important development, I guess it was just Ed Skrein's performance that made him more appealing to watch over everyone else. Skrein, whom most people know as Ajax from ""Deadpool"", definitely has the screen presence for this type of villain, which is part of the reason why I was curious to see what he'd do next. Though this may also be to do with the fact that he's literally dressed as a Nazi SS officer (minus the Swastikas) for the majority of the film that makes it seem like he really means business.For the beginning of a new franchise, ""Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire"" leaves a poor first impression on viewers that allows little excitement for what else is to come. So far, none of the characters have any true staying power and the universe it exists within is exceedingly dull. However, there is the possibility that all of these issues could be amended in the following sequels, so perhaps I shouldn't speak so soon. Until then, all I can say is approach this film like you would any other Zack Snyder movie; as either mindless entertainment or just plain mindless.I rate it 5/10.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

They still could've made into something worth watching but unfortunately, Snyder just didn't make the cut.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

I quite like them, but not on this level. I really wanted to like Rebel Moon; it should be right up my street. However, the way it's been made, the dialogue, the characters and plot are so contrived, I couldn't bring myself to give it more than 4 stars.It's a shame: Charlie Hunnam's not in it enough, the dialogue is too much tell and not enough show, and altogether this is one terrible movie, although I did sit through the whole thing, so it's not one star worthy. The villains looking like nazis, complete with caps and overcoats, was a stretch too far for me. This should be Sci fi. Surely the filmmakers have an imagination and don't need to resort to mimicking history?If you're expecting an amazing Sci fi / fantasy extravaganza, look elsewhere. This isn't it.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

It's not original at all, it's directly a one for one ripoff of Battle Beyond the Stars for the first half.Nothing in this movie is actually original. It's as if the writer took his favorite clips of movies he's watched and fed them into an AI script generator and filmed what came out the other side. Seriously you can make a game out of it with your friends, and pause repeatedly to see which movie each segment was stolen from.75% of the film is purposely blurry apparently for artistic reasons, but only served to annoy me. There is a small circle in the middle of the screen that is in focus, everything other than that small circle is blurry. If this was the only thing wrong with the film it would be enough, but the dialogue, the story, the absurd premise, and the EXCESSIVE overuse of slow-mo just removes any suspension of disbelief.Oh and the casting is horrible. If you want to show me some scrawny 98 pound girl beating the crap out of eleven 200+ pound men at once, at least cast an actress that has muscle tone, or give her super powers, or at least revel she has cyborg parts or something.Seriously it's awful, it's not even so bad it's funny, it's just eye roll inducing.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Visually this looks great, as always with his movies. Too bad, movies also need a story and decent dialogue.Why do we need the main character to tell us her whole life's story every 5 minutes, when the whole world around her is just cartoonishly one dimensional? It just does not connect on any level.Why on earth would you allow Charlie Hunnam that godawful, butchered mockery of an Irish accent? Why? You clearly see how much he needs to focus, and how little brain capacity is left to actually do... you know...the acting.On the brght side: the dead sheep they glued to Djimon Hounsou's face got a good laugh out of me. That ""beard"" looks absolutely ridiculous, particularly the fluffy upper lip section. Poor guy.I could go on, but would rather just sum it up. If you need to put your brain on autopilot for a while, sure you can watch this. But the cringe is strong with this one, so don't expect much.And just because I think this should be said as often as possible: Justice League's Snyder Cut sucked so hard.

Something in this movie just seemed off. The one action scene was predictable and disappointing. The writing was elementary. I'm 56. I remember when dialogue in a movie would grasp our attention instead of the middle school level dialogue which happens now. Critics say that the internet has conditioned us to need action and scenery to keep our attention in movies. Well, when the writing is this bad, as in 95% of anything released now, then yeah, we need much more than just dialogue. And the extra parts need to be good.

Nevertheless, it feels like the director has mixed and matched parts from other movies rather than coming up with something new. Hence the plot feels really weak although the production is quite nice. There is a plethora of places and characters that maybe would feel relevant if there was a story that carried forward. Also the actions of the characters are sparsely explained or motivated. Cgi is unimpressive. The lead is not a good enough actor to carry the role. Charlie Hunnams accent is totally unconvincing as well as his acting. Ed Skreins character has a fetish for finishing people off with a walking stick for some reason. The rest of the cast is mediocre at best. Overall a nice package but too messy and incoherent content to warrant a second part. I suspect I will give it a chance, but I'm almost certain to be disappointed.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Zac Synder is someone who I consider to be a pretty good director but a terrible writer, and this movie pretty much puts on full display his style when he has full creative control, which is: visuals first, story last. And visually, there are a lot of nice scenes and action (although Snyder reallllly needs to lay off the slow mo, he overuses it wayy too much).The story is so simplistic that it feels like a video game from 20 years ago, so if you are a non-native English speaker and need an easy movie to practice, here you go. There was one laugh-out-loud scene for me I must admit (unintentionally so) regarding how a ship is taken down, but otherwise it's all pretty much generic sci-fi fantasy. If you took Firefly and Star Wars and put them in a blender, then dumbed down the story so that a 5 year old could understand it, you'd get this movie.

This time he brings us part One of his epic space saga. After two minutes of the movie I was blown away by the directors vision. This movie is absolutely stunning. Every single scene is breathtaking. As a Massive fan of his work I want to say that there isn't many directors out there that could make this type of film. My thoughts always turn to the amazing 300 as the starting point for this style of storytelling. The Star Wars comparison will always be there for any sci-fi movie these days. It's very hard to judge a movie on a single part of a two part saga. Zach builds a rich and colourful universe and introduces us to Kora ( Sophia Boutella ) Kora has a secret past life and has settled on a farming planet. As things always do it's not long before the bad guys commanded by ( Ed Skrein ) Admiral Atticus arrives on the planet demanding resources. Given the choice to serve or face the consequences Kora has a big choice to make. Along the way we meet a former military robot voiced by ( Anthony Hopkins ) and Irish Rogue Kai ( Charlie Hunnam ) his Irish accent is pretty terrible but a decent character all the same. The opening hour or so was mainly an introduction to the main cast of characters. Darrian Bloodaxe ( Ray Fisher ) Nemesis ( Bae Doona ) General Titus ( Djimon Hounsou ) Tarak ( Staz Nar ) and Gunnar ( Michiel Huisman ) before we embark on several fantastic looking adventures. I definitely enjoyed this. With the promise of a R rated Directors Cut in 2024 it has the potential to get even better. If you are looking for epic sci-fi fun this holiday give this a spin. With low scores on the corrupt Rotten Tomatoes 🍅 ill give you my verdict below.My Rating 🌚🌚🌚🌚This could be the start of something brilliant. I'm a bit gutted that the directors cut wasn't released the same day giving the viewer the choice. The Snyder Cuts just seem to improve the movies in a big way. The superior cut of Batman vs Superman and Zach Snyders Justice League proving the point.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I really enjoyed Army of the dead and Army of thieves.Unfortunately this was a complete turkey. The plot felt like the magnificent seven in space but set in a quasi Viking setting at the start...with barely a glimpse of the other locations as Kora flys around recruiting a forgettable crew. I'm also curious why the blood axe soldiers look like a androgynous emo band?The acting wasn't bad but it was wooden and all the rousing speeches just felt flat, the characters lacked depth (my three favourite characters were the robot, the Griphion and the Spider woman all of whom were in the movie less than five minutes each).The cinematography was beautiful to look at but the over use of slow motion coupled with bland action scenes killed a lot of the visual impact.I'm trying to keep an open mind for the second movie but it's 50/50 if I'll waste two hours watching it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Zack Snyder puts to much everything on screen, average viewer can't focus on action or characters presented in movie. From my point of view photography was the worst part of the film, everything seems so blury and blend with background. Another problem is no connections between events and characters presented on screen, story is just poorly written. Despite everything bad I must admit there is some good written characters like Kora or Admiral Noble, also there is high potential in political background presented in this world. I hope extended edition or even next movie will improve defects from Rebel Moon - Part One.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

My only mild complaint would be how quickly the movie had to move through some parts due to the abbreviated runtime, but this should be fixed by the release of the directors cut. As a huge Star Wars fan, this feels like the mature grown up version of Star Wars I've been waiting for, with a fresh dip into unfamiliar terrain. Deep, stunning to look at, and just the tip of the iceberg! Excited for the future of the franchise!

I think I see the problem.I vote they ask Jim Henson to do part 2. It would work with Muppets. No, really, certainly couldn't be worse.Anthony Hopkins as the hippy robot (I am so pleased Isaac from The Orville found a new role) was outstanding. He got an appearance fee without his actual face being associated with it.Let this be a lesson to Directors everywhere who forget that if the story is bonkers and the script/acting weak, no amount of special effects lipstick can hide the pig.I am so sorry I was rude about Aquaman.

The acting is reasonable though not helped by the poor script that seems, at times, to have been written by a GCSE student. The locations for shooting are beautiful at times and the actions scenes would be great if they were put into slow-mo every-single-time!

I could almost tolerate the generic, sci-fi storyline that we have seen countless times before were it not for the constant pointless slow-motion shots that add absolutely nothing but seconds to the runtime. Half of these slow-mo shots are of nothing: the lead landing in slow-mo, the lead drawing their gun in slow-mo, someone turning around in slow-mo, it goes on and on. The lack of a better score and the repeated blunders of the cinematography left me frustrated at the budget they must have wasted all on something that was probably doomed to be underwhelming.The only reason to watch this is to have it playing in the background while you scroll on your phone or read.

Love them!But I've been left a little confused by this movie. So much so that I don't even know where to start with this.Firstly, there's no reason for the movie to be this long. It would have been over a lot quicker if it wasn't for all the unnecessary ""slow motion"" moments. They add nothing to the movie other than to highlight the poor CGI.The story telling was poor. The characters who want to form a team are happy to just watch the others get laid into and... stand around and just watch? It's bizarre.Snyder has his way of working and maybe there's a reason he's not making blockbusters anymore because this just ain't it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

They don't stand out, you don't care about them, they're just participants in the action and nothing more.The structure is clumsy, with flashbacks inserted inorganically and forced, only to try to drive the entire story behind it a little, which doesn't really contribute much to this movie, maybe to the second part, but that remains to be seen.In the end, the best thing that can be said about this movie is that it doesn't make you feel like you've wasted your time, and it doesn't evoke any emotion, you feel nothing once it's over, it just ends.But it announces a second part, which hopefully won't be so disappointing.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It is stale. Sci-fi is stuck in a rut. I'm afraid that Star Wars is playing a large part with the issue. It was so innovative and original that other attempts pale in comparison. Even the newer Franchise releases have suffered under the hands of Disney.The original Star Wars developed characters before jumping head on into the saga. We cared and understood the characters. They were also limited to a number that allowed their development. Do we really understand or care about the Rebel Moon participants? Not in my book. We have retread characters that don't measure up to Luke, Lea, ObiWan, Han, and of course Vader.The writing is stale. We need new blood in the Writers Guild. Be innovative and not copy previous themes. I'm afraid Sci-fi may follow a path that Westerns did from the 50s, too many similar themes that caused a hiatus of releases. Perhaps a pause till new material is warranted.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It feels like a Warhammer meets Star Wars and others.The graphics/atmosphere is good. The actors do what they can with the moronic pace, characters and plot they were given.That being said, I can find NOTHING else redeeming for this ...thing.The story is fast tracked to the point it feels like snapshots barely hanging on to context and to their previous narrative. The plot is weak. The characters are cringey and unbelievable.As story unfolds and advances, characters and actions are increasingly cringe to the point of ridiculous.The entire world concept is in a perpetual conflict with itself, where technology is both advanced as well as antiquated at the same time.For example you have this all conquering empire that can travel the vast reaches of the galaxy, relentlessly enslaving, yet they can do soil analysis, they can't recognize outlaws, they have unruly robots, moronic and ill prepared 'soldiers'. The regents, while clearly presented as cold blooded genocidal maniacs are somehow also good...The wars presented are intensely fought by infantry despite technology. I mean even Star Wars and Warhammer (where they seem to have borrowed a lot of the looks, motifs, etc.), do a lot better to feel more... advanced...Too bad frankly...

Weakly cobbled-up characters, with distinctive sayings that should look cool, but sound so trite instead. Whose acting performance is so wrong and unbelievable that one wonders who the director is. And the fight scenes - a minute's silence for the fight scenes. It happens all the time in bad flicks that screenwriters have no idea about physics and, for example, let experienced soldiers look for protection behind wooden tables against plasma guns (like here to). But as soon a slender character parried twice as heavy opponents with wooden movements and can assert themself against several such opponents, then wishful thinking is involved (twice happend). Just like the ridiculous slow motion.All of this together has nipped the movie experience in the bud.Give one star for the cgi, and another one for the nearly empty cinema, so noone disturbed with laughs.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

With elements taken from The Magnificent Seven, Gladiator, Braveheart, Warhammer, and Jupiter Ascending.Zack Snyder still has an eye for unique visuals and incredible imagery. The various worlds and cultures we encounter are compelling from a design standpoint. The CGI is pretty good for the most part. I saw complaints about the visual effects not looking polished. There may be some wide shots that look suspect. But overall, it doesn't look *that* bad. There is a robot character that is a very good looking effect.But the story feels very incomplete and most of the characters introduced, and there's a lot of them, do not leave an impression. It doesn't help that the movie is very po-faced and serious but not in the ultra gritty way that Snyder can do it like in '300' or 'Man of Steel' that is so over-the-top it becomes fun. Also for an R rated story, it really is not that much more violent than an ultra-light episode of 'GAME OF THRONES'. Oh that's another thing the movie rips off for the political intrigue. It doesn't help there are some GoT alumni in the cast.There are a couple exceptions. Anthony Hopkins voices a robot that is actually an interesting character, but he's in the movie for like five minutes. Charlie Hunnam shows up as someone who looks like he's going to be the Han Solo of the story (there is a part two coming soon). He's alright. But then all of a sudden, he's not the Han Solo of the story. Ed Skrein plays the villain of the movie that is essentially every Imperial officer ever from the Star Wars franchise, plus a little bit of Hans Landa from 'INGLORIOUS BASTERDS' too. He is a cartoonishly evil character but at least he shows something of a personality. Everyone else is not bad per se, but they're very bland.Sofia Boutella handles herself well in the action scenes. But she is saddled with horrendous dialogue and overwrought exposition. In fact, a lot of the script's problems is directly a result of Zack Snyder ignoring a vital rule in storytelling which is ""show not tell"".I really dug the world that Zack Snyder has created for the plot but I wish that he just gave the audience just five minutes to sink in and settle into this world. Or just to halt the exposition dump for a while.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

There's a certain Lack of chemistry with the movie, hard to explain but those who have seen it know what I mean. First 20mns were promising but went to crap afterwards, this is a B movie at best.In my opinion, it would have been better as a series.Very mediocre, uninteresting, not captivating, nothing innovative!!!","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

It reminds me of Jupiter Ascending, which was also an expensive piece of burning garbage.Zach Znyder has been overrated since Watchmen, but this is his worst film yet, by a good margin.The backdrops look really fake, and the 3D effects are a mixed bag. Some look pretty good while others look like a video game from 2006. The only really good things about this movie is the sound-design, which I actually think is rather impressive. The worst part is the script though: They say all the quiet parts out loud and there are 0 surprises in the plot. Sharknado has a better story than this. 1/10, hope they cancel part 2.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

I've only seen two films from him and I hold them in high regards. Rebel Moon essentially follows a ex-soldier who goes on a journey to recruit a band of outlaws to aid her in a quest to bring down her former empire after they plan to ransack her village of their needs. Basically Seven Samurai or A Bug's Life if you will.The story is big, very big. We go through multiple planets to recruit these outlaws and each planet is very distinct from one another. The problem is, with a story this big you naturally have some parts underdeveloped and oh boy, do some characters get massively sidelined here. Our main characters that we're supposed to root for, don't have distinct personalities to begin with, in fact, almost all of them have no personalities at all! I get the sense that maybe Snyder wants to expand upon them in the next installment but this is not conventional storytelling. You have to get us familiarized with these characters in order for us to get invested in them, especially when the movie is trying to have some emotional moments with them. Another point I want to mention here is the acting, there are some really talented actors here, but they all feel very wooden here as if they're just phoning it in for the paycheck.The VFX are acceptable, I appreciated some of the practical effects here but from an ~83M+ budget (Both films share a 166M+ budget), I've seen better from the likes of ""The Creator"", which had the same amount of budget as this had. There are some decently handled action scenes and a lot of that trademark Zack Snyder slo-mo that he just can't make a single film without (Except maybe Dawn of the Dead) but not a lot inventive ones. There is a clear visual style with each planet they travel to; There's an industrial planet along the likes of ""Blade Runner 2049""; a desert-like landscape that recalls the video-game ""Monster Hunter"" and the villain here is very nasty, helped by reliable Ed Skrein in the role whose attire recalls a certain group of Germans from the 1940s.Overall, a wannabe-epic that squanders over the weight of its own story. It fails to distinguish itself by simply not having enough of anything. It's very self-indulgent by Snyder and I do think he's getting a load of himself here but I enjoyed most of it. I am somewhat interested in the extended cut Snyder is planning to release some time in the future that will hopefully fix some of my problems that I had with this version. I'd say check this one out as a no-brainer, it's not peak Sci-fi but hey, its something.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Man they had almost no emotion. Sofia Boutella, come on! At least try to connect to the scenes you are acting. Others actors also didn't do that good, however, many of them didn't get enough screen time.The action scenes are also totally unrealistic. I think even Tamil (an Indian movie industry known for unrealistic action sequences) movies are more realistic than this.While Zac Snyder has some good movies, I think he messes things up a lot when it comes to pure sci-fi. He messed up the Justice League, now this one.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Let's start with the good: The casting is well done - Sofia Boutella is the perfect Kora, her emotions and skilled fight scenes represent the character so well. And it's great to see Ray Fischer in a new role and he looked so cool. Also, the overall story/premise is very interesting as well and has potential to be an epic series. But that's about it on the positives.Now the negative: The writing just feels very amateur. There's a lot of deep moments and dialogue throughout the movie that's very moving and touching, but the way it's written is a bit cringey. I said the casting was amazing, but that's tainted a bit with the dialogue they've been given. I hope for Part 2 they really focus on the writing to improve it significantly. I'm not sure if it's because Netflix got involved, which does happen unfortunately like with WB did with his previous work. The cinematography while great most of the time, feels a bit odd at times with this blurry effect when something is out of focus, I'm not sure if that's intentional, but I don't really see it adding anything to the story or mood. The fight scenes could have been much better. Only Kora's fight scenes were epic and well done. Everyone else's felt a bit too step by step and not action-packed enough for such an epic battle.As a big fan of Zack Synder's work, I was expecting more. However, there's definitely potential here as I said above for it to be an awesome sci-fi series. There's still lots of story to tell, and lots of
interesting characters they can deep dive into. But I really hope with Part 2 they really fix the writing and camera effects.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

Kora's rebellion feels like a greatest hits of sci-fi, lacking the spark of originality. Every twist is telegraphed, leaving the audience adrift in a sea of déjà vu. While the action sequences are undeniably epic, they're smothered in CG, sacrificing grit for spectacle. Dialogue clunks with exposition, spoon-feeding the story instead of letting it unfold. Underdeveloped characters, mere archetypes in costumes, fail to ignite emotional investment. ""Rebel Moon"" might ignite a flicker of potential, but Part One is a forgettable journey through a familiar galaxy.

I hate to say it but this was awful. The actors did the best they could but that script and the world building wasn't there. It was a total rip off of Star Wars meets Foundation with a Thanos & Gamora relationship at the root driving the protagonist. I didn't care about any of the characters. Great sci-fi and or fantasy all have one thing in common and that's the world being meticulously designed in a creative and interesting way. There was nothing about this world that was original or memorable. The world just didn't feel lived in by anyone. This lacked passion, creativity, and imagination. I was really excited about this film and it was a total disappointment.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

My only suggestion is maybe wait for part 2 and binge it - if you're like me you'll not want to wait another 4 months.Is there going to be a part 3, part 4, part 5??? Dear god, let this be so...Meanwhile, to the people who were amazed by stars wars as a kid you need to realise part of the magic was BECAUSE you were a kid. Find your inner kid again and stop over analysing sci-fi, it's supposed to be entertaining, not perfection. This ticks every box apart from having Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford who (let's be honest) carried a slightly hammy Star Wars to greatness. Greatness is in Rebel Moon, and I sincerely hope we see it grow into something as ground-breaking as Empire and Jedi.","8 out of 24 found this helpful.

So clearly for the maturer viewers of this film, we've seen it all before. To summarise the story it surrounds a young lady out to gather a group of Rebels together to take on a mighty but unconvincing invading empire. So you've heard it all before.Thel most impressive part of the film is clearly the special effects, which unsurprisingly are very good albeit some ropey moments too, but in this age that's not enough.The problem for me is two key aspects. The acting & dialogue is woeful, and really the producers could have taken just a bit of time to improve this and we'd have had a decent film.Quite frankly I just mentally switched off throughout much of it. I was mostly unimpressed but it's still watchable.With so little out at present and this being on Netflix, I guess it won't cost to watch it. Just go in with low expectations.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

So much story packed into weak writting, it stank of desperation to create a new saga worthy of the budget. Sadly, it failed. The acting wasn't horrible, but the casting wasn't great. The story was rather cliche, and in all honesty lacked any reason to invest in a second or third follow up. No real plot twist that you could not see coming from a mile away. On the brightside, the cinematography was decent, save far too many slow motion scenes. The world creation was ok, but nothing even close to original. Star wars, firefly, Battlestar galactic, star trek, the matrix and even Harry Potter all made appearances. Over all, not even worth a watch.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's terrible. Like REALLY, terribly, horribly, dull and BAD.If the 2nd part is as bad as this one that's gonna be a rough watch. So Far I don't know why on earth this needed to be broken into two parts? It was so incredibly dull and dragging that before it was even half over my mind was on a hundred other things, this just didn't hold my interest at all and I LOVE sci-fi movies. I couldn't wait for it to be over.Every actor/character in this movie is not only forgettable, they're not even likable. They were so unappealing. It seemed like even they didn't want to be there.The acting was terrible, especially from the main character, Kora. Every lame, eye rolling, cliche pose and stupid saying you can think of in movies, she did them all. Terribly. I don't mean to completely crack on her though, I don't know her or her other work. Perhaps her horrible character was at the direction of Zack Snyder? Maybe he thinks that's great acting? Wouldn't surprise me given his other movies...And the HORRIBLE CGI / special effects... Is EVERYTHING filmed in front of a green screen nowadays? Newsflash, it doesn't look good! This was particularly bad.Filmmakers of the 70's and 80's did WAY better work with so much less.The best part of the movie is when it went off and there were almost 12 minutes of credits. That's 12 minutes I got to fast forward through and not watch.There's something about Netflix movies... Very rarely does Netflix kick out a movie where I think ""Man, that was a great movie, I need to tell everyone how good it was."" This was no different.So awful. I can't believe this is what passes as good filmmaking in the 2020's. C'mon, man.Just my silly opinioin.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I ignored my fears that releasing straight to Netflix meant it would be bad and held out hope. If this was a low budget sci fi or a tongue in cheek space opera it might be forgiven but sadly this was a serious attempt to make a major sci epic. For a director like Snyder to release a film so badly produced and directed is inexcusable. It lacks soul, finesse or story line. The acting is sub par, the action is clunky, the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and telegraphed and the special effects aren't good enough to make up for Many scenes seem to be lifted directly from other films and the whole film is riddled with cliches and over used tropes.This was originally conceived as a 2 part Star Wars film and I'm so so glad it was turned down.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The series follows Kora, a conquered people fighting for their freedom on another planet. Snyder's interest in spiritual, erotic, and kinetic pop mythology serves revenge as a vision. Rebel Moon resembles numerous familiar sci-fi adventure tales but has a unique energy and imagination. As Kora gathers forces, her allies, including bounty-hunter Kai, disgraced General Titus, maternal warrior Nemesis, cagey pacifist Gunnar, revolutionary Darrian Bloodaxe, and enslaved royal Tarak, are introduced in stirring episodes. These sequences, along with Kora's flashbacks, evoke a compendium of movie and biblical myths, setting the background for a familiar legacy of conquest and liberty. Snyder, as his own cinematographer, creates a lusty narrative that resembles Frank Frazetta's fantasy art. His sensual daring, including white clouds and planets, creates kineticism and wonder that resembles The Thief of Bagdad. The film features Tarak tames an enormous gryphon, achieving 3D closeness without 3D. Snyder's signature motif of particles floating in prelude to violence adds to the thrill. Snyder, a renowned filmmaker, has a unique ability to create visually striking films that captivate audiences. His imagery blends elements from A Hidden Life and Geronimo: An American Legend, combining lyrical, hostile, and historical elements. His visual-kinetic excitement surpasses the works of George Lucas, Peter Jackson, and the Wachowskis. Rebel Moon, a film that stands out for its movement and spectacle, is particularly striking. The expressiveness of Kora's flashbacks, conveying her emotional need and mystery, surpasses the juvenile tomboy gestures of Daisy Ridley's Rey in the Star Wars saga. Rebel Moon by Zack Snyder addresses the issue of Hollywood's obsession with action-movie distractions, a trend that began with George Lucas's Star Wars franchise. Despite its popularity, the franchise's artistic potential was squandered when Lucas sold the franchise to Disney, leading to mass-reproduction and diminishing artistic results. Snyder's approach to action and sensual mythology in Rebel Moon, combined with his visual poetry, makes it a triumph over the Marvel, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings movies, which have also achieved box office success but with diminishing artistic results. ""Rebel Moon-Part One: Child of Fire,"" the first half of Zack Snyder's planned Star Wars sequel, is praised for its action-figure-deep heroes. After 133 minutes, the film features Akira Kurosawa in space, but with storyboard perfection and a focus on visual scale, despite a lack of eye-catching details. The film is a satisfying addition to the Star Wars franchise. ""Rebel Moon"" by Snyder and co-writers Shay Hatten and Kurt Johnstad is a formulaic film that often looks more like an animated pitch for a movie than an actual movie. The film follows the space farmers who fail to resist a visiting party of space fascists, representing the Motherworld's formerly great colonial power. The space farmers are led by Corey Stoll, a brawny character, and Admiral Atticus Noble, a pale goose-stepper with a short temper and an army at his back. The film's big, corny, and ungainly plot makes it difficult to enjoy and enjoy. ""Rebel Moon"" is a visually appealing film that excels when it revolves around objects crashing into or flying above each other. However, the transition from storyboard to screen has not preserved the fun and affection that likely went into the creation. The characters' perverse humor and sincerity are difficult to empathize with. Heroes like Kora are used to justify the prefab epic-ness, but they do not make the film move faster towards its cliffhanger ending. Snyder's film focuses on style-guide features like cleavage, haircuts, and accents, rather than the characters. Some actors like Hunnam and Stoll contribute, but dialogue is constantly expository, threatening plot. Kora is the main character, but other characters establish interest in post-Star Wars themes of resistance, hope, and compassion through bumpersticker dialogue and G. I. Joe poses. The movie's plot is primarily driven by Kora, with other characters contributing to the film's overall appeal.","18 out of 63 found this helpful.

Equally pleasant is a high quality film maker directing the majority of a TV project, like the criminally underrated Devs (2020). Same can be said of any number of filmmakers transitioning elegantly to the smaller screen.But what about the other way? Has anyone ever said, ""Wow, that movie reminded me of a TV show! And it was so good!"" No! No one ever said that!And that is what we have here. We essentially two or three episodes of a TV show crammed together to try and make the first installment of a movie franchise. Zack Snyder really should of known better, especially with a writing credit. While it's not a complete disgrace? It is all around bad, and I'd argue the biggest problem is the approach. That, by the way, is a failure of production and a failure of leadership.Rebel Moon gets off to an astonishingly boring first 15 minutes... that sets the pace for the entire experience. People standing on green screens talking. This is not a story that needed Any science fiction in the first place. It's a story that has been told better many times in period pieces like Braveheart. Chronicles of Riddick is also a comparison, but Riddick has the protagonist already in place, played by a Super popular actor at that time. It also dove into the science fiction right from the start, not... farming! Rebel Moon... is so... average... I'm actually irritated - don't do the genre like that!I think the make up/costuming is good - but it's hard to recognized any merit among the abundance of mediocrity.Acting is wooden. Characters are two dimensional. Scenes are bland. The content can be cherry picked to make a decent trailer, but thats about it.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Djimon Gaston Hounsou phoned in his part.Snyders attempt to replicate the original. John Sturges take on The Seven Samurai was appalling, with his episodic back stories being plain boring, daft and just providing a disjointed narrative, if there is one.Sturges managed to make a film of several almost stand alone stories helped by his stellar cast, but Snyder is no Sturges.Lets hope that part two is better as I can't imagine it being much worse.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

His DCEU films were poor (yes, even his version Justice League) and this is a threadbare quilt of other people's stories that he has tried to fold into a single story. The results are visually engaging (if repetitive) but the narrative is thin and the script crumbles under the weight of the exposition. Honestly, the script is horrible and unintentionally hilarious on more than one occasion The die-hard Syner-philes will no doubt herald this as a masterpiece... but it isn't and someone really needs to tell them that the Emperor has no clothes.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

We get so few of them. But I truly did not enjoy watching Rebel Moon.This was inspired by Seven Samurai. So was Adam Sandler's Ridiculous 6. Yet for all its flaws, that movie had better ideas and more fun than Rebel Moon can muster. Even the forgettable Magnificent Seven remake was better.This movie starts with a lengthy narrative intro, then dumps us on a medieval moon, only to take a astoundingly predictable forty minutes of shallow character archetypes doing and saying EXACTLY what you'd expect.There are no original ideas here, which the movie masks by being unnecessarily serious. That just leads it to drag out moments and constantly show its hand (and doubles down with so much exposition, narration, and flashbacks).Technically, Rebel Moon is very impressive. But as a story, it's enormously derivative which it tries to cover by being overly self-important.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I loved the tension and the world building. I really want to see more of Jimmy. 100% he has my attention. I also want to see the character Aris build a relationship with Sam.I can't wait to see the directors cut and part 2. The world is beautiful and may not be for everyone.

Unfortunately this is, on the surface, a polish turned. I don't know, is he aware of what he made?The movie is a reworking of the Seven Samurai story, village is being starved by bad guys who steal their crops and hire protectors, which isn't in itself a bad thing; Many movies have done that. It does however fail to make me care about any of the hired guns that she picks up along the way. They're given very quick and silly introductions, complete with plenty of Zack Snyder slo-mo poses, and suddenly join the team without a whole lot of motivation. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil and dress like nazis (of course), the good guys are cartoonishly righteous. Oh yea, and the main antagonist has a shillelagh. It's not even like a laser shillelagh or anything. I'm not entirely sure what part two will be, since this one seemed to wrap itself up.He wrote this movie for the Star Wars franchise and Disney turned it down, so he thinly disguised the various trademarked elements and made the movie anyway. Now, was he doing this as a tribute to the B-Movies of the late 70's and early 80's? Because this feels like one of those Starcrash, Battle Beyond the Stars schlock fests made to capitalize on the popularity of Star Wars.Also the opening shot made me laugh out loud. Come on now.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Action scenes were more hilarious than tense and the editing to try to make them look impressive did the opposite, a weird mix of normal, slow and fast speed and of course the baddies for the most part were rotten shots. The acting was rather odd as well, lots of very flat characters and many of the actors seemingly not that interested in the story they were trying to tell.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Rebel Moon is anything but good though. I was very excited about the arrival of this movie seeing as not too many good sci-fi movies get made. Sadly this feels like more of a B movie that a cable channel would produce than a big budget film.The CGI is both bad and good. Although it seems to get worse as the movie trudges along. It's almost as if they started running out of money so they had to take shortcuts.I've seen a lot of hate spewed towards the script and dialogue, it's warranted. At times it seems that a 14 year old wrote it due to the incredibly bland conversations of it all.As for the story it starts out with a decent amount of character and story building only to pivot to a rushed ""get it all in"" feel. It's hard to not see all of the Star Wars rip offs in the movie and not acknowledge them. Some of the characters, including our main baddie and our story's heroine are good in my opinion. Unfortunately other characters get very little polishing so they seem to matter little.You may have a different opinion when watching it so give it a go. I wouldn't set my expectations too high. There's a part 2 slated for the spring that maybe Snyder can do better with, or it'll be a huge flop for Netflix.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

If it were unknown actors it might have made this more real. Visual appealing? On some occasions, the tiresome slow plot? It's a good movie to fall asleep with. I can't fall in love with the story since there's so many like Dune and other types that doesn't really give me a reason or tell the difference.

Sofia Butella, Staz Nair and Sky Yang (even though his role was small) were especially bad. Sofia Butella plays the character with the most potential, Kora, but it just goes nowhere and her line deliveries are incredibly wooden.Speaking of characters. There are so many that get no development, and I think the only chatachter with a story arch is Kora. Unfortunately, her arch is mostly finished in the first few minutes, and then it's as static as everybody else's. Most other characters get a short introduction (told, not shown, more on that later) and then just hang around. Most of them don't really do anything. Was there not a single person during the process who thought the characters should be more than props?The merry band of overpowered outcasts collected by Kora and Gunnar seem to be picked up by chance and for no particular reason. Each one no more than a checkmark in the direcors notebook. Most of them also seem to have essentially no interactions with other characters beyond their introduction.There is so muched packed in to this movie, I don't think it would have been possible to do it well, but there is still so much room for improvement. Everything is too on the nose, and I don't think there is a single new idea in the entire movie. The old ""show, don't tell"" rule is thrown out. Instead, we are constantly being told what happens, what is going to happen, what happened and why things are happening. I just wish someone told me why this movie happened.Before this movie, I had no strong feeling on Zack Snyder. He had some hits (I think Army of theives is fantasic and a really fun movie) and some meh movies. However, I think this movie should end his career when it comes to big budget movies. It's just that bad.Jenna Malone and Anthony Hopkins were good, and their characters were the most interesting to me.

The casting(!) is one of the worst parts of this movie. When you have a high budget netflix film, which is being split into several parts, you can't get better actors than this? Seriously?The main cast is boring, the ""mini"" villain is Ed Skrein (who is dressed up like a 2000s emo band member most of the movie) and the big bad villain is...... I don't even know because I don't recognise him from anywhere.The acting is also horrendous, from basically everyone in the main cast to even random extras. Literally noone gives a good or even believable performance.Most characters feel so out of place and the actors who portray them feel equally out of place in this movie.I don't even know where to begin with the story, so I'm not even gonna try.There's so many loose ends that (hopefully?) gets tied up in a satisfying way in part 2, but I really doubt it based on what a shitshow this movie was.The visuals are mostly solid but at some points it really feels very green-screeny, and distracts some from the action.Speaking of action, the fight choreography is horrible. It feels slow, and lethargic, people swinging and missing on purpose shown front and center on screen.Actors missing timings everywhere and what not.But the worst thing personally, is the god damn slow motion.Yes Zack, I know you like slow motion, and there definitely is a place for it. Once or twice in the movie to really sell a scene.But when you use slow motion 2-3 times PER FIGHT SCENE, it really becomes annoying after the second time you see it.I could go on and on about the shortcoming of this movie, but I really don't have the energy to write anymore.It's a badly made, horribly acted mess that should've been alot better had it been handled properly.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I couldn't continue watching after an hour and 20 minutes of this film because I got tired of confusing exposition getting thrown in my face and getting introduced with empty characters with little dialogue. Felt like Snyder didn't want other eyeballs to go through the script before filming.

So many troupes we've seen before, not a lot going on, but visually interesting. I was just overall bored. Which is not what you want in a fantastical sci-fi full of action that comes in two parts. I don't know what they could possibly do to make up for this in the second part.Of course we have seen this narrative a million times, but I do think that the world and mythology being built had some interesting ideas. I think a TV series, or better yet a mini series, would have given the room to fully flesh things out. There was a bit too much exposition for my liking, and some weird moments of characters doing things for no reason. Why are we trusting this dashing rogue? Just not a lot of motivation for choices made at some points.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I'm glad I did. It definitely has its flaws, but nothing as bad as what people say. It's a theatrical space opera built from the premise of 7 Samurai. The writers admittedly took inspiration from Akira Kurosawa. The world they built is nothing short of fantastic and immersive. I wish the character development was given more emphasis but with what they did, the plot at least did not suffer.The cherry on top of this cake is the lead actress, Sofia Boutella. She did an excellent job at portraying her role as the Darth Vader-gone-good protagonist. She even reminds me of Nara from Chorus (video game). All in all a worth-it experience for fans of Star Wars, and Kurosawa alike.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

Literally an hour and a half of this could be put into a short montage, but it drug out to be most of the movie.Casting did an amazing job, but the pay off is equivalent to hiring Lewis Hamilton to drive your go cart. All of these actors weren't allowed the room to do anything to earn their paychecks. There is zero depth. It's a massively simplistic story that in no way motivates me to watch the next installment. Unfortunately, it's another example of Netflix not being too particular about what it throws onto it's streaming service.I've never been a huge Snyder fan, and Rebel Moon does absolutely nothing to move that needle.

Mixing Star Wars with Dune, it delivers a weak punch with underdeveloped characters, a muddled plot, and a desperate reliance on flashy CGI and eye candy.The film's fatal flaw? Shallow characters. Rebel Moon introduces a slew of forgettable figures with little depth or backstory. Viewers are left wanting more, as the cast feels like mere placeholders rather than fully-realized individuals.The storytelling is equally lackluster. Attempting a complex narrative of rebellion and intergalactic conflict, Rebel Moon stumbles with rushed pacing and missed emotional beats. Critical moments lack the impact they desperately need, leaving the audience struggling to care about the lackluster unfolding events.Sure, the CGI is top-notch, and the cast is easy on the eyes, but style can only take you so far. Rebel Moon prioritizes visuals over substance, borrowing heavily from more successful franchises. The result? A half-baked attempt at replicating the magic of Star Wars and the complexity of Dune.In the end, Rebel Moon is a sci-fi misfire that fails to carve out its own space in the genre. Despite the dazzling visuals and attractive cast, the film crumbles under the weight of poor storytelling and forgettable characters, leaving audiences longing for a more fulfilling journey into the cosmos.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The fact disney rejected this as not being good enough for their SW franchise should tell you where this sits.It's got no heart or soul at all. About 20% of the movie is Original and Interesting, the rest is predictable, forgettable and been there, done that I didn't care about any of the characters or the story. The constant Slo-Mo action scenes are unbearable. When slo-mo is used it's usually to mask bad fight choreography or to show something new (like The Matrix), in this case it was just because the director has a love for it (like he did in 300). The movie would've gone for 30 minutes less if they had normal action scenes so I guess that's one way to stretch a movie out.This is a big budget version of one of those rip-off movies that come out around the same time as a blockbuster. Even with the big budget some things look cheap, like they made a paper mache mask and put it on a horse and called it an alien creature.Normally reliable actors, like Djimon Hounsou, look totally clueless. Not because of their ability to act but because of the situations and dialogue they are given.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The whole premise and pitch had me really hoping it would be good, and even after the fact I see potential of what it could have been but that slowly goes out of the window. I just think it was all executed poorly, like there's so much to take from this movie and tear apart.There was like nothing 'good' about this movie. Maybe others found something to like about this movie but man I really slogged through this movieAs I said there was at the start some potential. For instance the idea of a farming community on a moon, I absolutly loved that. But once the cartoonish villains showed up and our heroes went elsewhere it was all paint by numbers by that point.Its needlessly aggressive, comically so. The villains are so cartoonish its almost funny if the movie wasnt taking itself so serious in doing so. Trying to be an adult Star Wars is fine but the way Snyder went about it was just so weak, like everyone is miserable, everything is dark and gritty, oh and there is a uncomfortable scene of a woman and a bunch of men that just felt uncomfortable, (the word I cannot use cos I think it will get the review declined).... like really?The characters, are forgettable, and just boring, the cinematography is this wishy washy brown that every 'dark' adult, gritty movie has got to have now, it lacks identity. It feels very dated in some aspects and while it seems to pay homage to alot of 80's sci-fi it does little to be original by its own merits. It doesn't help when the writing just tends to flip flop all over the place with no direction, which is ironic since the writing and direction are the same person.Oh and the slow-mo, good god the slow-mo too, way too much slow mo (Yea I know, a Snyder movie with slow-mo, shock and awe )The story was just a collect 'em all movie. Go here, get this, go here, collect that, go here, collect this. Like nothing had a chance to breathe, a planet got destroyed and I am like 'meh' am I supposed to care? Our heroes didn't even care, they didn't even know I don't think? This movie is so bad it is literally leaving my subconscious right now I am struggling to remember parts.This movie wanted to be something I have craved for a long time, 'original sci-fi fantasy'. It delivers the sci-fi fantasy but very little on the originality. And that's sad. I really hope a movie like this doesn't deter movie makers from creating original pieces of fantasy franchises. Because in an era where everything is remakes and reimagining's and extended universes I want something like Rebel Moon, just Rebel Moon wasnt it.It was not very comfortable viewing overall. And it was good this was on Netflix I had time to groan loudly in pain as this movie dragged for 2 hours that I would never get back, and stretch my legs and take a 5 minute break half way. I will be honest if this was on the cinema I probably would have never went to see it at all. I saw it only because I was curious, and also hopeful because I wanted this to be good.I will assume this show is going to have a audience and it will be one of those growing audiences over time maybe, but this wasnt what I hoped for and thats just sad.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Hilarious.We're supposed to believe that the main character can beat trained assassins twice her size. Such things have become boring and tiresome, and all together produce the exact opposite effect of what the writers would like.The characters are boring and even irritating, and this all looks like a remake of Seven Samurai, only the action takes place in space. Well, Seven Samurai is a masterpiece, and this is a Netflix movie, and that's all you need to know. I don't mind that this movie borrows from other movies, a lot of movies are like that and that doesn't make them bad, some actually turned out great, but this feels like a bad parody.I didn't watch the movie until the end, because I couldn't bear to watch another piece of garbage, goodbye Netflix, there's really no point in having a subscription.Even the villains are hilarious, all together this would be a good parody. Lately we have a lot of movies that show all men as incompetent morons, and this movie is like that too. There is no point in spending time and money on something that is an obvious waste of time.We're supposed to believe that the main character is some kind of elite soldier, absolutely hilarious.The fight scenes look like a parody, I can't believe so much money was spent on this. Zack Snyder has made some fun movies, but this is a disaster. I give it the lowest rating, because I didn't even manage to watch it to the end.I spent an hour on this before giving up, an hour I will never get back.

And if you do play that, rest assured there are a lot of films you can tick off, sometimes even entire scenes are identical to other movies.You've got a all the Riddick series in there, several Star Wars movies, Seven Samurai (or The Magnificent Seven if you prefer to choose the remake), Serenity, Chappie, Gladiator, Blade Runner, several Spaghetti westerns, they're all in there and manymore besides. I could go on, I'm sure you could too if you watch it and play along.For example, fairly early on there is a 'let's go to this Cantina' scene which is about as close to the classic scene in Star Wars as you could get without it being identical. I was literally expecting the Star Wars Cantina music to stat playing. It's therefore not a surprise to find that a handsome roguish smuggler whom they meet there (and yes he shoots a bad guy and indeed fires first) has a ship which can fly them off the planet to continue their quest.That said, visually it looks pretty okay with some competent CGI and derivative yet competent costume work, but even so there's far too much 'drop to slo-mo for the fight' going on, so much so that it actually impacts on the action itself in a pretty negative way. The audio mixing is, as is sadly all too common these days with movies, terrible; bombastic 120 decibel music one second then quiet dialogue another, which has you adjusting the volume on your TV up and down like you're playing a trombone in order to not be deafened but still hear what the characters are frequently telling, rather than showing you, not that it matters much if you don't hear the odd line, you could probably spontaneously invent a better and more original one yourself and pretend that's what the character said and you'd still be bang on the money as far as where the plot was heading.All of that could have been forgiven if it actually had a decent plot or even actually had a sub plot at all, but unfortunately, it's so basic that you'd have to be in a coma to not be able to predict it, and what plot there is has some logic holes in it which are big enough to fly a spaceship through, which doesn't help.There is the odd bit of decent dialogue here and there, but for the most part the cast are pretty much phoning it in because they have so little to work with. You get the impression that they are only sticking with it in the hopes that it make make it to a few sequels and provide a few more paychecks for them.I'm not saying it's absolutely not worth watching, it'll pass an hour and a half if you are bored and enjoy spotting infuences, but any and all of the films it borrows from are much better than this and if any of the plot surprises you, and that even includes the fina scene before the titles roll, then I would be very surprised indeed.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The fight scenes are well choreographed, the actors are doing a great job with the script they have to work with. The only issue I have is I don't really feel any emotional attachment to these characters. The attempt to build a universe was unsuccessful and there's really no real reason for the audience to feel any emotional attachment to these characters. I don't really care who lives or dies because everyone just seems like an expendable character. In Star Wars the audience very quickly established an emotional attachment to Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and of course R2-D2 and C-3PO and were invested in whether or not they survived. In Dune, the exposition setting up the universe is so well executed that you understand who the main players are and why things are happening the way they are. To be fair I have read the first Dune novel which these two movies are based off of but I feel like anyone who watches the first film understands who the Atreides and Harkonnen houses are and what is at stake.

But I like Sofia Boutella. After some self-debate, I did start to watch it, and it does have lots of Sofia Boutella in it.After a while, it dawned on me that I should think of it as a live-action cartoon, and from then I could enjoy watching Sofia Boutella more. Also entertaining, was thinking about all the other movies it reminded me of, since there sure are a lot of them. I'm also pretty sure I saw landscapes from World of Warcraft.It has a plot, but it's one of those plots where they could have just told you what it is in a couple sentences and you'd be like ""oh yeah, that one, I know that one, that's a good plot. Oh, no, no, you don't have to fill in the names and whatall - I got it."" This film would be way better with no exposition at all, no voiceover, no flashbacks. When you're doing something this familiar, and fully conscious of its familiarity, it just does not help anything when you sit us down and explain it all. I get ""space Nazi"" - this is like the 20th film I've seen with these exact same space Nazis; it's just wasting our time to keep going on about how these guys are space Nazis. When exposition is expounded with something like this, it really has to be a tale of extraordinary interest to be worth slowing it all down to fill in the backstory. Do you really think you cleared that bar? Honestly?The CG artists sure worked hard on it, lots of cool art.Surprisingly the fight sequences don't work that well. Are those supposed to be like squirt guns? They squirt stuff. Really, it's like they squirt yellow goo that splatters around and glows and only kills people when it's convenient for the scene. It always seems weird to me when movies have sci fi space guns that are less effective than actual guns. Like, did they forget how to make bullets in the future? Maybe it's in the past, which could be why their agricultural technology is somewhere around early Bronze Age level.Yup, live action cartoon with Sofia Boutella.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

You build a world with phenomenal technology and light speed spacecraft, but you fight with sword and spears. And i have to mention, the big spaceship is powered like 1900, men shovel coal fuel.In this movie, when laser guns go with west style horse farming and myth animals, you know it is just another hollywood hollow CGI big MTV style commercial product.Hollywood now a days is just so felt behind. You stay in your comfort zone for too long. The audience has grown up, and world has grown up. And american producers are still live in their dreams with pride. The director is so well known for play cameras and lenses. In his interviews he always talks alot of how special his camera and lens are built. But cinema is about story telling, human emotions, life experience. He should be a cameraman and let someone else be the director.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Rebel Moon: Part One- A Child of Fire takes Snyder's Star Wars plans and turns them into one of the most lifeless and generic space adventures ever made. Giving us a kick-ass cast, the dialogue and lack of development make every moment difficult to get through. The entirety of the runtime is spent setting up the next film and by the time it is over, it feels as though there were 30 minutes of ideas, stretched into this nearly two and a half hour film. Some of the action scenes are fun to watch as the choreography is nicely done, but nowhere near Snyder's best work. Though the cinematography is gorgeous, that seems to be where the efforts stopped. Everything about this film, down to the character names, feels like it was written by a 13 year old boy, after being asked to make the most 'badass and extreme' film that his high school mind could imagine. Rebel Moon: Part One- A Child of Fire is Walmart brand Star Wars, trying to be the real thing, while being a hollow shell instead.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

So, I've been a Zack Snyder fan, appreciating most of his work, but Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire is, to put it bluntly, a disaster.Originally conceived as a Star Wars project, it still feels like Star Wars, just without any of the iconic elements. Sofia Boutella's character seems lifted from Rogue One, resembling Jyn Erso, and the parallels with various Star Wars properties are hard to miss.Typically, Snyder's films are visually captivating, but here, it's surprisingly generic. The attempt at a vintage vibe with custom lenses falls flat, resulting in a blurry and overly bokeh-ridden mess outside the direct centre of the frame.While the costuming appears elaborate, there are moments like Ed Skrein interrogating someone in a white business shirt and black tie, looking misplaced and like he stepped off the set of Transporter Refueled. It's just one of a number of confounding creative choices in the film.The CGI is well-executed, albeit occasionally at odds with the unique live-action camera work. However, what truly stands out for me is an unexpected element in a Snyder film: boredom. Rebel Moon delivers boring characters, bland action, an uninspired story, and janky visuals, making it feel longer than Snyder's four hour Justice League cut.If that weren't enough, the film is only halfway through, with Part 2 expected in April. It faces a significant challenge in salvaging this lacklustre project.FORMAT: StreamingVIDEO: 9.0

It's beautiful to look at and has some interesting world building that's cobbled together from previous films. The story line is predictable. The characters are lazy. Because we've seen them before Snyder thinks we'll just get who they are. They're straight outa Star Wars, LOTR and Vikings. And what's WITH the Vikings in space thing anyway. Was it easier to buy beard beads and puffy shirts on ETSY than come with new costume designs? I also object to the uraki that are just horses with weird masks on their heads that make what seem to be growly noises. Too much pew pew gun stuff for me. Compare this to the Mandalorian series. Rebel Moon is the lesser.I'm watching this for the visuals. This is the age of great fantasy and genre fiction. MK Jemisen is a favorite of mine. Film makers can be very conservative in developing stories. Maybe they need to read more. Or maybe they need to watch some of the good anime films that are on Netflix. Studio Ghibli should be an inspiration. Not the overdone Star Wars world.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I have nothing, again absolutely nothing agains Zack but man, that movie is a hard one to watch again.

Zack Snyder's directorial style may resonate with some, but based on my experience with this particular film, it didn't manage to engage me or live up to my expectations.

Remember when the Original 'Dune' film tried to compress 4 books into 90 minutes? This film takes a similar approach but even at over 2hours there a so much assumed backstory that you're lost halfway through.Once you get past the unoriginal plot - you're onto the script , casting and acting. All of which are stilted and horrible. Clunky dialogue that feels like each scene is rushed to get to the next scene without any improvement to plot. The accents are all over the place and even the SFX feels like it was cut in from a 20 years old sci-fi movie. And finally once you get past all of that.... There's the very heavy handed use of slow motion in the fight scenes. It's all so over the top and bad that this film will no doubt be an odds on winner for the Golden Raspberry Award. 3 out 10.

This leap into a 'Star Wars'-like universe lands in a charmless sandbox, with Snyder's overindulgence in slow-motion for even the simplest actions serving more as a narrative hindrance than an enhancement. The characters, as deep as action figures, meander through a plot stitched together from clichés of B-movie westerns and Kurosawa's classics, yet devoid of their essence.This space opera, embedded with 'Star Wars' DNA, fails to evoke the sense of awe and wonder it ambitiously aims for. Visually striking it may be, yet it's a landscape emotionally barren. Unlike 'Dunyayi Kurtaran Adam,' the Turkish cult classic that playfully dabbled with 'Star Wars' themes with a tongue-in-cheek approach, 'Rebel Moon' takes itself too seriously, morphing into an expensive parody, a shadow of the cinematic titans it attempts to replicate.In conclusion, 'Rebel Moon' is a visual feast starved of substance, proving that sometimes, less is indeed more in storytelling. Snyder's fondness for slow motion only adds to the film's overbearing atmosphere, making it a cumbersome watch.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It is 100% style and 0% substance. Every ounce of production was spent on trying to make a thing that looks ""cool"" and not one modicum of effort was spent on characters, narrative, cohesion, world-building, etc. There are so many problems with this movie and I'm annoyed that I haven't seen any reviews giving this the brutal scalding that it deserves.First of all, there is not one single thing in this movie that is unique. I saw a review describe this as a kid dumping out their toybox filled with bootleg action figures and bashing them together, and that's EXACTLY what it feels like. Take the worst, most generic tropes from every Space Opera (Star Wars, Dune, Warhammer, Riddick, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc), combine them and you get Rebel Moon. Every single character, scene, location, encounter, line of dialogue, etc is at best extremely uninspired and predictable, or is a nearly direct copy of something from another movie. For example there is a cantina scene here that is pretty much beat-for-beat the Mos Eisley scene. The motherworld or whatever is just House Harkonen/Imperium of Man/Necromongers, the Gyphon scene is straight out of Harry Potter/Avatar....you get the idea.The story is painfully stupid and suffers from the same inherent flaw as Justice League. This is another ""I'm forming a team"" movie where we're thrown into a universe that we know nothing about, and are rushed around to meet the characters who will form the squad at a breakneck pace without ever understanding why or what's going on. We're quickly introduced to each character on some random nondescript world, shown what is supposed to a poignant scene with them (which has no impact whatsoever because we know literally nothing about them) and then quickly move on and the character never speaks more than 2 lines for the rest of the film. It's impossible to care about anything because nothing is explained or connected in any meaningful way. To make it worse, the scenes are often incredibly silly and contrived, take the spider one for example -- the asian lady with swords (sorry, we're told nothing at all about this character so that's literally all I can say to describe her) kills the spider because it has been stealing children. However they say its been stealing children for a while yet only RIGHT NOW in front of our heroes the lady decides to kill her. There are no repercussions whatsoever for killing the spider, so why didn't she (or someone else) do it sooner? Every one of these scenes is exactly like this - completely lacking in logic.The narrative provides only the absolute bare minimum required to move the characters to the next place so they can find the next guy and we learn nothing of substance in any of these encounters.The other major problem with this film is that I never got the sense that the writers put any thought into the universe, not do they understand anything about how science, technology, or space work. Similar to the stupidity of Prometheus: no one ever wears space suits or a helmet for some reason, because I guess everyone can breathe everywhere in the universe and every planet is exactly the same as Earth in every way; when people do actually wear ""armor"" it's the most bizarre, half assed stuff that wouldn't protect you from anything (one in particular is like a half-finished roman cosplay outfit. Yeah very functional for futuristic combat I'm sure!). The level of technology is extremely inconsistent to a level of absurdity so great I'm not going to bother getting into it. There are a lot of throwaway lines that indicate how little thought was put into this universe. At one point the main girl mentions fighting for the empire when she was age 18 and that she ""fought on countless worlds"". Really, how did you have time to fight on COUNTLESS worlds being that young? Things in space are very, very, very far apart, how did you travel to countless worlds in the span of a few years? Are we really saying this universe even contains COUNTLESS (millions, billions?) of fully populated, habitable worlds in it? How would that even work? How does the empire keep control over millions of worlds, how do people travel and communicate over those distances? Anyway, my point is that there are tons of lines and scenarios in this movie that make it obvious that the only thing that mattered was making things and scenes that ""look cool"", and nobody cared that nothing makes a single shred of sense if you think about it for more than a second.Unfortunately, they barely even succeeded at the looking cool thing. A few things do look nice - a few of the Star Wars-derivative locations are nice to look at and a few costumes are ok as well. There is a robot that looks cool and seems important, but then after 2 minutes of screen time is never shown or mentioned again. That said, there is also a lot of horrendous CGI (the background on the moon is laughably atrocious), and a whole lot of scenes randomly going out of focus which feels painfully amateur.The fights are generally clunky, illogical, filled with ""extremely accommodating stunt men"" and the comically liberal use of slow motion.There's more I could say but I'm tired of expending mental resources thinking about this film. To sum it up: Rebel Moon is the worst aspects of Zack Snyder filmmaking, the worst aspects of Zack Snyder writing, and the worst aspects of the Space Opera genre. Watch at your own risk. 1 star for a few of the creature designs and 1 star because my cat seemed to be really into it and only ran away once.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Confining this type of story to two films may prove to be a congested decision. Instead of proper development, as seen in Dune (Part One) or Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, Rebel Moon rushes through its fundamental pieces to jumpstart an adventurous journey that would be more rewarding if the foundation had been set. The score by Tom Holkenborg is excellent and there are glimpses of triumphant moments, but Snyder quickly returns to his own stylistic choices that have proven to be unsuccessful in previous films. Staged sets with distinctive backdrops create an enclosed world to tell an expansive story which ultimately confines the unearthly element that makes this story unique. There's enough context to leave viewers wondering what will happen in Part 2, however I'm not sure many will be marking their calendars in April to find out.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was half expecting a bunch of apes to come out running into the action armed with crossbows and a wizard or two to run out waving a wand and chanting spells maybe flying on a broom.Personally I think I'm done with Snyder's films.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"" moment after another, the action scenes are over-choreographed & reliant on excessively used slo-motion to cover up their shortcomings, and the character development is practically non-existent, except for the main protagonist, who gets extended flashback scenes to give her her 'Gamora' backstory. As a result there is no empathising with any of the cardboard cutout cliches this movie is populated with.The plot is one that's been used over & over & over again. Seven Samurai, Magnificent Seven, Battle Beyond The Stars, and each one of those did it better.I'm not a Snyder hater, but he's always been better at adapting existing stories (300, Watchmen) than producing original work.Frankly, the prospect of a part two, and an extended cut is underwhelming & leaves me with no enthusiasm at all.

It's easy to see the parallels Snyder was trying to draw between his film and Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven, but these only serve to cripple the story in the character department. Kora is given a somewhat decent backstory, but virtually every other side character is given only one introductory action scene before they are shelved to make way for the next. This results in a collection of exciting but shallow set pieces that fail to function as the director intended simply because he has not given the audience nearly enough material to sympathize with most of the characters. It would've done the movie a lot of good to cut an action scene (or three) in order to show the cast interact with each other and bounce off of each other's vastly different backgrounds and experiences. Instead, the audience is given only the bare minimum in terms of character description before the plot moves along to the next scene. It makes it very difficult to feel the emotional impact of a character's sacrifice when the audience knows basically nothing about their motivations.In summary, Rebel Moon has some gorgeous cinematography and impressive (albeit very Snyder-ized slo-mo) action scenes, but lacks basic writing techniques needed for good characters. Good for one watch, but the script needs some serious re-drafting.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I couldn't stop thinking about how that's such a very small minded opinion that barely scrapes the surface of what this movie (and Star Wars for that matter) is. It definitely is it's own movie with it's own universe and story, and if you're not trying to nitpick everything that's ""wrong"" with the movie then you might have a good time watching it like I did. There isn't one problem with the acting, dialogue, scenery, special effects, or anything that I see most complaining about. I saw one review that said they could barely make it the first 10 minutes.

I can really see the Star Wars influence on this one, and how it could've played out if Snyder didn't have to abandon the franchise.It wasn't a perfect movie, the first half was cool and more character focused, but it was a bit slower. It spent its time introducing you to cool characters, who after their moment to shine in their intro, they don't do a whole lot. I wish I could've seen more of them, but I think we'll see them shine in the next one.Once the movie made it to its second half it went by really fast, and I was surprised when it ended ""so quickly""
It had the standard Snyder slow motion, which was cool, but several times felt overplayed and unnecessary.It's still a fun movie and I recommend to any science fiction fan out there.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

It felt like scene after scene was cut right out of a bunch of other films, stitched together to form a halfway coherent plot, and changed just enough to pass a plagiarism test. It was really just a mashup of tropes from popular films with zero character development. I sat through it only because I like some of the actors and was hoping the plot would actually come together and stsrt making sense at some point. It took me three sittings just to get through it. I'm generally love sci-fi and fantasy and am not super picky in those genres, but I could not help but audibly groan and roll my eyes throughout this movie. I reactivated my imdb account just to write a review because I don't think I've ever seen a worse movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

That is a directorial decision that should have been reviewed before someone gave Snyder another budget.Why, exactly, assemble this ragtag group of rebels only to not put them to use? How is it that they their existence and loyalties are known, yet scattered throughout the universe?How is it that the main protagonist presents as a young female, yet has enough Mary Sue energy to single handedly defeat a battle group of hardened military opponents?I kept thinking that this was Seven Samurai meets Firefly, and yet both of those thematic predecessors did their job with more thoughtful consistency to both character and plot.This appears to yet again be another exercise of Snyder getting a big budget for some laser flashes and ultra violence, but maybe somebody will eventually require that he employs a writer too.Ps. Why is everything on Netflix so mediocre? Could they plz start valuing quality over quantity? Even if they are trying to speak to multiple demographic cross sections, I'd prefer 3 good movies in any one category than 15 very mediocre ones. I legit can't remember the last time I recommended an original Netflix series to anyone I know.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

A start of one with this film. Several characters being introduced. The plot setting up for bigger events to come. Several worlds and set pieces.The plot is about a tyrant invading a peaceful farming world which Kora (Sofia Boutella) a hidden rebel soldier. Decides to recruit other warriors to help fight back against this tyrant.The film sets up with Kora recruiting several others by visiting there worlds. Convincing them to join her. Which is what majority of the film covers.There is a few action sequences. Great fight sequences with Sofia Boutella. The visual effects are good and set pieces are good. The cast ensemble is also good as well.The film does leave you feeling a little short. Especially the climax which the films action sequence felt like it was trimmed down. While Kora was doing most of the fighting. The team she built up felt underutilized during the climax which the film spent most of the run time building up the team and even on an epic scale. When it came to the climax it missed out on the epic and wow factor when it came to Kora fighting with the bad guys army. Hopefully, Zack Snyders directors cut version fixes all that. Cause the film did feel like they trimmed it down.Overall, it was a good film and i enjoyed it. Which I cant wait to see more films made and see what Zack Snyder does next.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

The hell, even 40+.And that folks demand way better acting in a first place (tbh, not that everyone sucks).Another thing - cheap ass SLOW MOTION effects in EVERY fighting scene? Was that done in a Cap Cut app? Cheese, childish, amateurish.In a first fighting scene, I expected a clean cut of an arm and pretty much gore and blood, yet immediately realised its kind of censored, but don't understand why? You have A LOT of violence here anyway, like smashing heads with a stick/pole, and you do fighting without blood? Adding gore in a visual way would ramped this movie up really good. Actually, in the last scene, there is a tiny bit of it..Some emotional scenes are like... commercials. Have a real TV commercial vibe. Or some 2000. Music video, idk. Its not good, however.It looks like no one who worked on this film had a freedom and everything is heavily limited because of this and that, idk. Seems that most of the actors decided to do this half ass.Movie made for everyone, yet no one will really like it.Good:+ But anyway.. somehow its a highly watchable movie. Not completely trash as it seems. It still IS kind of ""netflix generic crap"", but it has something, to hold attention, and even enjoying a bit.Photography is great, guns and shootings are well designed, space ships and frigates are solid, sound is great. Fighting is good (even with annoying slow motion and lack of blood and gore).Sceneries are great. Haircuts are original and perfect.Using of smoke effects is well done..Will watch part two, even if it is on the same level.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The characters are rather simple; the good guys have honor; no one else does. There's a giant spider woman and nasty mercenary creatures that look like orcs -- feels a bit like Tolkien's LOTR in Space (although there's no MacGuffin {One Ring} so far) with Warhammer-style ships and weapons. And we have an over-the-top stereotypical Nazi villain. The word derivative comes to mind.The casting seems generally fine, but the choice of Sofia Boutella (Hotel Artemis) for a super-warrior is a bit of a stretch. She's athletic but a bit unconvincing; I like her but I think she would have been better cast as a secondary warrior or perhaps a thief; she seems a bit small to go up against some of the hulking adversaries (but granted, her character's combat skills are impressively well-rounded).This Netflix movie begins and ends on an agricultural planet (The Shire?) populated by pseudo-Viking peasants. There's a town with a space-port full of dubious characters (think Star Wars ""bar"" scene).Conceptually, this is only a three (3) star film. But it gets a 1-star bonus for the impressive visuals, and another for the Zack Snyder touch. That's five (5) stars total.BTW, my favorite character is the thoughtful, melancholy robot -- the only story element that lingers, sadly.EDIT: Part 2 is now out. I'm in the minority that liked it better (gave it a 6); there is more character development. So if you're on the fence, endure Part 1 for the set-up, and Part 2 for some pay-off. Just my two cents.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Cool dark atmosphere but a lot of space travel where people are added to the team easy and without any real discussion, they just come along with a stranger with a suicide mission without any sense of camaraderie. The bad guys are super bad, almost comically drawn as the worst and then times 10. Not likely the staff of the universes most disciplined army where mistakes lead to crucifixion.The movie could have been really good and I usually are rather open minded when it comes to sci-fi, overlooking sound in space, gravity on spaceships and fast travel between planets that seem so go effort and cost free.A missed chance in my mind.

Director Zach Snyder, known for his visually arresting style, crafts a universe rich in detail and aesthetic splendor. The film is a feast for the eyes, with beautiful cinematography and cutting-edge animation that promises an epic sci-fi adventure.However, beneath this visual spectacle lies the film's Achilles' heel: a lack of substantive storytelling. The narrative feels secondary to the array of slow-motion action sequences, which, while impressively choreographed, do little to advance a compelling story. The film frequently indulges in these stylistic flourishes, often at the expense of developing a believable and engaging plot.The world of ""Rebel Moon"" is undeniably creative, a testament to Snyder's vision and the film's talented art team. Yet, this creativity doesn't extend to the script. The characters wander through stunning landscapes and elaborate set pieces, but their journey needs more depth and emotional resonance. It's a classic case of style over substance, where the narrative's potential is overshadowed by its visual execution.""Rebel Moon"" is a frustrating experience. It had the potential to be a groundbreaking piece of science fiction cinema, given its breathtaking visuals and innovative world. However, Snyder's focus on aesthetics and neglect of a solid storyline ultimately undermine the film's impact. It's a stark reminder that no amount of visual stimulus can compensate for the foundational need for robust and compelling storytelling in film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

He shows us 3-D images of characters, aliens, spaceships, and planets, but all without any true depth. If only Snyder had hired some actual story writers to add some meaning to his Sci-Fi idea, we could have ended up with a good movie. Snyder is good at imagining and directing action but safe to say at this point he is not a good writer. Hopefully Netflix has learned this lesson, unfortunately the hard way. This disaster reminds me of Rings of Power, and another cautionary tale of how desperately need good writing to make a good movie. So say we all?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Despite its two-hour runtime, it seemed as though important plot points were glossed over, leaving audiences disconnected from the narrative and its characters.However, amidst its shortcomings, there are glimpses of potential within the film's world-building. The universe presented holds promise for captivating tales and epic conflicts, yet these elements were not fully realized in this installment.

The contradiction between future technology and hand to hand fight scenes is comical and constantly breaks the suspension of disbelief.The actors mostly deliver their lines woodenly as if they can tell the plot line is farcical. Just about every scene comes across as if the actors were simply reading off a prompter in the background. I just finished watching Part One and I honestly don't know whether I will bother watching Part Two when it comes out in April. That should tell you something.Anyone checking the ratings for this movie should probably knock of 1 or 2 points for the shills that have written multiple extravagantly favorable reviews.

The film, directed by Zack Snyder, feels like a budget-friendly rendition of the iconic Star Wars universe, with a plot that echoes the timeless classic ""Seven Samurai.""Visually, ""Rebel Moon Part 1"" struggles to escape the shadows of its more established counterparts. The set designs, special effects, and overall production quality give off a distinct impression of a Netflix production values and attempt at capturing the grandeur of space opera. The spacecraft and alien landscapes lack the meticulous attention to detail that has become a hallmark of the genre, leaving viewers yearning for the immersive environments that have defined other sci-fi epics.The plot, while intriguing in its own right, cannot shake the feeling of déjà vu. ""Rebel Moon"" borrows heavily from the Seven Samurai trope, where a group of warriors is recruited to defend a vulnerable settlement against an impending threat. While this narrative formula has proven successful in the past, the film fails to inject sufficient originality or depth into its characters and storyline, making it feel more like a recycled concept than a fresh take on the genre.The characters, unfortunately, suffer from a lack of development, leaving audiences with thinly sketched archetypes that fail to evoke the emotional investment needed for a space epic. The dialogue feels stilted at times, and the performances, though earnest, struggle to elevate the material beyond its derivative nature.Despite these shortcomings, ""Rebel Moon Part 1"" does manage to offer some entertaining moments. Action sequences are passable, and the film occasionally hits the mark with its attempts at humor. However, these fleeting highs are not enough to redeem a movie that ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to breathe new life into the space opera genre.In conclusion, ""Rebel Moon Part 1"" falls into the trap of emulating the giants that came before it, particularly Star Wars, without successfully carving out its own identity. While the homage to Seven Samurai adds a layer of familiarity, it also reinforces the feeling that we've seen this story unfold in more captivating ways. As the first installment in a planned series, one can only hope that subsequent chapters will find a way to break free from the shadows and forge a unique path among the stars.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

In recent times, only ""The Mandalorian"" has given me that feeling..... Many critics over the years of watching dozens of fantasy pictures mixed with attempts to blend and integrate actors into super-realistic, computer-generated works like ""Avatar"", etc., lose their sense of reality, of what they really like, and can no longer see other pictures as examples of independent art...

Later in the film, there are scenes which are supposed to be somewhat comical, but this was the one time I laughed while watching.I tried to watch this, thinking maybe it's a cult film, so bad that it's good, but halfway through I realized this is following the idea from Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, one of my top ten films and felt like it's impossible to continue. Kurosawa's film is a great classic, perfect as a movie, while this one is just terrible.Action is bad, it goes slo-mo in unusual places, I guess it's Zack Snyder's attempt to distinguish from other directors. I'm getting tired to see tiny women throwing big guys around, it's just such an off putting theme these days. And that's the least sucky thing in this movie.The dialogue is so wooden you could build a summer cottage using the script. Sofie Boutella, a charismatic actor who I liked a lot in SAS Rogue Heroes, tries her best but it doesn't help.Only thing I liked in this film was that in some places sets reminded of colorful and moody old westerns with painted backgrounds.

A Runtime of two hours and thirteen minutes. Streaming on Netflix with a PG-13 rating.Set in a futuristic setting. ""Kora"" played by Sofia Boutella lives on a small distant moon where the only thing taking place on this planet is farming. ""Gunnar"" played by Michiel Huisman takes the lead on organizing and selling their crops.There is a huge war going on. Well not so much now. They're tyrants and people fighting against them. But this small community of farmers stays out of it and just worries about the farming.Well, they did until commander ""Atticus Noble"" played by Ed Skrein came to their planet looking for a rebel who's been a thorn in this regime's side. As well as get his troops fed for the foreseeable future.But things didn't go well. After causing chaos and giving this community a deadline of an unrealistic quota of crops to fill. While also leaving boots on the ground(soldiers) to help oversee things while he's gone. This will cause ""Kora"" true identity to come out. Let's just say she's no farmer but an elite warrior with a back story.Some might say she was brave for sticking up for these people after the boots on the ground were causing nothing but mayhem. But now she has to deal with the repercussions of it. This causes her to leave the planet with ""Gunnar"" in hopes of finding warriors to help defend this planet against ""Atticus Noble"".You watch as she searches and collects a handful of talented people. Like ""Titus"" played by Djimon Hounsou, ""Nemesis"" played by Bae Doona, ""Bloodaxe"" played by Ray Fisher, ""Tarak"" played by Staz Nair, and ""Kai"" played by Charlie Hunnam.Even with the most skilled fighters will this be enough to help stop what's perceived to be an unstoppable force? Find out in the first part of this two-part film.""Rebel Moon: Part One- A Child of Fire"" had too much going on. Netflix gave Zack Snyder the keys to the house. Giving him all the actors he could ask for and a massive budget. Letting him create the framework of his version of ""Star Wars"". There are even lightsabers in this film. At least his version of them.This was a huge mistake. I think this should have been a series. It was way too much going on and if you started thinking about it, it didn't make much sense. Zack was obsessed with slow motion. There was a lot of Tom's foolery going on in between scenes. The action is what made it tolerable. But then that got redundant with slow motion after slow motion. Like, switch it up a little.It felt like A combination of a bunch of different films. ""Avatar"", ""Star Wars"", ""How to Train Your Dragon"", ""Dune"", ""Fifth Element"", ""Matrix"", and the ""Pitch Black"" franchise to name a few. The audio was a mess as well. High and low throughout the film.For a new franchise that you knew had multiple films coming, this felt rushed. I didn't get that. They have plans if this is successful to build a whole universe. Not many people get that type of power.Zack Snyder is already talking about a Snyder cut. Every time the film isn't good he always says if the film I wanted to put out came out it would be completely different. I understood the issue with Warner Bros. His Snyder cut of ""Justice League"" was better. But I don't want to hear that with this film. I don't. Put out the best cut from the jump.I'm not looking forward to the next film. Such a lot of promise but they dropped the ball with this. The action scenes were dope and Ed Skrein plays the villain so well. His jawline just screams butthead. A collection of talented actors with a script that felt rushed. This is not to bash Zack. I love most of his films. I'm just disappointed because he was talking a big game while filming. Mentioning how Netflix is letting him be great. I expected him to knock it out of the park. Instead, he barely made it to first base. I give this a strong two mor fire 🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

Such a great movie. Probably would have done very well in the he theater also. I would have to say a lot of people sure are becoming snobby about what movies are coming out now. This movie has a 1977 star wars type vibe to it. Lots of great sci-fi and a ton of action. Takes a little bit of the movie to really get going, but once it does it seems to pull you in more and more. Im very glad that they are planning on making these into a trilogy. You definitely have a fan and I plan on making sure all my movie theater friends know about this movie and any future ones.","7 out of 22 found this helpful.

A films plot doesn't have to be original to be good, a certain level of cliche and tropes can make an excellent film if well implemented or with a decent twist applied; this was none of those things. The Magnificent Seven in space minus all the charm; good dialogue, good set pieces and drama. Everything about the film seemed horribly mechanical and flat; Plot flat and obvious; dialogue wooden and with no real emotional effect; characterisation almost non existent, action, overblown slow mo fest with bad guys rooted to the spot whilst the 'hero' spins around a lot firing a pistol like a gangsta rapper. Frankly it looked like the sort of thing a film club could come up with. Bad guys straight out of a violent panto. Some of the visuals where quite good but for a lot of film you cant get it out of your head that you're really watching 6 actors on an empty sound stage with everything CGI'd in afterwards and various horrible colour filters applied. In space everything is grey or brown bar the sky apparently. And after all of that we only get half the 'story'. I assume the 2nd half will be an orgy of slow mo battles but will anyone care. A final thought is the 1980 release ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" does the same MS in space trip and despite cheesiness and low special effects actual has more charm and heart than this effort; Characters actually have character and the whole story is done in one sitting.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

You could make it at least a half a decent movie out of this instead it is just boring. I really tried but as with the justice league I did not last over 30minutes.Maybe indeed too much attention paid to franchise instead of to the story?

The pacing was really weird the characters were incredibly awkward, like no chemistry at all which made it really hard for me to care one bit about them. The ""main cast"" as in the five characters that were supposed to form some league (???) had close to no interaction between each other and some had almost no screen time more than a brief introduction. And speaking of their introduction, they were really awkward and I was honestly confused at times why they even spent time on it but then at the end I realised it was because they wouldn't have any screen time at all without it.

Ultimately it's seven 'outlaws' against the evil empire or whatever. The idea sounds great. The seven samurai is a classic after all.That said, the movie, or more specifically, part one, doesn't really grab anything. They made everyone too generic. Killed off the actors or characters that had real potential to save the ones with known names. There are many ways this could have been done better, not use Zack Snyder, possibly may have been one option. His movies are stilted and lifeless. This is a mediocre movie at best.

"5","/10","Rebel Moon focuses on world building and big epic spectacles instead of good storytelling, a good sci-fi film - My Ultimate Review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9513256/?ref_=tt_urv","Holt344","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80693802/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2023","Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire is finally here, the first part of the Rebel Moon duology and universe Zack Snyder has created. I have been looking forward to this film for quite some time, I'll be going through more of my thoughts in different paragraphs down below. This is very much Zack Snyder's film as Netflix gave him complete freedom, with him directing it along with co-writing the screenplay with Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, also producing it and serving as the film's cinematographer. But it's not ""the"" film I hoped for as I thought it would have been R-Rated from the beginning, this PG-13 cut is visually striking but lacking in certain ways when you clearly see its supposed to be R-Rated, but then again this makes that more people get the opportunity to watch the film which is always good. The inspiration is clearly from Akira Kurosawa's film, Seven Samurai, with a sci-fi touch. Zack Snyder first conceived the idea from a Star Wars pitch before becoming its own thing, Star Wars was heavily influenced and inspired by Kurosawa and Dave Filoni made an episode dedicated to Seven Samurai in The Clone Wars show.The film is set in a fictional galaxy ruled by the Motherworld, whose military, the Imperium, threatens a farming colony on the moon Veldt. Kora, a former Imperium soldier, ventures on a quest to recruit warriors from across the galaxy to make a stand against the Imperium before they return to Veldt.Starting off with a voice over by Anthony Hopkins (who does the voice for Jimmy) it was the right choice as it gave us a feeling of this new world Snyder had created. Other than Hopkins in a small role, its ensemble cast features Sofia Boutella, Djimon Hounsou, Ed Skrein, Michiel Huisman, Doona Bae, Ray Fisher, Charlie Hunnam and Staz Nair. Sofia Boutella holds her own in the ensemble, yet occasionally falling in the shadows of her more well known actorsAbout the writing, I had hopes that the villains and antagonists would be three dimensional but nope they were one or two dimensional. There's a sequence at 30 minutes into the film where Kora saves a woman from being raped and abused by a couple of soldiers, the writing was not very good except for showing Kora's character development and for bringing an action sequence, but the thing is the choreography wasn't even that good and it focused mainly on coolness. The flashback action scenes told by Kora were good. The next big sequence has Kora and Gunnar visit a town called ""Providence"" which made the planet ""Veldt"" much more interesting, seeing the different kinds of aliens which co-inhabit the planet and world. Here's also the first great action sequence, which introduces Charlie Hunnam's character. I've read critics criticizing the storytelling and character development, I agree with them. Zack Snyder needs praise for the world building, that aspect of the storytelling is fantastic, but the smaller stuff like character introductions and overall writing wasn't very good. It comes off that Zack Snyder focuses more on spectacle than a well written story, like in the scene we get introduced to Tarak, I found him cliched and simply boring and after a scene of dialogue we get this spectacle with Snyder doing what he's best, creating a painting like frame. I know Zack Snyder can do better than this, given more time writing a better script would have improved the film heavily. The character development isn't quite there, I'll give that a pass though because of how this is 1/2 of a film, why it's called Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire. The characterization though, that's something I can criticize, it's not very good and although I like the casting and actors playing them, the characters doesn't have a lot of depth making most of them two-dimensional. The final big set piece, the climax, it was actually one of the high points of the film. One certain twist and a brilliant action sequence, the film's best. For a story that started interesting but quickly lost its way, the ending was actually quite great.My honest opinion, I think it's great that Zack Snyder gets the chance to be his own cinematographer, but same with Army of the Dead, Rebel Moon suffers from an issue with motion blur and things looking unfocused. Stylistic? Perhaps. But why blur out things when you can use that to establish the world, and when it's blurry inside interiors where lots of characters are, it just becomes that it bothers me. Yet, the film looks utterly fantastic and the visuals are spectacular, with some great camera angles. Snyder has never made a bad looking film, his stylistic choices are great. The costume department, art direction and production design, are all terrific. Making it even more visually striking. The musical score by Tom Holkenborg was fantastic, giving each scene that extra depth. I think Zack Snyder's direction was actually quite great, both in his visual storytelling and his direction to the actors. The visual effects were top notch, making Marvel and DC nowadays feel like a B movie.If you dislike Zack Snyder's other movies, then Rebel Moon isn't a film for you. It has quite a slow pacing with lots of dialogue, all to build up a universe and second film, characters like Titus played by Djimon Hounsou will have a much larger role in the upcoming film. Inspired heavily on Seven Samurai as I've written before, yet far from meeting the same expectations. You see, Seven Samurai is three hours and takes the first two hours if not more to set up its characters, their characterizations and making them all three-dimensional. Meanwhile, Rebel Moon focuses more on world building and big epic spectacles, instead of giving that time and attention for its characters. I think the film would have been better if world and universe building was an after thought, as there would probably have been more focus on the screenplay. For what it's worth, I liked the film despite its many flaws. From whom do I recommend Rebel Moon to? To fans of the sci-fi genre but also for fans of Zack Snyder.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It would almost have to be.I will give Snyder credit for a good-looking film, and the monster bird that has to be ""broken"" isn't bad, but slapping some prosthetics on the heads of horses is just plain lazy.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

This film is so average it's difficult to write a review about it. The film is so dull and generic it makes you wonder how it even managed to get this far into production. Generic isn't necessarily bad, but a stroke of creativity doesn't hurt right?There's no amount of originality to the script. Keep in mind, originality in art translates to execution. Of course, this is nothing new under the sun-but execution is what makes or breaks anything in life. In this case, Rebel Moon is a movie that a 12-year-old would come up with. Scratch that, that's an insult to 12 years olds everywhere. Rebel Moon is a movie a lazy person would come up with to pass the time.The pedestrian storytelling and script are severely lacking. The worldbuilding is uncreative--it's like no effort went into to anything here. The characters are largely forgettable--I cannot recall anyone's name lol. We never get to know any of the characters beside the farmer dude and the MFC. Everyone else *shrug* no clue. Why did they even exist in the movie in the first place?I can say the only thing the movie had going for it are the SFX, but that's not really saying much in the long run. That's the equivalent of saying you like the font a book was written in and the little illustrations throughout, but the story itself was kinda whatever.In the end, it's good entertainment if you want to watch something that you could laugh and talk through because you aren't missing out on anything noteworthy in regards to plot.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

A 5 star rating seems accurate. Both husband and I were on our phones at multiple points throughout. There's a couple exciting scenes and some of it looks pretty cool. But it's not engaging, it's not thought provoking, it's predictable. Idk if it's Snyder or Netflix, but it clearly is trying to be like Dune.Not a unique plot at all. Very predictable. I wasn't even that impressed with the graphics. For a Netflix/Snyder film, I was expecting better but it did not meet my expectations (in terms of plot or graphics).Didn't pass the Bechdal test either but again it's Snyder so not surprised.AND there's a weird distortion at most points in the whole movie. The entire edge of the screen as well as background and often foreground have this weird distortion, that almost looks like a TikTok filter. It messed with our eyes and we had to adjust for a bit.Not the worst movie, but if there was a better option, I would pick that. Just doesn't seem like many good movies out these days.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's shamelessly derivative and full of cartoon characters that just don't work.It is a blatant takeoff of Star Wars mixed in with the Seven Samurai having poor, innocent farmers being threatened with death if they don't hand over all their grain to the evil empire which turns up unannounced in the sky above their idyllic village. Why a galaxy-spanning empire that has the technology to build sentient robots and starships the size of aircraft carriers needs grain is not explained. The two dimentional villain is a Darth Vader ripoff without the cool cape and helmet who is run by an emperor who is even more evil. It even turns out he's a cybernetically enhanced Darth Vader ripoff. This guy just delights in violence and cruelty for its own sake and as a result the character is simply vapid as are his comic-book lines and facial expressions. The real Darth Vader was a far, far better villain who had depth and Ian McDiarmid's Emperor Palpatine was a stellar performance rendering Rebel Moon's attempts at these types mere cardboard cutouts by comparison.The hero is just as vapid. The often-seen-in-action-films-these-days sylph-like girl out for revenge who can break bones and the laws of motion physics with equal ease is simply boring and unbelievable.The scenes and locations are blatant Star Wars ripoffs too. The trek across a barren planet to a thug-infested spaceport where there is a fight in a seedy bar full of strange looking aliens. The joining forces of the hero with a mercenary so the hero can hitch a lift on his starship. The villain's mortal injury and cybernetic resurrection at the end...I could go on and I'm surprised Lucasfilm/Disney haven't sued for copyright infringement and plagiarism.To reiterate: we've seen all this before and it was done better.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's not terrible. It's watchable. People's expectations and standards are so high. Not everything is, or can be, the best thing ever.People are complaining about the acting. The acting is fine. Lord knows we've seen much worse. One thing I found weird was Charlie Hunnam's accent. Actually, in sci-fi movies set in a different galaxy it's always strange when accents are Earth regional, but we just have to get past that, since the actors are from Earth. 😁. I guess I'm used to either Brit or American accents in Space because I found his Irish accent a bit distracting. And, Irish? He isn't even Irish, so this was an odd decision. Someone said there was no motivation for anyone who joined the rebel crew. Actually I found their individual motivations to be pretty clear.Overall, I enjoyed it. I liked the world building and the esthetic of the different locations. Mainly, I'm just happy to have some sci-fi that isn't set in a dystopian future. I'm so tired of that. For the past few years the majority of sci-fi seems to be a mix of dystopia and zombies with a few super heroes and monsters thrown in. For me, this is a welcome change. I'll definitely watch part 2.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The constant use of slo-mo into normal speed for each action movement oooooover and oooooover and ooooover again makes this almost unwatchable.

This was an exceptional film with great graphics, great acting, and a lot of nuggets dropped to get you to buy in to the ongoing saga. Sure it is a little plastic in terms of character depth. It started as a film so it doesn't have the richness of a film built on an epic novel. But it hit all my joy points and I was even left thinking about it after it was over. This was a very good movie. Far better than any of the Star Wars films except maybe the original 3.Rebel Moon is Star Wars for grown adults. Ignore the reviews. Go see it. Enjoy it.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The storyline is flat and obviously, there is actually not much character development and personally I miss enough depth of backgroundstories and motivation of most characters. Which is quite sad cause a lot of sets are promising. The diversity of planets and populations are quite interesting. But there is no moment to dive in because the movie feels rushed through. I didn't liked the CGI. It didn't felt contemporary so that at no point I had a feeling to really dive in and let myself go with all of it.... and the slow motion scenes are just to much. The fight scenes seem pretty predictable and sometimes I felt it was missing a certain flow (waiting for the next move or enemy to attack, something happened so they start shooting without any aiming and such things)It has a lot of potential but it needs to slow down has to give every single character time to unfold to make it plausible that this character needs to be in the team. It needs to connect more with the diversity of its surroundings and needs to find it's own way to develop an universe worth to be told.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Even on a lower budget, his goal is always to make his films feel grand. I have enjoyed a lot of his films, so I will always give his efforts a chance, even if they don't look good throughout promotion. Well, his latest release, Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire is now streaming on Netflix and I must say, even though I didn't hate it, it's one of his weakest films for sure. A lot of people are tearing this film apart and while I agree with a lot of the criticisms I'm hearing, I did find some good in it. I won't be recommending this one, but I will say that I liked it just enough to watch the sequel coming in a few months, so there's that.Much like many Sci-Fi stories, Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire is simply about a hero who needs to form a team to take down a looming threat. With that said, when you start incorporating robots, cantinas, laser swords, space travel, and a massive villain showdown, eyebrows will be raised. Personally, this is a film that knows it's borrowing from all the classics and it runs with it, so I just chose to forgive it and try to experience it for what it is. Sofia Boutella as Kora is honestly pretty wooden in her performance, which is a shame because I have loved her in the past and this entire film is on her shoulders. Many of the side characters were far more interesting to me. I'm going to move on from the characters though, because that's probably the worst part of the film (nobody gets any real development) and I don't want to rant about just that. I also know that a version of this film is coming that's an hour longer, so I'll be even more frustrated if they're fleshed out more later on.I also think this film suffers from having a smaller budget from Netflix. It film tries to look huge, but the CGI doesn't quite match up in my opinion. The slow motion didn't hurt the film for me like others are saying and I thought the action was fun. The exciting aspects of this film are really why I give it a pass. The screenplay however needed some work. The dialogue is very simplistic and over-explanatory all at the same time. It felt like the characters were reading a description from a novel, rather than dialogue for a feature film. It wasn't bad writing in general, it just didn't feel like a script, which to me might be worse.Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire is not a good film by any means, but I'd be lying if I said I hated watching it. It was the perfect film to relax in the afternoon and watch. That's probably not the intended idea behind this film and it does have a lot of wasted potential, but I still mildly enjoyed it. Again, this one isn't getting a recommendation from me, but I do believe it's better than the terrible reviews out there. It's now streaming on Netflix and if you had any interest already, you may still enjoy it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Overall exciting and enjoyable to watch and not a star wars ripoff like some people seem to think it is. I enjoy many of the actors they got and the not so subtle 40k inspirations. What this movie does lack is going full on with the 40k inspiration. Could have been more high Gothic in design, could have had mentions of the warp and daemons. Could have used extreme prejudice against all alien lifeforms. But it did capture the imperiums need of subjugating planets and stripping them of their resources by any means necessary. Keep in mind this movie could also just be inspired by Dune as well given 40k and Dunes connection to one another.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

There are no clever twists, honest dialogue or original stories.

A leading light in this rebellion, Kora (Sophie Boutella) is hidden there and wipes out a small group of Nobles' men. She then hurriedly leaves the planet with rather cowardly and smitten farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) in tow to recruit a range of colourful fighting characters to take on Noble and the Motherworld.Whilst this is nowhere near as bad as some critics are making out, there is still a good deal wrong with it. The 'characters' such as they are, are completely flat and dull as ditchwater and are recruited by Boutella to the cause one by one in a long series of set pieces of varying quality a la Magnificent Seven, Snyder's Justice League etc. The story is just so derivative of better works, most obviously Star Wars it defies belief including a C3PO robot character played by a miscast Anthony Hopkins who when he speaks sounds like he's delivering a Shakespeare monologue from the London stage. Finally, like other Snyder films it has far too much exposition and far too much anti climactic epilogue.On the plus side Boutella is convincing in the lead, Skrein is great fun as the villain whose moral compass and he parted centuries ago and some of the set pieces are impressively staged. It is not enough though, there is clearly a desire here to create another franchise which will sit nicely with Snyder's many loyal fans which I'm sure it will. (They will no doubt write to Snyder asking if Mark Hamill could join the rebellion) I will pick up with part 2, but I think that will be enough for me.

In a cinematic landscape where immersion is key, Rebel Moon misses the mark, overshadowed by scenes that prioritize visual extravagance over a sensible storyline.

There is little to no twists or gasp moments to draw you in. The main character is dragged into the position of playing hero, and finds other ragtag fighters to help her fight the big bad. But I will say for the true Sci Fi fan, this is Easter egg galore... from Avengers to Matrix to Star Wars to Star Trek to Mad Max to Beetlejuice to Harry Potter... the scenes play out like a recap of Sci Fi over the last decade.

The effects are good.The acting is even pretty good. I think our main issue was it was too much like every other show I mentioned.I agree with some other reviews saying there are too many characters and not enough development for them. Maybe the second installment will remedy that.The accents kind of threw me off but I dont know how made up aliens should talk so...

In the realm of contemporary cinema, diversity in genres is imperative for a well-rounded cinematic landscape. While some may argue for the significance of movies like ""Creator,"" which delve into serious undertones and intellectual exploration, fun films like ""Rebel Moon"" hold their own importance offering audiences distinct experiences. What makes ""Rebel Moon"" particularly noteworthy is its ability to deliver an even larger visual ambition within a similar budget range, with a staggering $166 million allocated for the production of two parts.I would have loved to see ""Rebel Moon"" in cinemas with 3D. Especially since some of my favorite 3D visuals are of Zack.I had several goosebump moments, accompanied by solid visuals that elicit a resounding ""hell yeah."" These goosebump-inducing moments contribute to the film's ability to resonate emotionally with the audience, creating a memorable viewing experience. The visual prowess of the movie is undoubtedly one of its strongest attributes, providing a feast for the eyes that complements the narrative.However, the film does not come without its criticisms. Achieving the right balance between providing necessary information and maintaining a dynamic storyline is a delicate task, and ""Rebel Moon"" might lean slightly towards the side of excessive exposition.Another point of contention lies in the characterization of certain roles. While Sir Anthony Hopkins delivers a standout performance, other characters such as Djimon Hounsou's Titus and Michael Huisman's Gunnar may come across as a bit on the nose. Finding the right balance in character development is crucial, and the film could benefit from a more nuanced approach to these roles to avoid veering into stereotypical or predictable territory.Despite these minor critiques, the ensemble cast, as a whole, fulfills their roles admirably. Each actor contributes to the narrative, ensuring that the movie maintains its momentum and keeps the audience engaged. The overall execution of the characters is mostly perfect, demonstrating the proficiency of the cast in bringing the story to life.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

But I also have a soft spot for the subgenre of women who hurt men who hurt women and I really like the impetus of this whole conflict being around the supplying of food to one faction.There's a good movie hiding in here. The budget was obviously huge because the fights are fun and more interesting than Star Wars. The entire aesthetic makes little cohesive sense, neither does the various accents people have. Like, how does one father have an accent but the daughter does not? The world bible for this thing must be wild to see.I think I liked this more than the last two Star Wars though.

While it showcases impressive action sequences, a captivating screenplay, and commendable performances, it falls short in certain areas, hindering its potential greatness.The film boasts a series of truly badass slow-mo action sequences that are sure to left with just one word, wow. The film also delivers thrilling moments that showcase the film's high production values and meticulous attention to detail.The screenplay of Rebel Moon Part 1 is another strong aspect, offering an intriguing storyline that sets the stage for an epic space opera. The narrative explores themes of rebellion, sacrifice, and the fight for freedom, creating a sense of urgency and emotional resonance. However, the film suffers from a slightly underdeveloped first act which could have benefited from more refined pacing and exposition.While the direction of Rebel Moon Part 1 is generally solid, there is room for improvement. The film sets up a vast and immersive world, but at times, the direction lacks the grandeur and polish necessary to fully bring it to life. Also, there is no emphasis given to character development. With a more visionary approach, the film could have achieved a greater sense of scale and spectacle, elevating the overall experience.Another weak aspect of the film lies in the love story between Kora and Gunnar. Although the potential for a compelling romance is present, the development of their relationship feels rushed and underdeveloped. More attention could have been given to their connection, allowing audiences to invest emotionally in their journey.The editing of Rebel Moon Part 1 is a mixed bag. While certain scenes are expertly crafted and contribute to the film's narrative flow, there are instances where the editing feels uneven. Some scenes appear unnecessary or could have been tightened, occasionally disrupting the film's overall pacing and rhythm.The performances in Rebel Moon Part 1 are undeniably commendable, although Ed Skrein's performance as Admiral Atticus Noble stands out amongst the crowdIn conclusion, Rebel Moon Part 1: A Child of Fire presents an enjoyable cinematic experience with its badass action sequences, strong screenplay, and commendable performances. However, the film falls short in certain areas, particularly in carving out the love story and maintaining consistent editing. With improved direction and a more refined first act, the film had the potential to reach greater heights.Despite these shortcomings, Rebel Moon Part 1 sets the stage for a more action-packed part 2 that leaves me eagerly anticipating what comes next.8/10.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

What's the point? If the whole point of this movie is to make women look masculine and men look feminine, then this movie should be rated a TEN, but that's about all it was good at... and it's sad because it had SO MUCH PROMISE. The lead actress had no depth by the middle of the movie. She had one expression, one delivery (just like the lead in the LOTR Trilogy, when women forget about being tough, and just mimic men, it comes across as very one dimensional). Women can be tough without acting like a man.I feel bad for the men in this film. They were all dependent on her for safety. They were useless followers.

"5","/10","Unrefined film lost between Nazi - and Norse - exploitation, Star Wars ripoff","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9516026/?ref_=tt_urv","Jon-Osterholm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2168476/?ref_=tt_urv","24 December 2023","Much of the way through, I felt that this epic -- epically stiff -- production must have suffered from being over budget and forced to be tightly restrained, so much that the final work didn't quite get the attention it needed. Whether that's true or not, it felt like it. The film felt it was not thoroughly developed, not rewritten enough to reach clarity, not expertly directed and edited. It did not achieve the kind of action or narrative pace, nor character growth, to keep a clever viewer engaged. It was not refined, no more than something for an audience to stare at 'xplosions 'n' pew-pews, a film one might let distract them while in a waiting room. This was rarely a popcorn-chomping film full of ""wow.""I'm not resentful, but I wanted to like this story; I wanted to love this film. I was intrigued by the backstory -- it is rooted in a rejected Star Wars story pitch by Snyder -- and interested to see how Snyder and team might build a Star Wars-esque space opera that didn't feel like a ripoff -- or awkward in other ways. It felt like a ripoff. Plus, there are some obvious cultural and accent similarities that I liked at first, but was annoyed by, in total.There is a space-Norse villager feel, which might have been OK on its own, but then space Nazis (Motherworld enforcers) showed up to be cold and cruel. Then, Charlie Hunnam's character had an... Irish accent, umm, sorta. Why? (Why not just go with his native Aussie accent?! Just a thought.)Rebel Moon Pt. 1 is filled with some intended intense characters, some intended bold action sequences, and has a basic story that must have been great in a pitch session. But, with whatever struggles were encountered in creating this Netflix film, it did not make for a finished product that offered a refined, watchable tale.It was not as horrible as, say, ""The Spirit"" (a painfully stiff 2008 Frank Miller fantasy flick), but it is not even on par with, for example, ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" (a decent, not great, 2018 Han Solo origin film), in its cohesion and entertainment value.What makes it worth it? The actors and the characters, while not fully developed in this struggling narrative. As the lead baddie, Ed Skrein does evil well. I am a sucker for star Sofia Boutella (Algerian actor, you might know her from a ""Star Trek"" reboot film or ""The Mummy"" with Tom Cruise, among other films) is about as intense a female actress as is out there. Other actors show up and their skills are apparent, but get hammered by the stumbling last half of the film. Boutella and the other actors can't save this story, but she and some others make it watchable. Just not watchable enough.So, is the Zack Snyder director's cut of this coming? Hopefully, they'll put more effort into it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But then you've got to somehow beat an old black and white movie in Japanese with no special effects made by one of the greatest directors the world has ever seen.The vast amount of money needed to make such an epic with spectacular effects unfortunately doesn't compare to the wonderful photography, great acting and magnificent battle scenes of the original.Maybe 5/10 is generous.

You simply can't present all of this adequately in 2 hours. It was all very rushed.Kora, Gunnar, Kai, Tarak, Nemesis, Titus, Admiral Noble, the Bloodaxe brothers, the droid... So many characters that you *should* care about, but you don't. I felt unable to empathize with any of them. I didn't even feel sad about a character's death, because... it doesn't make any difference. It's just a random character.I am very disappointed. I really expected more.

Visually this movie did an amazing job. All the landscapes and scenes look nice and crisp. It was a very enjoyable immersive sensation.In terms of storytelling, I like that the main character has a strong background with a moral dilemma and is not heroin who came to power just because of random events that made her better. She struggled and did things like every other person could have.The only negative I can really say about this movie is that I believe the story was very rushed. I believe this might have been decided to explain as much as possible as fast as possible to make the audience understand the situation. I am not aware if this is based on other source material or if this is an original story, but I believe this is the reason they made the first chapter so packed. I am actually interested in where this story goes. This movie did a good job of triggering my imagination and making me want more.But I do believe this series can become more successful, but they are going to have to slow it down a little and do more character development. By the end, besides the main character, I knew very little about the other characters, just a few comments that left me with more questions than answers. I believe there's a lot of potential here if they take the time to develop all the characters and lore.

For real, I don't remember most of the names after I watched the movie.We know only hints about the main guys (the admiral takes like 2 minutes talking about them), why or how they become who they are is also mostly unanswered. No interesting addition whatsoever by the brief scenes when they are assembling the team.The visuals were somewhat OK, but the too many slow motion mid-fight scenes were terrible at times. And why do I have the feeling that some elements are taken from Star Wars?Almost no screen time for about the most (or the only) interesting character, the robot which was voiced by Sir Anthony Hopkins. What a shame.I don't think the second part will save this title...this is the uninteresting version of a galaxy far, far away with a hint of Harry Potter with the crow-headed griffin. Don't sit down watching this if you have any hopes about originality or a nicely built up movie and character development.I give a 4, because the visuals and the music was ok, but a zero for story and the characters.

All I kept saying from that point on was 'what?'.Totally wasted opportunity and not what I expected from Mr Snyder. Very disappointed.m with this. If you want to waste a couple of hours but not be worried about good writing o script then go for it. If you want something that has solid story and character development then avoid like the plague.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The vfx and alien worlds all look spectacular. The lore beneath the surface is itching to come out and explode into all of our faces. There is so much there that it leaves me wanting more. The characters are pretty cool, and the action is of course top notch. I do have issues with the fast pacing and hopefully the directors cut helps with that. And I know we'll know more about the characters later, but still wanted to know more of their back stories in the first part. There is inspiration from a lot of other works (not just Star Wars), but has its own identity and feel. I think this might be one of my favorite films of the year even with its flaws. It was there to mostly set up the universe and the characters. I am excited for more from this universe because by the end I just needed more of it in general. Part 2, the extended cuts, and the comic can't come soon enough!","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

A CGI mess of a creation with nothing original that hadn't been stolen from other projects. Dialog so contrived you can predict each character's next line in advance. Even the better of an otherwise second rate cast (Anthony Hopkins amongst them) is forced to vomit crappy dialog, and poorly so.10 minutes in, the remaining time left of the story is easy to see coming. It almost feels like a setup for a future video game. The attempt for the scenes to appear ""timeless"" has viewers needing to reconcile the confusing mashup of 1800's England with some proposed distant future.

It would be one thing if it was advertised as a knockoff or even a spoof (e.g. Spaceballs), but it appears Snyder and the 5th graders didn't tell anyone at Netflix that's what they were up to. If you watch it, the best way to make it through is to try to count all the movies that are referenced in it. Otherwise, you might not make it to the end. To get you started, the obvious ones are Star Wars and...wait for it...Gladiator.

And more of a summary or the boring vignette of one, completely devoid of build-up and payoff. With time-wasting scenes, predictable outcomes seen from miles away, terrible pacing, and formulaic execution in every event. The problem is that it feels SO small, when it wants to be too big. A perfect example of everything wrong with recent cinematic attempts at trying to make something big without a soul.Content-wise there Farmer Land, Japanese Land, Cowboy Land, Coliseum World.. there's not an ounce of creativity to be seen. Either in narrative, alien lifeforms, culture, technology or developments. And the epic-sounding background music has the opposite intended effect! Makes it all seem childish, with generic science fiction out of a Kellogg's box and a stink of unfulfilled grandeur, like a hero's anthem played on kazoo. Then the Battle choreographies are dull and poorly made. I've seen enough to know the overuse of slow motion ruins everything, and the poor direction and camerawork puts the actors and stunt workers to shame. Not to say anyone is charming or endearing. Everyone seems like charisma-vacuums, and the dialogue is almost inconsequential. Oh, and Sofia Boutella should not be screaming her lines.. makes her look like a novice.I didn't particularly enjoy the recent Dune.. but by God does it do things better! There are characters, stakes and tension..
This, on the other hand, is one of the worst pieces of big-budgeted content I've seen in a while! Sad to say this feels like a giant waste of time and money.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I also really enjoyed it because there is clearly huge scope for progression of the characters over the course of the two movies and what will hopefully be many more after that.If you need the shot to change every 2 seconds because you have zero attention span then this is not for you but if like a movie which actually has a plot, great characters and imaginative special effects I recommend you watch it!","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

After Army of the Dead and The (probably finished) Justice League, I hoped for a similar epic story. But this felt very rushed. Characters who were interesting and fighting scenes which could have been very memorable, were just not worked through.The cast was very well chosen, even though I missed a bit more alien life. We are introduced into a universe full of it, but all alien characters only played minor unimportant roles.The most interesting character for me was Jimmy the AI robot. But even he had just a little part.This seems like another Justice League situation. Rushed.But this time there is no good reason, but rather the industry simply being what it is. I am sure if it had been up to Snyder, the movie would have taken a few months more to come out, but it would have been the epic Space Opera his fans were hoping for.

And then lower them some more.I had high hopes for this movie given Zack Snyder's track record with action and superhero films but this one is out of his grasp. Just like the Star Wars franchise falls from grace, so does this strange ensemble of scenes that were slapped together to make this a so-called movie. At first glance, the casting is appealing but I'm not sure this movie did anyone any favors (aside from pushing them to get ripped so they at least look good on screen). The story and movie itself lacked depth and was overall just weak. It's almost like they sat in a room and said ""so we've done 50 shades of Star Wars, Divergent, Game of Thrones, The Avengers, but what if we try to combine themes from each series and then pepper in some Fifth Element vibes?!"" Also, the fight sequences were terrible. Don't get me wrong, I know it's all fiction, but the reaction time during fight scenes was so unbelievable and the major fight scenes were all borrowed from other movies.I'm sure there is certain pressure to bring ""the next best thing"" to our screens when it comes to sci-fi/fantasy film and space opera but this ain't it. And it certainly doesn't make me eager to watch part 2. Zack Snyder needs to take a seat, sit back, and chill on this one.Conclusion: go watch Dune. It has substance and depth, superior casting, better acting, and fantastic cinematography.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This isn't a Star Wars knock off anymore than the current below average Star Wars content is a knockoff of history and the stories that came before itCredit that this story line is at least its own story, not a piggy back off anything else.

The character backstory and development was nice to have for once and the directly did a docent job weaving their stories together for the overall story but without giving you every detail of each character, just enough to allow the viewer to understand each's interest being part of the story.The biggest ding is the female lead. Not because a woman is the lead but rather how unbelievable this character is. Hollywood is really doubling down is trying to make everyone believe that an average height women who is 100lbs soaking wet with clothes on can physically dominate and beat down every man twice her size with minimal effort despite the man's training, superior strength and size.But the director couldn't stop there in the name of DEI. You have to have a sob story from every ethnic group character required to qualify this as a ""diverse"" movie to make this ""good guy"" team of misfits unstoppable. This powerfully diverse group of misfits uniting through struggles to be like a sci-fi Avenger team to challenge the all powerful, and purely white skinned, elite ""evil"" autocratic government aimed at stripping all worlds of freedom and resources. The usual annoying and incompetent drone of activists to parallel modern society who just repeat brainless electric without thought.If the female lead was believable in her prowess this movie would be easier to stomach, even with the usual droll social activism forced into the movie.

Every character in the movie, except maybe for the main villain (who was also a stereotype, but less non-sensical and with some unexpected twists), is completely flat and uninteresting. They read their script lines, but I don't understand why, nor do I care. They also seem to have deep revelations or feel deep emotions for no particular reason. I find it hard to comment on the acting, because the background story and lines of each character were both so cliche and non-senscial, that I didn't feel any empathy for any of therm.Another problem is that the plot feels like a train. No matter how a scenes is played out, they continue to the next piece of story, without any logic. A great army and a large ship is suddenly defeated by 20 people. Nobody blinks an eye when those 20 people are going to defend a small village from a war-ship the size of a large city.On a positive note: I found some of the visuals were quite good.

I dont mind the borrowed details in space ships, Buckbeak, worlds, conflicts, rebel etc., but it is important to create a convincing story. A small village in a small planet, how can they convince others to join them? Why should they care?

Jyn Erso...er, I mean Kora (not the Avatar) brings together a band of fighters to start a rebellion (even though there is already a larger, better equipped, and better organized rebellion already started) against the evil Mother World with, I dunno, a series of high Charisma rolls. That's the only way to explain how she is able to convince all these people to come fight for her adopted farming village. It's Star Wars (of course, this was meant to be Zack Snyder's Star Wars entry) meets Seven Samurai.The good: Sofia Boutella (Kora) has decent screen presence. The smoky stand-ins for lightsabers are pretty cool. Charlie Hunnam is engaging as smugger/thief/whatever he's supposed to be Kai. Ed Skrien's Admiral Atticus Noble is effective as a much more brutal and competent version of General Hux.The bad: Kinda everything else. The effects are Star Wars on a Serenity budget but it's too bad they didn't have a Joss Whedon-caliber writer. Most of the characters get only the most basic introductions. Kora's imploring speeches to convince them are short and unconvincing. Everything feels rushed and half-done. And oh my god So. Much. Slow. Motion. I almost gave up during the first fight scene.I really really wanted to like this movie. I really really didn't.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It introduces potentially interesting characters, races, and planets, offering viewers a glimpse of its visual brilliance.However, the movie falls short in terms of storytelling. The characters come across as overly simplistic, primitive, and unengaging. The dialogue lacks depth and sophistication, often feeling overly straightforward. Also, we have seen this plot many, many, many other times. Why on earth would you do this basic plot again in a completely new universe?It is also feels like there were not enough time to show characters or develop them somehow. Mostly you get half minute preview and that's it, no backstory or any depth and they already in the team.I would eagerly anticipate a second installment with a fresh narrative team, as the current movie struggles to engage the audience beyond its captivating visuals. It falls short in delivering a compelling story.The whole premise of this movie is ambitious and certainly have potential, but it is not delivered well.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This was expected on my part, when I heard that they are making a Part 2 right behind it. Honestly, I liked it for the depth it had in building up the characters.The general public, however, doesn't have the patience for movies w/ depth any longer it would seem. These are the same people that have Google & Amazon at their finger tips to give that immediate shot of dopamine that they need so quickly.Personally, I really liked the movie. Was it the greatest movie ever made? No, it wasn't. But that because it's leading to something larger.Synder wasn't going to make the same mistake that the production company/DC comics forced him to make in the DC universe. They forced him to fast track into Justice League. He wanted a 2nd Man of Steel, a stand-alone Aquaman, a stand-alone Batman... all before the Justice League came out. DC had other plans because they were so desperate to keep up with Marvel & they rushed it, it was slammed together too quickly & it failed. Somehow, that was Synders fault.I believe he is trying to do the opposite with Rebel Moon. Depth in characters, build-up, universe building, & it was a good production. I just hope I'm proven right in Part 2 because I do like the idea of the universe he's trying to build.Lastly, I think it might have made a GREAT 10 episode miniseries, instead of 2 movies... But I haven't seen Part 2 yet. So, I'll wait to judge.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Part one of Rebel Moon is presented as an epic piece of science fiction, worthy of a giant awards shelf, but it isn't. It has almost absurd flaws for a million-dollar production and under the names it supports.Starting from the script, there are too many narratives to present characters, situations and events. The most basic and easiest way to tell a story. A shameless shortcut by Snyder and his team of writers. There are conveniences and inconsistencies. And let's address the elephant in the room. There are many similarities with Star Wars. Understanding the story behind the scenes, these similarities could have been reduced, but it was decided to make a cheap copy of the Lucas film intergalactic saga.In terms of editing and photography, there is an excess of slow motion. It's understood that it's part of Snyder's rubric, but it's really an excess of this resource. The lighting is irritating. They shine spotlights in your face all the time. They saturate you with frames full of light sources, some even meaningless.Moving on to the performances... poor, flat, soulless, lacking enthusiasm. None of the actors convince in their roles. I even think that putting Anthony Hopkins' voice behind an android was a mistake, since it's very far from being something that fits together.Now, not everything is terrible. The film is not a disaster as critics want to make it out to be, despite what you have read so far in this review. The action is entertaining, the battles are captivating, the production design is a good element, the visual effects are not like those of Marvel, although they are not like those of The Creator or Dune.I hope that Snyder knows how to fix his shortcomings for the second part to be released this coming year in 2024.PS: We need more blood!!!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

He made really good movies like 300 and Watchmen. But now he has descended to the Uwe Boll level, and even Uwe Boll knows how to put more story and originality in his movies. The fact that this was once a pitch for a Star Wars movie made me curious. The management at Disney was very wise not to give this guy any money, Netflix was less sensible. What a lame movie, without any original idea. Seven Samurai is reduced to an incredible simple story without any tension, the warriors never really hesitate to join the team. Al little chat, a stupid ride on a imitation buckbeat and they join. Normally fine actors are not challenged at any time and act completely without inspiration. The CGI is incredibly ugly and nowhere the movie gets exciting. An idiotically weak and never impressive or scary enemy. This is really sad and should not be compared with masterpieces as Star Wars, Seven Samurai and Dune. If you want to compare it, compare it with Jupiter Ascending and Battlefield Earth, also utter crap. I really don't get how people can like this. This is more content then a real movie.

The rest of the cast are very good and believable in their respective roles with an additional standout performance by Ed Skrein as the main villan of the movie.Unlike a few other movies I have seen that seem to go on forever with needless filler, I would say that Rebel moon would have benefited from a longer run time.

They allow the viewer to escape even for a brief moment from the daily routine . To dream of magical worlds in space where anything you could think of could happen . So my question is what happend ? The people around Zack who saw the movie , advised or helped didn't say anything ? I would have loved to be an advisor on this movie or the last person to see the movie before being released . I would have given an honest opinion !!!I went into this movie without reading reviews or spoilers.There is no cohesion in the plot , the characters are like loose treads on a sweater and the have some really great actors .But you can't even try to connect to them or the story , it's all flat ! My guess is and i don't mean any disrespect to anyone involved , the problem is the script . There is no feeling in it , no humanity , no soul , nothing .I felt more from The Creator , shed a few tears , i felt something and it's not about the robots or A. I. but feels like more thought was put in it and its not the best movie i've seen , far from it . I would give that a 5/10.I also feels rushed , the development of the characters could have been so much better , sometimes less is more but not here !To make a small suggestion look at Dune (2021) , forget about the plot of both movies for a second and look at the development . I could say more , but whats the point ?!!Feels like were just filing a quota of plot points .I'm not gonna watch part 2 if its the same clipboard check-in.I don't leave reviews this is my first , it had so much potential but was lost in translation .

Like most sci-fi it has lots of recognizable influences, many are obvious, and clearly is 'seven samurai in space'. That said, if you want a bit of fun, don't take it too seriously and just enjoy sitting back and watching a film where clearly lots of passion has been put in then look no further.Only a few small things I didn't like, a few scenes longer than they needed to be, and one terrible accent but so be it.I was nearly put off watching it form seeing many terrible reviews and I honestly think some people have just missed the point of entertainment.

The attempt at world building is there, the potential for lore is great.Guns are cool.Weird stuff: there's no blood or gore? Feels like it's really missing that. Especially with any hand to hand stuff?Ol Zack attack with his slow mo. So. Much. Slow mo. Fun drinking game I suppose.I seen an interview with Charlie hunam where he says he wanted to do an accent, so he chose to do this. He decided to do it. He certainly attempts something. He's definitely met someone who briefly lived in Ireland once.Everyone with the exception of 2 characters hair is dumb.Bad stuff: the script is not great.No character interacts outside of their introduction scene it's bizarre. Where a movie like expendables does so much in the plane on the way to the mission bonding it becomes tedious, rebel moon does the reverse. All of these characters are strangers to each other from what we see.I've already seen calls to ""release the snyder cut"" I'd be more forgiving of this if it was the first time. But ALL of Zack attacks movies go this way. Even the beloved Watchmen has a million different cuts. I get there is studio interference and stuff has to be cut out to get run time down and hundreds of other reasons why a film is edited the way it is. THAT BEING SAID this was supposed to be his free reign. Free of constraints, his movie his way.This is the Snyder cut.It didn't go to cinema it went to streaming. The Irishman was a million years long and netflix was fine with that? So not sure what the holy directors cut has to offer and yes I watched the directors cut of BVS and justice league both are still a mess.I'll watch another one for sure, am strapped in and want to see where it goes. It's nice to see a new property that's not connected to the Disney collection.Despite what others may have said it's not unwatchable just turn your brain off, accept the flaws and look at the pretty slow mo and the not lightsaber lightsaber.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That Disney rejected this as a potential Star Wars trilogy shines through as little to no effort has been made to make Rebel Moon feel like it wasn't intended to be part of the Star Wars universe. Furthermore, the plot is pretty much a direct copy of Seven Samurai with elements from the likes of Dune thrown in for good measure.I could forgive this if the film was actually good fun but it isn't. This is just a slow, bloated mess with a terrible script and non-existent character development. The cast do their best to try make their characters seem interesting but they are given so little to work with that it is impossible to elevate them to levels that you would have any interest in what happens to them. Snyder has already leapt to the defence of the film saying that his director cuts are always better but maybe he should take a step back and wonder why directors such as Nolan and Villeneuve can tell far more complex stories in a two and a half hour run time whilst Snyder needs four hours just to tell a slightly above basic story. It's time he realised his talent lies in making basic action films. There's nothing wrong with that.Moments of Snyder's eye for visual flare and exciting action sequences to sneak through but these are lost in what has now become his signature overuse of slow mo. Even the best action sequences will soon have you rolling your eyes as another needless slo-mo shot takes over. And Snyder hasn't just limited slo-mo to the action sequences. Oh no, we're even treated to characters turning their head in slow motion. I'm sure he thinks it looks dramatic. It doesn't.Thanks to the existence of the cinematic travesties that are Sucker Punch and Batman V Superman, Rebel Moon just about manages not to be Snyder's worst film but it isn't far off and should only be watched as an example of how not to make a movie. It really is a turd in slow motion.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

You can notice a certain resemblance to Star Wars because it was originally planned as an installment of the franchise created by George Lucas, but aimed at a more mature audience. Snyder chose to try to create his own story in hopes of starting a new franchise. The film has that visual style that Snyder always uses and an air of an epic story taken from Greek myths. It has good sequences, good special effects and a great soundtrack by Junkie XL. The weak point that this film has is the script due to its questionable writing.The film is only the first part of this story that is currently divided into 2 parts, but Snyder hopes that this will be the beginning of a new franchise with a universe that can be expanded through different means. This being the case, this movie would be only episode 1, but it starts this story in a way that is too slow and unexciting. It has a good story, but the way it is introduced doesn't generate much attraction or excitement. It presents the characters directly, without fully knowing them or knowing what their motivations are, except for a few winks. That makes it difficult to connect with the characters. Kora is the only one who can be known a little in depth because of how they show her past. It is clear that there are more things that needed to be explored or explained that Snyder perhaps decided to reserve for later or were left in the original cut of the film, since the released version is a PG-13 rated cut.Apart from using Star Wars as inspiration, Snyder also decided to base himself on some works by Akira Kurosawa and the one that can be most noticeable in the plot is The Seven Samurai. It is curious that Snyder's narrative level has dropped, because his previous films, from 300 and Watchmen to the extended version of Justice League, had better narrative development. It seems like that started to decline since Army Of The Dead. After having been in charge of the DC Comics universe, Snyder now wants to create his own franchise and hopes to get it with this new proposal.Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child Of Fire has something interesting to tell, but it's too lukewarm a start to this new intergalactic adventure. My final rating for this movie is an 8/10.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Zack Snyder can, and does, make entertaining films, or at least, if the film is too kong and doesn't hold a cohesive story of interest, he gives us entertaining moments, and even things to think upon in character dialogue. Here, it is stated that Snyder borrows a lot from other sources, including other films, but his imagery of the Imperium strong-arming the farmers, and the outfits of the officers, is very reminiscent of Nazi Germany. The world-building is indepth and the execution goes back-and-forth between dramatic intensity to drawn out dialogue. Is it western, space opera, sci-fi, fantasy, etc? No matter, it can work. Where it fails for me, is that all the bad guys, the most vile, the abusive and rapey, are all white men, even a pig-faced perv at a bar. A galaxy far away is so different than Earth that the human tendency to conquer and garner power, assault inferiors, is subject to a demographic. In addition, a woman trained under the Imperium, is able to destroy a whole Imperium military unit of men, though her backstory is that she has no special powers or abilities different from them. This is a common Hollywood trope, for decades, amplified with Disney and Marvel and so forth, to present women as powerhouses, creating a standard of elitism that neither man nor woman can keep up with. This also hurts the main character's personality: she is bitter to be around, depressing, monotone, and a harbinger of justice and revenge that that doesn't age well even after a few hours.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

With that being said, let let me lay this out for you, as unbiased as I can.If you like Snyder's stuff, you're going to like Rebel Moon. The Slow-Mo is about as prevalent as it's ever been in a Snyder flick, there's interesting world design, in the sense that it leaves you wanting to know more about each of the world's the rebels visit, they're all very unique.The fight scenes are visually interesting and you don't have to worry about the shaky jump cuts that plague a lot of action films. The movie itself visually stunning throughout(outside of the CGI in one scene, you'll know the one). The movie looks its best in the first act, Veldt is beautiful and the overall aesthetic of the film might be my favorite of any Snyder movie to date.The cast is great, although the majority of the team doesn't have enough to do (more on that later). Boutella, Hunnam, and Fisher carry the day.If you don't like Snyder, there's not enough here to change your mind, largely for the reasons you'd think.It's definitely a part 1 film that doubles as an ""assemble the team"" film. So don't expect Casablanca in terms of story. Lots of exposition, but again, it's all interesting.Act 2 is definitely rushed, sacrificing getting to know the characters in favor of moving the story along. I imagine this is where the director's cut will come in and fix some of these issues, along with the pacing.All in all, I saw enough that it left me wanting more, which is the most important thing a part 1 movie can do.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Does the writer and director think that no one has ever watch Star Wars E,4?!?!That said, its watchable and there are some good moments and scenes but the plot holes are Star Destroyer sized. I mostly sat there identifying where scenes and shots were lifted from other movies.Production values are terrific and there is an abundance of eye candy of all sorts. It all gets a bit jerky and comes off the rails when you recognize the director is copying from How to Train Your Dragon, mixed with a bit of Game of Thrones.The super human female combatant trope is getting a bit old and Snyder goes for more than one here. Sadly the introduction of the Nemesis character feels awkward and pointless and to put. Hounsou's character in a gladatorial setting for his introduction was a bit too on the nose.But hey, if you like Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey story line, mixed in with The Seven Samurai, a Star Wars origin story and comic book like violence, then sure, go for it. Just remember to turn your brain off as soon as you get past the opening credits.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"5","/10","All in one action packed everything at once that looks like Disney, written for Netflix. Easy to watch, easier to forget","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9532702/?ref_=tt_urv","eonzenox","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur93952640/?ref_=tt_urv","31 December 2023","George Lucas was inspired by his love for old Western and Samurai films and created a fantasy sci fi world that became a timeless galaxy far away called Star Wars. Despite the use of popular cinema tropes, it worked with subtle reinvention of classic genres made into something new with original storytelling and good writing.Zack Snyder is guilty of trying to copy that formula almost as if its part of Star Wars, yet lacking the writing. Making it too boring to surprise, yet safely entertaining enough to watch till the end credits. Willing to please anyone that settles for general relatable content in a movie with a Sci Fi undertone that looks cool as a trailer and would be a modern Snyder directed weekend movie blockbuster for any age to enjoy without feeling offended. Or at least pretend you enjoyed it if you were forced into watching it like me.It is ambitious in a smothering way at times, borrowing from everything one can possibly put into one movie that feels like it came from another movie like a random lapse of cinema Deja Vu. A character from every mainstream time period genre Snyder possibly could put in the future, he made sure they all exist there shamelessly. Mixing and mashing them all together like some diverse space multi cultural Justice League where each unique individual has a heroic origin story, prequel and possible sequel that already feels exhausting to even imagine trying to be that person that actually cares to Google it.It might sound great if it actually made sense to expand a complex universe, but it ends up looking like a typical Mormon farming community being oppressed by WWII Nazi lookalikes, add a robot and some spaceships and give them funny accents and we are in the future telling a tale as old as time. Wow! But wait, its about to get weird with so much more stereotypes to entertain us with...Imagine watching western influenced cowboys and Indians that meets Chinese Dynasty era with Roman Empire Gladiators meets Scandinavian Vikings along with fascist supremacy villains with a dash of Marvel's Wakanda warriors with PG approved GOT violence with a Chronicles of Riddick landscape along with The Matrix steam punk technology mixed with a little Pocahontas in a futuristic Dune mystic fantasy world with slow motion action packed Star Wars signature alien creature world like qualities. Renowned cinematography that typically expands Snyder's 300 classic, but now it's in space on steroids where every character is a possible lead. We just simply don't care to know yet. At least it's what anyone can expect. Super attractive cast that looks amazing when they move so fast in action scenes filmed in slow motion to see how fast they move, but in slow motion...What is it about exactly? Space oppression with a hint of resistance to fight for a better future and justice for all. An old generic heroic tale of bravery just like Star Wars but different types of good guys and bad guys. Totally different its almost original if you take the Zack Snyder fandom very seriously. No desire for average folk wanting to know more at any point unless it becomes a multi billion dollar franchise to exploit and stretch out Marvel style.As fans would fairly demand in a world with so many choices of stories that would never end until its rebooted and retold for the next generation with a modern spin and advanced CGI that makes it never ending yet you can't wait for more sequels, spin offs and prequels with shocking cliffhangers revealing more cliffhangers.Rebel Moon is a possible franchise option in an ocean of competitors identical to using the exact same magic formula and character arcs from every franchise that ever made a profit. Honestly it's a tough competition for any Network to invest in, especially Netflix well known for quantity over quality. Otherwise it's canceled until something better replaced it.Also, It's quite exhausting to watch if you expect something original. Especially if you try to find deeper meanings and focus like there would be a twist any moment that would surprise you and make you jump out of your seat and yell ""Aha, a plot I well thought predicted yet I've been fooled by the ultimate twist of great storytelling!?!"" None of that, sadly. Very predictable.It comes across as multiple ideas for a movie that evolved more as a Snyder directorial concept pitch to Netflix than an actual well written story to be adapted into film. A great idea that looks visually stunning and promising with a well known directorial name behind it, yet begging the viewer not to want more than to capture it at face value. Be happy with anything that anyone might find remotely relatable in a movie at any given time as you watch it. Then it's for you! As long as it makes studio a target with a healthy viewership algorithm for a wide audience with long term seasonal return viewer ratings, then I guess it achieved its ultimate goal.Mediocre and watchable. Relatable yet equally forgettable to think it would need a sequel to make it any longer and more boring... One Rebel Moon is enough to get a basic ""meh"" experience... Everything explained very thoroughly and it feels like the only debate would be if you actually care to find political metaphors into why the farmers be farming, and why the oppressors be demanding a harvest. Total mind blowing opportunity right there... We are all Rebel Moons! A self revelation of our own quest for justice? Meh, not really...Unless you are a obsessive Snyder superfan that has dark thoughts after reading this negative outlook on what is clearly a masterpiece to you. Then I would say just kidding silly. Best movie ever. Nothing like it, please dont hurt me with your super human powers.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is predominantly a swipe of ""Seven Samurai"", by way of ""A Bug's Life"". The Pixar film I just mentioned felt like a winking homage, ""Rebel Moon"" feels a lot more like a copy, a cheap way to introduce Snyder's roster of protagonists. Some could claim other films, like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" used a similar mechanic, but this film feels a lot more blatant with the swipe. Even the original ""Star Wars"" owes it's origins to Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress"", but this just feels heavy-handed. With more movies coming, I can only imagine what movies will be scotch-taped in as the plot.Snyder comes up with some very impressive visuals, but he needs to learn that's not enough. He needs some original writers with original ideas. He needs to stop writing movies, and stick to directing.With ""Rebel Moon"", you will see Snyder use that slo-mo-time effect during fights way too often. That Matrix-era mechanic is getting old. I do want to point out that I have enjoyed some of Mr. Snyder's films- I'm not a ""hater"". I'm just tired of the same-old same-old.I also think better wardrobe would have helped this film- it doesn't seem ""another planet"" enough when the clothing styles are way too close to standard Earth clothes. There are any number of ways to make a wardrobe feel ""different""- none were used here. For pete's sake, Ed Skrein's ""Little Hitler"" has on an Earth shirt and tie! All of the Enemy forces look way too much like Nazis. Star Wars did a better job of making ""Nazi-ish"" uniforms 40+ years ago. I did really like the Anthony Hopkins robot.I really wanted to like this, and I do a little- I always like seeing Djimon Honsou and Sofia Boutella in movies, but at the very least it needed better costume design, and another pass at the script. The storytelling is sloppy, and derivative. It's rumored that this was Snyder's pitch for a Star Wars film, if so I can see why they passed. This movie is an ok time-waster, but not a destination watch.Zack, I'm still rooting for you, but talk to some better writers at least.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This mishmash of much better movies doesn't have an original bone in its body, presenting its well-worn plot in the most plodding way possible and somehow flattening all of its theoretically colourful elements into a single greyscale blob. There's no character to any of it, least of all the actual characters. At times, it's hard to keep track of what's happening and why, as the piece just throws trope after trope at you while hoping its plentiful peppering of sci-fi jargon will cover the stench of familiarity that clings to each and every one of them. Everything vaguely makes sense but most of it just happens in a very transactional, A-to-B kind of way that prevents the overarching plot from feeling cohesive in the slightest. There's no reason to care about anything that happens. Furthermore, the film is straight-up boring even at its most eventful. It's the sort of thing that slips from your mind as soon as it's over; you'll be very thankful of the recap that opens its sequel even if you're watching the two back to back. Zack Snyder is so used to the studio butchering his intended vision that he's decided to do it himself, even after being afforded all the creative freedom he could wish for. It's baffling. I can't imagine anyone clambering for a longer version of this, even if it does fix the blatant butchering of some of the movie's clearly shot-for-R fight scenes. Bleh. I don't know what else to say.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

However, well good intentions cannot bring a film to a status of excellence which could elevate to even a cult level for fans to gush over for years!! And that's why it didn't work. Film making needs to go deep into character substance and a storyline that brings the main character to a heroine with the emotional backing for the fans to delve into whether it's in space or on even on a regular timeliness. Looking good, without depth of the belief of this series storyline. Certainly there are good points, but sigh let one holding a empty popcorn bag with great marketing. And marketing syfy movies into a two partier without a stream of believable story.

DeMille but didn't restore the latter's brain and heart rate, only getting back a shadow of the man. Now place said director in today's competitive movie industry where most variations on the Hero's Journey have been made, and imagine as if all of the reel burned down in a storage room fire and the company had to deliver by splicing together aborted reels from Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and what have you lying around collecting dust behind locked doors in Hollywood. Like someone else here said, this watches like a parody on an attempt at a homage to a... 80's bad fantasy film. Except that there's no way an 80's bad fantasy film could have been that bad. Even the bad ones I occasionally dig up to watch end up being _almost_ worth the 1-2 hours spent watching one.With this movie -- not so much. ""Almost didn't watch it"" would be an understatement, as in fact I turned it off somewhere near the end, cursing under my breathe I let Netflix lure me into giving it a chance. What a waste of acting talent. Yes, I believe no small part of the cast can actually act, but with the 2-dimensional depth-less characters they're given to play, they can't do much as demented re-animated DeMille behind the camera, in Snyder's incarnation, seems to bend the project to their bottom-line. The result is like watching a child's show, except there's no humour and it is far more boring to an adult than most of the children's shows I've looked at.Frankly, I don't know what else to add. The plot is waferthin, and has been rehashed a gazillion of times since invention of movie camera. There's so much tropes badly woven in the movie I am not sure what it wants to be. Even the title is absurd -- I don't know which moon they're referring to.I can't escape think of Star Wars here, what with Rebels etc. I wonder if Disney will want to try send their legal department after the people who so blatantly ""almost"" copied Star Wars here?Regards, a fan of good science fiction. Have I set my sights too high? No, I don't think so, there are many good stories to be told well, I am sure of it. This falls so far off the mark, the stone might as well been thrown _backwards_. Snyder should be allowed to retain directing duty, but his writing seems like scribblings of a pre-school kid asked to write a novel.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Bad writing, lame dialogue, weak story that just borrows everything from other movies and shows, cheesy space-nazi bad guys, mediocre CGI with overuse of color filters and blurry camera effects to try and disguise the mediocre CGI, and boring action sequences that seem to be more slo mo than regular speed. Really so much slo mo in this movie it started to get predictable and irritating maybe halfway through it. The slo mo in the action sequences actually made the main character seem less bad ass despite obviously being used to try and achieve the opposite effect.

I like other movies that Zack Snyder has made so this might deliver. And deliver it did.This wasn't one of those fast sci-fi without a story. This pure joy of build up and execution. They really picked the right actors and writers and the best CGI team.Lately big blockbusters have been released with poor cgi. But this was top notch. And sound. That's just something that can take a movie up one level that nothing else can affect. Sound was really good.All in all this is definitely a movie to watch. And I can't wait for the next part to be released. I really hope this builds to a big sci-fi epos with many movies. I can easily continue watch anything in this universe.As always just like with sound of freedom there is a lobby against movies ok Netflix.

Unfortunately, they spent the budget entirely on visuals (which were beautifully done). This film had the potential to be great but missed the mark by a wide margin when it came to character development, world building, and captivating story telling.The characters were paradigms of a party you might find in a Final Fantasy game, not a bad thing if done correctly. Each of them received a formulaic Ocean's Eleven inspired introduction to showcase their origin story and combat skillsets. Unfortunately I couldn't remember any of their names or cultivate any attachment because they rapid-fire sped through what seemed like a dozen of these. In fact by the time the audience is introduced to all these awe inspiring characters, they manage to spare a few minutes for a final battle.I do wish they spent more than 20 minutes setting the stage for this 'epic', it's as if there was a missing 90 minutes of film that would have tied it together better. Maybe, but maybe not. It is very clear that this film drew HEAVY influence from Warhammer 40k, Star Wars, Warhammer 40000, Dune, WH40K, and a dash of Harry Potter. I get being influenced but...come on now.I sincerely hope they turn this trilogy around (if it survives). The visuals are top notch, it would be cool to see that matched.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Secondly, the storytelling itself lacks excitement, which is surprising considering the extensive effort put into constructing various realms and cultures.Overall, it felt like a subpar amalgamation of numerous sci-fi and ComicBook movies I have watched before. There was a distinct lack of originality, and to top it all off, the film failed to evoke any emotional response. Except for a handful of sequences, the majority of it was unremarkable.On a side note, it's clear now that Mr. Snyder has a penchant for slow-motion sequences.

A lot of those ideas were pretty neat if they were given any kind of pacing. There was so many ideas that the movie just kind of hummed along without really spending any time with any of it. Which kind of sucks because I feel like the only time Zack Snyder makes a good movie is when he's following a graphic novel frame for frame. Which makes sense why those graphic novel movies are the only ones with solid world building and character development.The space farmer/viking aspect of the move: cool idea. The space reich: a little tired, but maybe something there. It's just...man, they tried to recreate one of the most iconic scenes from Inglorious Basterds...but in space at a different pace. It was cringe. What makes inglorious basterds great is the pacing and the dialogue. You watch Tarantino's characters build anticipation with nothing more than dialogue over like 15 minutes. In this film...you have similar wardrobe and set design...but ugh, it is just bad. Don't get me wrong, some of the best work is inspired by others work...but not when you're just copying wardrobe, setting, and 'general vibe'. We want to watch Tarantinos dialogue because it's sets up dire consequences; there's a lot at stake. And he followed through with devastating results. Almost like in Heat (1995), they do a lot of talking, but the payoff is some of the best action sequences of all time.But back to this movie: there's nothing worth listening to because there's nothing at stake. There is nothing that makes me care about any of these random characters or what they had to say, so anything that happened to them became trivial. Any work they put in is towards a goal that I'm pretty disconnected from.Some of the visuals looked pretty cool though. Even though the visual sequences were a little misplaced. Like the dropping of the seeds when the ship arrived. It just seemed like a forced visual to try and heighten importance.Overall would have been cool to see better character/world building at a pace that lets it breathe. It also helps if you make your protagonist likable. Not just hot and stoic. You could even make your antagonist likable. Not a great movie, but cool to have on in the background.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It feels like a poor homage to Star Wars, Matrix, 300, Dune, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings without introducing something new and unique.This doesn't mean that it had to be a bad movie, but the writing is just too bad. Some scenes feel overly lengthy without any contribution to the main plot, while others are rushed and don't give credit to the talented cast. All the right ingredients are there but are poorly mixed.It is similar with the CGI. It is A grade in some scenes and then it looks like an ambitious fan project in the others.The acting is decent given the poor script. I liked especially Ed Skrein as the main villain. Djimon Hounsou and Bae Doona are great as always. Special credit goes to the character of the android Jimmy which is dubbed by Anthony Hopkins. Probably the best of the entire movie. Not much is revealed and still Jimmy seems to have depth which the others lack so much. I am looking forward to more of him in part two. I hope his story will not end up in a cliché as well.The point that bothers me the most and I think makes the movie less believable is the fact that everyone is too good looking. Seriously, stop that. Please hire normal people. It just doesn't help if everyone looks like right out of the gym, oiled up with a fresh hair cut. It might work in stylized movie like 300, but not here. It feels fake. And that's probably a good description of the movie. Fake.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Sure, La Femme Nikita (1990) was fun when it came out. Maybe Atomic Blonde (2017) gets a pass as well (assuming I'm remembering the right film and not confusing it with a similar one -- they all begin to blur together after a point). So, yeah, maybe one tough-girl flick every 25 years is my saturation point for this sub-genre... or maybe consider the laws of physics for minute when choreographing a fight like those films do (then watch more Aikira Kurosawa, Bruce Lee, and Steve McQueen to see what else you did wrong).","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Looks nice but not much behind it and supported by thin pieces of wood. Generally all of the reviews here so far are right. This is a great movie for a bad hangover where you don't have to think, you can doze off, wake up hit a bit and not miss a beat. The only thing that really drove me nuts was Charlie Hunnam. It's very possible I'm too sensitive to these things but his awful accent absolutely ruined every scene he spoke in. Not only is there no need to have a Northern Irish accent for the character, he does a really really bad job. Everything he said sounds the same because he is focused on the accent and not giving his dialogue life. I actually muted him when I could and just read subtitles instead. Watch is you are feeling brain dead and want to see some very nice VFX, otherwise skip it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was just like a cast of emotionless marionettes being pranced through various landscapes where, and this is where it diverges from the source material of Wile E Coyote or Tom & Jerry, none of them actually learn anything throughout their escapades, they are just as vacuous at the end of the tale as they were at the beginning.The actors, like many of the reviewers searching vainly for something to say about the greatness of Zack Snyder, had absolutely nothing to work with although they tried valiantly to justify their time and money. In the end the viewer is left as crestfallen and utterly bereft of hope as the expressions all the actors exhibited at the end, even though the characters they played supposedly won the day and sent the bad guys packing. I seen it, I just didn't feel it.So to wrap up, some questions about the crazy universe in which I was briefly dipped...1. What kind of wonder crop were they growing that apparently takes nine weeks to mature, one moment scattering seeds by hand, the next heaving a scythe about with harvest approaching?2. What was so great about the murdered king, sounds like he was as bad if not worse than the folks who killed him and deserved no pity nor honour?3. Just how many teeth does Atticus really have? He clearly loses at least seven permanent ones in the final fight scene and yet regains them all when his comrades plugs him into a recharge socket? Are they like the Mr. Conehead's teeth comprised of multiple layers, or like a shark, constantly replenishing themselves?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

'Man of Steel' and '300' are some of my favorite films ever. That's why I was so utterly shocked and disappointed when I saw this film. Rebel Moon to me is basically a ripoff adaptation of 'Star Wars'. Think about it, a young farm girl must rebel against the evil tyrant forces that rule the galaxy after threatening to destroy the place she calls home. She then scrapes the galaxy for people who too were chased by this force, ultimately creating a rebellion. And to top it off, fricking plasma swords, or for how most are accustomed to, ""Lightsabers"".The cast itself isn't bad at all. Some terrific actors star in this film. Djimon Hounsou (Titus), Charlie Hunnam (Kai) and Anthony Hopkins (Jimmy) are amongst them. Unfortunately for me, the main protagonist, 'Kora' played by Sofia Boutella, fell short for me and didn't resonate with me at all. A shallow performance in my opinion.The plot is just filled with cliches and doesn't seem to give us anything new or original. No character builds a connection with the audience because no real effort is put to make us care about what's going on, at least that's how I've felt. Plus everything seemed to be predictable.Visually too, I was not expecting much as this was a Netflix production. And unlike most of their series which look fantastic, their films aren't usually impressive to look at. This film was no different.Did not enjoy this view.

It's main problem is poor writing and calling them cardboard characters is actually a compliment to how shallow they really are.Just in the first few minutes you get Warhammer 40K, Starwars and space Nazis. The main bad guy is a comically mustache twirling space nazi who is evil just for kicks. Who has completely incompetent soldiers who are comically evil just because. He asks them to set up a camp and they just decide to start raping random people instead of you know setting up camp. Plot needs to have bit more than that.There are some very cool scenes, but there are also plenty of scenes that leave you scratching your head. Like it sounded cooler in the director's head, but looked awful on film.The good guys pose a lot and look mean, or constipated, not sure which. Luckily all the bad guys just freeze up with them instead of just shooting them. And no that wasn't one of the way to many slomo sequences.Had to watch this in about 4 sittings because my 'well that is dumb' meter filled up too many times.Did I hate it? Not really. Did I enjoy it? Not really. Get a decent writer and editors and this might have been good b grade sci-fi. As is they made knock of light sabers not look cool and really didn't have much of a story despite ripping the plot from at least 7 other shows. Including straight out of Harry Potter.

Right after watching all the spectacles (that yet fails to awe), I immediately thought of the original Star Wars trilogy that were made back in the 70s, compared it and still A New Hope did better even with outdated technology. Great casts but lacks of character. The Snyder shot does appear but still nothing new to that. Thank God that this movie was pitched and never made as a Star Wars movie. Too many unnecessary conversations, slow paced with predictable plot, the action sequence feels like 300 ripoff. Truthfully I know Zack tried to did his best in this movie and being original as Zack does Zack, but look at Nolan; he did what he did best but with a twist and fresh and experimental and new. It hurts me as a fan, and disappointed much as I have high expectations that Rebel Moon could be better than Star Wars but unfortunately no.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The special effects are simply astounding, standing out for their quality and ability to transport the viewer into a completely new and astonishing universe.What really sets this movie apart are its original characters. Each one brings a freshness and depth that has been missing in recent productions. There's a palpable sense of authenticity and grittiness in their portrayal, reminiscent of the iconic movie ""300"", and sharply contrasting with the more sugared and less impactful version of recent Star Wars films.The story itself is intriguing and beautifully narrated. It introduces us to a fascinating world that leaves the viewer longing for more, eager to explore every corner of this newly discovered universe. The plot hooks you from the start and maintains a pace that skillfully balances action and character development.It's surprising to find negative reviews of this work, as personally, I think the movie marks a before and after in the space sci-fi genre. It had been a long time since I saw a movie of this type that captivated me so much, both for its visual quality and its solid storyline.In conclusion, this movie is an absolute recommendation for those looking for a cinematic experience that combines top-notch special effects with a deep and immersive narrative. Without a doubt, it's a film that not only entertains but also invites reflection and wonder.-","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

Man of Steel was his magnum Opus, although Slither still is my personal favorite. But this... this reads as 'Well if Disney won't let me make a Star Wars Seven Samurai movie, I'll just do my own thing!' and then he breaks out the crayons and cries himself into a storyboard for a movie, supposedly a dream of his from the late 90's to make, which doesn't reflect the perspective time is supposed to grant. I had such high hopes for this movie. I am a rather big Akira Kurasawa fan, and I love Seven Samurai and Yojimbo, as well as all the various movies and series spawned from those two movies. This was just painful to watch for me. You feel the star wars vibe in all the blaster fire moments, and yet there is an over-arching 'dune' feeling to a greater huge power at work, which is not at all what seven samurai was about. There wasn't a nation, or huge organization targeting the village in seven samurai, or in magnificent seven, or the planet Akier in Battle Beyond the Stars, but a group of insurgents, bandits... one might even call them rebels without a cause. That is why the title of this is so very off putting... Zach Snyder is making his own Star Wars parody of Rebels vs the 'Evil Empire', just for the sake of doing it. It is not at all in theme with the original premise of Seven Samurai. I wanted so much more out of this, and Zach did not deliver. I think the current IMDB score of 5.6 at the time of my writing this is very, 'VERY' generous.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Someone complained about the 90 lb waif look and I'm so confused by that because she's lean but visibly very strong. A very convincing bad ass.The visuals are incredible.On to everything else:This is the most painfully sucked up I've seen this many men in a long time... at least for the sake of these actors kidneys can we cut out the need for hyper chiseled characters?! It's such a ridiculously unsustainable look. Skrein and Nair are clearly committed, both had me VERY concerned for their health😖Why did Hunnam need to do an Irish accent? In space?! And why was it so bad?! I can't stress this enough (and it goes for all sci-fi movies) they're in freaking space, I know we're prolific but FFS. Having him do an almost insulting Irish accent was highlighted by Fee's real Irish accent 🤦totally ridiculous and unnecessary.Huisman is an excellent actor, but his performance here was like he was reacting to blank screens... scenes of horror barely illicited a response from him but I'm not explicitly blaming him, this might be a director thing.Lots of other really great actors, wish I could have seen more of their character development but that would have made it feel like suicide squad, it was already pretty forced.Snyder has a habit of rushing through story to focus on visuals and it all just feels underexplored, slap-dashy (like Justice League).This sci-fi story is really captivating but characters were dumped on us then snatched away or just not explored enough.Exposition is dropped way too often but how else can they tell an untold story when there's no book to fill in the blanks? This movie feels like it should have been a book, maybe even a series but a movie (even 2) feels like it's been robbed.Cinema Sins is probably going to rip this movie apart, for sure🤷Side note: Can we get more of Ray Fisher saying stuff? Like in movies, commercials, whatever because that voice! He said the word, ""revolution"" and I died😅","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

How and why studios keep backing him is a mystery to me.One of the problems of the movie is the plot. It is just boring and unoriginal. And it's not just the main storyline which makes little sense, the villains are comedic and not interesting, a mix of Nazis, star wars villains and just like stormtroopers seem incapable of hitting any of our heroes.The assembly of heroes which is the main point of this part 1 is what the movie is about, is also rushed and the motivation of the people to join is straight-up nonexistent in most of the cases and is simply skipped entirely. Think a poor imitation of Magnificent Seven/Seven samurai and you kinda get the idea.As for the villain who comes to find mysterious troubling rebels, apparently every single person knows who are the rebels and how to find them and shares that information to the first stranger they meet. It's not like they are even hiding.Next, combat and action scenes. Blasters that penetrate people in armor through, but can't penetrate a thin piece of wood. Remember when in the new Star Wars trilogy a red guard could strike Ray but was just making dumb random moves to simulate action? Well, it's absolutely the same here. Maximum drama, lots of slow motion, frequent switch of the scenes every few seconds and very little sense.The acting is ok, but it's difficult to judge the actors due to the poor script tells. Kora is just a poor character who feels out of place and a character who I just didn't feel any connection to.It's not all bad. The visuals are good but like most Snyder films I felt it was a 2 hours and 15 mins long that could quite easily have been done in 30 to 40 mins.I'd say it's the most disappointing Snyder's movie so far and that's saying something given Sucker Punch, Batman v Superman etc.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Obviously some writers still tried and probably died (at least inside) in the process, so the rest was seemingly left to be written by a school kid or two. The only twists can be seen from a mile away.I felt like half of this film was character introductions, and they even did it twice for most of them. Admittedly I lost interest in the characters somewhere along the way, so they probably had to. If they're trying to sell action figures, this might be a sensible approach, but at the same time there's a lot of violence and stuff like implications of interspecies sex, so am I supposed to buy that tentacle thing for my kid or what? I'm confused.Certain visuals are nice, but that's about it. I thought slow-mo combat scenes died somewhere in the 90s, as nowadays there are more sophisticated ways of emphasizing action, but perhaps Snyder didn't get the memo.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Most of the movie's three hours were spent in slo-mo. Not the brightest move there. Unnecessary and disconnected scenes that betray a director and editor who didn't talk to each other. Just signs of a non existent team effort behind the scenes and Zack too impressed by his fancy lenses that he'd got specially crafted for this movie. If he'd only seen deeper into his Japanese inspirations then he'd realise that lenses are the weakest link in a film at the end.

I saw one comment about how a skinny girl can't beat up men - nonsense. Those comments probably come from fat armed men who don't work out like she does - she clearly got good muscle definition and you don't need to be big armed to have speed, technique and urrrm, shoot a gun?As I've been hyped for a Star Wars inspired movie, I saw the critics reviews - do not listen to what those miserable people have to say. I expect they need happy fun movies because their lives lack it. I enjoy a more serious gritty movie as much as I enjoy a humorous happy go lucky adventure.My only criticism, and by no means a deal breaker, was 2 things.1. Slow motion action used a tad too much. Don't get me wrong, I can't argue too much with it, as you see such beauty with slow motion you wouldn't see in real time. But some of the action may have been appreciated how quickly the protagonist dispatches of her enemies to show her form.2. Pacing. I believe there is rumour of an extended version - and I think this will do the movie great justice. Because this movie is quite ambitious in what it tries to lay down, and because of all the characters it introduces, it is not enough time to flesh out who these characters are.In summary, a fantastic spectacle which leaves you ready and wanting for part 2.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Those who rate it low are too busy comparing it to other films (one saga in particular) to appreciate this masterpiece as it's own work of art. If this movie had come out at a different time, or that other series did not exist, it would be the biggest movie in history bar none!From writing to cinematography to FX this movie leaves nothing to be desired.The story is rich, yes it has similarities to other stories before it, but what movie doesn't? Zack manages to build a storyline for a ragtag team without wasting precious run time but while still giving the audience enough to understand each character's unique motivations.The cinematography is the amazing enthralling beauty that Zack Snyder has become known for, and is made even greater by the absolutely stunning VFX work.I almost always leave a movie with some 2-3 points that I wish they had done better, and I'm very critical of everything (much to the annoyance of those accompanying me) but this...this was one I walked away from with full satisfaction and anticipation of the next part.I eagerly await part 2.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Is it cheesy at times? Without a doubt. Does it keep you on the edge of your seat though? AbsolutelyMy favorite thing to do is to look at all of the 1/10 reviewers' past reviews. If they like bland indie movies and hate unanimously loved/good movies, then I will give their negatively ranked movie a go. This was one of those movies, and the formula worked.The acting is solid and the vision is new. Game of Thrones fans will get a kick out of Dario Naharas vs Dario Naharas with a sprinkle of a Dothraki soldier.Critics also hate the amount of slow motion used, but if slow motion is used in some indie anime movie they call that acceptable.It's by no means a top 10 movie of 2023 but the review bombs by all of these losers are people that hate good ole fashioned fun. It is ambitious and tries to combine Star Wars with 300, Vikings and the magnificent 7, and somewhere in between you appreciate the movie unless you go into it wanting to hate it like most critics do.If you like fun, watch rebel moon.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

So I tried my best to lower my expectations before watching this movie. I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. They basically took the storyline of ""Seven Samurai"" and the hero gathering like ""Mass Effect 2"" to really try and flesh out the characters that are being recruited. I thought some of the standout heroes were Kora, Nemesis, Jimmy, and Tarak who had a bit more complicated characteristics, but they didn't develop Aris, Bloodaxe, and Titus enough - although Bloodaxe does have an amazing standout action scene towards the end of the movie. I also thought it was pretty cool of Snyder to bring Michiel Huisman/ Ed Skrein (the infamous recasting of Daario Naharis from ""Game of Thrones"") being in the same movies as opponents. Skrein definitely tries his best to bring out his inner Col. Hans Lands from ""Inglorious Bast*****,"" and although he is no Christoph Waltz he does a good enough job to make him a hateful villain. Also, I like how the movie throws you a curveball and it seems like the movie will end with a fight like it's Seven Samurai, but the ending in this movie gives this movie its own uniqueness and even some shock factor. I liked this movie so much I am watching it again this morning!","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Instead of establishing and repeating the same flavor, we are presented with a sci-fi-tasting menu of increasing complexity. The first film acted as a setup for what's to come, with Kora gathering a variety of intergalactic warriors to help defend the moon of Veldt. Its follow-up promises a larger focus on action, something that might help make the second movie more exciting than the first. However, while Rebel Moon - Part One's ending sets up a memorable battle, the lack of story and character development in the film may cause Part Two to be less emotionally resonant than it could be. However, it's still possible the movie's director's cuts will end up getting more positive reviews, since they'll be more complete films aligned with Snyder's vision. However, Rebel Moon's reliance on sci-fi tropes seen time and time again appears to be a fundamental issue with the movie as a whole. This means it will still feel generic even if its story and characters become more well-developed. It remains to be seen just how different the R-rated versions of the movies will be, and if they can bolster critical reception.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The film's measured pacing in its opening sequences serves as a deliberate narrative choice, gradually laying the groundwork for the unfolding drama. However, the narrative dynamics undergo a significant transformation with the introduction of compelling and nuanced antagonists, injecting a palpable energy that propels the storyline forward.In juxtaposition to the widely criticized trajectory of Disney's Star Wars, Rebel Moon emerges as a refreshing departure, rectifying perceived deficiencies and providing a cinematic experience more aligned with audience expectations. The film effectively sidesteps the pitfalls of its cinematic predecessor, crafting a narrative that resonates with authenticity and resonant storytelling.While some discerning viewers might identify moments of contrivance in the choreography of fight sequences, wherein each character's strengths are seemingly spotlighted, these instances, upon closer examination, contribute to the film's overall strategic narrative. Rather than mere gratuitous displays, these moments serve as deliberate choices by the director, enhancing the depth of character exploration and ultimately enriching the viewer's connection with the protagonists.

The fact is that is well choreographed, well acted, well executed, and edited with popcorn blockbuster flair. It's not the best sci-fi epic of all time, but it's certainly worth multiple watches and I think it warrants further diving into the universe that it's created.","6 out of 22 found this helpful.

The story arc and characters began to roll out nicely; with every reason to believe they will further flesh out in Part 2.Having said that it was a nicely complete story in and of itself. Characters you embraced as ones you cared about...or ones you despised; a Star Wars quality robot and a great fantastic flying creature that both bring engaging emotions, a similar emotional connection to the resistance backstory through individual histories of horror; very nicely composed and timed music to heighten each scene. I thought the story flowed well; rose to an excellent ending, and lent itself to a great part one ending... promising more in part 2.Have I seen something like this before?? Sure, but come on... writers and directors have thrived revisiting David and Goliath; revenge and self sacrifice, wonderful support characters as far back as stories have been written.I think Snyder has come up with a wonderful retelling, with a very good characters and an equally good cast, excellent production, costume design, music scoring and editing.Top notch entertainment!","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

So, this film, I watched with my wife who is a bit super heroed out like most of us but I explained that Zak Snyder had written a trilogy as a Star Wars story then adapted it to his own stand alone universe story, nothing wrong with avoiding the Disney effect I think. That said, he wouldn't have the same budget or resources and this is what some negative reviews unfairly pick up on.The story is somewhat predictable in areas from a possible Star Wars story but it is very enjoyable, a decent intro into their backgrounds and enough information given about the story ark.But, I wanted to know more about the over thrown royal family, and, who may become a character, the kings daughter if she survived.Yes, not the most refined that it could have been when you compare to the justice league but decent enough to want more, understanding enough to know there has to be a beginning
So less hate, enjoy it as a film, a piece of art and expressions of a story
Enjoy.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

The way he has started to create this universe is breathtaking. The story unfolds at a great pace and the fact its done in two parts means it does not have to rush. We all know this is what he wanted to bring to the Star Wars universe but its so much more then that, I found myself bing realy pulled in to the story and some of the action scenes as brillianty done. For me Zack Snyder is one of the best at telling these kind of storys. The cast was a great mix and everyone of them brings something to the story you dont feel like they are just there to make up the numbers.

If we pause a second and think objectively, this first movie started something with a huge potential to set up a new universe like star wars or something different.Actor and actress were perfect fit for the roles ans expecting a lot more from these characters in the next upcoming movies.I was worried with initial reviews and actually rarely write a review but it seemed like an ""organized campaign"" against this movie or against Zack. The movie is great. It is not complete since it is the stepping stone and intro to Zack's vision.I bet second one will go deeper in characters with great action to set up a 3rd deeper movie.It is Zack's style and storytelling to do in stages. And this may be different to many audiences' expectationGreat movie

I think there's a group who just review bomb any Zach Snyder movie.Is it the greatest sci-fi movie ever made? No.Is it a good movie with a large budget, good cast and solid effects? Yes.I watched this movie with my 12 year old son on Boxing day after deciding to ignore the reviews and watch it anyway, and I'm glad I did. I enjoyed it, he enjoyed it, and I'll watch the 2nd one when it comes out in the next few months as well.The movie has a solid cast and the scenery is well done. The only legitimate complaints any one could have is that the film doesn't go into full detail on the main characters past, but this is obviously because it's to be expanded upon in the later additions to the series.The other complaint anyone might have is the slow-mo fight scenes are, well, pretty much every fight scene, but this is Zach Snyder's style and you either enjoy it or you don't, but it doesn't take away from the overall movie.In short, the movie is very enjoyable, and the lore it hints at or delves into is very interesting, and I think the reviews are being unfairly critical of what is a decent part one of a series.","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

It is a movie to watch for the first time, with no distractions, especially if you're going to do a review on it.But it never slowed or got boring, something was always moving forward.The special effects were seamless and the world itself was beautiful. And the imagery... I must have commented out loud about it no less than 5xs.It was refreshing to see something come out of Hollywood that wasn't the same old characters or a remake or sequel. And yet it had a familiarity from some of it's inspiration sources that was comforting.My only critique was too much slow motion.

I read some reviews about a bad or unsatisfying cliffhanger ending. I don't know what these people are talking about. It feels like a standalone movie. I feel satisfied but I also like the Part 2 trailer made me want to see the second movie. I'm just glad I don't have to wait one year for it. Also, the twist was unexpected.

Ignore if you have opinions on Zack Snyder.Just press play and enjoy the movie without bias.Even ignore that this is a part one of two - this part is very watchable on its own - and of to a great start building - if not characters - then team and skillset for part two.The story itself is very tight and easy to understand - and pleasently without tons of lore and backstory.So - if you are not an elitist, but just want to be entertained - without the could've, should've and would've.Sit back - press play - and be enjoy.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I was worried with it being a Netflix film but after watching it, I can't wait for the second one. If you're a person that doesn't enjoy slow paced movies, this one may not be for you. Although, the actions scene, the plot, the cinematic shots, and so much more will make up for the slower pace. One of the most interesting parts was the slow motion scenes and how clear everything was, it felt like I was there. The music choices are perfect and I've never heard the style before. One thing that could've been done better would be the way people die because almost every time, whatever they were killed by will not leave a mark on the. Like a gun annd an mnife shoule leave obvious cuts annd whatever else, but the fist to fist combat was perfect. Overall, a solid 9/10.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

A mid 7 at the absolute lowest. How often do we get a sci fi movie that's well made with an allstar cast with what looks to be a solid budget.

Had low expectations. Loved the characters and the scenes. Many whiney types seem to pick apart everything. It WORKS. Just enjoy it. Highly recommended.This movie gets one thing right- a strong villian character who you can really relish giving some justice to. Ed Skrein is wonderful as the imperial villian who is almost likable in his joyous evil! This is a space OPERA and ""big"" charactere are a must. His evil stick is a fierce and personal weapon.Sophia Boutella as Kora is my favorite character, the hero, and central to the plot. A former Imperial who was taken as a child and trained in combat. She is beautiful and has a noble dignity. She knows the peaceful farming community she inhabits will not survive it's encounter w the Empire. So she hastily heads off to find alliesA great aspect of Rebel Moon is the different worlds and characterd Kora finds. Every ally she finds I loved! Great characters all. Even the tricky rogue.So, to summarize-see this film. Don't nitpick every detail. Remember, it's a space fantasy. In terms of freshness and good acting it's at least in the ballpark of the first Star Wars. Although, it's a bit more intense and combat driven. This is part one. I look forward to part two, in April 2024.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Stylistic it was well edited and payed good attention to detail and comedic effects.

I loved man of steel and that was it. But I was really looking forward to seeing this. And I have to say it didn't disappoint. I was completely invested from the start, a brilliant cast, amazing story, the slow motion scenes were a little annoying at times but that's it. If you read this review I hope you decide to give the film a go. Some people just like to complain and moan about anything, if you don't like something don't watch it. Don't moan and complain because you have nothing else to do. Should Zach Snyder see this. Thank you for this incredible story and film. I genuinely cannot wait for part two! And I really really hope this gets a blu ray release because it 100% deserves one. A 1000 times better than anything we have had from Disney Star Wars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","6 out of 25 found this helpful.

I'd totally watch it again. Several star actors in the cast made it even better. Every sci-fi has some common elements and though some reviewers counted that as a defect, I don't feel that's true at all. One of the elements that draws in the viewer is the backstory of the main character Kora, who is an amazing combination of farmer rebel, and female warrior.

I knew I will not be disappointed, because of Snyder's name.There's so much more to movie making than meets the eye. It takes a lot more than just high-budget visual effects to create a masterpiece. The acting, script, plot, direction, cinematography, all work in cohesion. But the most important thing is the art of blending all these elements together in such a way that the viewer gets absolutely immersed in the experience - enjoying every minute of it. I believe very few movie makers have mastered this art - and Zack Snyder is undoubtedly one of them.Kora (Sofia Boutella), a former warrior, wary of violence, had decided to call it quits and live a peaceful life in a small village on a moon of a distant planet. But then, something happens, and she is compelled to fight again - you know - 'don't mess with me - you don't know who I am' kind of thing. We have seen these characters before, but we never get tired of seeing them again - provided all the essential elements of movie making are handled properly, which, in this movie, have been combined exceptionally well - leaving no dull moments at all.I really feel Rebel Moon should have been released in theaters, before becoming available for streaming on Netflix. The reason is that movies like Rebel Moon have lots of cinematic elements - which means that they can be best enjoyed on a big screen with an immersive sound system. Most people watch Netflix on their home TVs, tablets and even smartphones which essentially strips away those theatrical components that make the movie a truly unforgettable visual experience. I am seeing several negative comments and reviews and I feel this might be the main reason.As a Netflix subscriber, I'm so delighted that the streaming service is coming up with such cinematic marvels which are a treat to watch on your home cinema. Can't wait for part 2 in April 2024.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Saw this movie Rebel Moon was #1 on Netflix and so I wanted to give it a try. I LOVED IT, and cannot wait for Part II! Storyline and plot is incredibly simple, which always makes for the best epic movies. Characters were deep and intriguing. Action sequences were unbelievable and entertaining. Special effects and CGI was off the charts, same as Dune. It is SOOOOO NICE to have AWESOME top tier movie franchises like these two, Dune and Rebel Moon, offering an alternative to the lame and boring Star Wars franchise, which only eve offers us more of the EXACT SAME THING, wrapped up in different packaging... Let me guess, the next Star Wars trilogy is gonna have the 3rd Death Star, and then the 4th Death Star, and then the 5th Death Star??? LoLoLoL. You have NEVER seen anything like Rebel Moon! Dune was amazing as well. I literally cannot wait for the second version of both these movies. I am SHOCKED that Rebel Moon didn't make it into the theaters!?!?!?!

It wouldn't surprise me if the house of mouse hasn't propagated all the negative response to this film in an attempt to cover up such a monumental blunder. Had they seen it through you would no doubt be reading nothing but positive reviews about how this is the star wars film the fans have been waiting for since the empire strikes back. The only disappointing part of the film is that it had to end but luckily there's a second part on its way. I'm excited for the future of this new franchise and hope to see much more of it in the future beyond rebel moon part 2.","5 out of 22 found this helpful.

Its part one, so you are getting some background story and character introductions, as well as some worldbuilding.Sofia boutella is amazing as always and the other characters are also well cast and played, nothing to complain here.I very much enjoy this new dark scifi world that seems like a mix of starwars and warhammer, but is not burdened by the horrible old scifi design where everything looks like a kids-toy.I dont think its a perfect movie, there where little things here and there, but all in all its a recommendation from me and ill be back for part 2 for sure.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

The science fiction universe created is also very good and holds up very well. So I consider this film quite underrated only because it is not supported by a great science fiction franchise like Star Wars and therefore mistreated by everyone, yes it is true there are many similarities between this universe and that of Lucas but because that imagery has now monopolized science fiction and it is difficult to create something completely new.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

WarCraft, Skyrim, LOTR,and others, except there's no dark lord as yet revealed as its mythology is more contextual with Japanese cultural film history, e.g. Kurosama's seven samurai original classic.Which didn't inspire SWars, instead the Magnificent Seven western as I recall.I expected it to be dark with Snyder's flair for the gritty,cruel and unusual
Great cinematic scenes in space and land with unusual aliens without the plasticky face masks A la Lucas...and a lot more critters in this movie with asian lore influences...Wasn't disappointed, hope there's going to be a longer cut, or more content and depth in future parts to be developed, a saga in the making.The usual suspects.. great character actors are present, gleaned
from other movies that did well, and as they are introduced, you then know what to expect.Later on midway what grated a bit was Ed Skrien, the main villain in a London style 80's shirt collar and tie, have a word with the wardrobe dept, and keep it sci-fi,

It has some Ster Wars elements, yes...but that is not a problem. Problem is that it has a old story (it is 7 samurai, maginificent 7, Battle beyond athe Stars remeke more then Star wars). It easy can be a Star Wars movie, but for adults, it is to violent...and it is not. So, movie is worth of waching, solid fun (after all it is only sf action flick, has no pretend to be artistic masterpiece), so relax and wach it. 2 plus hours of fun for me.

Notwithstanding these narrative shortcomings, the movie excels in its action sequences. The fight scenes are exceptionally choreographed and executed, offering a blend of excitement and engagement that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.

Come on.It's true - Rebel Moon clearly pulls strong influence from Magnificent Seven/Seven Samurai. Who cares? It's clearly self-aware in that regard, while still introducing some story twists and political backdrop of its own.The world is something of a space-western/samurai movie, but interestingly pulls some cultural and architectural references from Nordic fare as well (long houses, village elders with braided beards drinking ale, etc.). The action is cool and character driven, ranging from people meant to be reminiscent of cowboys and native Americans to those more of the mythical samurai persuasion.The cinematography and lighting are appealing and intentionally stylized, the character design is interesting, and while the writing isn't Aaron Sorkin, it leans into its fantasy sci-fi world without being campy. A few scenes suffer from looking a little green-screened, but that's quickly forgiven as you're too busy looking at the interesting gritty costumes or wondering what fun new creature will show up next. Plus the action direction keeps things kinetic, physical, and story-driven as opposed to just a bunch of shots of people pointing guns at each other.Some say ""the plot doesn't go anywhere"". I disagree, but even at that, it doesn't hide that it's a ""part one"". This film is about introducing you to its interesting universe while giving each of the characters in the ensemble their ""moment"" to set up what comes next. Relax and enjoy that about it.Don't believe the bad reviews. Rebel Moon is a well crafted adventure set in an interesting world with stunning visuals. It's a new IP that knows its roots and sets up what comes next. Have fun with it.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

I don't see any parallels to Star Wars (Who is Luke, Lea and Han and where is Darth Vadar?). A thousend year kingdom is not the 20 year empire of Palpatine. Netherless after that hours the film is the SiFi version of the 7 Samurai, which is not bad but a little bit implausible. You can't feel the motivation of the fighters to follow Kora.

People going into it expecting something else and then getting upset about it make no sense. Whereas, The Batman should've been something new and fresh, yet we got the most simple and safest take on the character, didn't take a single risk, and literally just ripped off some other movies and used the name batman, but everyone loved and praised that. I really don't understand this unnatural amount of hate for Snyder and his movies. At least Snyder adds his own style to the films he makes, which is more than can be said about other directors that get praised for copying other movies. Lets not forget that Rebel Moon is a netflix release, with a more definitive directors cut still to be released, and people are acting like this is the finalized version. Did people not learn from BvS and Justice League? Or are people just looking to hate for the fun of it? Because i can say for sure that i don't go out of my way to watch movies made by directors that i don't like the style of, and don't understand why anyone would, unless its just to hate.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Looking forward to the second installment.This easily challenges Star wars franchise and is on par and definitely fresher with endless possibilities if Netflix carries on investing in the franchise.Critics that rated low clearly have no understanding of what the audience wants and enjoy, these critics are negative people with no appreciation of a quality movie.","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire is an awesome sci fi movie with great action and great slow motion scenes. I recently watched both films and i thought they were cool. It definitely doesn't compare to something like Star Wars or Dune, but it is a great film. I don't understand all the hate. This film isn't supposed to ""change the film industry"" like people think every movie should. At the least this movie should have a 7.0 or maybe 6.7, but 5.6? Really? At this point people are just hating on Zack Synder which makes zero sense. If you love movies like 300, Watchman, or the 4 hour cut of the Justice League, you will enjoy this film.In conclusion, don't expect every film to be The Dark Knight or The Godfather because there not gonna be that level. Just have fun with movies. If the movie is good or bad it still won't change the way your life is.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Even though I agree with many of the criticisms.... It's derivative, the initial aggression against the first village required much more cost and effort than would be retuned in resources, it steals heavily from Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, the Seven Samurai and all of its remakes... BUT it looks good. This more closely resembles pulp inspired space opera than most recent sci-fi movies. The action set pieces are well choreographed and the colour palette is attractive and resembles high end graphic novels. There are MANY good films that are derivatives or remakes. Yes, there are some lazy narrative choices but all in all I really enjoyed this and while I respect others may disagree with me, I think many of the critics who have cranked up the bile and the negative superlatives are just examples of the polarisation of discourse where some people think they have to mark to extremes to make a point.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Although there are quite some cliches going on, I believe it doesn't deserve the current low rating of 5.2 / 10.Admittedly, not too much happened in this movie, but I still gave it a 7.5, which rounds up to 8 due to the benefit of the doubt the following parts will live up to all the seeds that have been planted. This first part touches a lot of lore but doesn't go into much detail, so I hope this will be addressed in following parts. I look at this first part more like an introduction to the characters and the story. Thus far, I wouldn't call it original, but it does succeed in bringing entertainment.Some turns of events are quite unrealistic, if you can't stand that, better not watch ;) overall, i can recommend though.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This, accompanied by an epic OST.What to expect from the film? Well, if you are expecting your typical Star Wars or your average action film, you will be disappointed. What you must expect is a Zack Snyder film. Period. Boring? Not for me. Was Dune boring? Some say yes, some say no. But the film became a classic of Sci-Fi. Is Sandman boring? People enjoyed it despite the lack of action, so it all depends.I watched Rebel Moon twice, the first time I really liked it (especially the second half of it), and the second time I loved it.The characters are great, especially the main protagonists and the antagonist. Some, like Nemesis or the robot, look epic but lack a proper development. However, as this is only part 1, their presence builds hype for part 2.I get that Snyder films are not for everybody, but I think this is one of his best, and one of the best contents on Netflix right now.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

I hope the next saga is a little bit soul grabbing. The positives I like are obviously the storyline, the worlds and the off world species.

Atrocities committed by fascists propagated by capitalism is not subtle at all. It's right in our faces, we see now those fighting back, Rebels who have a call to courage and are not afraid to die for their land. Something so beautiful that evil can't stand and must monopolise for their own gain. ""Vote Blue"" isn't a solution but a disguise of evil to commit their atrocities. We need for films like this to tell the world how it really is.Zack Snyder uses the optics of the brand new RED V-RAPTOR to take us into a heavy metal world, with VFX inspired choices akin to the likes of George Lucas with the prequels. Sublime photography I can't wait to capture all my favourite shots into a hard drive.Rebel Moon isn't afraid to go slow-mo and uses it even more to make nerds who hate it cry and moan online. Every time it kicked in it sort of made me the viewer feel like a benevolent force observing closely at these courageous actions.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

Even though the story had potential, some dialogues and small scenes kinda messed it up. And honestly, some of the characters, like the farmer guy, just didn't pack a punch. It's a bit of a letdown when a movie that could've been great falls short, especially when you're measuring it against the big names in the genre.Still, I'm hoping for better things in the second part.

People are so burnt out and cynical that they only see negatives. It's a shame. I feel this movie would have benefited from a longer runtime, more specifically a tv show or or video game or anime (lol). Alas, Netflix is known for destroying good things, specifically tv shows.

The script/pace is not perfect (at least to begin with). And yes, some of the characters are 'over the top' and archetypal - but isn't that what stories about heroes and action are meant to be?Just because it reminds somebody of something that may have come before, does not mean it loses any merit. And that's because when you look at storytelling, performance or art, everything can be broken down as being a copy of a copy of a copy if you are inclined to take a negative view. The question should be - is it well done and entertaining? And the answer is YES!If you are unfortunate enough to be handicapped by your own prefrontal cortex and implicit bias, then you are probably the type of person who says 'I want high budget, lot's of action sci-fi franchises'.

Not sure why the hate or dislike for this movie by many. From the moment I saw the trailer, the first thing I said ""this looks like a Star Wars based movie"", and sure enough, I find out that Zack Snyder did write this movie originally as a Star Wars Story, however it was not used, so then he took it back and re-created his own thing. Well what you get is this great feel like your watching a sort of distance story to Star Wars similar universe, and it hits it out of the park! Since Disney took over the Star Wars franchise, they started great with Rogue One & Force Awakens, however after that in my opinion this movie Rebel Moon is better then all the other actual Star Wars based movies and TV shows that have been released. That being said, don't think this is just some knock off to trying to be Star Wars, it is very different and original story, the similarities fall more in visuals like creatures, many alien races, androids or some terms used, many paying homage to the classic, however maintaining it's own path. Can't wait for Part 2 to be released in April 2024.","4 out of 21 found this helpful.

Not unlike Snyder's other films his visual flair is a complement to the set design creating a slick and stylistic look.The film's screenplay, co-written by Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, is well-crafted and keeps the pacing tight. The dialogue is sharp and impactful, adding depth to the characters and driving the story forward.

This movie is 100% enjoyable and when you compare to all the other garbage sci-fi plot lines this one stands out.I personally think Zack Snyder knocked this way out the ball park for creating something fresh and completely new.Now could they have made the script better and added context in scenes? Yes.Should it have been less predictable? Yes
Should they have build the characters stories more? YesI do agree it did feel rushed and not as much effort in the script than it should have. So is this a perfect movie absolutely not. But this is as close as you can get to something besides star wars. Synder is trying to start something that can be big. I just hope he continues to add more depth context and develop characters more so us as the audience can connect more.7.5/10 for me. The movie Dune doesn't come close to this, I was so bored in Dune but this had my attention all the way through. It has its downfalls but like I said compare this to so many other movies of 2023 and this stands out like a diamond in the rough!Watch it with an open mind and decide for yourself. Def. DO NOT compare this at all to Star wars bc it's not and obviously nothing can touch star wars.","3 out of 14 found this helpful.

However the production quality of Rebel Moon is just a step or two down from a Marvel feature so way higher than any TV film! I would keep in mind that this is a Netflix production. Over the last few years I have sat through many films produced by one of the streaming services.

You know its coming, so if thats not your cup of tea, move along to the next regurgitated IP that Disney attempts to feed you.Is it perfect, heck no. I'd take a three hour version that lengthens the character intros/development in a way that doesn't make it feel so rushed. Some character motives could also be further explored, given time for more dialogue.But to establish an entire universe, set the table for storytelling, and move it along to a clear, concise conflict- is way beyond much of the sci-fi drivel we've had to consume in recent years.

It's also refreshing to have a story not beset by a big studio ""message"" or pandering to be relevant in today's society and just being a story. It's a traditional story about empire stomping on those that it claims to protect, the things that real world rebellions have been caused by, but it's an enjoyable ride along with a band of characters and protagonists that left me wanting to see a) the next chapter and b), the extended r-rated version.","4 out of 23 found this helpful.

Snyder's concept for ""Rebel Moon"" originally pitched to Lucasfilm, shares DNA with ""Star Wars"" due to both creators being inspired by Joseph Campbell's works and Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"". Despite these influences, ""Rebel Moon"" maintains its distinct identity, akin to how ""Star Wars"" evolved into an original property despite its influences from Westerns and pulp sci-fi.As an admirer of the cinematic arts, rather than a staunch fan of either Snyder or Star Wars, I appreciate ""Rebel Moon"" for its visual splendor. Snyder's unique style, with its muted tones punctuated by bursts of color, provides a visually arresting experience. This film, despite its narrative challenges, distinguishes itself through its cinematic beauty, showcasing Snyder's ability to craft visually stunning scenes.Additionally, there's a palpable anticipation for the Director's Cut of ""Rebel Moon."" Given Snyder's reputation for delivering extended versions that often reshape the narrative and deepen the cinematic experience, there's a keen interest to see how his unfiltered vision might enhance the film's story and overall impact.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

The low grades here were given by viewers who ""loved"" the new, abhorrent Disney's STAR WARS Trilogy.The same herd of viewers try - unsuccessfully - to shape a new generation of brainless movie fans who consider REBEL MOON...""soulless"" or ""weak"". It wouldn't be a surprise if the same viewers will put REBEL MOON in the same category with JUPITER ASCENDING (another - without logical reason - underrated movie, unless you wanna fly in pink clouds and you are afraid of anything dark).As the title says, ignore all these stupid NWO trolls of Disney (just because Snyder figured out that he couldn't fit in the vomiting and toxic environment of the specific multinational). The movie was fun, with a great FX level, concrete scenario, quick and in the end you will find that it had lots of elements of DUNE + FIREFLY + LORD OF THE RINGS + FOUNDATION + HALO + 40K WARHAMMER.If you a true (dark) space opera fan, you will appreciate that project.If you are a NWO fruit/""princess"", you will continue admiring pointless with no I.

I can echo what many have said here about the need for some writing refinement, mostly with dialogue which is far to exposition at at times. Te characters are interesting though, they just need to be as well scripted as they are conceptualised. The plot is solid reflecting the resistance of space nazis and the world is gorgeous. The biggest problem is Snyder invited comparison with Star Wars which was brave. It has the potential but only time will tell. I'm excited for the next one and there is good setup for a saga.When you write a movie intending it to be part of a series based on an original concept then you naturally will make the mistakes of cramming too much and too little into each film. This movie managed to do both and oddly that actually worked.If you go into this with an open mind and ignore all the Star Wars comparison then there is a lot for SciFi fans to enjoy and it will keep you thinking.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Sure it is a little cheesy in places and has hints of StarWars,BuckRogers,Marvel,LOTR in various scenes. I'm not quite sure why people are hating on this.

The plot and setting reminds you of several universes but it never detracted from the viewing experience. I thought one scene at the Trading City bar was reminiscent of the Star Wars Cantina but that was the only blatant borrowing I saw. Obviously it is about a group of Rebels that rebel against an Empire, so you can see some of the parallels to Star Wars. I also felt it had some homage to Dune and Chronicles of Riddick. The movie plays quickly at 2:15 I never felt it dragged and let me just say there is a twist near the end that surprised me and something unexpected.

I even thought the robot would have its own arc similar to I,Robot / Chappie. Plot isn't unique at all. Might have borrowed the Borg queen, Braveheart warpaint, Gladiator, and an Urukai. It even has a little bit of Greek mythology influence. It tries to mix all these elements into one movie, but I thought it worked, because it entertained.

They surprised both positively and negatively, but with increasingly better effects as well as good content. Of course, quantity does not mean good quality.That is why, of course, there are also many failed films for which I do not know who paid for the film... or did they even read the script??Ok, I agree, maybe the first part is really a bit stretched and there is a little Darth Vader association in it...at least at the end.However, the story is set seriously enough to unfold into an interesting sequel. Of course, all of us who are fans of good action and stories know that hunting, revenge, etc. Follow. However, it is difficult to satisfy all tastes.My opinion is that as far as Sci-Fi goes, I found the film watchable. We'll see what the sequels will be like.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

It won't take long for anyone to see the clear inspiration, especially if Rebel Moon was originally a project pitched for Lucasfilm. Watching this open-minded will do you good.I liked the movie thanks to it's good visuals ( both special effects and cinematography were on point), real Star Wars pacing (it fits, what can I say), original characters which we all have yet to get to know. So far they've been just introduced, because that was the task of this movie - to introduce a new world to the audience. In my opinion it did a great job of setting a base to build upon.It's definitely a decent entry for a new franchise that's why I'm giving it 8/10 even though it's more like a 7 or 7,5 maximum.

It's just an important introduction, very much needed, for next parts.Waiting for the sequel.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Sophia Boutella is intense and memorable as Kora, a refugee with a past, who becomes the defender of the farming village she now calls home. Her background in dance serves her well in the combat choreography. Ed Skrein plays evil characters so well, and he's in his element as the face of the evil empire.

If you can figure that out early you'll enjoy it. Even the title Rebel Moon sounds like a Star Wars sequel. Great job on what is probably the most expensive Star Wars fan fiction ever made.Light sabers, empire, rebels, a Mos Eisley-esque bar and bar brawl, a Star Destroyer called a Dreadnought, laser guns, an emperor (""king""). No Jedis, but the characters form a group of people with extraordinary skills who basically fill that gap.Snyder is obviously frustrated with the Star Wars franchise and this movie should be viewed as a response to the Disneyfication of Star Wars.

On a small moon at the edge of the universe a clan of quiet, industrious agriculturists work hard for a simple, bountiful life until a monolithic spacecraft penetrates through through their atmosphere, bringing violence and war with it. It represents a ruthlessly dogmatic regime with eyes on conquering everything in the known cosmos and only a mysterious stranger (Sofia Boutella) living amongst them provides any hope against the eventual onslaught. This first film is a raucous recruitment montage as she leads a ragtag band of outliers across many solar systems to find others that may help their cause. Snyder builds his world with music (phenomenally emotional score by Tom Holkenborg), motion, colour and stirring passages of monologue rather than sit-down exposition. Anthony Hopkins' robot narrator provides the obligatory Galadriel opening spiel and then it's off to the races and even if everything doesn't quite make sense plot-wise, the film moving in fits and starts of slow and sped up pacing, Snyder paints with such vivid, broad strokes one can't help but be moved by the spectacle onscreen, a feast for eyes, ears and soul alike. Boutella has already proven what a strong presence she is in the action/fantasy realm and holds her own as a lead terrifically here, supported by Djimon Hounsou, reliably villainous Ed Skrein, Michiel Huisman, Charlie Hunnam, Cleopatra Coleman, Cary Elwes and a standout Jena Malone. The isn't without some issues; it races along with such childlike lack of expository inhibitions that we aren't introduced to all of the characters languidly enough to care about them as a unit, and the story can feel a bit scattered amongst the stars in terms of coherency. But observe the style, movement (yes, there's lots of slow motion, deal with it), music and sheer atmospheric scope of this story, it's truly something breathtaking and a world to get lost in from moment to moment. That's what Snyder and excels at so much is the *moment*, the sheer cinematic bliss of one framed scenario and all the spatial dynamics requisite to capture an audience. In this moment I'm grateful for his vision, and excited for the second part of this story. Any film that references Harry Potter, Avatar, Inglorious Basterds and Chronicles Of Riddick in the same runtime while still managing to retain a soul of originality is doing something right.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

My biggest disappointment was finding out that this is not even the uncut version, which is obvious, specially in the action scenes and I do feel that it affects not only the narrative but the visuals. The rest of the characters are undeniably plain and the world does feel a bit reduced, but I feel like I got enough for the first installment of a franchise that it's supposed to go beyond 2 films, and I understand the story because of personal reasons which might be the main reason why I actually enjoyed it, along with the visuals.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Sofia Botella is just brillant, the fights scenes with her are amazing and remembers me a lot when she played a bad ass in the first Kingsman. The evil guy is scary and the progress of the rebellion is exciting to see...You are so deeply in the movie that you just want Sofia Botella to kick the asses of all the oppressors in that story. She is a real and believable heroe. You will not waste your time watching that amazing movie.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

It feels like Star Wars (original episodes) at times. At other times it feels like the legendary Seven Samurai. Either way it feels different from most things I've seen.The pacing is nice and the plot moves along at a leisurely pace. The fighting sequences are really cool and plenty of gore... not a movie for kids. The soundtrack sounds epic. The CGI is amazing.The acting and actors is top notch, better than most blockbuster movies I've watched in the last few years. Can't wait to see the rest of this story.I see a lot of people nit picking this movie but give it a watch and judge for yourself. So far I love it.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

But over all i think its a solid 8 or 9 for me, enjoyable, it has more potential , it was just shorten it looks really rushed the story is like jumping no character groowth except for the woman lead.

From mythalogical refrences to some mystical elements blended with sci fi and fantasy, A Child of Fire captures everything Snyder is best at. Say whatever you wanna say about Snyder's direction but no one can deny when it comes to cinematography and visuals no one can beat his style and same goes for this movie from opening shot you'll know that this movie is a feast to your eyes, from multiple cgi creatures to different worlds to big set pieces everything is so well done..with big spaceships, weapons, lighting blades, laser guns and epic action scenes you can really see the production value of this movie..
Junkie XL's score is also great to hear, he never misses with his soundtrack..
Storywise it is similar to many films we've seen in the past i will call it Magnificent Seven meets with Justice League where multiple heroes form a team to defeat the evil,but since it is only buildup for what's to come we really can't say what Snyder is really cooking. It is getting the band together story with the actual main event loading to explode in sequel. Every cast member played his/her role too well especially Charlie Hunnam and Sofia Boutella, she was 🔥as Kora and i am interested to see how will her journey in this universe will take her. Rest of cast also done justice to their characters..Action scenes were really epic especially final battle since Snyder is best known for delivering epic slo mo action scenes we can easily say it is one of the best action films of this year.. With an extended cut for this movie is coming next year sometimes it suffers from pacing issues which will be resloved in that 3hr cut i think.. Overall it was a great fun to watch.I am waiting to see part 2 in April next year and excited to see where it will take us..On December 22 2023 as DCEU finally dies a shameful death Zack Snyder's new universe rises on Netflix.. I call that poetic justice..","1 out of 11 found this helpful.

The production quality was high and the cast was impressive. It is already hard enough to get an ""epic"" sci-fi movie (Star Wars original trilogy will never have an equal, obviously). But with the very good hand to hand spots, very unique technology and aliens it all lead to a very promising future franchise. So far there is no great backstory such as the great war between the Sith and Jedi, however no story before or since can equal that. This movie kept my sons (17 and 23), and even my wife entertained the duration of the movie. I have never been a movie snob, and getting original stories is almost impossible. The writing was adequate, the plot was good enough. The acting was good and the action with the humanoids and the unique aliens and weapons just made a very high budget movie, we got to see for free on Netflix.Not a writer, nor a professional reviewer. Apologies for the write-up, but the movie is more than worth a watch.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I am really getting that Warhammer 40k, Star Wars vibes while wathcing these movies and I like it. It is dark, grim and a cinematic visual spectacle. The music is astounding and I can see the Snyder aestatics in the movie, as in the movies 300 and the Justice League Snyder Cut. I guess it is not for everyone, but it was definetly something new out there that is worth to watch. There are too few movies about an epic space opera on such a scale like this. It has a lot of potential and it had me eager to see more of the world and characters.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

You quickly catch on that this is a ""Magnificent Seven/Seven Samurai"" type of film. A little heavy handed on the slowmo scenes but that's kinda to be expected with Zach Snyder. Good variety of action, choreographed fight scenes, and battles. Storyline is basic but still serviceable and that's really all you need for an action movie. Good acting overall. Nice setup for the second film.Bottom line: if you're looking for a highly enjoyable action movie with good CGI and some heart, then this is well worth your time.

This film is produced wanting to rub it's shoulders with the big Hollywood productions, I feel that it has achieved a high result with the budget it has been given. As a Netflix funded film, it uses the funding tricks of the big budget film and has managed to get the post production teams many a director would give a body part for and uses all these resources to the max.To sum up, I feel it's a good curl up with film.

I found myself several times having that feeling of dread when you feel all is lost and the cheer with the victories that come with such a movie. I realize there are many criticisms on lack of plot and character development, I respectfully disagree it's a great watch.
