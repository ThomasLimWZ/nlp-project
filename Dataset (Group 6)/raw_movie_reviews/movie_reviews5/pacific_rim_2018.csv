The difference between fight scenes at night vs broad daylight may not seem like a big deal, but for some reason it really stood out to me. It just feels like this one was more geared toward kids, and potentially selling action figures. I didn't hate it by any means, but it really lacked what made the first one so unique, and intriguing to me.","186 out of 260 found this helpful.

What was expected? Bigger robots fighting bigger monsters. The same thing with little tweaks - as most sequels do. What we got?
A product. A film generated by an AI. I wasn't there, but I assume it went something like this. The first meeting of the creators of this movie follows.
Ok, Google, what do modern kids like?
1. Robots (Transformers)
2. Scary cool monsters
3. Robots fighting monsters
4. Robots fighting robots
5. Memes from 2009 (Trololo sing) really? + memes from 2017 (the salt). 
6. Horribly executed kid rebel subplots (Divergent, The Maze Runner, The Hunger games whatever)
7. Action
8. Forced drama?
9. Bad jokes?
Ok, let's take The Independence Day Resurgence's basic plot and fail miserably at everything. Done.
In other words, there is nothing in this movie besides action scenes. The plot lives on its own, there are no characters, and even their substitutes are completely disconnected from the dead plot. Nothing they do matter, it just follows typical cliches until the end. It even gets confusing at some point, but then you see the light at the end of the tunnel. It rushes the ending knowing that by this point nobody cares.
All the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Most of the actors are just having fun knowing that there's no need to get invested into anything here. Sadly, Scott Eastwood's face is stuck in one emotion and is unable to display anything else.
CGI crews did a good job, I guess. Looks fine. There's even one creative action scene involving buildings. Other than that the action is generic, even IMAX can't make it feel better. Maybe it would've been more impressive but the overabundance of CGI city destruction in modern blockbusters seriously lowers the threshold for getting impressed by CGI.
I'd compare this to a long video game cut-scene, but modern games have more character development and creative visuals in their cut-scenes. For instance, pretty much all Blizzard cut-scenes are visual masterpieces. 
Final verdict: not entertaining on the big screen and a total waste of time for home viewing.","227 out of 348 found this helpful.

Uprising is stupid and it is heavy on the cgi (As it had to be I suppose) but it's also a lot of fun just like the first movie.The cast however are mostly different and that's a very mixed bag. Scott Eastwood is awful, he's just the absolute pits and has no place in front of a camera. His father was dire initially as well, so if he follows suit with his father he'll be a bearable actor by around the age 60 mark!Next we have John Boyega whose choice of roles explains why I'm not keen on him. He played a Storm trooper gone good in Star Wars, he was a chav moron in Attack the Block and here he's a criminal turned hero. Sorry but that just doesn't work for me, why is he always the good guy with bad roots?And finally of those note worthy we have Cailee Spaeny who was excellent, very likeable, very talented and I hope this girl has a bright career ahead of her as based on this performance she deserves it.The movie itself is exactly what you'd expect, it follows on well from the previous movie and adds to the universe well but ultimately is just dumb take your brain out over the top fun. And you know something, that's okay! Not every movie needs to be smart or well constructed, sometimes you just need to see big flashy cgi robots beating up big scary cgi monsters!I hope there is a third (And probably final) movie to wrap things up. The franchise is never exactly going to produce outstanding movies but for simple silly fun they tick all the right boxes.The Good:Big dumb funCailee SpaenyThe Bad:John Boyega is simply not up to filling Idris Elba's bootsI struggle to get behind criminal protagonistsScott EastwoodFelt like it should have been longer","30 out of 52 found this helpful.

I felt that the film was a love letter for adults that love Robots fighting Aliens. The Monsters were unique and interesting. The fights were bone-crunching. The Sounds the Kaiju made were great.Unfortunately, Pacific Rim: Uprising loses the gravity and heart of the first film and is really made for kids this time round. There are a few ""cringey"" moments and it all seems a lot more light-hearted. The storyline is ok but it feels like there is a great film in there and it just couldn't get out. Perhaps they should have spent a little longer improving the storyline and having slightly less kids.Anyway, don't get me wrong, the action scenes are incredible and they are worth the admission price alone, but it feels like a missed opportunity. The ending also feels a bit rushed. 
I think I'll get the film when it comes out and just fast-forward all the talking bits and just watch the Robot action and Monster fights. That's where this film succeeds.","24 out of 42 found this helpful.

Most of the parents I saw after exiting the cinema look just okay, while their children were very excited.Don't watch this movie while expecting superb acting or stellar storyline, go watch it while expecting to see giant robots punching other giant robots and monsters. But hey, at least I can safely state that the plot and acting are still way way way better than the Transformer franchise.In conclusion, this sequel lives up to its supposed expectation as the most awesome dumb movie (as said by Honest Trailer).Man, this movie should have been named as

where you came from,
who believed in you
and who didn't.
We are a family now, and we are earth's last defense.What amazed me the most was the fact that I couldn't remember much of ""Pacific Rim"", even though I thought it was an original-looking film years ago. No worries. Little by little everything is explained again in such a way that I partially knew it again. And even though ""Pacific Rim"" wasn't high-quality cinema and simply a very expensive monster film with superb looking computer-generated images, the film impressed me at the time. ""Pacific Rim"" was brainless amusement with a high entertainment value. This sequel is simply a duplicate with other main characters in identical Jaegers. But it's so irritating and annoying mostly. I was hoping this time the Kaiju's took control and destroyed planet earth. That way we don't need to be afraid of a possible sequel in the future.Since the design and subject are identical to that of the initial film, one could say that it's thanks to Guillermo Del Toro the first film was kind of a success. But that's a bit simplistic to state, in my opinion. I rather think there are several factors that ensure that you can't really call this a successful film. This time the entire Jaeger program shifts from a mature world to that of teenagers. We end up in a cadet school where young people are trained to become Jaeger pilots. A bit like in ""Ender's game"" but now it's not in space. And of course, there's one of the cadets who can't stand the newcomer Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny) and believes she doesn't belong there. And who will be the hero in the end? Yep, not hard to guess. Anyway, it all feels a bit like a kindergarten. The Goonies in giant robots who save the world. Haven't we seen that before?Also, the acting wasn't something to get enthusiastic about. Cailee Spaeny was acceptable with her youthful enthusiasm and rebellious behavior. John Boyega sometimes played the indifferent Jake with reluctance. Scott Eastwood was again suitable for the character Nate. And not only because of that creepy resemblance to his famous father. But the acting by Burn Gorman, Charlie Day and Tian Jing was at times simply bad. Bad enough to make me squirm.Only the graphical part remains. Just like the 2013 film, it's a visual spectacle. And just like the acting, there are also ups-and-downs here. It's fun to see huge robots and enormous monsters smashing into one another. But to be honest, it's the same old thing as in the previous movie. And the final battle in a Japanese city close to ""Mount Fuji"" just looked ugly. It wasn't as if this clash of the titans took place in between blocks of flats made from cardboard. Just like in those ancient Godzilla films. But it's a close call. The duel on the ice, on the other hand, looked extremely great. A computer-graphic masterpiece.Do you like to watch huge robots and by extraterrestrial created monsters battle each other? Then I guess this film is right up your alley. Have you seen ""Pacific Rim"" years ago? Then you can safely skip this one because you won't be seeing something really new here. To be honest, I sometimes had the feeling that I was watching a modern version of the Power Rangers. Only the creatures who emerged from another dimension resembled those that the Power Rangers fought against a long time ago. Ridiculously long time ago.","185 out of 238 found this helpful.

Entertaining but unfulfilling in equal parts","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4100454/?ref_=tt_urv","ckpie","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15225011/?ref_=tt_urv","22 March 2018","The movie has the robots, the badass fight scenes, the enjoyable cast of characters and all the makings of a fun time. For most part, it is. However, when compared to the first it lacks that certain reverence for its inspiration which shows most apparently when watching the action.Character scenes aside, since the first was no winner in this department either, what Pacific Rim did amazingly well was craft gargantuan mechs and monsters that we can remember. Uprising almost feels like the director was following a checklist, but forgot to watch the first one to see how Del Toro put it all together to make it special. The result is a 'cool' and 'badass' robot v monster fight scene collection that ultimately fails to resonate.As a sequel, it also fails to cover any new ground. This is most likely due to having to basically cast a whole new group of characters, give them scenes rather than simply starting off where the last left it. Consequently we don't really get too much more info in terms of what or how or why things happen, only that the Kaiju are coming again and we gotta stop them.Pacific Rim Uprising fixed the pacing issues from the original, but thats about it. Otherwise, more doesn't always equal better sums it up pretty well. It IS still a fun watch, especially if Jaeger v Kaiju action was what you're looking for in the first place.","20 out of 39 found this helpful.

It wasn't great or perfect as an overall film, and somewhat of a case of style over substance, but it entertained and did well on delivering on its objectives. The involvement of Guillermo Del Toro and Idris Elba are reasons enough to see the filmReally do wish that the same can be said for its sequel 'Pacific Rim: Uprising'. The trailer was not good and the reviews not great (one of the weaker received films of those released so far this year), but saw it anyway due to liking the first film enough and wanted to see something that was pretty much the same sort of thing quality-wise (and perhaps with improvements). No such luck. 'Pacific Rim: Uprising' turned out to be a dull and soulless sequel and film, and one that comes over as pointless at the end of the day. Starting with what 'Pacific Rim: Uprising' excelled with, which sadly is not much, much of the cinematography and editing are slickly atmospheric, the production design is gritty and audacious and some of the effects are top-notch. Some of the action and spectacle is exciting, they're big and over-the-top but appropriately so. John Boyega is a reasonable and charismatic lead and the only actor to come over well. On the other hand, nowhere near as good a job is done with the direction, nowhere near as in command of or at ease with the material the action, making for a film that tries to be both silly fun and taking itself seriously but fails at both and neither gels. The film doesn't know what it's trying to be, it can be dully paced and target audience is not easy to figure out due to the film's muddled done.Boyega aside, the acting is very bad, especially from Charlie Day and Burn Gorman who are as irritating as they were before. 'Pacific Rim: Uprising' also has some cringe-worthy, childish and vomit-inducingly inane dialogue and paper thin stereotypical characterisation (enough to tick off the long list of cliches one by one in quick succession) where not much is done to develop the characters and make one properly care for them. There are clumsy and unnecessary references to the first film too and there is too much exposition that really bogs things down.Although there are instances of them being good, other effects are cartoonish. A lot of the action doesn't work, not very inventive and not always cohesive let alone exhilarating. A big case of a lot of noise and attempted style but not a lot of brains or soul. Worst of all is the story, which is dull, ridiculous, barely coherent and with a cobbled together glued badly feel and a complete lack of emotional investment.Concluding, a mess apart from a few good things. 3/10 Bethany Cox","45 out of 54 found this helpful.

I would group this film in the same group as transformers, or fast and furious films (Switch-off films, if you will) - if you go into them looking for faults, you'll find them by the absolute truck load, but go in with a blank mind, you might be surprised by how much fun you can have. John Boyega's charisma carries the film between the action scenes - his position and relationship in relation with Caliee Spaeny (who I was surprised to learn is 19 - she plays a 14-15 year old very convincingly), is established early on, and for the most part, works well. The supporting cast do what they have to - Scott Eastwood's character arc is predictable, but provides great moments of clarity. I believe this film is definitely an improvement from the first - the big action moments are far easier to understand who is punching who, the lighting and colouring has been revised so that everything happens in daytime, which is great. Would I recommend this film? If you, like many others, go to the cinema to switch off for a couple of hours, this is a great film. It's not a film of subtilty or nuance, but if you can expect nothing more you'll have a great time.","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

That's not really saying much.The problem with the Transformers series and Pacific Rim is that they are really just action movies dressed up with robots. Transformers attempts to spice up the mech genre by having them do acrobatics and fancy, unrealistic combat moves. They look like ninja turtles or those kangaroos from Warriors of Virtue, except they're giant robots. Pacific Rim doesn't have the fancy flipkicks, but it suffers from the same dilemma: they fight just like humans.You have to ask yourself, if you just want to see moves, why don't you just go watch a martial arts film? It has much better action sequences that isn't bogged down by ""slow, clunky movement"" becsuse ""robots"". Or if you want to see high tech weapon suits performing great looking feats, most anime do it much better. In fact, in Pacific Rim one, the fighting scenes between the pilots was hugely superior to the robot scenes.Let's be real. What's the real reason you watch robots films. You want to be wowed by amazing technology. Neither Transformers nor Pacific Rim deliever. All you have are robots performing fancy human looking feats and fancy looking human weapons.Throw in your plot, and both series have decent plots, and voila m, giant robot movie. But that's all they are. There is no wow. They may as well have been standing still for the whole movie. Decent alien invadion plot with plot twists that can somewhat keep you guessing. Sci fi wow factor is almost zero. Robot wow factor is low. They feel like first generation robots, which is boring. The plot for the second story is not as good as the first. The fighting scenes are better which makes this one slightly better.In conclusion, decent action film, with robots as substitutes for humans.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

DeKnight brings none of the child like charm or enthusiasm the Mexican auteur brought to the table with his entry as we instead get a lame and tame tale of Idris Elba's Stacker Pentecosts' child Jake (played by a struggling John Boyega) turn from troublemaker to Jager pilot, as the world finds itself once more under threat from the dreaded Kaiju monsters.The first Pacific Rim had a similarly dumb plot and characters that were more like walking caricatures but there was a sense that everyone involved was having a great time and despite better judgements, you as an audience member did to.That's completely lost here, there's little fun to be had with the bland and uninteresting action scenes, the main cast are all completely forgettable, while even returning cast members such as Charlie Day's Dr. Newton Geiszler and Burn Gorman's Hermann Gottlieb are more of a tacked on accessory, with Day in particular getting an embarrassing character development that is both lame and totally misguided.With a pulse-free plot line and thrill-free action there was little chance Uprising ever had at succeeding and there's little mystery as to why this unwanted sequel failed to capture the dollars at the box-office, guaranteeing the Pacific Rim brand is now dead in the water.Final Say -Not even the most hardcore of Pacific Rim fans will find much to enjoy in Uprising, an utterly forgettable and disposable new entry into the wannabe franchise that somehow manages to turn it's over the top foundations into a bland, charm-free and tiresome event.1 child mechanic out of 5","21 out of 25 found this helpful.

With no more Kaiju, the world is trying to rebuild. Jake Pentecost (John Boyega) ran from his father's heroic legacy and lives on the edges of the rebuilding civilization. He deals in black market and tries to steal from a decommissioned Jaeger. He is scooped by street kid Amara Namani who builds her own mini-Jaeger. They get arrested and his stepsister Mako Mori recruits him back into the program. Amara joins the other young cadets training to be pilots under Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood). Ruthless industrialist Liwen Shao is pushing for Jaeger drones controlled remotely by a single operator with bumbling Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) working under her.The Guillermo del Toro style has been scrubbed down and transformed. Jake is a less than compelling lead which is not that different from the original. It starts with a lot attitude and a lot of fronting. Boyega does save it by his sheer charisma. The first movie is a kiddie idea taken seriously with fun. This one takes that serious take and injects some kiddie jokiness. It literally adds a Robin-like character. The attempts at jokes annoyed me. The city destruction has a sterile feel. There is still some fun to be had and it is still robots fighting monsters.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

Pacific Rim: Uprising is a good film that, could have been so much better. Director Steven S. DeKnight doesn't successfully take over directorial duties from Oscar-winning filmmaker, Guillermo del Toro. Some of the dialogues in the movie, are cringe-worthy & unintentionally funny. The visual effects are good. The action set pieces are the highlight of the film. The 3D is effective. The performances suffer, due to the poor script. John Boyega is great as Jake Pentecost. Scott Eastwood is superb as Nate Lambert. Cailee Spaeny is spectacular as Amara Namani. Newcomer Spaeny outshines all her co-stars. Burn Gorman is great as Dr. Herman Gottlieb. Charlie Day is hilarious as Dr. Newton Geiszler. Tian Jing is brilliant as Liwen Shao. Jin Zhang is effective as Marshal Quan.

This movie belongs to a recent born herd of movies who are embedded, almost drowned in all the references and quotes that, in the writers' mind, should make the spectators squirm in uncontrolled happiness. 
That may work if the story can hold the movie together, and that's just not the case.
The number of this movies is increasing and it's a worrying thing.Pacific Rim : Uprising unceremoniously throws you in a Episode VIII-ish carousel of ill-placed, badly executed references from the previous movie. The poor writing lets boredom seep into the movie through planet-sized plot holes that quite admirably manage to furrow in disbelieving thought even the dumbest kid's brow.
A lacklustre CGI, along with a annoying cinematography, a truly forgettable soundtrack and a horrific screenplay contribute to create a completely obscene movie, which is so boring that watching the grass grow for the rest of your life would seem a far more palatable activity than give this movie a second chance.Pacific Rim : Uprising is a collage of dull scenes quite badly glued together, a movie which is tragically deprived of whatsoever emotional impact. A twelve hour straight Pac-man gameplay can create more hype and has a far stronger emotional impact than this movie.A total disappointment.CGIPacific Rim's CGI was truly something. It admirably managed to convey the power, the bulkiness and the mechanical presence of the robots, the raw power of every hit, the slightest nuances of any movement made by a giant robot that was driven by humans. It was a rare jewel.
In Uprising the CGI is disappointing. Lacklustre, cheap and badly melded with the rest of the scene. There are no more three-dimensional, giant robots made of moving, bruised iron plates, or solid, bulky steel giant mechas with a weight, or some realistic, a bit sluggish movements.They look like toys, their parts, gears and plates plain and stiff, barely moving. Robots are light, unrealistically quick and agile models. 
The design of the robots is pretty lazy and uninspired, and really reminds me of some cheap plastic robot action figures.
Their textures are also quite cheap.
This gets a little better with the Kaijus, they are honestly cool.CinematographyThe dark, ominous tones of the first movie completely disappear. While this is not an intrinsically bad thing, it contributes to create a blindingly white, overall fake, aseptic scenery, that while it's understandable given the setting of this movie, in my opinion is irritating.
The already excessive holographic colour fest of the Jaegers' HUDs of the first movie is unnecessarily amplified here, it almost gave me an headache. 
Truly bothersome.Storytelling.
Here we go.
The lack of chemistry between the characters, due to a criminally low level of writing, is the true common thread of the movie. The characters are dull, their backstories already heard in every action movie released so far.
Their development in the movie is either non-existent or plainly wrong.
The human reactions are somewhat odd, not quite believable.
Funnily enough, some of the lines unwillingly probe the screenplay and expose it's flaws, but it's a bitter laugh.
The whole screenplay features horrible, cheesy lines that would have seemed ridiculous even in an '80s action movie featuring Steven Seagal. 
The screenplay is truly awful and predictable , every subplot is either forgotten or comes to conclusion in no more than 20 minutes. 
There is a good thing in this screenplay, there's a thing I'd never expected and that truly caught me off guard, but it's not enough. I'm fairly sure I didn't see that coming cause I got distracted when the usher reprimanded a kid who'd put his feet on the seat in front of him.
An inch higher than Independence Day 2, but well, it's not really a compliment.Cringe soars to unrivalled heights with a reference to the salt bae.
Good thing : Cailee Spaeny's acting is really good.","259 out of 383 found this helpful.

The great minds of Earth came up with Jaegers (giant robots) to combat the Kaiju.What was the same? The Jaegers. A reluctant pilot being pulled back into the fight. Widespread destruction.What was different? The actors. The plot. The final showdown.Was it as good, better, or worse? I think it was better.First, let me take time out for this mass destruction disclosure. Both Pacific Rims would have you believe that densely populated cities with millions of tons of concrete and steel being strewn everywhere would leave minimal to no casualties. And to be fair, Pacific Rim is not the only perpetrator of this myth, many other movies have indicated the same. So let me be the one to tell you: impossible. I know that these movies are basically cinematic versions of the video game Rampage. It seems to be a millennial dream to destroy entire cities. But, no way are these poorly constructed skyscrapers going to be busted apart like sand castles and you won't have thousands of casualties to go with it. It seems that the people are more durable than the buildings. Maybe they should construct the buildings out of humans.OK, that's it for my MDD (mass destruction disclosure). Pacific Rim: Uprising was actually better in my opinion. Besides Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood) being supremely militaristic the acting was good and the characters likable. They went for a little more humor and it worked. The destruction porn is kind of old hat but that is a large part of the movie. I'm more of a fan of seeing what the giant machines can do (an ode to my roots of Transformers, Voltron, and Robotech) regardless of whether or not they have the ability to bulldoze entire cities in one fight. Since this movie takes place 10 years after the first Kaiju attacks the Jaegers have nice new weapons and more moves. But what I liked most is that this movie was less predictable. Yes, the overall eventualities are predictable but how they achieve their goals is not that predictable and it was refreshing.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

Now, Steven S. DeKnight continues the saga with ""Pacific Rim Uprising"". Plot: Ten years after the war, Jaegers became the new global defense organization and Jake Pentacost (Jon Boyega of Star Wars fame), son of Stacker (Idris Elba), is recruited to train the next generation of pilots. A rude awakening comes when an unknown human force comes with a plan to bring back the monstrous Kaiju and our new heroes must rise to the challenge.This is a fitting continuation of the world established by del Toro with a few new things to offer. The story is decent enough and has a couple of plot twists I didn't see coming.The action is faster paced this time thanks to improved technology and each Jaeger and Kaiju has new tricks up their giant sleeves. I'm especially fond of the mini Jaeger Scrapper. A few original characters return with the actors reprising their roles, though Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) has little screen time. Boyega, Eastwood, and Spaeny are strong enough to carry the story with their own charm, though the rest of the new cast are unmemorable. The humor falls flat most of the time and the themes don't hold as much weight as those in the first film. I guess since del Toro is not in the directing chair (instead, he's the producer), it lacks his unique filmmaking touch.All in all, ""Uprising"" is a fun romp with substantial spectacle, a fair cast, and nice updates, but it lacks the nuances of its predecessor and has not only a couple inconsistencies but things that require more suspension of disbelief than before. A third film is planned, so hopefully improvements can be made. There's also talk of a possible crossover with the MonsterVerse (starring Godzilla+Kong), which I would love to see. If you're a fan of Japanese pop culture or just want to pass the time, then this can do it for you.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

the first one had depth, the characters were someone to relate to. I had high hopes for the sequel but i was disappointed. The actors are young very young and it shows on the acting skills and the characters they portrays. (what no adaults agreed to play in the movie?). i'm sorry to say the eastwood jr. is just a preaty face and does'nt have to presence like his fathers. and what with all those Japanese walking around? why don't French, Germens, Israelis?
and that Shao lady, by talking english and dissolving the hair and playing 'rambo' you're not making you're performence better. 
To sum everything up the movie is a waste of time I hope the director will learm from his mistake and the third movie will be better.","107 out of 155 found this helpful.

Especially if you go with a bunch of 10 year-old boys. Or are one inside.If you're looking for a good sequel to the story and tone of the original ""Pacific Rim"", you'll probably be disappointed.As a sequel, this isn't that great. A lot of what was established in the first movie was thrown out the window or just forgotten about. The Jaeger program was disbanded because it cost too much while there were actually Kaiju to fight. Now the Kaiju are gone, so they built like ten more Jaeger, plus some drones? Stacker Pentecost had a son no one mentioned? Drift compatibility is much easier to attain now? A plus: While the character Raleigh Beckett is not in the movie, he's briefly mentioned but not confirmed to be dead. I seriously doubt we've seen the last of him.But on to the movie itself. It was definitely geared more towards the young fans. Most of the cast is teenagers, rather than the battle-hardened adults of the first movie. The fights are during the clear day rather than in the rain at night, which gives them a very different atmosphere. In addition, the runtime was under two hours. That suited me fine; it's a loud movie and I can only take so much monster-punching action in theaters before getting a headache.The plot isn't that important, but it's okay for a big dumb action movie. Promising cadet who was kicked out of the academy years ago for being a rebel is forced to train some new Jaeger pilots in case the Kaiju attack again. A big company is building Jaeger drones so they don't have to train cadets anymore. Something goes wrong with the drones, then Kaiju attack. The reason for this is briefly explained, then we get to that sweet Jaeger vs. rogue Jaeger vs. Kaiju action.The new Jaegers themselves were really cool, and tried to top the previous movie's Jaegers in every way. Liked the chain sword on Gipsy Danger? Well, get ready for Saber Athena, which has one on each arm. Why have a regular sword arm when you could have a chainsaw arm? Well here comes Obsidian Fury, with TWO chainsaw arms! And so on.So the action was awesome, but did I have an emotional reaction / investment in the story? Yes. Nothing life-changing, but I cared. There is a plot twist that I didn't see coming and it was a blow to what I'd previously thought about someone. A character dies and I was genuinely sad about it. I was actually worried when the biggest monster showed up and there looked like there was no way of stopping it. Main characters were likable. I was internally cheering when something happened near the very end to help the main characters save the day, even if it was a little silly. (You'll know it when you see it.)This is going to be a huge hit in China, not only because Transformers-type movies do well over there, but because a popular Chinese actress, Jing Tian, has a pretty big part in this film. I liked her character a lot.Which all leads to the nigh-inevitable third Pacific Rim movie, which they set up in the end.And, man: poor Tokyo just can't catch a break.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Does this Pacific Rim Uprise or fall flat from its predecessor? My answer is yes:Del Toro is vastly known for the 'Dark Fantasy' theme in his films, so his move away from the Directors chair unfortunately takes away much of the 'dark mood' from the first. Solely focused on being a fun YA action movie, it seemed like a basic attempt on something with a much bigger premise. Yes, there were new ideas, but with so much back story going on the narrative felt lost at times. Nevertheless fun action was key here and, for the most part, it was fun.

I went into this movie with low expectations as a big fan of the first movie. The trailers didn't hype me up much, and without del Toro helming the direction I just felt it wouldn't have the same feel as the previous film, and I was right. The pacing was weird in the first half of the film, with too much forced exposition detailing plot points of the first movie. The comedic points to help keep people entertained are pretty campy and cheesy, but it's at least consistent and helps get the first half of the movie over with.Once the movie hits it's second acts climax however, it's full tilt boogie from there on. The movie definitely felt less like Pacific Rim and more like what I thought Power Rangers should have been. Things move at a faster pace and the fights are pretty awesome at points. It's brought back memories of watching huge monsters and robots fight while eating cereal on a Saturday morning. Do I go to these movies for character development and a deep plot? No, I came for badass robots and kaiju fights, and I got more than I asked for in that regard with this movie.When the credits rolled, I was not only satisfied but it exceeded my expectations. If your looking to take it super seriously and want to learn more about the Pacific Rim universe you'll likely be left wanting. But if you go in for some great Saturday morning action, you'll find it for sure.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

Pacific Rim 2 was action-filled as expected, but it lacked the character build. 
With Charlie Hunman leaving after the first movie, John Boyega andScott Eastwood tried to keep the flame going. But I felt like they lacked a story; they lacked a past or a self-story that would make them special as the main characters.
Also the story-line was basic. Yes, they kept the same story as the first part but they added some aspects that to me was illogical; that it was forced.
Other than these two problems I found, the movie amazed me with its visual effects, sound editing and mixing, and I left the theater satisfied.","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

If I could begin with one positive thing to say about it - it's that the giant robot fights can give Transformers a run for their money. Alas, this is as far as it goes.Pathetic Rim swipes old characters under the rug, adds the black stormtrooper.... excuse me, getting a deja vu here..., introduces the characters ""way"" out of proportion(on the Marvel\Transformer level of stupidity, despite this being a damn Del Toro franchise), and barely tries to stay coherent throughout the runtime.Instead of trying to do what honest sequels ""must"" do - reconnect with the story and make the viewer feel like they are watching Part Two, Pathetic Rim throws a few expositions, introduces us to an irrelevant situation that has Last Knight written all over it, shows a few scenes that are supposed to be reminiscent of what we've seen in the original. Oh, and, of course, once you see characters randomly reciting the events of the previous movie... you know that the writer has the experience of a first-grader. Not once, not twice, multiple characters will blatantly try to make this movie look like a sequel by laying out that major events of the original.What is the movie about? Well, let's see... Last time I checked, the Jaeger Program was scrapped. Frankly, for a good reason. And that's before the victory. A few years after - we see numerous Jaegers around the world. Why? As a deterrent? Or to use the resources to build toys instead of rebuilding the damages? Of course, in light of all the Jaegers, there ""have"" to be places with ""decommissioned"" Jaegers, just waiting for brave looters to dig in. That's not just Last Knight, this is A Force Awakens rip-off if I ever saw one. But why rip off trash?Somewhere in that mess of the girl from Last Knight and the ridiculous situation of AFA, we get our black stormtrooper, who is apparently an ""already"" prodigal son of late Marshall Pentacost - adhering to the nature's call of his race. Seriously. Don't you dare get offended. I am not a director, who put a black protagonist in a position, where he enjoys gangster stuff, looting and thug life. Just pointing it out.After the aforementioned irrelevant situation - the two protagonists find themselves among the ""new generation"". Somehow - the whole deal is overseen by China. I understand that they are powerful, but does Europe count for nothing in this world anymore? God forbid they mention Russia, obviously, but, besides the base being located in China, which I could understand, because it's a ""Pan Pacific"" Defense Force, we also meet a large... that's right... Chinese corporation. And that's not even Last Knight, that's Age of Extinction. I get it, Chinese silicon infrastructure is world-leading, and USA is trying to appeal to them... well, tried to, before Trump... but besides that - they aren't that far ahead. Not in military. Not in machinery. Not in science. Any kind of precision german engineering, at least some Tesla ripoff - fine. But another movie with a large Chinese company building drones? No, thanks.For a little bit, we are supposed to believe that this corporation is bad, because this is how it goes. Until a rogue Jaeger shows up and tears Gypsy a new one. After that - it's only questions. What was in that Siberian base? Plan B? Why was there only one rogue Jaeger? Why did the antagonist have to be where the plot needed him to be? Why were the Jaegers made out of butter back on the base? Why is the girl suddenly drift-compatible? Why was there the female object for our two protagonists? Why was the head lady suddenly a pilot? And, of course, why was the movie resolved like a deadline? No, not even cliffhanger - deadline. A cliffhanger promises something, this isn't even a promise.It's not a waste of time, however, it can play ball with Transformers just fine. But it's not Pacific Rim. Del Toro showed us what the genre could do. What Godzilla, Transformers and even others ""should"" do. In the original, we saw Gypsy Danger smack the kaiju with a freighter, a god damn freighter. That scene alone gave the movie an extra pair. What can Pathetic Rim show us? A plasma cannon that kind of crushes down one skyscapper after another on a kaiju. Even Man of Steel would cringe, and that's saying something.","19 out of 25 found this helpful.

The follow up keeps using a very similar structure to the first one but brushes off most of the over dramatic situations; thanks in great part to John Boyega and Scott Eastwood; a couple of actors that work very well together as demonstrated here.
Jake (John Boyeaga) plays Idris Elba character's son. He is a hot head living a very disastrous life that one day is caught stealing Jagger parts with a teenager Amara. Both are sent to Jagger's pilot training camp; however while Amara gets to be a cadet, Jake (who already was a Ranger) is sent to train the new recruits.
His old mate and Jagger co-pilot is Scott Eastwood; they spent most of the time fighting but you can smell a great chemistry among them.
Most of the surviving characters (but not Charlie Hunnam) are back and all of them get important parts in the events. 
The action scenes are more elaborated than the first one; but that would mean nothing if the story was not well orchestrated; but it works.
John Voyega is in my opinion the best thing about the new Star Wars series; he already demonstrated his commanding qualities on the under appreciated Attack the Block. 
Scott Eastwood has good comedy mojo that works very well here; but Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as the two nuts scientist of the first movie that carry most of the history and the comedy.
This is really a follow up of the first movie; so there are a few things that might not be clear if you did not see it; but in any case it is a lot of fun to watch.","37 out of 72 found this helpful.

Some characters from the original did not return for Uprising, some like Charlie Hunham didn't return due to scheduling issues with his other movies. But also other characters like Herc Hansen we didn't get to see. Also I think they could have done a lot more with Mako Mori. But anyway, the original was more serious, it was a bit over the top but not too much. While Uprising was very over the top imo, especially the fight scenes. Uprising also suffers from weak character development and tries more to be a Transformer-like kids movie.I think they should have just let Del Toro direct Uprising as well instead of DeKnight, not that DeKnight did a bad job, just that Del Toro could have done it better. Hermann and Newton were a bit cringy in the original but I think that was done intentionally, while in Uprising it felt like they had a bigger role to play, which I liked a lot.Still I don't think it's a terrible movie, it's just not really that good either, while the original was imo a pretty decent movie. But I do want a sequel, the Pacific Rim franchise has potential and a very interessting universe.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the first one they even need a rocket throster on their back to jump.Some weapons are just plain impossible or not making sense. Check the first one you won't see a weapon that isn't impossible. I know it's already impossible to make giant robot and their weapons in the first place. But they show you in the first movie that's likely possible. So yeah it's like ""screw physic!"".Not make you feels like a pilot. This is what Del Toro tried so hard in the first movie.Jaegers looks similar with each other, part make them different from each other is color and weapon, not the entire body of the Jaeger.A kid, make a Jaeger from trash. What is this transformers?Lost sense of hugeness, they're big, huge, their height is almost the same as a skyscrapper. Playing with depth of prespective give you feels how big a Jaeger is, now it's gone.Pilot are not in sync. As in movement and when they're hit. Also too much talk, aren't they have to drift or already in drift when they're near base? When you're already in each other head there's no need to talk much.Pilot's suit. Jaegers aren't made in the same place. So are their suits. Also the suits is like some plastic glued on black suit.Just because it's already 10 years technology is like 50 years advanced. Don't make it as reasons to make an impossible physic.The Uprising looks like only rely on franchise's name to sell their products.
The first movie could be enjoyed by anyone from from any age, but this is like only for around 10 years old kids. Especially these teens cast, make it feels like Power Rangers.Also i thought they were going to show Hannibal Chou, because he appeared in the end credit scene. But nope.God, i wish they'd bring Del Toro back or just stick to be a single movie without sequel.","4 out of 4 found this helpful.

In a time where we're being bombarded with superhero movies and cheap thrillers, it was nice to see a giant monster/robot battle. The same holds true with this movie. It was nice and it was different from what else is out there today. That being said, the movie was rushed and disjointed. It felt like 98% of the original cast was cast aside in favor of rebooting the sequel with teenagers (we don't even get a mention of the main character from the last film). The story development focused solely on Pentecost this time around and even then that fell through. All other characters were just forgettable, even Mako.The story itself was interesting enough. Kind of a far stretch, but something to grasp on to. It clearly sets itself up for a sequel, and, you know, I'll watch it because at the end of the day I enjoyed the monster battles. Hopefully, however, the sequel will have better battles than this movie because it paled in comparison to expectation, especially when you have to wait an hour just to see some fighting.Overall, I'd rewatch the first movie over this one any day. But it is still an okay film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Ten years after Gypsy Danger closed the breach that the Kaiju were coming from, the son of General Stacker Pentecost, Jake (John Boyega) is forced to resume his father's work and face a renewed Kaiju threat that has the potential of wiping out the world.At first, this film attempts to forge a new direction. There's a more jovial and self-aware tone, we see smaller, home-made Jaegers going up against the more familiar big boys, and a scrappy new protagonist who seems to have some genuine personality (Cailee Spaney as Amara Namani).The bond that begins to develop between Jake and Amara is the one genuine highlight of this film, and it does resolve in a satisfying way. However, as Uprising turns more formulaic and relies more and more on the gags and banter of the first film, it really turns into a yawn.Character development is even more lacking in Uprising than the original Pacific Rim. The original got away with this because it only focused on about five main characters. Uprising tries to give a sense of camaraderie between a group of Jaeger cadets, but aside from Amara, the others are entirely forgettable and interchangeable, especially when they all wear helmets.Ultimately, this film tries too hard to recapture the lightning in the bottle that was the original, and in the end in more ways than one it comes off feeling like a bad rip-off of Independence Day: Resurgence, which was itself a bad rip-off of the original Independence Day. Best to remember what good there was in the original Pacific Rim, and leave this one to the bargain bin.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

"","","A lesser film than the first one; distracting and noisy even if it has specific elements which improve it a bit","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4306861/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","27 August 2018","I'd had a tiring day and had about 2 hours of laundry to bring it to an end, so I opted for the Pacific Rim sequel as my company since I figured it would not require me to pay too much attention at any point. I had quite enjoyed the first film, for what it was, and hoped maybe this could do the same. The answer was ""sort of"" because it replays the first film but without the weight of the novelty, and the weight of some of the stars. The plot this time sees the Jaeger forces slowly rebuilding, only to face a new foe in a unregistered powerful Jaeger who attacks the PPDC. All fingers point to China's new automated Jaeger drones, but is it that simple?As a plot it is a pretty decent attempt at a different angle, and prevents it feeling like a total rehash, even though it is. It plays out well enough but it is lesser than the original film in almost every way. It is less fun, less dramatic, and the battles are less engaging and feel a lot more like a video game. It does still have plenty of action, and if you want robots hitting things then there are certainly other Hollywood franchises that are worse. The film benefits from its cast, in particular John Boyega, who brings his accent and tough charisma which put him on the map in Attack the Block. He plays it well and mostly he makes it work, with only 'bigger' moments and some malfunctioning banter letting him down. Spaeny is okay - better than her character at least. Gorman and Day are solid but not as fun as before. Supporting cast don't make much of a mark, but the very obvious leaning of the cast and plot towards the Chinese market does at least provide the film with some external interest points (although it seems the attempt to maximize box office in China didn't pay off).For all its weakness, it is a solid enough distraction that delivers what you expected, even if it falls short of the original (which itself was not a hugely high bar). Distracting and noisy, but not too much more than that even if specific elements try hard.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Pacific Rim: Uprising feels like a sequel created by committee. It has enough satisfying robot action, but not enough to save it from standard character and plot","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4105577/?ref_=tt_urv","RforFilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv","26 March 2018","In the time between the previous Pacific Rim and the new sequel, I've gotten around to watching anime that had been it's inspiration such as Neon Genesis: Evangelion and Mobile Suit Gundam. I had previously said that the first Pacific Rim was only a monster movie homage (and it still is). Now that original director Guillermo Del Toro had just won his Oscar for The Shape of Water, I had to question my previous statement. I've come to see that the Japanese love seeing their world in a larger scope and what technology can bring to warfare. What makes a lot of this anime, and Pacific Rim interesting is that it shows how much something unknown would force a change to the world military and the definition of an enemy. As a character study, Pacific Rim is there to be a crowd-pleasing spectacle first. This doesn't mean the movie is bad (in fact, I named it as a favorite of 2014). This simply means that there's nothing wrong with liking a movie about mech-controlled robots fighting space monsters. It just so happened that Del Toro created a world that resembled that similar kind of anime that was appealing to a mainstream audience. Let's see if this story can continue is Pacific Rim: Uprising.It has been ten years since that Bridge between worlds have closed and the monsters are no longer a threat to Pacific Ocean based cities. A former Jaeger pilot Jake Pentecost (played by John Boyega) is living the life of steeling former mech parts on the black market. He's eventually captured, along with another Jaeger engineer teenager Amara (played by Cailee Spaeny). His adopted sister, now General Secretary Mako Mori tells him that he has the choice of either jail, or returning to China to the Jaeger program, now as an instructor.Jake takes to offer and comes back not just to train the younger Jaeger pilots with former copilot Nate Lambert (played by Scott Eastwood), but with the threat from Shao Corporation from wanting to replace the human run Jaegers with drones. Cailee, meanwhile, continues to work with the other candidates, who resent her since they worked hard to get in while she was plucked. When a rouge Jaeger attacks Sydney, the drones are approved of, with the supervision of Dr. Newton Geiszler (played by Charlie Day). The Jaeger pilots try to find out who was behind the rouge mech and to see if the Kaiju monsters have returned.The reason I brought up the anime earlier was to show how inspiration and homage can lead to a creative and original project like Pacific Rim. Pacific Rim: Uprising feels like that it's more or less, copying rather then taking inspiration. Guillermo Del Toro is replaced by Steven S. DeKnight, who is certainly trying to replicate the original. The problem isn't the robot battles, which while they take a while to get to, at least have a lot of great imagery. What falters is the script.A lot of the plot elements, the rebel told to reenlist, the teenage tough girl, the evil corporation; these all feel like elements from other franchise stories that we've already seen. Because they all take the typical routes, Pacific Rim: Uprising is lacking in surprise. The original movie may have not a lot of original characters either, at least knew that the plot was mainly to defeat the monsters. This tries to pass off as character driven, but comes off as being an obvious product written by committee. So it is disappointing that you have to sit through a lot of predictability before you get to the battles the trailers promise you.I'll certainly give credit to all the actors for trying their best. In fact, I may like John Boyega as a better lead then Charlie Huffman was before, as Boyega is more charismatic. It should come as no surprise that the script was written by four people, indicating that there was more of a focus on building a franchise rather then a genially good story. I don't have a problem with it as long as I was entertained, which I was, but it just takes too long to get to the good stuff.I'll give this six Kaiju brains out of tem. If your just looking for from giant monsters and robot fighting, then you'll probably be satisfied. This is your standard blockbuster, which I imagine will be fine for most people. It's just that since the first one was made by Guillermo Del Toro, my expectations were a lot higher. Take what you get and see if Pacific Rim: Uprising is enough to keep you entertained.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Jake lives for the hustle, finding and trading one item of value for another from cookies and cereal to parts from down Jaegers.Looting and operating parts from the former combat giants is very illegal but with the massive payout from their parts, the lure is too great for Jake to ignore. This pursuit leads him into trouble and reluctantly paired with young scrapper Amari Namani (Cailee Spaeny). Jake gets a choice of prison or returning to train Jaeger pilots as he is the son of the late hero Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), and naturally has many unresolved issues of sharing the name of the beloved hero.
Figuring training a class beats jail, Jake agrees to teach Amara and a new class of Jaeger pilots with his former rival Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood), and to say they still have issues with one another would be an understatement.
Despite this, training moves along as planned and Nate and Jake even work well enough to pilot a Jaeger at a ceremony that will usher in a new but controversial new age in protection for humanity.When an unexpected threat arrives and causes mass devastation and chaos, Jake and Nate must get to the bottom of the threat. As their investigation moves along a massive threat is discovered which pits them and their untested recruits against a threat old and new which threatens to end humanity.
What follows is a FX laden finale where cities are laid waste to and massive combatants engage is a truly impressive visual spectacleWhile ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" does use a familiar plot threads, it does so in an engaging way. The film does have a very basic plot and does not delve too much into character development and leaves some of the threads it opened unresolved. What it does have is a good amount of action after a slower than expected buildup. The action is visually appealing and exciting and delivers a much better experience than the last few ""Transformer"" films did. The cast works well with one another and it was nice to see Charlie Day and others from the first film return as Day always makes his scenes engaging.
While you may have a sense of seeing much of this before in giant monster and robot films, it is done in an appealing way. There is much of the film that you can see was clearly included to make sure the film appeals to audiences in China and Japan but in the new global film market, it is vital for films to do well in those markets, and with a film based in the Asian Pacific Rim, it only makes sense to do this. Eastwood and Boyega work well with one another and the finale opens the door wide open for a third film that looks like it would extend the franchise by taking things in a new and exciting direction.

Is he man enough for the task? Writer-director Steven S. DeKnight (Daredevil 2015 TV Series) with writers Emily Carmichael, Kira Snyder & T. S. Nowlin seem woefully unprepared for the task of bringing a cinematic project to the big screen. One of the biggest gaffes seen in Uprising is taking a solid plot and pumping it full of vacuous, episodic humor. In fact, the opening scene of Uprising is just as poorly made as the very last scene, which should surprise no one. Uprising shines when it comes to the giant robot Jaeger and Kaiju monster clashes, but beyond that, there's just not much there to recommend this movie. This sequel to the masterful Pacific Rim (2013) is not very good - which makes us wonder why we had to wait five years for it. Entertaining? Somewhat. Worth your time? Not hardly.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

"","","A spectacle for the ages","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4116676/?ref_=tt_urv","crybabystinkypoo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16720145/?ref_=tt_urv","4 April 2018","PACIFIC RIM 2: UPRISING cost 150 million USD; 40 million less than the first film but you wouldn't know it because the sequel's visually as good if not better. I don't understand the backlash; is it because Ron Perlman wasn't in it and Guillermo del Toro wasn't the director? Or is it because Uprising's Jaeger pilots are teenagers? It's a lighter, less serious film but that doesn't mean people should write it off as a kids film; thankfully the teenage aspect's reconcilled by a coming of age story, like Ender's Game (2013). If people want exactly the same film then watch the original. It's hard to be objective; people (myself incl.) like or dislike films for all sorts of reasons; depending what mood they're in or whether they went in with low or high expectations etc. But we should try to be objective, weigh everything up and judge a film on merit. And with Uprising I don't see why it isn't any less of a film than the original. I saw Pacific Rim at the movies in 2013; didn't love it/didn't hate it; actually the whole premise is kind of silly; monsters coming out of the earth's core and being fought by human made mechanical monsters. But the crowded cinema audience seemed impressed (there were only two people in the cinema when I saw Uprising; me and the other guy looking at his tablet). Rewatched the original in 2015 and reassessed: it's good. But I honestly think the sequel's as good if not better because the battles in the first film take place mostly at night or in the ocean or underwater, like at the end when they're sealing the breach. And the Kaiju attacking the cities during the day are only on screen for a bit and one of those snippets is in the bleak, gloomy rain: I wanted to see more sunny, daytime action; there was only a bit of that in the first film (most of which was a newsflash of Sydney, Australia being attacked). But in Uprising a lot of the action takes place in bright, sunny daylight. Uprising didn't make the mistake that e.g. Robocop 2 (1990) made i.e. A director (Irvin Kirschner) who openly admitted to not liking the original film and a composer (Leonard Rosenman) who also admitted to not liking the original score (which wasn't used anywhere in the sequel much to its detriment); the original Pacific Rim's theme music's retained as are most of the characters and like the first film Uprising has an emotional element but the cinematic aspect's taken to a new level. Pacific Rim 2: Uprising; does it have faults? Yes, like how could the whole of Tokyo's CBD be evacuated into underground shelters i.e. As if some civillians wouldn't have died while the Jaegers and Kaiju tear the city apart; this is also a moral dilemma that the original didn't explore either; should Jaeger pilots worry about civillians inadvertently being killed while they fight the Kaiju i.e. Delay engaging until everyone's out of harms way? Jaeger pilots are meant to be heroes but they're piloting mechanical monsters that are as potentially destructive as the Kaiju; I guess anyone that got caught in the crossfire is collateral damage but it's an issue neither film explores. Uprising's action packed (like the original) but it's less gloomy and subsequently seems more imaginative/more visual and faster paced. Uprising's good entertainment; it's a full throttle, awesome ride. 8/10.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Post credit scene? There is a ""beginning of credits"" scene.
If you haven't seen the first one, don't worry this movie gives you a quick recap in the first 60 seconds. At the same time, if you haven't seen the first one, watch it instead of these 111 minutes of giant ""Rock 'Em Sock 'Em"" robots.The first movie was not without its faults, but at least it was watchable. This sequel has none of the heart, emotion or intrigue that the first one had.What made the original film exciting and interesting was the newness of it all. It was a new take on the Kaiju genre. It was a new and interesting way to utilize giant robots. The aliens were cool. The doomsday anticipation was intense. The talent was impressive - Elba, Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Hunnam (as Mako Mori and Raleigh Becket respectively) were strong in their roles and helped viewers ignore any missteps the film made. And sadly, no sequel was ever going to be able to capture any of those things in the same manner. Even so, we expected more than the bad writing, hanging plot points, and poorly-developed characters and lackluster relationships that we got.Boyega is fairly believable as Elba's offspring - except for the fact that the character came literally out of nowhere. And while otherwise there's generally nothing wrong with his portrayal and he's decently charming, he alone does not have the Elba charm to carry a film surrounded by weak castmembers.Scott Eastwood (as Nate Lambert) is nothing more than a pretty face in the film. He doesn't fit his role as a soldier and commander and certainly doesn't play well off of Boyega in the role of frenemy/buddy. But the lack of chemistry doesn't stop there. Cailee Spaeny is quite impressive in her debut role as Amara Namani, yet the character ultimately falls flat due to the same lack of chemistry with Boyega. Her storyline basically amounts to a poorly copied reiteration of Mako's story from the original without any of the heart. And while the rest of the teen actors aren't necessarily bad, they are also not utilized much in the film, have zero backstories or character development and ultimately serve as nothing more than plot devices needed to drive robots. Even Charlie Day (as Dr. Newton Geiszler) failed to impress.There is one improvement from the first film and it is the cinematography. The fight scenes are beautiful to watch and are masterfully staged. Yet, without a half-decent plot, coherent dialogue or emotional stakes, they aren't worth the two minutes of occasional thrill. On top of that, this is the first film where we can actively say the sound mixing is genuinely treacherous - while the dialogue was nothing to write home about, we did want to hear it and that was made virtually impossible half of the time.Featuring: A female character that has no purpose except to facilitate an unnecessary love triangle that isn't even explored.","112 out of 210 found this helpful.

What somewhat makes up for this is a cast of characters that actually bring something to the table in this picture, in contrast to the last film which short of Idris Elba's rousing speech, was lacking in that department. John Boyega, channeling his star making turn in Attack the Block, is terrific, and the rest of the cast is solid. The movie had a nice amount of dry humor and wittiness to it as-well.But where the writers really shined in PR:U, is in the story, which manages to re-introduce the kaiju in a way that was consistent with the universe and wholly unexpected. I also really liked how the movie handled the bad-guys, as it didn't really let us know who the baddie was until late in the movie. It kept me on my toes, and I liked that. I also liked that, in keeping with the first film, this movie felt like a story that encapsulated the world, as the main players weren't just all Americans and brits. It's a very inclusive film universe, and never in an artificial way.What kept me from liking the movie more, was the unremarkable action choreography. Yes, the movie didn't look as good as the first, on balance, but it still looked damn good. But none of the action scenes really wowed me, and in a movie about humongous robots fighting ginormous monsters, that's pretty important. If you have access and money and time to spare, I would highly recommend seeing this in IMAX, on the biggest screen possible. The smaller the screen, in my opinion, the less enjoyable the viewing experience will be.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

I think the first Pacific Rim could be considered the latter. On one hand, completely silly and taking itself a little too seriously (much like the F&F films tend to do from time to time). On the other hand, it's visually spectacular with a few fun performances. However, I saw that film before I went to the movies around a hundred times a year. Now, I'm much more aware of the type of filmmaking that caters to audiences that don't care to see a well-strung story or a well-performed film, but rather, big robots fighting big monsters. That's what Pacific Rim: Uprising is. Although Steven DeKnight did a great job of running Daredevil season 1, there's really not much quality character depth or originality in the story at all here. In fact, the supporting characters and performances are some of the most bland and forgettable I have seen in any big budget movie in years. I don't pretend to be a huge fan of robot/monster films like the Godzilla or Transformers franchise (and I realize how annoying it may be for some to hear me compare this film to those) but this film is about as middle of the road as you can get. Let's not even talk about Scott Eastwood, who is somewhat likable because of his family tree, but it sure looks like the apple falls very very far away. There are simply some decisions made in this movie, whether that be acting, story, or visually, that are simply frustratingly pathetic. But hey, if you like to watch dumb robot/monster films then this one may be for you.4.7/10","13 out of 19 found this helpful.

Speaking of robots, they got introduced with grand sounding names ready for the toy market.Maybe I shouldn't have expected much. Boyega plays the same character he's played since he wrapped on Attack the Block. Scott Eastwood read his lines well.

The story is nonsensical and just goes all over the place, the characters are very poorly developed and written (what a pathetic waste of Mako), the soundtrack is forgettable (literally can't remember a single track), and the special effects, while up to standard with most Hollywood blockbusters, is definitely a step down from the original. The original Jeager cockpits and sets in general look a lot more realistic and interesting then this, which just feels rather cheap and generic, and the weight of the Jeagars and kaiju in the battles is lost, making this not feel like Pacific Rim in it's action sequences and instead feel like a Michael Bay Transformers movie. This feels like nothing more then an attempt by the studio to make a franchise that was started by a very passionate film into something that can be made for cheap, and it clearly shows.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Dare I say, I almost hated it. The second time I watched it, I appreciated the effort quite a bit more. What I liked: 1) The story makes sense, even if some of the moving parts don't. (See 1 and 2 of my dislikes.) 2) It does a good job of telling its own story while setting up the next film (I would suggest that the next be the last, for a fine trilogy). 3) Again, thumbs up for John Boyega. 4) I also liked the new Jaegers, especially Saber Athena. What I didn't like: 1) That love triangle. Yeesh! One of the best things about the first movie was the absence of any such nonsense. Please drop it if you make a third film. 2) I wish they hadn't given the female lead such a similar story and flashback (""drift"") scene to Mako's. Reusing scenes like that feels like a cheat and doesn't have the same impact the second time around. 3) O_o That awful, awful soundtrack. Pacific Rim's soundtrack gets me pumped. Uprising's so-called music?--takes me out of the action and makes me frown. Am I watching a Saturday morning cartoon or a Jaeger vs Kaiju movie?! Please, please get Ramin Djawadi back if you can, but by no means use any more of that noise I heard during Uprising!I do hope there's a third film with Boyega--and maybe a return of Charlie Hunnam's character--following through on the last scene of Uprising. But I also hope the third film will implement the changes I suggested above. ;-)","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Legendary focuses screen time on the robots and monsters which the original film hesitates to do. The audience engages more with this film because it doesn't have redundant slow sections like the original. Viewers immerse in the fights thanks to the beautiful visuals and powerful sound effects.The film gives mecha/kaiju genre fans the action, robots, and monsters they want. Casual viewers expect more from the plot, but don't understand that giant monster and robot fights are the main focus in this genre. The plot reminisce the fast pace plots from old school mecha anime. The film pays homage to the mecha style with teenagers and young adults as the main pilots. The film briefly explains the background of the large team for people to understand each members position.

Practically an embryonic Marvel universe, rife with creative potential.Would that Guillermo del Toro had turned to this existing mythos for 2013's PACIFIC RIM--he surely could have worked kaiju into his script somehow-if only in service of creating a viable franchise going forward. A Gundam adaptation, or merely inspiration, could easily have resulted in a sequel far more satisfying than watching talented actors squandered on Steven DeKnight's insulting hodgepodge of inept direction, incompetent story-telling, and encyclopedic list of rando cliches.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

The soundtrack was not that good in my opinion, the visuals were not nearly as stunning as the first one, and the story was very simple and felt like it was written by somebody who was just writing whatever came into their minds without trying to connect it all together. Ultimate thoughts, it's a popcorn flick and nothing more. If you are looking for monsters and robots battling it out and just pure action, you will enjoy this film.

This is a disservice to the first film aimed at 2 groups of people: kids, and the Chinese audiences.There are so many things wrong with this movie that I dont even know where to start. Basically if you are, or have, kids or young teens you/they might like this, or if you're a Chinese person in China, you might like this. Its not even good as a dumb popcorn flick. I kept wanting to bail on this movie but I stuck it out if only to warn others. It is basically a live-action cartoon with every trope you could think of.

After finally seeing the long-awaited sequel Uprising by Steven S. DeKnight, I felt like that movie had more in common with the forgettable modern versions of Transformers and Power Rangers of recent years. There were times it really did feel like this movie was filmed by Transformers's Michael Bay based on the sense of humour and the plot but minus the overabundance of explosions and racial stereotypes. It would make sense since DeKnight was once a part of the writer's room for Michael Bay's Transformers cinematic universe.The original's rich anime-style that was brought to life by Del Torro's focus for eye-popping colour and dirty detail is gone. Instead the scenes are blandly lit in regular daytime with not enough dirt and too much cleanliness to recreate the lived-in feel it once had. The film focuses more on the use of Jaeger technology after the war but sacrifices exploring most of the unique lovecraftian creature elements. DeKnight's story choices either alter or ignore the more interesting parts of the original's mythology for a conventional, blander plot. And it felt like a lot of the times it was a disservice to what came before.The use of the characters is a hit-or-miss depending how you view them. John Boyega gives the charm, charisma and depth in his performance that this film was lacking (which probably helped by the fact he was a producer on it). As the one improvement from the first film, Boyega as the late Stacker Pentacoast's estranged son Jake brings more leading power then what Charlie Hunman ever did. Another standout is breakout star Cailee Spaeney as the Jaeger pilot recruit Amara. However, it's a shame that these two interesting leads are mostly paired with boring side characters. They range from Scott Eastwood's overly serious and dull Nate Lambert to the other forgettable Jaeger recruits. These recruits become nothing more then Pacific Rim's equivalent of glorified red shirts that would be killed off in a Star Trek episode. The use of Charlie Day's character Newt felt the most problematic. In the original, you could see Del Torro's love and fascination for monster biology being injected into the levity Day brought. With Uprising, Newt becomes more of the annoying guy you would find in a Michael Bay film. Without giving away spoilers, the plot does explain his change in character but it felt like it was a creative choice that didn't payoff. It feels also insulting that Rinko Kikuchi's return to her role as Mako has such short screen-time and does not give her much to do at all.It took a while for me to get used to DeKnight's swifter and quicker fighting style for the more advanced Jaegers. The big city-destroying battles are not as terrible or disjointed like Transformers but they lack the sense of awe, wonder and creativity Del Torro put effort into crafting. The closest Uprising ever gets to resembling the original is the last half-hour with the Jaegers assembling in Japan to take on the new groups of Kaiju. But even then the battles don't give enough time or attention to show off the Kaiju's personality and abilities. As a big monster fan, I would have preferred the Kaiju to have been better used.While Guillermo Del Torro is credited as a producer, there is nothing of his love for monsters, robots and world building I can feel in this inferior sequel. It is also dissapointing since I like what Steven S. DeKnight brought to TV in the past with Spartecus and Daredevil season 1. Unfortunately his debut into film feels so forgettable. If one good came out of this aside from John Boyega getting a non-Star Wars big franchise role, it allowed Del Torro the time to create his Academy Awarding-winning fishman movie The Shape of Water.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I was a bit fan of the first movie and always hoped for a sequel, how disappointed I was with this follow up. Apparently the first one didn't do great, so I guess I should just be glad this one got made at all.
Certainly more a kids film this time around, a mix of Transformers and Power Rangers.
The casting wasn't the best, John Boyega was frankly just awful in it. I think John was brought in to add the humour and ""street"" element to it, missed the mark big time on both.

Despite being a sequel, the world of the movie is set in a completely different universe with very little to no relation or connection to the original classic. Overall, this movie undoes and destroys everything about the original. The whole movie is a Rehash of the first film with a heavy addition of forced humor, childish jokes, and dialogue that is exactly what people who don't like Marvel Movies think all the dialogue in Marvel movies is like. Filled with Cheap heavily Lit CGI spectacles and characters that look like five feet tall toy action figures, with no focus or development at all on character, story, and importantly realism. All aspects that were very strong in the first film. Furthermore, there are some features that may entertain. It is a giant robots vs giant alien monsters movie, so if your interested in those things this could be worth a watch for you. But if your looking for a good Sci-fi action flick with good characters, development, writing, etc. I recommend you avoid this. Especially if your a big fan of the first Pacific Rim you will definitely loathe this movie. Personally, I couldn't make it through watching the whole movie because the acting and dialogue in this is really bad. However, Children will definitely enjoy this it's a movie geared towards kids. On a final note, this sequel dropped the ball big time, with all that was established from the first movie. I really believe the artists and filmmakers behind the making of this misunderstood the property they were working on, as well as the audiences they had. Which is really unfortunate since this property has a really great, interesting, inspiring, cool, world and concept. Hopefully there will be better fortune if any for ""Pacific Rim"" movies in the future. Because this somewhat of a sequel is a downgrade beyond a joke.

"6","/10","As long as all you're looking for is fun and thrilling robots-versus-monsters spectacle, this straightforward blockbuster of a sequel should do fine","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4100472/?ref_=tt_urv","moviexclusive","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23415028/?ref_=tt_urv","22 March 2018","With all due respect to newly minted Academy Award winning director Guillermo del Toro, his 2013 love letter to Ray Harryhausen and Ishiro Honda's monster films was an all-too self-serious affair that took the fun out of watching giant robots fight against giant monsters. So as admirable as del Toro's intent of injecting dramatic heft with the concept of 'drifting' (i.e. where pairs of pilots gain intimate knowledge of each other's memories and feelings in order to operate the neural load of one of them giant mechas known as 'Jaegers') may be, the movie just wasn't as fun as it should have been, which was probably one of the reasons why it underwhelmed at the US box office.How much you love Steven S. DeKnight's continuation of that universe depends on how much you were in love with del Toro's empathy metaphor as well as his tone of sobriety. Indeed, much as one of the lead characters - namely, the teenage orphan Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny) - has to overcome her own traumatic loss of her family in order to properly pilot a Jaeger, there is much less emphasis here on the so-called psychic link that the pair of pilots have to forge in order to 'drift'. At the same time, DeKnight and his three co-screenwriters have opted for a much lighter tone throughout, which is evident not only in the wry banter that the characters engage in but also in almost all of its robots-versus-monsters brawls now take place in the brightness of day (than the darkness of night).Truth be told, 'Pacific Rim Uprising' is a lot more straightforwardly entertaining than its predecessor. Compared to the wounded survivors of the previous movie, our hero is here a roguish slacker Jake Pentecost (John Boyega) - who, for what it's worth, is the son of Idris Elba's martyr hero Stacker - happily passing his days partying and selling parts from decommissioned Jaegers on the black market. On one of his scavenger hunts, he runs into fellow scrounger Amara, who is collecting parts for her own DIY Bumblebee-like Jaeger creation named Scrapper. Given a choice between jail and service when arrested, Jake opts to join his former partner Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood) to train a new generation of Jaeger pilots at the Pan Pacific Defense Force's new Chinese headquarters, while Amara chooses to enlist as one of his cadets.Like we alluded to earlier, character isn't so much a priority here as it was in del Toro's 2013 original, so it doesn't go much further with the new additions than Jake as a reluctant hero with outsider cool, Nate as a square-jawed duty-bound soldier and Amara as a Jaeger fanatic whom Jake will come to personally mentor. Fans of the original will welcome the return of some of the surviving characters - including Jake's half sister Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) and the two vaudevillian scientists Dr Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Dr Hermann Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) - and be heartened to know that they are important pieces in the narrative puzzle.Without giving away too much, let's just say that there is a good conspiracy woven in that has to do with a rival drone project led by tech tycoon Shao Liwen (Jing Tian) of the shadowy Shao Foundation as well as the leftovers of the 'kaiju' from the earlier apocalyptic-cancelling battle fought a decade ago. Uncovering the puppet master behind a rogue Jaeger is what brings Jake and Nate on a globe-trotting mission from Sydney to Siberia and finally to Tokyo, the last of which is also where the climactic battle with a trio of Category 4 and 5 'kaijus'. Besides being utterly befitting of the cultural origins of the 'kaijus', the cross-country trek also adds freshness to the stream of nicely choreographed CG destruction.Oh yes, the very raison d'etre for most audiences of the 'Pacific Rim' universe is really to witness mountain-sized robots and monsters punching each other, and DeKnight satisfies that desire for spectacle by pulling off some impressive, even jaw-dropping, shots of mayhem. There are two mano-a-manos between the Gypsy Danger 2.0 that Jake and Nate pilots and the aforementioned rogue Jaeger of pure gleaming steel, the first in downtown Sydney and the next on the ice in Siberia; and the piece de resistance is no doubt the showdown in central Tokyo that sees three 'kaijus' transform into a mega-'kaiju' (much like how the Power Rangers 'zods' combine into a Megazod). To his credit, DeKnight eschews the nausea-inducing cinematography of the 'Transformers' franchise, so you can see the battles in their full glory; notwithstanding, there is no shaking off the feeling that the fights don't feel as epic as they ought to be, even coming off cartoony at times.And so, while del Toro's franchise opener was probably too sombre for its own good, this sequel pivots quite drastically to the other extreme, thereby diminishing the stakes involved as well as the gee-whiz grandeur. We do wish there were more personality to the Jaegers though, apart from being the one with the electric whip or the 'gravity slings' or the plasma swords. That said, it is engaging in a fun way which the original never was, in huge part due to Boyega's infectious charisma as well as his spontaneous chemistry with his co-stars Spaeny and Eastwood. The action too is frequently thrilling, and the visual effects work top-notch. If only it had more edge and threat, as well as more personality, this 'Uprising' would indeed be worthy of its title.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

"","","Ready For Actin Packed War, Needs Repairs for Story As A Whole","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4101213/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","23 March 2018","Giant Robots or Giant Monsters, which of the two titans is the better combatant for the silver screen? That question has continued to test audience members discussion boards as behemoths like King Kong and Godzilla try to usurp the title from Optimus Prime and Megatron. Tonight's movie though, doesn't make you choose, because it combines the two in an epic throw down that will hopefully please both sides of the spectrum. Pacific Rim Uprising rears back to make some noise this weekend, and yours truly is here to report his findings on the latest silver screen smash to guide your viewing needs. Let's get started!LIKES:Special Effects: Most will be tired of the CGI haven these movies have become, but yours truly appreciates the work that went into unleashing the havoc. The design of the new robots gets a round of applause, with sleek angular designs, some new tricks, and a fluid movement that fit well with the Japanese monster movie feel. Monster wise, the Kaijou aren't as prominent as the first film, but once breached, the monsters have got their own unique design that is odd, but again fitting in theme, with movements that again work with the pace of the movie. And of course, all the lights, punches, and collapsing buildings are beautifully brought to life in all their dazzling, speaker rustling greatness. The Story: While certainly not the best to grace the screen, the movie's predictable plot has a few twists and spins on the mix to keep things interesting. In a movie where smashing and fights are the key, you don't always get the deepest tale, but it works in explaining what happened in the ten years and the whole grand design of the plot. Unlike its predecessor, the movie managed to cut off a lot of fat to present this in a neat, less than 2-hour, package. As such, you have all the elements to put a reason behind the fighting and keep as many characters as involved. The Acting: Believe it or not, the acting is a step up from other films in this genre. The main stars of John Boyega, Scott Eastwood, and Cailee Spaeny all work in that dysfunctional family united by challenging times way. Still, they all manage to bring some power to otherwise simple characters that are semi-engaging to watch. Of all of them... I think Boyega gets my vote for having the best acting of all, being pushed across all realms to make a balanced character. As for Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, they are the comedic relief and do it well, but also manage to have some involvement in the story (nice directing) and not trying to sell themselves anyway. The Action: I've gone through all the stuff you might care about, but let's face it, this series is more known for its action and that's what you want. Well, for this reviewer it a step up compared to the first installment. Timing the movie, about 70% of the film involved some type of action, a majority involving the metallic behemoths fighting one giant obstruction after another. The battles have more variety than part 1, managing to help one differentiate one battle from another. What makes me even happier to report, is that the team listened to reviews and actually utilized their other robots more, instead of dropping them out in five minutes flat. While still not the greatest utilization of secondary robots, it was miles better for me in the long run, making the last 30 minutes of the movie, an action-packed climax to close the story out. 
DISLIKES:The Comedy at Times: The movie is ridiculous, I get it, but the comedy sometimes is a little too ridiculous and distracting from the overall tone of the movie. A random aside here and there works, but when over utilized as it is in this film, well...then it gets rusty and breaks down. In addition, there are some asides that felt awkward at the moment they chose to unleash it, jumping in amidst the action scenes when they would have fit in other realms. These culminations weren't my favorite use of comedic relief, as I think it crossed into corniness a few times. Shallow Character Development: Monster movies are seldom about our main characters growing a lot, but we've had previous installments capable of achieving this balance. Pacific Rim Uprising is not one of these movies. While Boyega's Jake has a little more complexity in terms of everyone knowing him, the rest of the cast have less depth to them past a few traumatic backstories to garnish them up. This is highly evidenced in the other pilots outside the main crew who after getting named are reduced to the shadows given the grand complexity of the film. Uprising proves too busy to invest in its characters, but most may not care as long as they get a good smashing. Obsidian Fury: As cool as the name and design, I had hoped the new bot would have more point to it, but this is again where the movie fails on at least a story level. The antagonizing robot brings a pretty epic fist fight, but plot wise it felt out of place, a tangent leading down a path that was as cold as the artic frontier it somewhat takes place in. Yes, there are some purposes it serves, but as the movie's plot progresses, its relevance became less and less for me, until it was just a convenient distraction. Trailer Syndrome: One thing this day of advertising is famous for, is revealing too much in shorter movies like this. Pacific Rim Uprising's biggest spoiler is that much of that awesome last battle has already been shown in the trailers. Catch all three of the trailers and you pretty much have pieced 75% of that sequence, with the other 25% feeling very nostalgic/overdramatic. I had hoped for some more dynamic moments to bypass that syndrome, or less advertising, but I didn't get my wish again. So, avoid the trailers and you'll be okay. The VERDICT:
 Pacific Rim Uprising doesn't pretend to be anything other than a monster/robot movie. It gives you the CGI thrills, spills, and chills in terms of design and the sound editing beautifully complements it. While the story is not the deepest, it works for the most part, allowing plenty of time to cram in the action you oh so wanted to see. Yet, the movie still has to work on its balance learning to not cram so much into the film and maximize on elements that the movie is going to be known for. In addition, stop revealing everything in the trailers and it means less elaborate scenes you have to shoot to make up for it. So, looking for a monster vs. robot's movie? Look no further, because this film is a success in terms of the action and big battles that are theater worthy. As a film as a whole though, the movie still has a lot of repairs to make, before it becomes war ready. Oh well, we at least have a soundtrack to get you revved up. My scores:

The acting is very satisfying. Tian Jing has a much more important role than she got in Kong: Skull Island and she delivered, to the surprise of many who have been bad-mouthing about her acting all these years. She should be given more credit and respect for her effort.

It was loud, dumb and yet strangely well-shot for an out and out B-movie (something to do with its very-talented director, Guillermo Del Toro). It had its flaws, but it was still enormous fun. So my hopes were high for 'part II.' However, the reviews came in and they weren't overly-positive. And yet, my hopes remained high. I shouldn't have got excited.The original told the tale of a breach in the ocean floor which allowed giant monsters to enter our world. The humans' response was to - believe it or not - create giant robots to beat them into submission (please ignore the fact that our military apparently couldn't defeat the monsters on their own, but never mind). Part II starts showing the devastation caused by the battles along coastal cities. A young girl (no more than 13?) has lived all her life among the ruins and has - somehow - managed to scavenge enough parts to build herself a fully-functional giant robot. She can pilot this on her own and out manoeuvre full-trained soldiers in their own mechs.This all occurs within about the first ten minutes and I found this whole situation just a little hard to suspend my disbelief for. Unfortunately, this small nugget of the plot basically sums up the entire film. I could spend quite a long time listing one totally unbelievable plot point after the next. I know the whole story is over-the-top, but the fact that it turns out that soldiers are no longer used to pilot the robots; instead a bunch of kids are trained up. Why? Who knows. You just have a teen-kid movie where they fight in robots and has one unbelievable story element after the next.It's not all bad. John Boyega is very watchable as the lead. It's just who's around him that brings the whole thing down. The film does its best to expand on the original idea and, for that, it succeeds. Plus the battles are as fun (and the final fight is truly awesome!). However, my main gripe is that just this film is probably going to be appreciated more by youngsters than hardened cynical cinema veterans such as myself. I'm sure I'd have loved this if I was a twelve-year-old boy and then gone out and bought the toy. Oh, yeah, that girl's 'build-your-own-robot' is annoyingly cute and looks a bit like 'Bumblebee' from the 'Transformers' franchise. I think they want you to not just watch the film, but also buy the toys. I won't be doing that. And, if Part III does get made (maybe) I'll wait for this one to appear on Netflix.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Guillermo Del Toro's (GDT) Pacific Rim created an awesome universe with subtle details about the past that kept the audience guessing and theorizing about things not explicitly elucidated in the movie. I don't think GDT expected to create a universe, I would guess that his idea was to make a stand alone monster movie with sufficient justification for the characters actions. This is why I think they (producers, directors, the head people) shouldn't have excavated Pacific Rim. Or at least not in the cheap way that they did. Overall, this movie is forgettable. I honestly don't remember half of what happened and I'm a fan. The dialogue isn't special; sometimes preachy and naive. The characters were weak; I didn't care if any of the new characters turned into paste. The only character I cared about in this movie was a continuing main character from the last movie. The visual affects are spot-on for a well lit monster fight and that's expected for a $150 million movie. But the setting for these fights were too giddy for my taste. In the first movie, most of the fights were in semi lit conditions and in water, you could make out what was happening and the fear that something might jump up out of the water was palpable. In Uprising, the fights take place in concrete jungles during the daytime; you can see the Jaeger's with all their power fight these beastly Kaiju. Lots of distruction, mayhem, trite team rallying, and just basic comic book style fights. There was also a stark tonal shift on this movie; this is not the dreaded and dark Pacific Rim setting, it's relaxed and sporadically attempts humor. I guess this is the movie telling us that everything is sunnier now, and this negates the intensity attached to any monster-action movie.Now that they've rebooted Pacific Rim and hinted at more movies in the future, I hope they at least expand Kaiju and Jaeger mythology if anything.I watched all the trailers and kept up with the hype and lore. The movie's main plot points arent revealed in the trailers but the reason most of us will go to watch Uprising, the action, is. Uprising is exactly what you expect it to be. A monster movie with above-aversge fights and nothing else. I knew this before going in, but I left disappointed because Uprising felt like a clear money grab.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I knew this simply would be a meditation in spectacular action sequences, and in that aspect I enjoyed it. The beginning is slow and I found myself waiting for the cliched (will discuss in second paragraph) story to be over so I could enjoy the amazing action battles. And the massive action scenes were very enjoyable, entire cities destroyed, bad ass robots fighting giant alien creatures while smashing into skyscrapers. I enjoyed all of that thoroughly and the last half of the film was chock full of visually pleasing action. But nearly everything other than that was either average, sup-par, or cliched.So for the story, many aspects half been done before and now have become cliches. Son of the greatest fighter also shows much potential but gets kicked out for being a maverick, only to return wen the agency needs a maverick, and will he live up to his fathers ultimate service. I've seen this over and over again and felt no interest in the framing story. The acting was a combination of averagely good acting combined with some not so good acting. For the most part acting was average with a couple good performances and a couple of pretty bad performances. I also found some of the plot lines/points to be unnecessary but I won't reveal them because they are spoilers. All in all, if you enjoyed the first, you will enjoy this one.","45 out of 88 found this helpful.

It looked remarkably unspectacular, and the annoying repetition of that 2Pac song did not help. The first film was just okay. I'll say this over and over, Guillermo Del Torro is a fantastic visual filmmaker, but his films plots are always lacking. That was the case for Pacific Rim. Seeing that he departed and his script for the sequel was revised left me with less hope for this film. As it is though, I have seen it. Its about what I expected quality wise but it gets the basic job of delivering giant monster vs robot action.The film follows the son of Stacker Pentecost, Jake (played by John Boyega). He is a former Jaeger pilot and is taken back into piloting Jaeger's when a threat of rogue Jaegers and new Kaiju re-surfaces. He also befriends a young girl named Amara, who is quick to learn how to maneuver a Jaeger. Just attempting to summarize the plot of this film was painful since the terminology sounds so dumb. Basically, it follows the events of the first film ten years later.Robot v monster action is on point. Its the least we expected and we got it. The action scenes are fun enough. I didn't really care for so much back story of characters so the character involvement and the ""human element"" of the film was not very interesting. The film is quite bland outside. Charlie Day returns in the film and is part of a plot point that I thought was kind of dumb. The story isn't anything groundbreaking but its not like this was expected. I also can't get into the universe of the Jaeger robots. They all look the same to me, and I can't remember their special names.This is at least a much more entertaining version of the last two Transformers films. Its also more coherent in its action and story, which really isn't hard to do. Its a good enough fil debut for a director taking the reigns from a well established filmmaker. I know the film series is attempting to build another film. I'd rather not but its not really in my control. I'll tune in but I hope for a massive turnaround.5.5/10","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I didn't really like the first ""Pacific Rim"" and that one had the creative vision on one of my favourite directors, Guillermo Del Toro behind it. It's perhaps not that surprising then that I didn't really enjoy ""Uprising"" either. There are plus points over the original, it doesn't have Charlie Hunnam in it, for one thing... which improves matters no end. His replacement is John Boyega, whose natural wit and charm makes him a compelling character, even if he's sometimes crudely pasted into a role that clearly wasn't the original idea. Boyega is Jake Pentegor son of Idris Elba's Stacker, sacrificial hero of the original. Having flunked out of Jaeger school, he's drawn back in when the law catches up to him. He rejoins just as the pilot scheme is in danger of being replaced with fully automated robots, that it until one goes rogue and attacks the remaining bases that a in the process of being decommissioned. From then on it's just ""Power Rangers"" with a bigger budget. It's actually pretty impressive how boring they've managed to make a film about giant fighting robots. Part of the problem is that the film talks about the characters and Jaeger's as if you're naturally supposed to know or care about them. They engage in consequence free/ damage free fighting (until the plot requires) until the films end. Admittedly, I did like the development involving Charlie Day's character, that was at least a little bit unexpected . . . but beyond that it's a tepid lifeless experience that you'll have forgotten before you've left the cinema.","22 out of 40 found this helpful.

Fights on a scale almost never before seen and breathtaking monsters. Unfortunately, recreating those same aspects in a sequel loses its impact. In the first Pacific Rim, the Jaegers were breathtaking; in PR: Uprising, they were just there. The Kaijus became just another monster instead of unfathomable beasts of mystery. PR: Uprising lacked emotion and sense of worry and dread the first one gave me. The one bright spot for me was that you're still watching giant robots fight Godzilla sized monster, which can be entertaining. Overall, PR: Uprising had its moments but you're not missing much if you decide to pass on it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Makers, r u listening?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4174281/?ref_=tt_urv","Chimar99","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur88495719/?ref_=tt_urv","22 May 2018","My first review here, seriously had it with IMDB'ers bashing of movies.Yeah, this movie has kids, but so what? At least the first half makes good use of them. Expect the second half to be cheesy.The action however is good and John Boyega puts a solid performance - at the very least he is comfortable with himself. Scott Eastwood is good too, but I think he will do better in tougher roles - my brain almost tricked me into seeing Clint Eastwood in a few scenes. Yep, he has inherited his father's looks and also tends to play like him every so often. The girl (Cailee), too, delivers a solid performance.I LOVED the way these Jaegers have been designed - Much more sophisticated compared to the first movie. They look and fight like badasses for a ""kids movie"" (the main Jaeger and the rogue one). The fights with the rogue Jaeger are definitely well done - 9/10 for that alone.As a man, I am naturally drawn to hardcore but involving action and adrenaline. That is how I de-stress every so often. Movies requiring more thought can be put off for other times. If you can digest some of the cheesiness and get over the fact that there are a lot of kids in this one, I recommend you give it a try to unload the stress at the end of the day, have a laugh or two, and enjoy decent action.Are the MAKERS listening?I am a marketing consultant, and like in my field, I genuinely hope the makers of all films come on IMDB and read the reviews every so often, at least the sensible ones.... or am I being naive? The story in here could have been improved upon big-time, the cheesiness discarded (for example: Boyega's character conveniently concludes the Jaeger's intended destination, kids suddenly are in-charge and fight better than the veterans who go down like ninepins, not much depth in how the story unfolds, etc.), more justice can be done to the original theme - Jaegers with sophisticated weaponry beating the heck out of equally defiant Kaijus in hard won and believable fights, as well as some mature emotional drama and loss.This movie doesn't know what audience it is targeting.Seems like in order to get kids onboard, you are turning away your main audience - mostly guys like myself here from the first movie.Hollywood, out with the cheesiness!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I thought the first installment was a good movie - very entertaining and visually impressive. It wasn't great, but at least quite good. This film, however, attempts to complicate its own story with absurd twists and plot points that it trips on its own creations. The dialogue falls flat, and barely any characters are fleshed out. After walking out of the cinema, I couldn't even remember a single name from the newcomers because no character stood out as interesting or compelling. There is room for enjoyment in this film (especially when robots are fighting Kaijus or hostile robots or Kaiju-robots), but the audience's detachment from the protagonists of the film makes the experience a passable one. The cinematography is nothing special, often sloppy. The visual effects are quite good most of the time (except for some very obvious green screens), yet it doesn't quite capture the magic of the first. The action sequences are mostly forgettable, and doesn't live up to what its predecessor has established. Overall, this film is a total disappointment.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's not like the original was a brilliant and subtle arthouse movie about the depths of the human condition. It was a very average popcorn flick cobbled together from table scraps of much better sci fi universes with non of the moral issues, religious themes and philosophic concepts that made them interesting. Without the inexplicable clout of director del Toro's name I highly doubt it would have received the universal acclaim it got. Beyond some fun world building it was nothing more than a bad episode of Power Rangers. Too serious to work as a comedy, too silly to work as dramatic sci-fi. Pacific Rim Uprising on the other hand is like a good episode of Power Rangers.
It shares a lot of the same weaknesses as the first one ( I really hesitate to call it the ""original"") but personally I found the main characters more likable and relatable. The story albeit nothing spectacular was a bit more intriguing than big robot fight big monster boom and it didn't overstay its welcome. Please Hollywood keep your schlock under two hours. You're not writing Lord of the Rings here.
As a fun popcorn movie this is alright. Way more watchable than its predecessor, not plagued with as much visual noise during the action scenes and with no pretense of being anything more than pure entertainment. Admittedly all the destruction and chaos it puts on the screen has zero impact on the viewer and you can see every piece of conflict and character development coming from a mile away but that's just how modern blockbusters operate.On a sidenote: stop hating on John Boyega. Yeah he's pretty limited but his character in the recent Star Wars movies is so underwritten not even Daniel Day Lewis could make it work.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The storyline picks up years after the events of the first film, with strange occurrences prompting the need for Jaeger pilots once again. The son of Idris Elba's character from the original and a former classmate must lead a new unit to confront threats to the planet.Directed by Steven S. DeKnight in his directorial debut, the film stars John Boyega (Star Wars: The Force Awakens), Scott Eastwood (Suicide Squad), Charlie Day (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia), Burn Gorman (The Dark Knight Rises), and Jing Tian (Kong: Skull Island).While the storyline is just sufficient to maintain interest, Pacific Rim: Uprising introduces cool new bots, monsters, and enjoyable characters. The cast delivers solid performances, and the special effects remain impressive. The monster battles are engaging, and a worthwhile twist awaits at the end.

How can you go wrong with such a movie, one can think. The plot however is extremely incoherent and thin. The lead actors are not charismatic and comes off as B actors. The cadets looked like straight from a disney movie or something. The villain was quite cliche. The asian actors have more charisma than the entire crew put together, they should have given them more screentime. Choreography and the CGI of the fighting scenes were done badly, but for the most part of the movie, that is what people wanted to see, mechanical robots fighting, it delivers on that part, but eventually you get numb with all that destruction to the point you don't feel any urgency when buildings get smashed and there are potential civilians inside that might get killed, you just don't care anymore. The first movie was excellent, but the second one is not memorable at all.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

The speed of the movie is off it starts ok then slows down for a long period then speeds up again. For a movie like this it needed to be shorter.But the graphics were good and the battle scenes (what few there were) were what I was expecting.

That being said, Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018) does a pretty good job of continuing the story that came to a mostly definitive end in Pacific Rim (2013). Unfortunately, it looks like they also took a play out of Independence Day: Resurgence (2016) and have teased at a further sequel past Uprising.I will admit that some sequels like Pacific Rim: Uprising have an easier time advancing the plot of the story since most of the exposition has been covered in the previous movie. There was certainly a creative and natural twist that helped bring back the Kaiju so that audiences could see giant robots fight them again. It was also fun to watch these Jaegers battle, much like we all enjoy the clashes between superheroes to see who is stronger (a la Captain America: Civil War (2016)). Even so, there was still something ""off"" about Uprising, and I think I know what it was.In the original Pacific Rim, most of the characters were unique and had clear goals and motivations. However, in Uprising, there is certainly less of that. John Boyega's Jake Pentecost didn't chew on the scenery for nearly long enough, merely falling into line when the danger became apparent. Scott Eastwood's performance was also equally distracting, especially with how much he resembles his father. While Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) was an empowering female character in Pacific Rim, Jules Reyes (Adria Arjona) seemed to be merely thrown in for ill-defined sexual tension. I also wasn't wild with the Ender's Game-esque addition of teenage pilots either. Still, the promise of Kaiju/Jaeger fights was satisfied.An adequate sequel that delivers on the action expected of it, I give Pacific Rim: Uprising 3.0 stars out of 5.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, the sequel falls up short in all of those areas, and yet it is still a satisfying Sci-fi action movie that isn't as well received as other similar movies.On its own, Scott Eastwood and John Boyega do a good job carrying the film and doing the best of what they've been given. The set pieces are well executed, unique and exciting with a focus on Jaeger on Jaeger (robot) action that was sorely lacking from the first entry. The Visual FX are still impressive as the scale and dimensions are well represented. There's also a nice twist in the film that was hard to see coming.This is a solid movie that is well worth a watch for Sci-fi action and Giant Robot lovers.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Various reviews called it ""disappointing,"" and ""a waste of time"". Well, I watched it anyway, and I think those reviews played a big role in how much fun I had watching it.Pacific Rim: Uprising has some cliché plot elements, some badly delivered dialogue, and some jokes that fall flat, but none of that stopped me from having a great time the whole way through. The action is visually appealing and clear/easy to watch, the characters were relatable, and nothing was jarring enough to take me out of the movie. This film also did a great job creating actual danger for the protagonists, which kept things fresh and interesting. If anything, I thought including a teenager as one of the main characters might backfire, but her performance was actually quite good. I'm also a big fan of Charlie Day, and as expected, he was fantastic. His inability to speak Mandarin was a hilarious callback to It's Always Sunny.Overall, I went into Uprising expecting it to be absolutely awful, and it was far better than that. That allowed me to experience the fun, which this film consistently delivers. Not that the whole thing is perfect, or that there aren't improvements to be made, but I'm more than pleased with what I got.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was more of a fun movie than the original, as I'm sure it was meant to be. I enjoyed it, perhaps as much as the first, but in a different, fun kind of way.Usually a sequel is aiming to be just good enough to support a third movie. This sequel did its job.

Del Toro effortlessly achieved that in the original, this sequel however just made too many bad decisions to be classed as enjoyable. Ten years after the war from the previous film, a group of young jaeger cadets must rapidly learn how to control their machines in order to prevent the kaijus from destroying the world...again. Ohhh but if only it was that simple. We have four screenplay writers, with DeKnight also directing. They somehow turned a simple popcorn blockbuster into a stupid mindless mess that is plagued with horrendous plot choices. Honestly, this script was diabolical. No hyperbole, no over exaggeration. Just. Pure. Stupidity. The unfunny humour was forced into every scene in an attempt to establish personalities. The amount of exposition was enough to make the kaijus savagely tear each other apart. However most regrettably, the story was painfully woeful. A primary antagonist, really? A small group of teenagers are tasked with saving the world? Come on! It's like 'Power Rangers' fondled with 'Transformers' and somehow gave birth to this. Too much of the runtime was spent dabbling into corrupted drone jaegers and not enough attention was given to the kaijus. Charlie Day...I mean, I can see the Golden Raspberry nomination now. Awful awful awful! Plus, not enough Kikuchi, which is a crime in itself. The third act was the saving grace of this mess. Why? Because that's what people paid to see. Destruction, chaos, colossal fights with an inventive arsenal of weaponry...it's what dreams are made of kids. The sound editing was phenomenal, the technological noises of the plasma cannon and gravity sling was music to my ears. After you wait an hour and thirty minutes, you get the film you truly deserve. But everything else was boring, dull and stupid. Cute that they gave Boyega a lacklustre speech, and also cute that they've left it open for a sequel...","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A Sequel With More Robots and Major Fights","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4100078/?ref_=tt_urv","MichaelNontonMulu","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68722929/?ref_=tt_urv","22 March 2018","This was a sequel of the film that I quite enjoyed back in 2013 , but with mostly different characters. I believe it would be best to see the first movie before seeing this one to understand better on the war history plus the plot involving those characters. My personal view of the movie was it had a lot more action compared to the prequel. If you are a fan of those Jaeger fights in that movie, you would be amazed with the major screen time involving these fights. Especially since there were exciting Jaegers like Gypsy Avenger, Bracer Phoenix, Guardian Bravo and Saber Athena. Those fight scenes were totally amazing and intense and those who love to see big robots fight against other robot and big monsters should be satisfied.The special visual effects of the Jaeger fights were totally awesome and looked amazingly real to me, obviously with a major budget of USD 150 million, it was really worth it. The sound effects of Dolby Atmos was very good, though at times (during conversations among the pilots in the Jaeger, sounded a bit too loud and seemed broken). And seeing those big robots and monsters in a large studio was certainly the right choice as it gave the feeling the robots were really enormous. I think seeing this in IMAX would be a lot better.Aside from those cool actions and special effects, the plot itself was not really great. John Boyega was able to portray his character brightly and he was surprisingly very charming and looked to have fun in here. Newcomer Cailee Spaeny was not bad either, while Scott Eastwood was pretty standard and not spectacular. The disappointing part would be the rest of the Cadets (and the supporting characters) whom I think did not have sufficient screen time to give us any sense of closeness and empathy towards them, including Jing Tian whose character felt a bit out of place. And the plot of Kaiju's re-appearance was probably a bit too short which did not give adequate room to absorb & understand. Maybe because the movie was not long enough as it was not even 2 hours including the very long end credit scenes duration to appreciate those wonderful visual artists.The movie also had some fun light moments, as well as the emotional moment in the middle which affected my wife a bit. It may not win the critics heart, but for my wife and I who love to see this kind of action movie, we thought it was intense, pretty awesome and we can still have fun by disregarding some of the obvious flaws mentioned above. I personally think that the movie might be appealing to certain type of audience, but definitely not all in general, which would be a sad thing if it's not successful commercially, especially since the ending hinted a third movie to complete the trilogy. There was no end credit scene if you are wondering, so you can hit the restroom immediately. If you are not a fan of this kind of genre, you might feel the movie to be too childish, light, illogical and so on. Especially if you do not like Transformers or Power Rangers movies. But if you are like my wife and I, then by all means, see this one and enjoy the Jaeger fights.

But here goes.To set the scene, the film is set ten years after the first success of defeating the Kaiju and closing down the rift. With no purpose for older Jaegers, people use them for scrap hunting and the military for training. However, another not-so-surprise Kaiju assault now puts these newer Jaegers through a new brutal onslaught with the mission of shielding the fate of humanity. Whereas the first film was dark, well-paced and realistic, Uprising juxtaposes this by introducing lousy characters and filling most of its screen time with fight scenes that seem to be copied and pasted out of transformers. The mechanics behind robot fighting from the prequel such as skill of the pilots and the reliance on strategy have become obscure. Instead, the audience is forced to sit through the first movie retold from a child's point of view; there is no logic, no understanding of physics and no realism. And when you thought it couldn't get any worse, Ramin Djawadi's famous soundtrack clings to only two minutes of the entire movie. Although the end of the film has set itself up for a sequel, there would be no way on God's Earth that any director could recover the franchise from where it has fallen. Children will enjoy this film but be sure to bring a blindfold to prevent yourself from catching an eye infection.
 
To summarise, Uprising does not live up to the sequel, is too rushed and has no sense of realism.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

No the plot is not amazing nor is the dialogue the best you'll ever hear, but it's actually quite fun to watch. The movie takes the time to build up the storyline and characters - a thing that lots of producers seem to forget nowadays - and does that in a good fashion. The plot is quite thin but hey.. so was the one of the first Pacific Rim. When you like SciFi, Meg or XL Monster movies you'll be entertained! Love the monster on XL robot fights, CGI is good. The actors have not shined nor completely failed - not more or less. Audio is not spectacular nor awful. In general it's a mediocre movie, if you like/love the genre it more enjoyable than most reviews tell you. Just sit back on a weekend night and enjoy the spectacle on your screen without having to think too much. 6/10 seems about right overall.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film was co-written and directed by debut feature filmmaker Steven S. DeKnight (who's previously only helmed genre TV shows, like 'DAREDEVIL', 'DOLLHOUSE', 'SMALLVILLE' and 'ANGEL'). The story is set 10-years after the events of the original movie, when society is threatened by new Kaiju creatures, and a new younger team of Jaeger pilots must do battle with them. It stars John Boyega, Cailee Spaeny, Scott Eastwood, Jing Tian, Adria Arjona and Zhang Jin (in new parts); while Charlie Day, Rinko Kikuchi and Burn Gorman all reprise their roles from the original movie. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's a modest hit at the Box Office as well. If this chapter does good enough, many more sequels are planned (including spinoffs) to create a whole new sci-fi movie universe (similar to the 'STAR WARS' franchise). I enjoyed this film to an extent, but not as much as the original, I am still looking forward to more sequels though. The story takes place ten-years after the Battle of the Breach. A Jaeger has gone rogue and is causing massive destruction. It appears as though someone, or something, has released more Kaiju monsters into the world. Jake Pentecost (Boyega), son of the late great Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba in the first film), leads a new team of young Jaeger pilots to stop this new threat. The movie definitely has some cool visuals, and some pretty awesome robot vs. monster fight scenes. Boyega is also very charismatic in the lead, although Eastwood kind of sucks as his rival, still the film is severely lacking what del Toro brought to the original. This movie has a very strong TV feel to it too, thanks to the inexperienced new director. If you're a fan of the 'DAREDEVIL' and 'DOLLHOUSE' type shows you might enjoy it, but I'm a movie lover (not a TV fan). I prefer quality over quantity, and this film definitely doesn't live up to it's predecessor. I am still looking forward to more future installments though, like I said, and hopefully they'll be much better than this.","30 out of 63 found this helpful.

This sequel didn't go down the usual path of remaking the original with a new, poorly-chosen cast and a stupidly derivative story; it takes place ten years later when people have moved on and are in recovery mode. Salvaging (stealing, really) tech from the giant robot carcasses is a career path for the desperate -- or the obsessed. I found the attitude towards the heroes (and results) of the first film plausible.So while I enjoyed the characters (esp. John Boyega's), there are predictable moments. But I had a good time; there's a lot to enjoy here. Plus, it's a welcome break from the Marvel Universe, which can get a bit numbing after awhile. The MCU films are good, but there's just so many of them, and they're all in the same universe, more or less.I think the original Pacific Rim had better robot fight scenes (arguably with a vague sport-competition appeal). This sequel is more thoughtful, perhaps. What WOULD come next in such a world? I think they did good job, considering. They went in a new, interesting direction but maintained continuity with the first film, using it as leverage. Getting some of the original cast was smart.I'm in the minority, but I think this film surpasses the original (again, not in the fight scenes). There's a lot going on here, and it's interesting. There are even some memorable lines.This film had the potential for eight stars, but I'm deducting a half-star for semi-predictability, and another for the (arguably juvenile) scene with the highly-trained pilots repairing the giant robots -- as if a giant military base had no technicians at all. That's seven (7) stars total.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Pacific Rim Uprising is pure awesome and fun. Only if you enjoy movies that are robots smashing robots or robots smashing Kaiju. And a lot of destruction with a battle in a city. This film may not top Guillermo del Toro first film which was fresh and new about Jaegars battling Kaiju's and that film had a bit of style with a neo night time battle. And seeing one Jaegar dragging a freighter and using it like a bat to hit the giant monster. Uprising may not have that style that the first movie did. But it is big, loud, and action packed for a science fiction film and that is all you can ask for in this sequel.What was good about this film? It is action packed. So if you want to see a movie that has more visual effects and action than substance of a plot. This is the film. Director Steven S. DeKnight (director that did Netflix's Daredevil) managed to have some creativity in giving these Jaegars a different look. Every one of them was different and had their own special weapon if it was an electrical whip, a giant spiked cannon ball, or a gravity pull weapon. Also, the action sequences are big and loud and exciting. I found the first film to have a lot more Kaiju fighting Jaegars action. I ll discuss that in a bit. But this film does introduces the concept of people building giant Jaegar drones. And there is one rogue Jaegar that the gypsy avenger has to fight against in a Siberian setting. But the climax taking place near Mount Fiji with three big Kaiju's fighting with a few Jaegars was definitely worth the price of admission. And makes up for the lack of Kaiju action in this film.The visual effects were spectacular. Seeing these giant robots fighting monsters was awesome. Also, newcomers like John Boyega did good playing Jake Pentecoste. A guy who is still carrying the conflicted emotions about his father played by Idris Elba. Scott Eastwood was also good, but his performance felt like he was still coming off from the set of the Fate of the Furious movie. Cailee Spaeny was great for her first performance debut, also struggling with emotions about the past after the Kaiju attacked. Which when going through the neuro hand shake like the first movie had a similar set up. Burn Gorman and Charlie Day were both good as the awkward goofy scientists. There is a twist in the film which is setting up for more sequels. What did not work with the film? I felt like this film did have less action than the first. There is one big Kaiju battle with the Jaegars in the climax. While the rest of the film just had the good guys trying to stop this Rogue Jaeger. And the drones from attacking. But the climax does make up for the rest of the film.Overall, Pacific Rim Uprising is a really good film. The visual effects are top notch. The action is loud and big if you love robots smashing monsters. The plot and concept does throw in a twist surprise that wants to carry over for more movies. I just felt like the direction is a little bland compared to the first film. Del Toro created something new and fresh and had that punching through a wall music score that just made you excited. Uprising was lacking that energy the first movie had.I definitely recommend seeing this film on the big screen for its visually exciting action.","41 out of 90 found this helpful.

John Boyega is pretty likable here, even when moments he wasn't trying to be. The rest of the cast are also pretty enjoyable, I mean everybody really shines also. The effects are also great, fight scenes are a fun rollercoaster ride. I thought I was gonna find another rehash of the last film, nd just when you think it's gonna go in that direction, it pulls itself in another way. I hope you'll find this fun and entertaining.","36 out of 78 found this helpful.

Was it entertaining? Moderately. 
Was there decent laughs and a fair amount of giant robots fighting? Absolutely. I'm not sure anyone expected to walk into this film expecting to watch the next oscar winning cinematic marvel - it was basically what you'd expect an un-promoted sequel that no longer has the biggest pulls of the original film (Idris Elba and Charlie Hunnam for those who were wondering). John Boyega is a loveable sass mouthed rebel youth come good, and banter with his smack talking little friend and Zac Effron-esque copilot make for an entertaining enough film even if there is little character development and a relatively predictable storyline. Burn Gorman and Charlie Day make for the best of the comedy and there's enough rock 'em sock 'em robots action to at least make you feel like you didn't get ripped off for your ticket price - even if you did expect the power rangers theme to start at playing at some point. Take your kids, enjoy it for what it is - a movie that doesn't require too much brain power and gives you a bit of a giggle - don't expect to be talking about it weeks later.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is totally perfect. The main story, the plots, characters, acting, cinematography, special effects, wardrobe, directing things, and other aspects can not be criticized easily, because the movie is just amazing. Without watching the first movie, audience could still understand the main story that there are still monsters coming from underwater to attack the world and the heroes are the pilots inside mega robot head. On this second movie, we could also see the newcomers, John Boyega and Cailee Spaeny whose characters developed each other, from strangers, friends, professionals, and then family. I am happy that the Director and all of the crew could consistently make the intense relation between the screen and the audience, so that the audience can feel also the drama and pain inside robotic pilot's mind that makes us never leave our seat from the beginning to the end of the story. I have no idea exactly how budget for this movie, but because this movie is screening mega robot and big monster with special effect and high qualified cinematography, it might cost really expensive, but money does heal audience's heart of watching other boring movies and we can enjoy this Pacific Rim: Uprising. Perfect perfect perfect, I love it!!!","30 out of 64 found this helpful.

The first Pacific Rim was a pleasant surprise to me and a thoroughly enjoyable experience. After hearing some buzz that this was more a ""youth"" orientated feature and watching an uninspiring trailer, I had intended not to see it. However today I was dragged along by my sister who I now need to thank.I have to admit I found this movie a fun entertaining romp with excellent special effects and great humour. Yes it's different but if it was eminently watchable. The new cast is fun and I was hooked from the opening narration onwards.So ignore the reviews and judge for yourself but it will definitely be added to my colllection when available.","27 out of 57 found this helpful.

Moreover, Earth's peace is about to be shattered as someone is out to unseal the breach and allow the creatures back in.I was pleasantly surprised by the original Pacific Rim. I am not generally into CGI-driven sci fi action movies but, despite its many flaws, I found it reasonably entertaining. It seemed to have more substance than your average CGI movie.Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the sequel. Pacific Rim - Uprising is incredibly bad. Basic, largely nonsensical plot. Any semblance of a storyline exists merely to move you from one mindless action scene to another. Throw in some gung ho dialogue and acting and this movie has nothing going for it.Well, almost nothing: there are some nice views of Sydney, Australia. That was the main reason I even bothered to watch this, as some scenes were filmed outside my office.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

PACIFIC RIM UPRISING 
#pacificrim #pacificrimuprising Here's my review without giving away anything . Unfortunately Im quite disappointed with this film . Almost 1/2 hour into the movie and the scenes were almost hard to watch - the main character is an Amazing actor - John Boyega who was one of the producers of the movie (ONE ! Of the producers) who acted very well given the script he was given . I applaud his performance for what it was worth. But again , it was kinda embarrassing watching the first 20'ish mins of the film as it had not much connection with anything to do with the main plot, they should have at least maybe turned back time and showed the audience who may have not seen the first one a recap of what has happened to get to the point they are in the movie now. Secondly, it was centred around too much kids , this is PACIFIC RIM 2!!! Step up! Why down by putting children as the forefront of the film - I thought it was really quite irritating and Derek wasnt a fan from the beginning of filming and I gave it a chance but tonight it was not good. The only one I was ok with was the main little girl but also that was just being nice . I thinking this movie should have stayed in the adult realm and less about kids. To make matters worse - they didn't develop the characters so they went into battle after a scene of a couple of them failing a practice run . And not to mention killing a very prominent actor from the first film just to get an emotional rise from the audience.3rd- not all movie need sexual content - but they had to add an unnecessary triangle of the 2 main guys and a sub-main character in the film - again quite annoying!Also this film has 4 writers! 4! and 14! Producers! Wtf ! too many hands making the soup spoils the soup!! Also not to say anything but 2 of its writers are women- who dont come from anything remotely close to writing a script like this and the movies' director is straight from a television background!! Again wtf!!! How did these people get picked for this job for this movie , Im dumbfounded how the industry picks people to do certain jobs they are not qualified to do. Especially for a sequel the box office smash! So disappointing 
I REALLY WISH GUILERMO DEL TORO DIRECTED THIS LIKE THE FIRST PACIFIC RIM - but alas he was probably focusing on the OSCAR WINNING MOVIE - THE SHAPE OF WATER - which was awesome I loved it!The ONLY SAVING GRACE Of this movie was the Special effects - THE JAEGERS AND THE KAIJU - it was VISUALLY SPECTACULAR! And the fight scenes was AMAZING! Minus all the human garbage that was a 10/10 for me ! Gypsy danger and Saber Athena and even the the drones and kaiju was CRAZY BEAUTIFUL ! I wished the plot followed the gorgeousness of them... Even the end kaiju was overpowered and alot of the scenes was not really realistic in a sense..Like I said the original actors did a good job for what was given to them, the new actors also did a good job - but the writing and plotline and script was unfortunately awful. I am a fair a honest and kind judge - i will give Pacific Rim Uprising 5.5 out of 10Im sure Ready Player One will kick its ass- at least they have less ppl dabbling in that soup so I think its more straight forward- at least I should hope so since its a Spielberg film !Reviewing that Monday I hope if they have the green light for Pacific Rim 3 after This subpar sequel - they would do a hell of a better job staying in line with a story and script and get a director with experience with doing FILM! Argh","12 out of 23 found this helpful.

It was serious, loud, sweet, and perfectly executed -- the ultimate guilty pleasure. This film is none of that, it's a sloppy attempt at making money on the glory of the first film.The storyline doesn't really make any sense, the characters are forgettable and stay undeveloped throughout the entire movie, and for some reason the CGI and compositing are atrocious. In one of the scenes, you can clearly see that John Boyega is acting in front of a green screen. The color palette and physics of the film have also been changed; while the first one was slow, dark, and gritty, thus showing the massive scale of the Kaijus and the Jaegers and their battles, the sequel is bright, fast, and has an unusual blue tint. Now the Jaegers for some reason can do backflips, bringing the film closer to Power Rangers and the Transformers. Finally, some of the panning shots in the film were obviously done to show the new robots in their full glory. If you take into account the underage cast, this film is nothing more than a two hour long toy commercial. I did not like this film, and I hope this is the end of the franchise. I don't even know why they made a sequel to the first film. Two stars for the effort.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

In a vast majority of cases this is indeed true with only on a very rare occasion where a sequel is as good or better. The first Pacific Rim was an ok film, original story with silly human controlled huge robots fighting to protect the Earth. In essence the sequel is in the same vein but and I'm very surprised and happy to say it is a whole lot more. A cross between Transformers, Power Ranges and the inclusion of an anti hero with a great and surprising twist made the time sat watching this very enjoyable. Not as good as some but definitely better than others, kids will love it for the robots, adults will enjoy it for the concept and story. One definite positive was the robot fighting sequences. The biggest gripe for me with Transformers is that its all too fast and you can't take it all in but with this you can, with some fighting slowed down to allow you to do so, well done. The length of the film was perfect also, fast paced enough to keep you interested and not dragged out as some films tend to be.

The characters are checklist and cookie-cutter, the dialog is dull, unfunny, and predictable, and the script is weak and quite stupid. The biggest and most noticeable flaw in this movie is the complete lack of depth and chemistry between any of the characters. They are simply not 'drift compatible' (sorry, I couldn't resist).Johnny Boyega is a good actor, but he is not leading man material. Not yet anyway. Scott Eastwood adds nothing to this movie aside from a strong physical resemblance to his father. This sequel has none of the heart, raw feel, or strong emotional connection of the characters in the first film. It's too bad Guillermo Del Toro didn't return to the director's chair for this movie, as it assuredly would have made a difference. The problem with movie such as this that are heavy in CGI, is that there is often a laziness to them, in that the filmmakers don't see the need or just don't feel like making the effort to writing a coherent script combined with good acting and strong character chemistry. Why bother because who's gonna notice, right? Well, moviegoers do notice and it's really no surprise that this movie isn't doing very well at the box office. PR2 is just a jumbled mess of 'shiny red balls' hoping that no one will notice how inferior this movie is to the first one.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

I wasn't going in expecting some movie about the human condition and the trials of every day life and overcoming adversity in dramatic fashion, nope I wasn't expecting that at all.
I expected to see some awesome fight sequences, great looking creatures (took a while to get to the real meaty stuff though) and fantastic cgi.
I'll admit that most of the humor didn't really work in the film's favor, it just wasn't very clever and at some points seemed extremely forced (the ending might just make you cringe).
But what was the purpose of the film? What was the intention behind it?
I think it accomplished what it set out to do, and bashing it for being something it never tried to be in the first place is just silly.
It would have been nice if there were more kaijus scattered throughout the film, but the climax of the film did boast one of the most awesome giant monster battles to hit the screen.
One thing I wasn't a big fan of was parts of Cailee Spaeny's portrayal of Amara, I salute her for giving it her all (I'm assuming), but there were scenes where she just didn't have enough grit, enough fight in her, parts where the actors around her were looking fierce and she just looked out of place.
Also the film could have done without all the Chinese dialogue and subtitles, we get it, they are Chinese and in China, speaking it doesn't sell it any more, it's 2018, we get it. Definitely a fun film, though some parts dragged on a little bit, it was still a worthwhile experience. I don't regret watching it.","24 out of 50 found this helpful.

Sure, it had its fair share of fans, but critics and fans either had a blast with it or it just wasn't for them. For myself, I was on the former end of that argument. I really enjoyed watching the spectacle of the first movie. Even though it was flawed, it was all about caring of the characters and whether or not they lived or died. Some people found it to be hollow, but there are counter-arguments to make about that as well. That being said, there aren't many arguments that can save this sequel from being disliked. Pacific Rim: Uprising is the perfect example of a film that desperately relies on the spectacle and characters of its predecessor in order to impress. For all these aspects and more, here's why I think fans of the first and newcomers might as well stay away from this sequel.Pacific Rim: Uprising follows Jake Pentecost as he is thrust into the war he never thought he would join. Being the son of his fallen father who helped save the planet in the first film, that was the one connection that made this film lazy in my opinion. From the visual style to the one-dimensional characters, to the nearly non-existent chemistry between everyone, I found this film to be lackluster from start to finish. Audiences come to see these movies for the spectacle of monsters fighting robots, but when the majority of that fighting takes place in the final 30 minutes and you've bored your audience by that point, then there isn't much hope for an enjoyable experience.I'm usually the person who talks as highly as I possibly can about a movie, looking for positives where most people find negatives, but I'm finding it very difficult to defend this one. Without ruining it for those who wish to see it, there are returning characters from the first film who are completely wasted here and their character arcs are ridiculous and frankly too stupid to agree with. The entire time someone from the previous film was on-screen, I found myself wishing I was back in the theatre when the first film came out. Everyone from the new characters to the old characters was poorly executed here and I was more than disappointed by that.Yes, the final act does have some cool fight sequences, but I'm more just commending the filmmakers on a few cool action scenes rather than saying that I actually enjoyed them while watching. Yes, the effects are great, but I was bored by the time they showcased them. On top of that, the stakes are silly, due to how the Kaiju's make their return to Earth. Honestly, I found myself either wondering how much time was left or hoping for an exciting twist that would grab my attention, but none of that is present throughout this film.In the end, Pacific Rim: Uprising is everything that I didn't want from a sequel. Being the first feature film that Steven S. DeKnight has directed (having only worked on television beforehand), I went in with a little apprehension, to begin with, but his work on television or smaller films may suit him better. This movie is just about as generic as you can get. I would like to say that this film would make a good example of how visual effects look on a home television experience for a rental, but I still think the better recommendation for that would be the first film. Overall, I've seen far worse movies out there, but Pacific Rim: Uprising isn't anything worth talking about.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

That is the reason I liked the first one and want to repeat in the second. And I wasn't disappointed. Worry little about ""story"" or ""character developing"" (there is actually some) because it is the giants that take the center stage. Fending off big ugly aliens that come to destroying us from out space, with equal sized fist and jaws; colliding face in face with building tall creature dug out of a portal in the sea, with big caliber weapons - that alone is enough to get your heart beat doubled and adrenaline piked. And those giants are not clumsy, they are actually fast and furious, sometimes pretty clever.

I certainly didn't walk out of that movie anxiously awaiting a sequel, or even remotely wanting one. So when I went to see this movie, I wouldn't say that I was exactly excited. I got exactly what I expected, it was bad. Now it wasn't horrible, it almost achieved being average, but ultimately it was bad. The cast in this movie is quite forgettable, nobody stood out. The only person I thought came close to working was John Boyega, though even he didn't quite get there. He did do his best, but his character really didn't give him anything good to work with. That was it, everybody else blended together in some very okay performances, I literally couldn't name one other performance that came close to being memorable. Charlie Day is one of my favorite working comedians, but his role in this movie is utterly pointless. An absolute waste of his talent. He does what he can, but he has nothing to do. The writing is pretty generic, the movie moves from one uninteresting part of the story to another. It's set up very much like a bland action movie. At times it's actually pretty bad, which causes for some unintentional comedy. There are some moments in this movie where they genuinely try to get us to care about what is happening, but due to the lack of relatable characters and engaging writing, I didn't care at all. They try to make us feel for characters, but it doesn't work when they feel like characters, rather than like real people. This is most definitely an action movie, and unfortunately the action ranges between being bland and actually bad. Not all of it was cut up excessively, but most of it was. The action lacks any sort of flavor or any feeling of originality. When your action is reduced to quick cuts of big things punching at each other, I tune out. For effectively the whole movie, I was simply waiting for it to be over. As we followed clichéd characters across unoriginal storylines, I was impatient for the credits to roll. By the time they finally did role, I got excited that this boring mess was finally over. If I'm excited to leave the theater so that I can have the experience of your movie behind me, I'm sorry to say that your movie has failed me. I haven't even mentioned the film's broken attempts at comedy. Fortunately it wasn't too excessive, but every time they try to get a laugh out of me, they just fail. The only times I laughed were at how absurd the plot was, which isn't a good reason to laugh. I'm happy to say that this movie didn't annoy me, although I certainly didn't enjoy it. If you liked the first Pacific Rim, I cannot recommend this one. Where that movie succeeds at being fun, it's sequel succeeds at feeling unnecessary and generic. While this movie is actually bad, it's not awful, I didn't run out of the theater screaming. I never had high hopes for this movie, but I was hoping to at least be entertained. I regret seeing this one, I hope you don't make the same mistake I did.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

Its better to watch this on some VOD site because the movie is not worth paying for .

Was this really all that director and writer Steven S. DeKnight, along with three other writers, could manage to come up with? The storyline was way beyond generic and predictable.As for the acting in the movie, well, let's just say that this will not be much of an award-nominating or winning movie. John Boyega is just unfit for acting on a scale of these movies. It was up to the likes of Scott Eastwood, Cailee Spaeny, Burn Gorman and Rinko Kikuchi to actually carry the movie, despite it being Boyega being the main attraction.The kaijus in the movie were quite nice and interesting, as they were in the first movie too. And the impressive CGI really helped to bring these monsters to life on the screen. The jäegers, too, were also quite nicely brought to life on the screen. However, I never understood why the pilots would exhibit pain and fatigue when the robot chassis gets beaten up. That made no sense.I also love the model simulation of what would happen to the Earth if the kaiju reached their end goal as Hermann Gottlieb magically brought that scenario up in mere seconds after being told of where they were heading. That was just downright ridiculous. But also the fact that apparently that Japanese metropolis managed to evacuate in mere minutes, and for some reason they knew that ALL people were safely evacuated below ground at the base, and they ordered an all out attack. Yep, that was realistic.""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" is crammed with plotholes and things that made little or no sense.It was entertaining enough for a single viewing, if you sit down with the intention of watching it for being an impressive CGI galore and very little else. I watched it to the end, but I can honestly say that I will never return to watch it a second time around.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I loved the 1st one but they butchered this sequel. The plot line was flimsy, they didn't try very hard coming up with a plausible transition into this film from the last. It was a failed attempt at a ""next generation"" type scenario but the next generation was completely different and far inferior to the original. Instead of assembling a new squad of jaeger pilots they decided to go with kiddie cadets, and In doing so effectively turned an action blockbuster into a teeny-bopper flick. It looked more like Enders Game 2 than Pacific Rim 2, very weak character development, poor character interaction, lousy corny dialogue and a VERY predictable course of action. Whereas the original pacific rim was an action packed adventure this one was like the Mickey Mouse club. On top of that the movies main conflict sucked and wasn't explained well & when it was brought to light it was a reach at best, not a plausible connection it was outta left field the writers dropped the ball. The movies only saving grace was the final 30-40 min action sequence, it was visually pleasing with decent effects, but again that said it was underwhelming In terms of its relevance to the story as a whole. This was the old paper bag over the head punch In the face type deal, they lured you in off of the success & popularity of the 1st one and once they reeled you in they delivered a crappy final product. Unless you're 13 you will be very dusaoomted, nothing like the 1st it's bad","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Here's the litany:
1. Lots of magical science words/concepts to lend credence to what otherwise is just junk fantasy like plasma, other dimensions. Fake military tough talk & attitude. Yes, it's a bit of a challenge (and turn off to paying customers) to try and educate while entertaining. 
2. Lots of industrial set props like duct tubing and electrical wiring hanging everywhere. Lots of aged industrial metal and concrete for ambience - cheap to rent. 
3. A broad, basically TV show resume, cheap to get eye candy actors (usually w/tight t-shirts male & female) whose other main attribute is rote reciting of lines. 
4. A broad ethnic and gender actor selection to appeal to a broader younger audience. A female middle schooler building by herself a Jaeger - credulity? 
5. Dumb down dialogue w/lots of visuals & CGI to keep said audience hooked. 
6. Lots of fake science, like a talking hologram (voice coming from where?); lots of suspended computer displays w/colorful graphics. Aerodynamically impossible flying machines w/the customary swooshing sound as they pass by (they all sound the same for some reason) and land vertically w/out the blast incinerating a vast area. 
7. Even the monsters (Kaiju) are beginning to look the same no matter what the movie - lots of teeth, horns, spikes, drool, and bad attitudes (off to detention for you guys/gals).

The acting, the directing, and the story, all deserve only 1 star. Although I won't blame much on the director. Since if you know how the film business works, you will know that the producers actually get to say what to be made or not, and in this case, Legendary Pictures, in 2016, bought by the Chinese giant conglomerate Wanda, has been producing lowest quality contents ever since, just like any other Chinese influenced Hollywood movies, specially forcing their own language and trying to make their own heroes.

Honestly I wasn't all that crazy for the first PACIFIC RIM, even with Guillermo at the helm. He's good at fantasy, and fantastic creatures of his own personal design, and beyond the Kaijin, there's nothing of that in either of these films. Meshing his very creative designs against Japanese anime themes just didn't churn out a masterpiece of film.It was better than this one, though.The original idea is that Jagers, with the Kaijin threat gone, are now being made by the average Joe, and the government won't allow it. Then, a company comes up with the concept of drone Jagers, instead of using human pilots, for some reason. The two primary characters, Jake and Nate, have to pilot one of the Jagers for the summit in which the decision has to be made as to whether or not the Jager program should be changed, from human drivers to automated ones, when there is an attack. I won't spoil anything, so I'll just leave it at that. And then the plot starts to move (and twist, and turn, and veer, and...).The actors all turn in good performances here, though John Boyega as Jake Pentacost, the son of the late Stacker Pentacost (Idris Elba from the first installment) stands out here. Sure, there are times when his humor falls a little flat, but there's more than enough times where it actually made me laugh, to make up for it. The kids do well, specifically Cailee Spaeny as Amara, who leads the charge in that regard, but that also reveals one of my main problems with the film: the kids don't have enough time in front of the camera, save Cailee. Their training regiment is largely off-camera, so it's hard to get behind the characters because we hardly see them throughout the film (save Cailee).Scott Eastwood plays Nate, the straight-as-an-arrow military dude, but I found his delivery sometimes lacking. Was it because he's the son of the legendary Clint Eastwood? Was the director afraid of telling him to give it a few more takes, to really deliver a scene or two that was rememberable? Because I didn't see any.The real problem with UPRISING is the need for the storytellers to keep shifting their course, trying to surprise the audience. Every time you think you understand what's going on, there's a sharp twist on the wheel, and we veer into an unexpected spot, surprised at where the plot is suddenly going. The surprises, instead of being like gifts of joy being shined down upon us, are more like being suddenly struck by another car from the side, as time slows down when you reel from the impact. Only to come out the other side dizzy and disoriented (and possibly injured). There are just too many HA HA! moments in the film, and eventually I found myself numb to them, because of their frequency.On the other side of the coin, there are impressive battle scenes in this movie, and even a few breathtaking dramatic moments. My favorite one is in the snowy Arctic, which I will not say anything more about as to avoid spoilers (but it's awesome). The CGI used for battle damage and realistic battle scenes between oversized enemies was nearly flawless. Can't say much about the score, because I didn't find it all that memorable. There were songs used in the film, but they didn't really add anything to its atmosphere.The collection of these problems and/or lack of impressions by themselves would have probably only shaved a couple of points off of my rating, but... Once the surprises start rolling in as though they are being delivered to you on an assembly line, it gets harder and harder to accept what you see as the final act of the film comes home. You start to wonder if maybe you'd been suckered into the theater just to feed a franchise, instead of enjoy a movie.And who's to say that's not what I've done, now that I've paid to see this? Because I certainly won't be doing it again.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Amd important to the premise, the giants on screen felt larger than any other monsters we'd seen on the screen at the time. The monsters and robots in this movie could have been exchanged with those from any other movie that came out this year, they didn't feel large for lack of discipline by the director, and the character development would have fit especially well in suicide squad. This movie feels like the dollar store version of the original. Did the budget get quartered perhaps? The blame must fall with the director.

I don't even know where to begin with the sequel to Del Toro's Pacific Rim, while I don't usually like to just bash a film like this, quite frankly I don't see anything much to praise at all. The first Pacific Rim did a great job with establishing character and heart, while the story is filled with plot holes, ridiculous premises and just an over the top vision of Kaijus fighting Jaegers. But, Del Toro made it work, with his passion, attention to detail and amazing action Pacific Rim actually managed to capture the audience's hearts, not to mention the killer score. Yet, this time round it was a complete mess and a real shame too. Characters that were established in the first film completely wiped away or underutilized to cheap cop out characters that just pop up like it's some kind of soap opera just makes everything laughable. With an abundance of characters who get little screen time and not enough time to establish themselves to a bunch of annoying teenagers that get way too much time, Uprising really just had the worse character work I have ever seen. Even the action could not redeem the film, something that seemed so simple yet completely missing. Something that even Michael Bay doesn't fail to do in his Transformers franchise yet somehow, Uprising makes Kaiju and Jaeger fights boring, unoriginal and laughable. The lack of regards that the jaegers had towards minimizing collateral damage to the cities just give us an idea of how little we should care to the choreography and battles. With Kaijus that are so insignificant they don't even give that sense of destruction and horror that a gigantic monster terrorizing a city should. How bad could they have been to accomplish this is just bizarre. And now to my largest complaint, the complete misuse of the amazing Pacific Rim theme. I sat in that theater patiently waiting for that climactic battle when they would finally bust that beat.They didn't do it in any of the earlier fights, and I thought, fine. Then for some reason during some weird construction montage they played it, and I thought well, it doesn't hurt to have more of it. But then came the final climactic battle and no theme, no theme? What on Earth were they thinking? A true mess, doing absolutely everything wrong, it wasn't even just boring but rather hatable.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Having seen it a handful of times, it's what you could safely call one of my guilty pleasures. It's big, it's loud, it's downright ludicrous; but it oozes panache and del Toro's trademark giddiness for cinema. This follow-up, with Steven S. DeKnight replacing del Toro behind the camera, is just as big, loud and downright ludicrous as its predecessor, yet it lacks that critical, intangible spark that makes those elements delightful rather than a tad numbing. Having defeated the city-destroying alien Kaiju ten years ago, the world has settled back into normal life and Jake Pentecost (John Boyega, a likeable anti-hero) - son of the apocalypse-cancelling, self-sacrificing hero Stacker (Idris Elba) from the last film - is a thieving rogue stuck in Daddy's shadow. In order to avoid prison Jake and newfound pal Amara (Cailee Spaeny), a precocious orphan screaming out for a role model, opt in for military service. It's good timing too, because of course there's another Kaiju attack mounting and preternaturally talented pilots for the Jaegers (aka big robots) are needed. Intricate plotting and profound character development is obviously not high on DeKnight's priority list, but this doesn't excuse the gigantic plot holes or painfully juvenile humour that is lazily dished up by the writers. Thankfully the action, spread across four major set pieces, is mostly satisfying, albeit without as many jaw-dropping moments as the original. (A climactic Kaiju ""enhancement"" is pretty awesome though.) Five years worth of improvements in CGI technology and an increased budget also allows the larger-than-life sequences to be staged in broad daylight, rather than masked by heavy rain or night-time skies, which DeKnight capitalises on with plenty of wide shots and relatively judicious editing. It's really just a shame that the Wow-factor seems to have been lost in a sequel that feels like it's more often ticking off boxes than going for broke. And whoever thought it was a good idea to bring back Charlie Day and Burn Gorman for their excruciating comedic double-act needs to be fired from the studio. The adequate action sequences and Boyega's easy charisma ensure this isn't a complete dud, but with returns diminishing quicker than expected, Uprising is a disappointing effort that could very well be the end of the Pacific Rim franchise.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

I call it an experience coz it's my first time in cinema
The first time I watch a movie in Imax cinema
2 days ago I said that i don't like kaiju mecha movies
I find them outdated 
But with a simple word called faith
I found myself sitting in front of a movie called pacific rim
My first intention was to pass some time before my uncle comes
I wasn't even intending to finish it
But then it starts
First of all Imax has great potential i tried Vr but 3d glasses and a giant screen makes it far better
The sound effects are great too
For the movie I stick to my word that kaiju mecha things are outdated
But I was tricked the whole movie coz i tough that it was based on an anime a manga or at least a book or a novel to search for at the end of the movie
Making names and types for the robots and monsters was the best part of it
it makes you believe that this movie belongs to a universe 
But it was not so big salute to the director coz it was original
The story was cool especially when death comes I was touched by that 
To sum up it's my first experience in watching in a cinema and in writing reviews my opinion shouldn't be taken into consideration coz it was based on feelings more than logic
But here is what I learned, always try new things and watch what u don't want to watch but do it in good cinemas so that at least if u don't enjoy the movie enjoy the effects
And sorry for the long post","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

The fighting scenes were overly destructive and unrealistic, and nothing new was shown, The CGI was poor and overall experience of the movie was a disappointment.Overall I would say the movie is a no watcher and save your hard earned money and wait for the movie to telecast.(which will be very soon as this one wont stay in the theaters for long)","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's far better than the first movie, thanks to director Steven DeKnight, if you're familiar with his work. He does not make garbage.
 I would say the only bad thing about the movie is the forced inclusion of Chinese actors to get the movie shown in China. It's brutal to watch them on screen, they don't fit in with their immense lack of talent and awful plastic surgery marionette faces. Take them out and it would be a much better film. Hollywood needs to force Chinese actors to up their game. The ones they're sending over are terrible. What are the Hong Kong actors doing right that China cannot? Is the Chinese government picking favorites to become actors instead of people with actual talent?","36 out of 86 found this helpful.

"10","/10","The rare sequel that really satisfies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4127526/?ref_=tt_urv","designsbygus","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80600237/?ref_=tt_urv","13 April 2018","Let's start on level ground here. It's made quite clear in the original ""Pacific Rim"" that the Breach was closed. Yet in the trailer, we see Jaegers fighting kaiju. I was concerned about how this sequel would explain that, wondering what the new source of the conflict would be. Would the filmmakers just cheap out on the plot and basically say, ""Huh? Oh, yeah, breach was never really closed. Our bad.""? Thankfully, no; what we are given instead is a stunningly imaginative and well-crafted plot which intelligently explains the reappearance of kaiju, while also honoring concepts set up in the first movie.One thing movie-goers have complained about for several years now is the too-long, too-revealing trailer, the kind which gives away the best jokes, major plot elements, etc. Did the trailer for ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" (PRU) show us Jaegers? Of course it did. Did it show kaiju? Well, explanation for them aside, this is a ""Pacific Rim"" sequel, so that's to be expected. Did we see any familiar faces? Yes, Burn Gorman's Dr. Gottlieb clearly makes an appearance. Yet even with all these, upon reflection I can say that in my opinion the PRU trailer gave nothing away.Gorman's performance in PRU is quiet enjoyable. And I was impressed with the range shown by John Boyega. I don't mean just the range he showed in this movie; I'm referring also to the range he's capable of from one movie to the next. This young man created a persona for PRU that is strikingly distinct from his Finn of the recent ""Star Wars"" sequels.""Pacific Rim"" took the concept of ""kaiju vs mecha (the Jaegers)"", rarely seen outside of anime, to a new level. With the bar set so high, PRU really had to deliver to be more than just a ""more kaiju vs mecha"" money-grab. Deliver it did. I found myself deeply engaged as I watched the plot unfold. The filmmakers clearly put thought and effort into this, and in the end this collection of twists, turns and switchbacks adds up to a richly satisfying movie. I readily give ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" 10 out of 10.","17 out of 40 found this helpful.

We just loved the movie. I even bought it on Blu-ray for the collection of liked movies. Even his girlfriend liked it.
Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018)?? Nah, we left after 20 minutes and I wish I could ask for a refund.
It's for 10 year kids and adults with kids' brains or washed up to stupidity.
It's more than obvious that the cast was ""carefully selected"" and I won't make any debate on my comment.
And this movie is another example of why I quit following the Star Wars saga many years ago. Only one I liked was Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016). The other, beginning in 2015, just suck, won't bother even to name them.
I'm a huge movie fan of all kind of movies. I have a collection of over a thousand Blu-rays and DVDs buy I won't buy or include Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018) in it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I like that the plot continues from the last movie. The characters are as interesting as their story. The one problem is the sequencing. Some scenes are pointless and are ordered in such a way that they don't make sense. However, if you like fighting robots, you'll love it. Pacific Rim: Uprising is the sequel to Pacific Rim. It takes place ten years after the war, which took place in the first film, was won. Jake Pentecost (John Boyegas), a carefree, retired pilot, is living life in a messed-up world. Through unwanted circumstances, he meets a 15-year old hacker named Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny). With common personalities and different pasts, they create a bond that no one can break. With this new bond, old friends of Jake's and new friends of Amara's collaborate to fight the Kaiju for what is left of humanity. This film is directed and written by Steven S. DeKnight, known for producing the Netflix series Daredevil. DeKnight pulls the story together without losing your attention on the main crisis with the Kaiju. My hats off to the special effects team. The robot close-ups are so realistic, it seems like you can reach out and touch them. The robot fights are also extremely real. The intense music by Lorne Balfe makes the movie extremely engaging. It is also surprisingly comical. Jake Pentecost's sarcastic tone makes you question whether the group is really living in a life or death situation or not. 
>My favorite character is Amara. She has a spark from beginning to end in the movie. Her ability to create her very own robot or Jaeger is amazing. Her curiosity and her attitude about doing the right thing is pleasant to see in an action movie. Seeing the connection between Jake and Amara develop throughout the film is a favorite part. The message of this film is that ""despite who your family is, who you think you are or what you've done in the past, you can still be a hero."" I rate this movie 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18. It opens March 23, 2018 so, go check it out. Reviewed by Kamryn B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Benicio del Toro has the ability to add that to all of his movies. It is very noticeable that he has stepped back in this case and left most of the work to others, only retaining a production credit.On the surface this movie is not that different from the original. It's still giant robots boxing with japanese-style monsters. But the narrative from the first movie, the voiceover that at least gave you the feeling of a deeper story, the philosophical tidbits... All of that is missing completely. This is something more resembling one of the crappier Transformers-sequels, ""here, this is the premise, now everybody fight and destroy things!"". There is nothing really wrong with the special effects or the action sequences, but it's just not satisfying. The effects look slightly worse than in the first movie, but overall they are fairly well made. Much of the fighting is set inside a major city, that feels very much like a model. It's not a believable city, and in general the feeling of huge robots and giant scale is somewhat missing. It's more like one of those old Godzilla-movies where a model set with cardboard houses is destroyed, eveything just topples a little too easily. This was something that I felt was very successful in the first movie, there was a real sense of epic fighting going on. It was enforced by really well-made music and sound effects. All of that is much weaker here, even though it feels big-budget it still looks a bit cheap. Making effective action scenes is not easy, and even though they spent the money, they didn't get bang for their buck.Honestly, I would probably recommend people to pass on this movie. If you liked the first one, this is most likely not going to do it for you. The lacking weight, the lacking flair and storytelling. It's basically more of the same, just that much less well-made.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie is a big budgeted version of all those cartoon series geared towards kids. I wouldn't dare to say that I loved part 1, now that I have seen part 2, but I did. Part 1 didn't have the best story line in the business of SF but it did have emotional parts which we could connect to. Part 2 is all action with nothing to relate to the characters.Part of the movie is in Chinese and we know why. It's a huge market and having few of the characters will add allure. The third part, I'm sure, will have Indians and Japanese.Another problem is that the story line is predictable. You can assume what's gonna happen and all you can wait for is for the CGI to kick in. The CGI is good and that's the only part of the movie I could watch without being disinterested.There are tons of loopholes and laughable moments, but I'm not gonna spend time explaining all that.

DeKnight he has recruited John Boyega and Scott Eastwood into this CGI-fest that picks up from the, dare I say, far superior enterprise from 2013. It's ""Lambert"" (Eastwood) who has to knock his new squadron into shape as they prepare to fight an even more deadly army of ""Transformers"" - nope, sorry, ""Kaiju"" - as the portal between our world and that occupied by this thing's writers becomes open and extremely dangerous. What now ensues does slightly surprise if only because Boyega already had ""The Force Awakens"" (2015) under his belt whilst Eastwood had ""F&F 8"" to pay his manscaping bills. What are they doing here then, you may well ask? At least Cailee Spaeny was still starting out! The story hasn't an original limb in it's shockingly derivative frame, the dialogue is an hybrid of the banal and the gung-ho and the whole look of the film seems aimed at Saturday morning kids television - there's isn't even the obligatory mixed shower scene! It's clearly had some production money thrown at it, and to be fair it does look good - in a repetitive and familiar sort of fashion, but quite why we wanted or needed this is anyone's guess.

Since the times of Robot Jox we didn't have any giant mech-related movies, and though the movie had its drawbacks it was awesome imo. Del Toro and his team created an immersive experience for all mecha fans.
My expectations of the sequel weren't so high as I already knew del Toro dropped the project. However, I must say I enjoyed it. Some people were frustrated due to teenagers becoming jaeger pilots, but I believe it to be a hint or reference to well-known Evangelion. Sadly, the jaeger action scenes are scarce, I wish there'd be more of them. First part of the movie is a bit tedious but then the film picks its pace. 
Plot was surprisingly good imo apart from not so interesting self-made engineer girl line.

I actually had high hopes for this movie. The first Pacific Rim was a whole lot of awesome giant robot badass fun. Unfortunately this movie did not live up to my expectations.On a positive note the animation was outstanding.
Similar to the first one this movie is all around pure eyecandy. The fight scenes were also well done and fun to watch, but not quite up to the first movie's standard.Story-wise this movie is nonsensical. There is barely any actual plot or character development. The big surprise twist fell flat and was highly predictable. The comedy was also lacking compared to the first.This movie also had a noticeable drop in originality compared to part one. While the premise is not exactly new, Pacific Rim was as close to a live action giant robot anime as we are going to get. Unfortunately Pacific Rim 2 feels like a combination of bad anime plot points. The movie is also predictable and very cliche. This goes along with the characters who feel more like walking stereotypes of sci-fi and action tropes.On top of all that while the fight scenes were entertaining there is a noticeable drop-off in quality. There were just too many bland moments in the movie.Overall the movie is a Mindless popcorn entertainment film, but I just wish it was more.

Pentecost Jr would rather live the life of a cash hustler over the glory and excitement of being a Jagger pilot and if the world should ever be in danger again: all the glory that goes along with saving the world like his father. As he repeats throughout the film however Jake ""Is not his father!!""As the film advances though Jake is put in a situation where he has no choice, but to be thrust into the life he despises and has been running away from since his father saved the world: Training Jagger pilot cadets! Soon after starting orientation of 7 brave young trainee's who respect and admire Pentecost danger emerges and quickly skyrockets to the level where the fate of the world once again is in the hands of a Pentecost!!The acting isn't quite as good in this sequel to Pacific Rim, but I think the action scenes flow so much better. I know some of the reviews aren't very kind to this movie, but to me despite the cliche' moments it really flies by and seemed like a fun thrill ride to me. All the catchy phrases they use like ""Drifting"" together and being ""Drift compatible"" with one another to share the load inside of the Jagger so as not to overload a single brain was pretty awe inspiring to me. The soundtrack maximizes the glory moments and really draws in my attention along with the sound effects, and visual effects in general.Just to reiterate about the acting: It's pretty good yet they still seemed to find an absolutely horrendous Asian actor that is so unpolished as an actor that she wrecks the flow of every seen she's in. Her name was Tian Jing and I just don't understand how there isn't another actor they could have used that could have been more authentic as the CEO of a multi-billion dollar Mech-warrior/Jagger manufacturing company. Other than that I thought it was an 8/10 movie though and looking forward to part 3 to turn this franchise into a trilogy!!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

No. Was it as bad as the other reviews make it look? Definitely not.Good acting, likeable characters, interesting story, and of course, more good old giant mecha vs monster action.To those calling it a movie oriented towards kids, you don't walk into a movie like this without hoping to connect to the inner kid in you. That said, only some of the actors were kids and even they didn't get as much screen time as some of the adult protagonists.The story was coherent and the script felt well thought out. Just ignore the whole impracticality of using giant robots to fight godzilla-scale beasts and enjoy it for what it is and you'll have a good time.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The success of Pacific Rim, which was financed by Legendary back when it had a deal with Warner Bros to make movies like that, along with the merchandise and home media and tv sales, forced Legendary, now owned by Wanda from China, to create a sequel, this time released by Universal, called Uprising. The reaction to this movie is awful. Here we have John Boyega, fresh off his turn as Finn in the first two of the star wars sequel trilogy, as the main hero. Add to that a mixture of asian and british actors and actresses, and a higher budget, and this movie became somewhat of a box office failure, with the third and maybe final movie in the series in the wings. At least Legendary has other projects that are far more successful, such as the Godzilla monsterverse with Warner Bros that continues with Godzilla King of the Monsters next year and Godzilla vs Kong the following year after the successes of the 2014 godzilla reboot and Kong Skull Island.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is great popcorn film for the entire family. The cast that stood out were John Boyega, Jing Tian, Cailee Spaeny, Rinko Kikuchi, Burn Gorman, and Charlie Day. For the people who complained that the first film took place too much in the dark, they will be happy with this film because it primary takes places during the daytime. I would settle for a compromise of the battle scenes taking place at sunset for the future films. I am hoping there will be a prequel to this film that takes place before Uprising and after the first film. I also believe there will be a direct sequel to this film, as well a potential crossover to Godzilla and King Kong in the Monster Verse. I had one issue with the handling of a particular character This sequel robot looks a little bit comic bookish compare to the original film which looked more realistic. This film is not as good as the first one but it is a good film.

First of all, this is just real steel, but bigger, this movie is a blatant rip off of a masterpiece movie, that not only explored the future of robot fighting and how our technology has the potential to develop, but shows us a father reconnecting with his son. Now pacific rim 2 on the other hand, this is just bigger robots, with less impact upon the audience. First of all, the fights are just plain boring, unlike real steel, where the combat feels real to the audience. Within real steel, we get to see the main character become one with the robot, with the unique shadow boxing chip installed. Now you might argue that in the pacific rim 2, they are connected directly to the robot, but that does matter for anything, and here's why. In reasteel, they form a connection with the robot, forming a bond with it when seeing it progress up the boxing ladder, upgrading it as they go alone. This connection is able to be witnessed when they refuse to sell the robot, and then beat the champion with it. The emotion that is shown within the final fight scene, of the child and their concern for the robot not breaking down is real, unlike what happens in pacific rim 2. When the robots in that movie die, the two pilots also die with it, and they do feel the pain, but only upon the physical level. The failure to reach an emotional level with this robot not only ruins our movie immersion, but the entire movie. It is this lack of connection to the robot, which causes the audience to not care about the loss of the robots or their pilots, and ruined not only my immersion, but my enthusiasm for robot movies. I will need to watch real Steel at least 9 more times to regain any passion I previously had towards any films containing robots.Bad movie, go watch anything else with robots in it, in particular real steel.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Good Question. This movie was a fantastic watch. Who doesn't love robots fighting kaijus or robots fighting each other? This is the future MMA Ladies and Gentlemen deal with it. That said if you wanna read about some of my rants then read below. Else stop here.Now, When compared with the first one which I rate it as a solid 10, this movie lacked a lot of original content. It borrowed a lot of action cues from the first one and tried to recreate it but didn't turn out as good. Also, a lot of original characters from the first movie completely vanished for no reason at all. If they were too pricey to cast. Then I can let that slide. My biggest critic is that the action sequences didn't have the weight like the first one did. The movements seemed much fluid than the first one. For robots and monsters that big it just seems a bit off. The last one is that the action sequences were all placed during the day. All the Jaeger's build and movements seemed plasticky. Seemed like it was a TOY battle. Hope they continue. Looking forward to the next movie.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Many have forgotten how to be entertained. And this movie is entertaining. Every time I post a review on this website, I keep thinking it's the last time I will do so, but I feel someone has to come on here and tell all of these poor, depressed, negativist that sit around watching a movie with a note pad and scrutinizing movies to the point that it's more like a college assignment than entertainment, that there IS hope. Listen carefully to this truth; You can actually watch a movie that is not going to be the best movie that has ever been made or that you will ever see and actually...(gasp)...be entertained despite the movie not being very realistic! having plot holes, unbelievable in places, and no character development...after all, do you really go to see a movie like this to see some big, long psychological character development, or do you see it to watch giant monsters and robots smashing and throwing each other into buildings? 
If you watch porno (which I don't) but if you do, you don't care about character development do you? If you watch a war movie, do you really care all that much about anything other than bombs and jets and shooting? If you watch a martial arts movie, is there anything better than a perfectly placed round-house kick to the bad guy? 
So....yet again, I feel I must come to the rescue! 
It sounds cliche, but it's true; Turn off your brain....that's what some movies are meant to do. Make us forget about the troubles and cares of life for a while. 
Put down the note pad....this movie has lots of unbelievable stuff in it, but gees folks, EVERY sci fi action move has them. 
It will NOT be the best movie you have ever saw in the sci fi/fantasy genre....it's not Aliens or the LOTR movies or the Chronicles of Riddick, etc. But that's ok...most movies are not. 
IF you allow yourself, you will be entertained and that's what movies are supposed to do, right? The action is awesome...the fight scenes are better than the first. The acting is a little rigid sometimes, but that's no biggy. 
The CGI is out of this world and in some ways better than the first in my opinion. 
It's a winner...enjoy...be entertained and don't bring the notepad. That's my advice. Someday you'll thank me for it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The first film was an unapologetic action blockbuster with a unique style. I was not the biggest fan of the first one, it had a fun plot, good performances and amazing special effects. However apart from those things, Pacific Rim was a somewhat dull movie with very little substance. This movie has no substance, and also none of the flare that Del Toro's predecessor had. John Boyega is a newly discovered talent after his breakthrough performance in Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens. I was initially excited to see him in this film as the lead as I strongly believe he can be a front runner for many more summer blockbusters. He brings everything to the table and attempts to make his character fun and likeable. Overall he gives a good performance and is a better choice for a franchise like this instead of Charlie Hunnam. Boyega has charisma and only his sheer likeability as a person saves this character from being totally uninteresting. He plays Jake Pentecost, son of Stacker Pentecost, the one who saved humanity from the Kaiju, 10 years prior. Jake is a drifter, who doesn't care about his father's legacy. This is a cliche that has been overdone in movies but I honestly find it acceptable in a movie where huge monsters fight huge robots. My problem with this character was that his arc was handled very poorly, he changes too quick without the audience receiving the opportunity to fully accept it. There is a cool dynamic set up between Pentecost and Lambert (Scott Eastwood) and Rinko Kikuchi is fantastic in a very limited role, bringing back her character from the first film. These are about the only good performances in this film, Boyega, Eastwood and Kikuchi. Charlie Day, who was hilarious in the first film is absolutely terrible, especially with a character choice that could have been interesting but just felt like a setup for Pacific Rim 3. I can already see him winning a Razzie next year, he was positively awful. The story is also incredibly flat, with the Kaiju only having a prominent role towards the final act. In fact its the last 20 minutes that feel like a movie, the rest is mainly just filler. This film was a gigantic waste of time that couldn't even be redeemed by some flashy action scenes and three solid performances.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Basically, John Boyega is Finn again and the girl (Cailee Spaeny) is Rey or just a general Mary Sue. Scott Eastwood unfortunately didn't inherit his dad's acting genes and he's just an average actor.Three actors from the original movie are back but they are shadows of themselves and not nearly as interesting as in the first movie.With the first revelation of the movie, the plot started to remind me a bit of the plot to ""Robocop 2"". The second revelation, which happens after the middle of the movie, was actually pretty good and I felt the movie finally starting to be interesting but it was a missed opportunity to make it something more.The result is a brainless movie. A sequel that doesn't come close to being anything like the original. It's watchable but only if you turn your brain off and want to see mindless movie about robots.","7 out of 21 found this helpful.

Cary Darling of the Houston Chronicle gave it 1.5 out of 5 stars and called it the worst film of 2018 so far, being especially critical of its bland premise and pandering attempt at international marketability. Darling concluded, ""Pacific Rim Uprising is a lot like the city-crunching monsters it stars: big, loud and as dull-witted as Homer Simpson roused from a medically induced coma. It's a rote, paint-by-numbers blockbuster that would be offensive in its mediocrity if it also weren't so relentlessly uninspired,"" and ""all that's left is the robot brawling and the marketing.
This is loud, clunky, screeching, nasty, mind-numbing, dull, awfully tepid, fetid, silly, repetetive, overlong and just playn horrid movie.
 Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle noted that ""DeKnight doesn't attempt to invest his monsters with majesty, the way Guillermo del Toro did in the previous film. With DeKnight it's just a lot of pounding, smashing and driving, purely functional.""
Truly so
All CGI, no brain behind those.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

TL;DR: A generic, cliche, checklist of a film that's aimed at children. It feels rushed and wanting to jump onto the franchise bandwagon, or at the very least, to cash in on its name. There's no heart put into it at all.It's got pretty looking things and has somewhat cool action sequences though. So at least it's got something going for it, albeit not much.At least it goes by quickly.
It starts off very unoriginal and pretty much maintains that throughout. The writing's just there to get the characters by basically. It feels very disjointed and awkwardly cut a lot of the time, like they are missing vital and interesting scenes for the plot. It's as if the film's in a rush to get to the big action sequences, which are the main highlights of the film, and that's not saying much, or should be the case. They aren't terrible sequences mind you, but they don't hold a candle to the first film either. Especially how the Jaeger's themselves are handled. It feels more like CGI fighting together, instead of big, powerful, heavy machines and monsters, like the cinematography the first film pulled off. The danger's not really there either.All of the characters are bland, like literally all. None of them are special. There are so many things about them that can be explored which aren't, and unfortunately because of this, unlike the Jaeger pilots I didn't have any kind of connection with them. Nor do they with each other. So anything dramatic gets lost in the wind. That's not to say that they don't have potential or that the actors are bad (well at least most of the mains ones), it's that none of them are fully utilised at all.It looks like a Hollywood budget film, but it doesn't feel like one. It's a movie aimed solely at children. A complete misunderstanding and veer from the first film. The people involved in creating this just don't have any passion or interest in the world, they just care about the paycheck and the norm/cliche that's good enough for kids. It's quite disappointing.It's definitely a sub-par sequel and I definitely have no enthusiasm for the franchise if it carries on this way. A soft reboot that follows after the first film and is lead by Guillermo himself would be much appreciated.A below average film that at least goes by quickly. Benefit of the doubt, 4/10.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Supposedly battle hardened Yager pilots who are ready to teach the next generation. This then sets up the next ridiculous thing from an adults point of view they then cast the rookie pilots all in the age range of around 16 so the young leads can appear more veteran and its been done before and yes that movie was pretty awful too.The comedy is childish and the acting is what you would expect for a movie aimed at kids.The action is good but I couldn't but help feel like I was watching a video game rather than a big movie production.This could have been taken in the opposite direction to become a Mech franchise leading to clan wars with the occasional Kayju thrown in but sadly they went this direction and pretty much like Power Rangers bombed at the box office I really expect this will do pretty much the same.If you have young kids they might enjoy it but for anyone else its just pretty awful.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Jake Pentecost (John Boyega) is the rebellious son of Stacker Pentecost who died saving humanity from the first film.After an encounter with a scavenger Amara (Cailee Spaeny) who builds a Jaeger robot from spare parts. Jake ends up in trouble and his half sister helps him out by forcing him to teach at the Pan Pacific Defence Corps under the auspices of rival pilot Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood) who spends the movie doing a Clint Eastwood impersonation.When the Kaiju return and threaten to cause further mayhem, it is up to Jake to rally the younger pilots to take on new dangers.This is an easygoing popcorn film, there is plenty of action. Director Steven S DeKnight is merely efficient, relying more on special effects than the script which can be cheesy and stupid at times. He lacks Guillermo Del Toro's panache and pomposity of the first film.Charlie Day puts in another irritating performance.

(Hatred for the actors and hatred of the fact that it is geared toward a younger audience and the Chinese, etc). I enjoyed this more than the entire Transformers franchise.If you want to watch a clean, family-friendly film that will keep you excited by the character development and world-building, I think you'll enjoy this film. I gave it such a high rating hoping to help balance the criticism of the nay-sayers. I will say some of the science didn't make any sense, but it is science fiction! Take off the critics' glasses, suspend your disbelief, and have fun!People claiming the acting is bad are also not taking into consideration how amazingly multicultural this cast was. I was actually impressed with the chemistry between all of the different characters, and how much diversity there was. Remember that many of these people come from different acting backgrounds and were performing in a second language.This is clearly a film meant to draw in the Chinese crowd, but in my opinion it was much better than other similar movies (The Great Wall).This is the kind of film that looks like it was a blast to create, and the actors and actresses portrayed it that way.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This picture fails to even do that. The characters are dull and we are given no reason to care for them or any of their problems, the fight scenes (which, lets be honest, are the reason we all showed up) are unimaginative and one-note, and the final film is so unmemorable that you'll have forgotten the character's names by the time you've passed through the theatre doors. I enjoyed the first movie from this franchise, but knowing Guillermo had little to no input on this one, my expectations were quite low, and still this film failed to meet them.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There are rumors that this movie was a flop, tho seeing the amount of profit this movie made, it can't possibly be. overall this was an outstanding movie, but the story-line that connects the movies is out of place, please fix it in the next one.

"5","/10","It's sort of watchable I guess","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5635344/?ref_=tt_urv","Jeremy_Urquhart","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26226712/?ref_=tt_urv","13 April 2020","Despite loving the first Pacific Rim, and being a huge fan of monster/kaiju movies in general, I didn't have high expectations for Pacific Rim: Uprising. The first trailer wasn't exactly great, and then the reviews came in and they were pretty middling. I never ended up catching it at the movies, despite the first Pacific Rim being one of my most enjoyable experiences at the cinema, and so when it finally popped up on streaming services, I gave it a reluctant shot.Look, there are aspects of this movie that are pretty bad, but as a whole, I wouldn't call it terrible. The action is still somewhat fun, in a mindless way, but admittedly not as good as the set pieces from the first. I'll give it credit for being colourful, and setting a lot of its action in the daylight, which is rare to see in modern monster movies. John Boyega does the best he can (he really does deserve so much better though- I generally like him in the recent Star Wars movies, but even there he's a little under utilised), and Charlie Day is somewhat entertaining here. The robots and monsters still look cool, but again: maybe not as cool as they did in the first movie.So those positives are pretty mild, to be honest. Makes me think 5/10 could be generous, but I got a kick out of some shallow, over the top actions scenes and cool robot/monster designs. It's not enough to make the movie technically good, however. If you're not as easily impressed by such simple things, you're likely going to dislike almost 100% of this movie.The story is all over the place, with several subplots cut between with little rhyme or reason. There are a group of annoying, poorly developed teenage characters in the film, and honestly, I only remembered they existed every time they were cut back to. That's how forgettable and inessential to the overall film they felt. The characters were serviceable in the first film, and some return here, but for the most part, they're not interesting enough to truly care about.Del Toro had little involvement in this film and it shows. He injected a true sense of fun and awe into the first Pacific Rim, and a mild level of self-awareness that allowed you to enjoy the film without taking it too seriously, while still marvelling at its surprising beauty and take it just seriously enough so that it didn't feel like a joke, or a parody. It's a surprisingly clever film, even in the screenplay department. Sure, it's not an absolute masterpiece, but it knows exactly what it is, what it needs to do, and how to engage its audience, and it's a massive success as a result.This one is less admirable in that regard. The storyline feels even less essential, and only exists to provide breathing room between the action scenes. The monsters themselves take too long to show up, and in a mid-credits scene, a premise for a third film (that'll probably never happen) is teased; a premise that Pacific Rim: Uprising should have simply used instead! The story here is so lacklustre and all over the place that I'm surprised it was approved for shooting.Pacific Rim: Uprising won't be a disappointment to most people who wouldn't expect much from a Pacific Rim sequel in the first place, but for people who found themselves surprisingly loving the first (like myself), it might well be. You could technically do worse, but you could also do so much better. For example, you could just rewatch the first again. It holds up, and was crafted by a filmmaker who knew exactly what he was doing. Its sequel may be sporadically fun in a very shallow way, but it has no focus, poorer humour and characters, and little reason to exist beyond showing some fairly cool robot and monster scenes.Avoid unless you're an absolutely diehard fan of the genre; even then, some disappointment with this film is very likely.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The general consensus seemed to be ""meh."" I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Was it perfect? No. Could some of the writing have been better? Absolutely. But I knew what kind of film I was going into. I wasn't going into some intellectual film made to made you think. I was going into a cheesy popcorn flick, with action. And that's what I got. My expectations were met. I got exactly the kind of film I was hoping for. Was the first one better? Yes. Do I still like this one? Yes. It's a live action Saturday morning cartoon. Nothing more. If the first one was ""Transformers"" mixed with ""Godzilaa"", this is more of that, but with ""Power Rangers"" thrown in there as well. Without spoiling anything, I will say I wish the last scene had been left out, or put on the Bluray as an alternate ending, because if the studio decides they don't want to make a 3rd one, that last scene was pointless and I will be disappointed. John Boyega was one of the best parts of this movie. His character is well written and you understand why he does what he does. He was actually the most interesting character in the movie. John Boyega has come a long way since ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and that was only 3 years ago. (He was also producer on this film as well. Good for him!) If you enjoyed the first one, you'll get pretty much of the same. Nothing more. Nothing less. It is on par with the first one. Neither better nor worse.

Any moment of tension or drama (including characters' deaths) is immediately undercut by a quip or a cutaway to the essentially 'comic-relief' villain, presumably to avoid distressing the audience. The derivative script is full of strained banter, predictable 'sassy-talkback', and deadening clichés and, at times, the imagery is not much better, with the mechas striking heroic poses and flailing around with their various 'melee' weapons as they fight the same craggy, poorly defined monsters that they scrapped with in the original (although I agree with comments that the sfx team deserves credit for generating many scenes in bright light rather than in the dark, underwater, or in pouring rain as was often the case in the original). The acting is on par with the material, with no one going much beyond a hackneyed plug-in genre character. I am decades past the film's target audience but, as a lifelong fan of kaiju films, I'd be fully prepared to enjoy it if it was any good, but it's not, so I'll check it off my life-list and forget about it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I stayed away from the movie theater thanx to hateful critics and I regret it. 
Seat back, relax and pump up the surround sound because the action sequences are excellent, the sound is exhilarating and on cadence with the action. 
It doesn't matter if this is for kids, it is action packed and many times better than other robot movies (looking at you transformers sequels ) If you want a grown up soul touching story then just go watch an old Oscar winning movie because this movie is about the action and one liners, good'ol Hollywood style.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

From there much of this feels ripped off from a Transformers movie than any of the nuanced work Guillermo del Toro did before. Steven DeKnight takes over directing. He starts out with a fun chase but by the time we get to the hour long final action sequence, I felt more than pummeled. John Boyega does a decent job, this is more life i've seen out of him since ""Attack the Block"". Compared to Elba though, it's clear inspiring skips a generation. Scott Eastwood and the rest of the cast fair much worse, they're so non-existant you forget they're in the movie when not on screen.Except Charlie Day of course whose always a fun watch and gets the best line in the movie; ""Giant robots again, real original guys."" Overall ""Uprising"" is a movie that starts kinda fun but quickly starts to feel like an overlong ""Power Ranger"" episode. That's why 2 out of 4 guys.

There is many problems with this sequence, for instance, the characters lack of depth, incoherent story, ridiculous fantasy, the dialogue dos not make any sense most of the time, and really really really stupid drama. in fact, there is not a single element one can enjoy in this movie.
honestly I would give it a zero, but the cgi still good, so this movie get one star for the cgi work.
although the cgi is good, however, no one should waste two hours watching this none-sense movie.
I consider myself a good critique, and most of my friends like my reviews about movies, and usually I can make a good points about a given movie or tv show. So my advise, don't watch this movie unless if you wanna enjoy some cgi and your feel really board, otherwise, don't bother. Finally, I only write review if the movie is extremely good or extremely bad, and my goal is to save people time before spending couple of hours and than regret it, and I'm writing about this one because it's clearly bad.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In itself, a very predictable and typical argument, at least we hope that the action scenes or the fights against the kaijus will be trained and unique, but no, we don't have that either.Following the bad tradition of ruining a saga in the sequel, Uprising is a bad joke for the fans of the original movie. Pacific Rim stood out for its fantastic effects and intense, well-coordinated combat scenes, with a physical realism never seen before in movies of giant monsters fighting. Del Toro did an excellent job with the original, however I think he cries secretly after having discovered how the sequel to his work ended.The action is quite mediocre, without the same realism in the physics that we had before, with some quite dry choreographies and without intense action, the story itself is... bad, it simply sounds like something that anyone with no experience in cinema can do to try to create any sequel, it doesn't sound like something done with passion or respect for the director's original work. Even so, despite all those negative things, one is still missing, which is the tip of the cake. The protagonists, the characters; they are so annoying and cliché that we simply can't feel sympathy at any time for this, leaving the side that there is zero progress in their development in a reasonable way. They don't even have enough time on screen for us to worry about them, they are all irritating teenagers that in the end the only thing they managed to provoke in me is that I support the Kaijus more. It is a terrible attempt to follow the good step that Pacific Rim had left, with Uprising I would like to think that it never happened, but it did happen.

This sequel on the other hand is like most sequels from movies like that, just bland, you just watch it because you saw the first one. You suspect they will make a third one and you wonder if you will watch that one. You probably will without much expectations, and I probably will also. In Pacific Rim: Uprising the acting isn't great, not awful but not great. Scott Eastwood looks like his father, there's no denying on who his real father is, but the acting isn't the same. The plot is kinda boring but you just watch it anyway. The CGI's are exactly what I was expecting from a big production like that, a bit like another Transformers movie. It's rare that a sequel outclasses it's predecessor and in this case it just confirms that. And yes there probably will be a third one, not very looking forward to that one to be honest.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The final scene is where all the good stuff happens but by the time you get there it just feels dull and you are too annoyed and too bored to care. Mind you, the original does not have that much action scenes either but at least the ones we got were really amazing to see and the movie kept your interest with very likable characters and very great storytelling. You were very entertained by the way Guillermo Del Toro crafted his scenes and his plot.
Pacific Rim Uprising is what it would look like if Michael Bay made a pacific rim movie. all the problems with Transformers are here as well. 
you have long parts of the movie where nothing interesting is happening. You get some background into the new plot but it just feels very boring. 
 you have unlikable characters that you do not care about, John Boyega is annoying and acts creepy towards a younger character. Scott Eastwood doesnt add anything memorable. None of the new younger characters are given any real time for you to care and I honestly forgot about half of them already.
The action scenes were okay but the Jaegers dont feel real this time around. The action scenes look like cutscenes from a videogame. the robots dont have any weight. they feel like dolls.
And this movie Also ruins big plot points of the first movie. They say stuff that makes the first movie not make any sense anymore. they literally add stuff that goes against the plot of the first. this movie literall ruins the story of the first one by adding eplanations for the Kaiju and adding motivations for the characters of the first one that do not make any sense. 
This movie is really long, it is really boring. the suits look horrible, the CGI looks cheap because of the sunlight in the movie, the characters are annoying and unlikable, the Jaegers dont feel real anymore. this just ruined the franchise completely","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

In the present day, Jake makes his money by wheeling and dealing with stolen Jaeger parts from a decommissioned site, but it appears that he has a rival when he tracks down a young girl Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny) whom is building her own Jaeger in anticipation of an attack from the Kaiju. When both are caught for using an unlicensed Jaeger, they are given a choice; either take part in a programme as trainer and recruit respectively or face jail time, they choose the former and whilst everyone is awaiting an attack from the Kaiju, it appears that the real threat is much closer to home...Having enjoyed the original film (which to my surprise was met with mixed/largely negative reception) I looked forward to this sequel and was hoping for a decent expansion/continuation of the story, but sadly I just did not get as much out of this sequel as I did with the first film.There are a whole host of problems with this film; it isn't as emotionally involving as the first film (despite the various attempts that are made to wring out emotion), the characters aren't as interesting or particularly well developed and despite my best efforts I just couldn't get involved in the story and just didn't find it all that interesting. Director Steven S DeKnight has perhaps tried to emulate Del Toro's style as director in the original film (as one of the producers one can assume that Del Toro must have had some involvement in this side of proceedings), but it simply doesn't work as well here. The mind-meld sequences don't hit home in the same way here as they did in the original film and DeKnight's haphazard approach to directing and writing also doesn't help - he pulls the film in far too many directions and if I'm honest buy the time I'd realised where the film was ultimately going I really didn't care all that much.Still as a very basic film it is perfectly acceptable and watchable; a lot of the action sequences are fairly well-handled and despite some rather muddled plotting the film is relatively well-paced. The characters, whilst not being particularly interesting, at least do have a fairly good camaraderie (with some in jokey humour which is mostly hit with some miss) and to their credit they are a fairly likeable bunch.Still despite some of its very basic strengths this is not a particularly good film as the story is rather muddled, threadbare and fairly uninteresting. Therefore it's left to the visuals and action sequences to carry the film (this was the case in the first film, but I felt they complimented the first film rather than carried it). It's noticeably weaker than the first film and whilst it isn't unwatchable - it moves too well to render it boring, but at the same time with a fairly dull narrative Pacific Rim: Uprising is little more than visual eye candy.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But, alas, the execution is entirely lacking. The great ideas are wasted in a plot heavy-laden with trope after predictable trope, the dialogue is cookie cutter, and the action brings nothing new to the table. As an example, compare John Boyega's inspirational speech bear the end with Idris Elba's From the first movie. Elba gave us ""The Apocalypse has been cancelled!"" The speech in the sequel was so poorly written and uninspiring, I can't remember a word if it. If you watch Boyega in Attack the Block, where he had a real story and real dialogue to deliver, then watch this, you'd have trouble convincing yourself it's the same actor.

The first film by the great Del Toro is alot better.John Boyega is just cool & is a very good actor & i liked him from his breakthrough role as Moses in Attack the Block (2011) so i knew this guy would make it big & he did so yeah he is a great rebellious lead & a nice guy character & Scott Eastwood makes a good solid more serious lead next to John who is more fun so they do make a good team & friends on screen.The monster are cool nothing amazing just good to fight against really & the big robots look cool pretty much the same as the first film in alot of ways just all set 10 yrs later but uprising does have a very cool slick edge to it & that's because of John Boyega as the lead & the start is very fun & cool because of his performance so yes he carries the whole movie & is a great lead.So yes uprising is a good fun Action packed sci-fi adventure but nothing really special like i said & it often feels like a Transformers film mixed with power rangers but it's solid fun but i will make one big complaint & THAT'S I'm sick & bored of seeing c.g.i cities being destroyed by fighting in the city it's very boring now & is in every big budget movie going like all the Transformers films & Marvel & Dc films & many many more it's very repetitive & boring & cheap looking now!!!
The Pacific rim franchise seems to be hard work as it's nothing exciting & each film is hard work to get through it gets very boring at times","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Gone are the vibrant neon lights, rainy Asian cityscapes, genuinely imposing machines, and cubist characteristics of Guillermo del Toro's ""robots vs. kaiju"" extravaganza Pacific Rim. Its sequel, Pacific Rim: Uprising, looks like any other sci-fi action film while barely functioning as a film in general, only fulfilling the criteria of having noises and images.I can only think of one improvement: the weakest aspect of the first film was no doubt Charlie Hunnam, who ends up quite dull in most of the things I see him in, no matter who stands behind the camera. This time around, our hero is John Boyega, which doesn't help as much as it should.Returing favorites include Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori, once a pilot of the Jaegers (the colossi used by mankind to fight monsters, piloted by two persons linked mentally via ""drifting"" technology) and Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as the two scientists who so rarely got along. Note also a severe lack of Hannibal Chau, or the now deceased Stacker Pentecost, the son of whom Boyega plays. Scott Eastwood plays Boyega's former Jaeger co-pilot, who reveals to him that times are changing in the world of kaiju-battling machines. Cailee Spaeny, Jing Tian, Adria Arjona, and other diverse faces also appear.The plot involves an impending drone protocol that's sure to make the Jaegers obsolete, as well as a character from the last film being transformed into a villain with a generic evil plan, and a connection with those responsible for the kaiju.None of this is especially memorable and I had to enlist the help of Wikipedia's needlessly detailed plot summaries to correctly recall certain deets. The music needs more Djawadi. The visuals more Del Toro. The characters have few notes to offer whenever they aren't providing callbacks to the previous film. Should I praise the fact that the cast is at least diverse, even though the decision seems based on the fact that movies like this do well in China (normally not a nice place to try out black representation)?The first movie also provided Asian imagery and performers (not necessarily just Chinese), although it seemed more to do with the love letter Del Toro was writing to kaiju cinema. I read somewhere that the original Pacific Rim was when Hollywood first realized just how lucrative and useful ""pandering to the Chinese market"" is, especially when the movie does poorly domestically. This could be wrong; I wouldn't be shocked if it wasn't.Pacific Rim Uprising is certainly not essential viewing. Action-packed images, plots, and so-called ""characters"" like these can be found just about anywhere else. However, if teenagers or any of their equals desire something that's visually similar to Transformers but takes their intellects more seriously and is less absurdly offensive, this works fine. Not that they care.For the record, I don't quite admire the first Pacific Rim as much as I did during my initial viewing (as Del Toro films go, I prefer The Shape of Water although my initial ratings may fool you), mainly as it needed to be cheesier. Compared to this, though, it still looks like quite a masterpiece. Thanks for that, Uprising.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In some ways I actually liked this movie more than the first one.Sure, the underlying story is totally ludicrous. Come one, fighting giant monster with big clumsy robots that requires two people in some strange mind melt to maneuver is just ridiculous. Just send in a couple of fighter jets with some suitable devices that go boom and be done with it. But then, the purpose of these movies are to show off giant robot special effects and on that note they certainly deliver.This installment in the franchise seems to be more geared towards the younger audience as far as the story and the cast goes. Some people like it, some don't. Personally I'm fairly neutral.As with the previous movie the story is not really that much to write home about. It has plot holes big enough to drive I giant robot through. I just had to say that didn't I? Still, there are some parts of this story that I liked better than the first one. It is a quite straightforward story with clear heroes, clear bad guys.It does not really have any of that lazy stupid plot twist where some dumb ass politicians are trying to shut down the program to save money. Sure the program is in some danger but this time it is due to a new program that actually sounds reasonable and could improve things. Of course said program gets sabotaged but hey, we, the audience, want our big silly robots right?The story is also mostly devoid of any stupid SJW crap or silly green preaching. The ridiculous crap about Dinosaurs being the first invasion and that we had terraformed the planet (global warming and all that stuff) so a second invasion was more likely to succeed was just an insult to the more intelligent among the audience and took off a star or two from the first movie for me.On the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. It delivered where it counts, that is in the special effects department. Loads and loads of special effects mostly involving giant robots and Kaijus slugging it out with massive property damage as a result. They are literally beating each other up with skyscrapers for Christ sake!The story, acting and everything else is adequate. Nothing more and nothing less. I do miss some colorful characters like Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman) from the first movie. The characters in this one was more bland that has to be said.It seems like a lot of people on IMDb and elsewhere have their pants in a twist over this movie and rates it one or two stars out of ten. That's just nonsense. A one star rating is for a movie that is truly awful in all aspects. The special effects alone elevates this movie above one star. You might not like the turn towards the younger audience or something else in the movie but it still does not make it a one star movie.Sure if you are not a science fiction or fantasy fan and do not care about special effects then I guess you could feel this is an awful movie but then why did you watch it in the first place? It is the second installment in the franchise so it should come as no surprise that the movie lives and dies by it's special effects.I would say that if you like giant robots, monsters and special effects and don't mind a fairly thin story aimed for the slightly younger audience then there is a fair change that you will find this movie entertaining.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

A long majority of the film is spent outside the giant mechs, doting over a slew of thin, bland, mostly-new focal figures instead.It seems frightened to cut loose, withholding the payout for fear it can't measure up. Those worries are well-founded. Once the monster threat finally rears its head and the city block-sized laser swords start flying, Uprising is a pale impersonation. Gone are the unique, individualized robotic designs of the previous film, replaced with a standardized set of forms that would easily run together in action scenes without their helpfully colorful paint jobs.Well-founded rules and restrictions for the universe, an important set of boundaries established and obeyed in the first film, are hand-waved away as soon as it's convenient to do so. What few returning characters remain are reduced to simple archetypes, emotionlessly going through the motions alongside the new cast members. It isn't even all that much fun to watch, despite all the flashing lights, rumbling buildings and well-trodden action movie conventions. A pointless sequel that does nothing new and actively resists many aspects of the original - why bother at all?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, this sequel made no attempt to engage with any of the concepts that made the original compelling. The connective tissue of Pacific Rim was the emotional bond between the characters: the movie wasn't about giant robots, it was about desperate, flawed people in a seemingly impossible situation slowly learning to trust and support one another to achieve something greater than themselves. The giant robots were just a cool aesthetic vehicle though which to tell a very touching story. Pacific Rim Uprising was just a movie about giant robots, and it didn't even do that part well. The jaegers had none of the character of the originals, and the fight scenes were mostly visual noise frequently interrupted by cuts to other, even less interesting scenes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

DeKnight in contrast to the first. Main actors of this film are Scott Eastwood, John Boyega and Cailee Spaeny. The genre of Pacific Rim: Uprising is science fiction. The action takes place ten years after the events of the first film in 2035. First part has the happy ending, but in the second part new adventures are associated with the case from the first part.
All story is connected with the robots, which were created by people to protect humanity from humanoid monsters called Kaiju. One example is Godzilla, who is similar to monsters in this movie. In the new part, people created a robot control function with remote control, unlike the earlier known robot control in a special cabin that was in his head. But this decision will be followed by irreversible circumstances. However, people created new generations of robots with unique weapons and abilities.
Pacific Rim: Uprising surprised me with the number of special effects, insane graphics - which was missing in the first part. In this film every detail was worked out and it is very good. Also, the actors were competently selected. In the film, there were no people who had already lit up in a large number of films of another genre, such as Mark Wahlberg from the last part of the Transformers. In some moments the film has a sharp plot twist that reveals and complements the main storyline of the film; also, these moments can't be always predictable.
I can say with great confidence that I recommend that this movie to science fiction fans in conjunction with the militant. But, I believe that it is best to start watching the film from the first part to understand the whole meaning of the film and all the ""Easter eggs"" of the film. I give 10/10 to Pacific Rim: Uprising.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

"4","/10","A Colossal Letdown","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5928574/?ref_=tt_urv","Darkside-Reviewer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur100147162/?ref_=tt_urv","23 July 2020","Pacific Rim (2013) was a very enjoyable movie that combined two awsome ideas Colossal sized monsters and Colossal sized robots piloted by humans. Every kid who grew up in the 80s and 90s watching TV shows like Transformers and Godzilla wanted a movie like this to be made. In 2013 Pacific Rim finally gave us a kick ass movie for adults about Colossal sized robots fighting Colossal sized monsters and with Guillermo del Toro as the director we weren't let down by the end result.Pacific Rim (2013) made a lot of money at the box office and got decent reviews so of course that means there has to be a sequel that capitalises on it's success thus Pacific Rim Uprising was released in (2018) five years after the original movie.Only a handful of the original cast members returned for this sequel and one of the main characters from the original Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) was written out of the franchise his character gets no resolution or even an acknowledgement in this sequel he simply dissappears. As for the remaining characters Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) is killed off in the first thirty minutes of the movie after less than three minutes of screen time and only a few lines of dialogue. The two mad scientists from the first movie Dr Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) and Dr Newton Geisler (Charlie Day) are the only two original characters left in the movie by the thirty minute mark and they are honestly the most likable and interesting characters in the entire movie without them this movie would have been so much worse.The first movie was geared more towards adult audiences and included monsters being shot full of holes by plasma cannons, punched, decapitated, impaled and even cut in half of course the blood was blue to avoid an R rating but it was still enjoyably violent. Pacific Rim Uprising mainly features the Jaeger robots fighting each other so it's all sparks and falling metal parts. Only in the last twenty minutes of the movie is there a fight with the Kaiju monsters and while there is some blood and some okay fight scenes the violence is toned down for a more kid friendly audience making the fight more like an episode of the Power Rangers than Pacific Rim.The cast includes (John Boyega) and (Cailee Spaeny) who are basically just comedy characters with unlikeable personalitys. The supporting cast are pretty much the same teenagers who break the rules, fight and save the day at the end.This isn't a Pacific Rim movie this is just Transformers 2 Revenge of the Fallen only the robots are piloted by teenagers and John Boyega but with the exact same unlikeable personalitys, lame jokes and child friendly action scenes that make Rock Em Sock Em Robot toys look more badass.I don't recommend watching this movie if you enjoyed the first Pacific Rim. This movie killed the franchise so hopefully we won't have to suffer anymore bad sequels.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Copping out at every turn and displaying a complete lack of trust in its audience, the script to this sequel immediately devolves into spelling out everything that its viewers need to know (either through blunt voiceovers or on-the-nose dialogue). This sets the tone for the entire movie as we're exposed to every cliché in the book (an exhausted plot line and flat supporting characters) as well as inattentive techniques (negligent pacing, transitions and effects). There may be some thrilling fights and the cool monsters but the entire ride rings hollow all the way through.While the design and potential of Pacific Rim: Uprising may have many wanting to give it a shot, its void of substance limits the film to only the shallowest of successes. In the vain of Transformers or the Fast & Furious franchise, this film has oodles of popcorn appeal and a major absence of craft or distinction. Pacific Rim: Uprising is fun at times but, just like its over-indulgent action sequences, the film is wholly unoriginal and bordering on insulting.Writing: 4/10

You'll see this to be true with in the first five minutes of the show and wonder if it's going to get better but that's because you were optimistic!It gets worse and worse and worse like a real low grade director took over the sequel and didn't know what to do so anything that cut a laugh or looked good he merely added 10,000 of the same thing and then figuring he was going to lose his core audience he catered to the youngest audience . I actually think high school students will laugh at it and be insulted by it.If you acted in this movie it is nothing to put onto your resumeI was upset that I didn't have a chance to go to the theater to see it because I liked the first one pretty much 75% but there still was too much bravado, and character development work compared to the actual thrill and science fiction of the thing. I'm not looking to like the characters or find one that cracks me up or some brokenhearted love story I'm looking for adventure and science fiction and these movies don't deliver it.If you like RoboCop and you saw all of them then this is worse than RoboCop 3!If you saw that and you understand my comment you're not even going to start this movie .It does however have one redeeming thing.I saw it on cable so I spent zero dollars and I still feel ripped off !","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story is a clusterfu**, most of the characters are lame, but John Boyega carries the film with his charm. He's invested and having a lot of fun. The robot fights are fairly well done despite the fact that they've cheapened how the interiors of the Jaeger, and all the action scenes take place during the day for some reason. It is not the sequel Pacific Rim should have had, but it will at least scratch your itch of big robots fighting monsters, if you have one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

For this sequel you have to be a kid to really enjoy. The first film was a great example of what a movie in this often disappointing genre could be. Unfortunately this film falls in with the rest of the disappointments. I kept wondering if the director had actually paid attention to the first film. I of course didn't expect him to make a Guillermo film but was interested on what his own unique approach would be to the franchise. He removed the unique human element and great attention to detail the first film had and didn't replace it with anything, leaving us with a dumbed down, run of the mill genre film. It's not the worst (transformers), and definitely not the best.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The only problem is, 'Uprising' is even a worse effort than its predecessor.The real draw in this film is supposed to be the battle between the next generation of Kaiju and Jaeger pilots, chiefly John Boyega and Scott Eastwood in roles that were actually well suited for them. The other fresh face here is young rebel Amarra (Cailee Spaeny), who tries to prove her ability as a pilot despite her age. And then we have Charlie Day, who abandons his facial hair but holds onto his fingernails voice in a ""really, man?"" reprisal of Dr. Newton Geiszler. Altogether, this is definitely a motley crew of a cast, and it kind of shows.There's really not much to write home about in 'Uprising,' as it comes off feeling like a desperate attempt for a cash grab to suck every penny out of a franchise that never really existed to begin with. Sure, Guillermo del Toro takes great pride in the monsters he conceptualizes, but even those feel like an afterthought in this film. It's also impossible to really form any sense of attachment to any of the characters portrayed here, so that leaves audiences with very little to latch onto.It's not like anyone expected 'Pacific Rim: Uprising' to be a masterpiece. But the laziness displayed here is on another level.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

At the helm of the Jaeger project, Stacker Pentecost, who gave up his life to save humanity from extinction from the monsters that ruled the Pacific. 
 Now we come to 2018, Stacker Pentecost's only heir, Jake (Boyega) takes up the reins after being out of the picture for almost 5 years due to his dad's obsession of defeating the Kaiju. Now the Kaiju have come back with a vengeance to destroy humanity once and for all. But through an unlikely source, one of their own, a human traitor is channeling the enemy to bring down the humanity once and for all. 
 This movie rocked. With John Boyega at the helm of the cast, anything goes. I must give Steven DeKnight his props, of this being his directorial debut, he did an amazing job from the cinematography down to the little of CGI. If there is a 3rd movie in this realm, it's going to be out of this world. Not more that I can say, but I loved this movie.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

But in fact I liked it, this is a faithful sequel. And it has the two crazy guys, so my score is mostly for those guys because they were perfect, they brought so much to the first film and they carry on with the utter inanity here, those two guys just work well together regardless of who directed them  And of course this is aimed more toward kids, with all of these young actors playing recruits. But they don't take over the entire plot like I was expecting them to. It's too bad Guillermo did not participate in this one as well, but he had other things to do. This movie doesn't have the high quality stamp that a Del Toro movie has, but due to the first half of the movie that I just watched right now, The story being told here is way over the top of the rails. It's a direction the story went that I accept based on what happened in the first film, I felt it was plausible. There are a lot of surprises in, things that you wouldn't expect and it was all handled well. Unfortunately the special effects we're not handled as well as they were on the first photo realistic film. Despite these issues, I am enjoying this quite a bit. And it deserves the rating I just gave it. I eagerly await the flood of nonhelpfuls, but this movie really isn't as bad as all that, none of the negative reviews I read give a valid reason why this isn't very good other than ""they hated it"", of course it's not as good as the first one, but is certainly not horrible or bad. I mean this is not like Star Wars episodes one through three at all: and that is exactly what I was expecting. It is done well for not undergoing the meticulous direction that Del Toro would have put into it. And the director is only experienced with television shows and as a writer, but I am familiar with his work especially with ""Dollhouse"", he penned one of the best episodes of that, one that became iconic for that show. So much that it was used for publicity. And he had experience as a consulting producer and as a director as well. It's different experience than Del Toro, but he did a lot here to make continuity between the first film and this one. We are missing some of his incredibly bizarre creature design which Del Toro always handles by himself in most of his films, but he did great homage to Del Toro's work. And if you look outside of IMDb, other reviewer's have given it a better rating. Not to mention it made all of its money back which it certainly would not have done had been as bad as they say. This is another film that I heard about because of the people talking about it and what I heard was not ""I hate this"", but rather that they were surprised that they liked it, like me. I don't care if I am the only reviewer on iMDB that liked it, but I did. And nobody is going to take that from me.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

I want to point out that the plot is different. The character arcs are different. That basically means it's not the same movie.The first movie showcased all of Guillermo's signature style. It had strong creature concepts and visual design. He is good at world building in that one part of the world is very well built, while the rest of the film's universe is undeveloped all together.It also suffered from his greatest weaknesses in that his characters are shallow and copy tropes.That is not to say the first one was a bad movie. I just wished it did things differently to be better.This movie fixes one of the greatest flaws of the first movie. It sets up expectations of a grand fight between the Jaeger and the Kaiju, but most of the fights end quickly. I got excited for nothing. Who can remember the Typhoon Jaeger and its triplet pilots getting killed in less time than the film spent introducing them?The characters in this movie feel more balanced. Boyega's character, Jake, is the son of Elba's character in the first movie. Jake was trying to live up to his father's legend.A new main character introduced in this movie is Amara. We are introduced to her as a Jaeger parts scavenger and tinkerer with unique talent.We are introduced to aspiring Jaeger pilots, who are training for a specialized role in a world where Jaeger pilots weren't probably necessary any more. They haven't figured things out yet, but they're giving it all.As the world tries to move on, a new threat strikes from nowhere, and suddenly the Precursors (the bad guys from the first movie) and Kaiju are back.For all of the things this sequel does better than the original -- complete character arcs, an intrigue subplot, themes of courage and loyalty, a more balanced contributions from the minor characters -- it deserves a score higher than a 5. I give it an 8, because it stays true to the universe and to the characters, while having a more complete plot and better stories in the fights. (That last kill, though, should not have been telegraphed.)","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

"8","/10","An action movie as it's meant to be done","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4214901/?ref_=tt_urv","erik_eklof","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur59654961/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2018","Pacific Rim: Uprising, and more broadly, Pacific Rim in general, is perhaps the epitome of action cliché. It delivers on all the fronts an action movie needs to deliver on. I feel that most people rate this movie unfairly, as they come into it with the same mindset as they would with a Kubrick thriller. But I came to watch giant robots slug it out with giant monsters, and boy did I get what I came for. This movie, like any good action, delivers its feeling primarily through the action, not through the storytelling or the plot. However, I must add that Pacific Rim 2 didn't actually do that bad a job in either of those departments. It was relatively readable, predictable, and, as mentioned, cliché, however it did a good enough job to keep the viewer (me) questioning my theories throughout the duration of the film. The final ending could have been paced a little better in my eyes, however. It felt as if they had run out of script at the very end and were filling for time.In conclusion, I felt that too many of the critics came into this movie expecting a Léonesque action drama one could analyze and critique to no end. In order to enjoy such a movie one must take off their coat, replace their whiskey with soda and take a careless dive into a bucket of popcorn. Ease off, this is the kind of movie that fills you with that same childlike creativity and imagination that I can tell some of these other reviewers have probably lacked for quite a number of years.If anyone needs me, I will be in my study, doodling Jägers and Kaiju to my heart's content.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

John Boyega steps into the lead role as Jake Pentecost, injecting charisma and humor into the film. The action sequences are a definite highlight, with the Jaegers showcasing impressive new tricks to combat the relentless Kaiju threat.However, ""Uprising"" sacrifices some of the original's depth for more straightforward blockbuster entertainment. The mythology and world-building take a backseat, and the plot occasionally feels rushed. Despite this, if you're looking for a fun, adrenaline-pumping ride filled with giant robots and monstrous creatures, ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" delivers on that front, making it a worthy sequel for fans of the franchise.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Shyrley Rodriguez and her bond with the younger Cailee :). That broish black haired ""bro""-saying Latina (who's anything but a Rodriguez, and is likely Roman, not Spaniard) coached her little powerpuff baby in a role (given one training video). That to me is the essence of big sis and her bros/their little sis, which is demonstrated in this movie. It's ""Seinfeld""ian.

I almost didn't watch it because of the very poor score. Having gone to see the original film twice, I wanted to remember that rather than a bad sequel.But this is actually almost as good. The only things I'd criticize are the prehistoric plot devices of a locker-room fight between two young pilots (will screenwriters ever tire of that?) and the absurdity of a young woman having built her own giant robot.It's also true that nothing here quite comes up to the originality (how could it?) and impact of the original. But the special effects are impressive, the direction moves along, and the plot is no worse.I'm giving it an 8, because there's no way to directly assign the 7.3 it deserves, and I'd rather round up than down on this one. And a thank-you to the producers.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

But I almost felt like fast-forwarding through the climax fight. And the overcrowding of Chinese characters in the film seems like a desperate attempt to pander to the Chinese and make sure the film runs in China.The screenplay is interesting in pieces though- typical underdog-helps-save-the-earth.
