Sure, if it was released say, in 1970, when none of the superhero/sci-fi/fantasy that today is flooding the audiences was present, it would have been quite enjoyable and watchable.
But in today's market it brings nothing new. I could constantly guess what was going to happen at the end of certain action scenes, and don't even get me started about the helicopter scene... that one was supposed to be dramatic and some kind of fitting twist but just left me enraged at the stupidity of the screenwriters/adaptation.In the end it's quality is on par with the other 2 similar series (Divergent and Hunger Games), so, gets a 5 star ""meh"" out of me. Good for kids but intelligent people beware!","268 out of 351 found this helpful.

I refuse to believe any fans of the first two could honestly think this movie deserves anything near that low. A 1 or 2 out of 10 would be something like Troll 2, not The Death Cure. There were definitely a few scenes where I predicted what was going to happen. Big deal, that happens in most movies these days. It's 2018, I dare ANYONE to write a movie without a scene or two like that. There are only so many possible outcomes to a scene. The love story frustrated me, but I don't really hold that too much against the movie. I expected things to go one way, they didn't. The way they did go is hard for me to relate to due to the character development, or lack thereof in this instance. The action is awesome. The movie is long, but didn't feel that way at all. I have to laugh at all the reviewers with the attention span of a gnat crying about the run time. 
Those people are the reasons we see so many movies squashed into two hour max time limits, which severely screws up a LOT of movies. Well, thank the impatient people that can't go more than 2 hours without checking their social media. Maybe the all theaters need to start having intermissions so all the people with unhealthy phone addictions can get a quick fix. That way we won't have to have all our movies limited to less than two hours by the studios, making many of them a jumbled mess with obvious material cut out?The ending of this finale was fitting, I enjoyed the letter from Newt. It did a great job of bringing you back to their beginning in the Glade and reminding you just how far our first group has come from the minute they were shot up an elevator with no memory or identity. So, if you enjoyed the first two I think you will enjoy this one as well. I am not sure what the 1 and 2 out of 10 reviewers were expecting, but this movie deserves at least a 7 rating IMO. It's pretty close as far as the avg rating goes, even with the ridiculously low ratings by the impatient minds out there. I refuse to bump my rating up to imbalance those who rate movies like a child crying for a candy bar at the checkout aisle.  If a 10 dollar movie ticket is going to make you feel like you broke the bank if you don't end up loving the movie, wait and catch it on RedBox. Don't take it out on the movie with a ridiculously low rating. 7/10, a much better finale than Hunger Games got.","70 out of 101 found this helpful.

It's not that I think this trilogy is among the best post apocalyptic series nor did I really have an ounce of excitement going in, but after Dylan O'Brien had his accident and over 2 years of fans waiting, the ending is here.If I'm being completely honest, The Death Cure actually served as a perfectly fitting end to an above average young adult series. I don't consider myself a fan per say, but if I was, I'm guessing I would absolutely love this film. It ties up loose ends and finds a way to close out the series in a surprisingly emotional send-off. It's much different than say The Hunger Games, which ended the series on a completely sour and disappointingly safe note, The Death Cure takes some chances and didn't have the beat for beat moments I expected from a YA adaptation. O'Brien, who is shaping himself out to be a force in this business, provided another solid lead performance and he's surrounded by equally efficient turns from Kaya Scodelario, Aidan Gillen, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Giancarlo Esposito, and Rosa Salazar. None of them take the material too seriously, something the Divergent series had a problem with, but they found a right balance of heart and humor.It's far from perfect, and for those who don't appreciate a good YA adaptation every once in awhile likely won't find anything here to like, but The Death Cure was immensely better than I expected. Sometimes that's all you need a film to be.6.9/10","94 out of 144 found this helpful.

Actually, the film creates a strong story meaning of friendship between this entire group that started as strangers that had to learn how to trust eachother. It's not just like any other teenager movie, like the hunger games or the divergent in which this kids are destined to compete and kill eachother. In this movie though, this group of young people fight and look to find a solution (by not torturing teenagers) for a possible real life situation (apocalypse) and a serious problem that the world is dealing with in that moment. Secondly, I understand the point that you think Dylan O'Brien acting is mediocre, however, for an actor who has never been to an acting school, I think he has developed and progressed alot ever since his first role in Teen Wolf. So don't just criticize his acting abilities, for not expressing well, because his role has a very complex persona to interpret (and never forget...he is still learning).","52 out of 97 found this helpful.

The 2nd movie was a bit of a coming to age for the cast through the hardships they had gone through, and some great additions to the cast. This last one is predictable, full of action but does hold some genuine surprises. I wasn't so idiotic to walk into these movies thinking they were made for me, someone who just turned 30. The movie cover for the first movie immediately informed me that I was not in the target demographic. This is a teen movie, riding the surf that The Hunger Games created. Once that was in my head I could switch off my brain a little and enjoy the movie for what it was. The same goes for this movie. It does hold tension, but it's very easy to guess the outcome of almost every scene. The one quarrel I do have with this film is the inclusion of some new characters that didn't make much sense, whilst not building up on some of the existing characters that had been introduced in the 2nd movie. Overall I have enjoyed this franchise. It hasn't been the most solid set of movies ever, but once again, I know I'm not the target demographic.","13 out of 21 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The best conclusion fans of the series could ever have","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4046921/?ref_=tt_urv","thevincercode","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur71507177/?ref_=tt_urv","29 January 2018","There is something about endings that I loathe. The feeling is doubled when I actually know how and when it ends. With The Death Cure as the conclusion to The Maze Runner series, that is exactly what I felt - as if there's a countdown that licks every second in front of my face.If you haven't watched the two previous films then there is no chance that you'd get a grasp of what's happening. They didn't waste time to get catch you up, or remind you if you forget, that the movie was set in a world that is a wasteland and that the whole human race is at the brink of extinction because of a virus called The Flare.In a nutshell, as you may remember from The Scorch Trials, Thomas and the Gladers successfully escaped the Maze but ended up being followed by WCKD at the last part with aide of Teresa. We saw that Minho and most of the remaining teens were taken on a plane by armed men that work for WCKD. They were supposed to be transported to the Last City to be experimented for a Flare cure.This is where The Death Cure continues the story. The film opens with an action packed sequence where Thomas, Minho, and Frypan, along with Jorge and Brenda, try to hijack the train that will bring Minho and the others to WCKD's headquarters in the Last City. Determined to start over again without WCKD's experimenting, the group would face off several challenges along the way including running away with Cranks and getting inside the heavily guarded wall of the Last City. Along the way, they would find and lost friends; a long lost Glader thought to be dead that would end up helping them and people dear to them, respectively. What lies ahead will either bring the immunes a new hope or the only cure the dying world will get: death.I don't know about those unfamiliar with the films but fans of the book and series will get the conclusion they deserved. The producers have been generous enough to give fans 142 minutes for an ending after a 28-month hold.Wes Ball's approach and direction with the three films has evidently developed over the years. However, there is something missing about his vision for The Maze Runner Saga that I am realizing just now - attachment with audience. The films weren't strong enough to claw on the viewers. Character buildup wasn't really given focus on the entire series which makes it hard to form attachments if one haven't already established on the previous films.I like how T.S. Nowlin's screenplay closely followed the book but this last one was good but not good enough to leave a lasting impact even to a fan like me. This is not to say that I hate the film because personally think this is better than The Scorch Trials in many ways and Scorch was already an okay film for me. It's like a parting gift from a lover you won't even beg to stay.Nevertheless, there are many good things I liked about the film that I want to point out.First, the quirky dialogue. I liked how they sprinkled quirky lines on some critical parts of the film to serve as a comic relief. My personal favorite was Minho's ""Is this real?"" comment.Second, the production design and VFX. Props to the team for such good production design complemented with impressive visual effects. (However, I'm not quite satisfied with the sound design during intense scenes because it did not complement the intensity of the visuals.)Third, the good sequences. Although I have to admit that there were parts during the film that I zoned out because of the slow pacing on certain parts, they made several good sequences to compensate: the opening salvo with dangerous stunts on a moving train; the tunnel full of Cranks sequence; a bus full of teens suspended in the air by a crane. My favorite, though, was that emotional Tommy and Newt sequence that I knew was coming. The way they executed that sequence gave justice to that monumental part of the story.Fourth, the Acting. Dylan O'Brien has really matured as an actor. You can see that he's grown out of that goofy acting he's known for in Teen Wolf and that's what I quickly noticed at the beginning. Kaya Scodelario wasn't given much highlight this time, making her a mere eye candy on the background. Sangster and Lee were good actors giving life to such a good support team. Four years with this series made these actors grow with their character. Rosa Salazar was such a surprise to me. She pulled off her character very well and it's no surprise if she'll get roles on action films in the future.Fifth and what really got into me, the farewell letter at the end. I feel like that letter was the best send off they could give the fans. I mean, man I was thankful I got a VIP couch all on my own while I try to wipe my tears. That was a good cookie, I must say.Over all, The Death Cure was such an emotional action film fitting for an end to The Maze Runner series.P. S. could there be a TV series in stored in the future? James Dashner seems to be teasing on his tweet, though.","24 out of 44 found this helpful.

This movie may not have the best paced plot, or the most logical action/escape scenes, but it has a heart. It doesn't follow a group of heroes who set out to save the world; it follows a group of friends who just want to rescue one of their own, and are willing to put themselves at risk to do it. 
The main strength of the Death Cure in comparison to the other instalments is its ability to articulate the moral question at the heart of the whole series: Is it right to sacrifice your humanity in order to save lives? The series provides no clear answer, instead allowing the audience to empathise with both the protagonists' and antagonists' motives. Everyone (except maybe Janson) was just doing what they thought to be right. The scenes towards the end of the film, however, do highlight how disenfranchisement, caused as a result of WKCD's actions, can halt any progress and bring about destruction all the faster (a theme perhaps more relevant to the present day than 'the government is evil, let's take it down' i.e. The Hunger Games). 
Overall the film stays relatively true to the main themes of the novel, with only minor plot adjustments, and is an enjoyable and thought provoking watch. The ending scene is particularly powerful and brought many people in the cinema to tears.","63 out of 104 found this helpful.

I think I could safely say that the Maze runner series may just be the most solid of all the YA/dystopia series we have gotten recently. Even the one who started it all: ""The Hunger games"" seems to fall a little flat in its two part finale in spite of large going bigger than any of the other YA series ever were able to do so. We also had ""Twilight"", which needless to say was not well received and the ""Divergent series"" which fell so flat it is now turning into a TV series. THere are many other such examples, ""The City of bones"", ""The Giver""......But the gift that keeps on giving is the maze runner series, while never the most amazing films they were constantly very strong in spite of a slight slip in the second installation. I think another major point that was done well by the series is the way that it manages to establish drastically different tones, the first had a mysterious tone, the second a more horror tone while the death cure had a more emotional and sombre tone as it concludes the story and sees the departure of some of the characters.The Death cure picks up right in the middle of action as we are quickly reintroduced to the characters in a brilliant action sequence that instantly puts audiences right back into the story. In fact, the general pacing of the film was quick and high intensity, resulting in the fast paced and exciting end results that never really slows down unless to establish a reflective or emotional moment. Complete with a brilliant teen cast delivering wonderful performances including the aforementioned Dylan O'brien and many more. The Death cure was a wonderful end to a trilogy that has stayed fairly consistent, fun and exciting and is a wonderful example of the YA genre done right, unfortunately it likely also marks the end of the genre.","17 out of 38 found this helpful.

From being a fan of the books and the films I couldn't wait till the day came to see the closure. And yet I was so filled with anxiety and hoping they would patch things up from what was not done right in The Scorch Trials. However I am pleased to say this final chapter did NOT disappoint me. From sitting at the edge of my seat to feeling all the emotions one could have since following these characters for so long left be spellbinding.The acting was top notch, there was action non stop, the intensity was constantly there and so much more. I truly can't say enough how grateful I am to have known this series and having it all come to an end. It's both very bittersweet of a feeling and hard to see it go. But may it remain in our hearts and minds as the years go by and see that The Maze Runner truly finished with a well deserve and respectful ending. Thank you Wes Ball and James Dashner for making a story and film(s) come to life. I for one and truly grateful for the memories that it all brought me.

Yes, it's got all the shortcomings of lazy writing. Yes, it's all incredible beautiful teens fighting the evil uncaring adults who envy them their youth. And with all that, Maze Runner had something in the first movie that made me want to watch it. Some sort of story, maybe the acting, maybe the whole thing. I just enjoyed it. So I watched the second movie to see what happens and then this piece of crap from pure inertia. And it was just not worth it. Imagine two hours and twenty minutes that could have been compressed into a five minute How It Should Have Ended animation (which would have been better). Kids are good, WICKED is bad (duh!), bullets kind of care about that because they fly away from the good guys and things just happen to be where you need them to be for them to escape and not kill anyone, not even the bad guys, because they are the good guys. A lot of talk, a lot of talk, then some talk, followed by more talk. The last part of the movie has all the action sequences and they are all Michael Bayish. Bottom line: I don't think they even tried to make it a good movie. It was all algorithmic. Why end a series that at least started interesting with a twist, or some nice action, or anything resembling a story? No. Take any other YA movie and copy paste it over these characters. It's like creativity costs money for these people. It's like it hurts them, like the sun kills bugs. It was so boring that it wasn't even funny.","57 out of 91 found this helpful.

I hoped 'The Maze Runner' had more books so this amazing journey could go on. It's definitely one of the best movies based on young adult books. For example 'The Hunger Games' the first movie was great, i gave up after the second one, 'Divergent' the first movie was good, i gave up after the third one, but only watched it because it was a cheap marathon and i didn't watch the second one.

I also found the third movie really good!
It didnt follow the book completly but the main scenes were there. The third book is really good but there are som sci-fi things in it hat i wouldnt want in the movie cause it would simply be too weird. I think Wess did a really good job making the movie more ""realistic"" than the book without ruining the plot. i actually liked some of the scenes from the movie better than the books version. The deaths were more meaningful and emotional than the book made them especially the last death. (you know who). The action was really well made, The actors (espeically Dylan) did a really good job, and the plot was overall good. There was also some good character-developments. i was also more sattisfied with the movieendning than the book. it gave more closure. i definitly recommend watching the first two before watching this one to get a relation to the characters and a better understanding of the plot. Actually. If you have not seen the other movies or at least read the books dont watch this one. You simply wont understand the plot. Dont listen too much to the ratings. If you enjoy the books (and the movies) go watch it and see what YOU think!

Do not expect clever plot twists, intelligent dialogue or original and witty scenes Expect hollywood action movie cliche after cliche and just sit back, relax and enjoy the shooting, running, chasing and stuff getting blown up non-stop for more than 2 hours. This movie never stops when it comes to action, it starts with loads of it and never eases the tension, there's always something bigger happening, a remarkable achievement on that front.
 
 This movie has done an absolutely excellent job entertaining the target audience, more serious movie critics simply need to come down from their high horses and realize this movie is not to be taken seriously.

"7","/10","Maze Runner: The Death Cure is a fittingly epic closing chapter that might just be my personal favourite of the series.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4072932/?ref_=tt_urv","TheMovieDiorama","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur67902729/?ref_=tt_urv","24 February 2018","Another YA franchise completed (let us rejoice...), although 'The Maze Runner' series has actually been pretty decent from the start. A slight misfire with 'The Scorch Trials' but Wes Ball is back on track to get the job done in style. Thomas and the gang want to save his remaining friends from the Maze who are now being stored and tested on in the WCKD tower. They must infiltrate the walled city before the virus destroys all of humanity. I'm going against the critics on this one. Yes, it's overlong. Sure, it pretty much consists of an expositional script. Of course, certain plot points seemed unbelievable and convoluted. But do you know what? This is exactly what I wanted it to be. Epic. What a finale this was! It starts off with what looks like an action set piece from the 'Fast & Furious' franchise, then we go through an apocalyptic tunnel straight out of 'I Am Legend' to a futuristic city scape that resembled 'Blade Runner'. It borrows all these elements to create a satisfyingly entertaining flick. The visual grandeur has never looked so good, the series has come along way in terms of detailing the architecture and modernisation of this dystopian future. The first act starts off well, the second is a bit of a slog...but then the third act arrives. Oh yes! Moody, gritty and some surprising plot twists that made it even more enthralling. Flashing lights and piercing alarms whilst our characters shoot their way out of the WCKD building as a burning inferno rages on in the streets below. The ferocity was conveyed excellently, and the stakes were raised. All the cast members did a good job, particularly O'Brien and Brodie-Sangster's onscreen chemistry. Whilst all the action is taking place, there are moments of sadness. And yet again, I felt the feels. Maybe I'm getting emotionally vulnerable as I get older? Honestly though, I was expecting to hate this, yet I came out loving the series even more. My favourite chapter to date.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

""The Death Cure"" has got plenty of intense action packed scenes, very moving character moments & real depth that completely sucks you into their world.The opening train rescue scene was absolutely fantastic & exciting!!!
The ending of this movie is intense, emotional,tragic & epic.The futuristic city looks stunning!!!
The cinematography is beautiful throughout the whole movie.
There's a real sense of danger that hangs over the movie,the characters are always on edge & sense of loss is always there.I love this excellent trilogy,the first film was a clever escape adventure,the 2nd was an apocalyptic-zombie type survival Thriller & this epic 3rd part is a sci-fi action Thriller,but all 3 films are excellent in their own way & that's very rare to have a complete excellent trilogy but they do get better as they go along but i think ""The Scorch Trials"" would be my favourite as i loved the whole ""Mad Max"" style desert wasteland setting & the Awesome Infected-Zombie type Creatures called Cranks.Thomas is nearing the end of his pulse pounding story & he is ready for war,a great character who has gotten better with each film. Also great to have Vince back, played by one of the most underrated actors of all time, Barry Pepper, who gives a good performance as usual & he's one of my personal favourite actors ever!!!Truly a completely satisfying,action-packed,dark sci-fi Thriller that is perfectly directed & acted by everyone on board.
Absolutely loved the Death Cure & expect an emotional punch towards the nail-biting action packed climax.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I was quite upset with the second one, The Scorch Trials. All those twists and alterations in that movie leave a bad taste at the back of my mouth, and I know that I am not the only one because after I saw that movie I saw some rants from other fans of the books on social media too. Also, the fact that it took a year to release this movie (Yes, I know that Dylan O'Brien had an accident during the shoot) kinda lose my momentum with the series a bit, I have to hurt my head to remember some names of characters and what have happened in previous movies. And their marketing department doesn't help much because it felt like their not promoting this movie hard enough. Nobody's talking about Maze Runner in here. Perhaps they just don't want to burn that much cash because they know the quality of their product? I don't know but we'll see in coming days how would The Death Cure performs at the box office.While I was walking into the cinema to find my seat, I was having this words play repeatedly inside my mind, ""please, don't suck"". But! I got to say that they've done a pretty decent job with this final installment. Though to be honest, I don't have high expectations for this movie after what have happened in The Scorch Trials. Though some scenes may be predictable, I still appreciate the effort that they did to pull it off. And base on the reaction of some audience in the theater, it seems to me that they were surprised when they saw some familiar faces pop up on the screen. Oh! and also there's a lot of explosions in this movie.Now in terms of characters, here are some that I really like in this movie. I think that Dylan O'Brien (Thomas) did a really good job in this movie, it made me realize how physically demanding this movie was and his accident made me appreciate the scenes even more. So thumbs up for that.I also like the portrayal of Teresa by Kaya Scodelario, too bad she's caught in the middle by Thomas and W*CKED but I really felt her genuine sincerity in finding the cure for the virus to save lives without any hidden agenda.Another man of science (or should I say a woman of science) that I really like is Doctor Ava Paige portrayed by Patricia Clarkson, her methods in finding the cure might be plain wicked but you'll see in her eyes that she's compassionate and that her intention is good despite the terrible acts they need/thought to do. I was kinda surprised with Rosa Salazar as Brenda in this movie. I thought she was forgettable in the Scorch Trials but she's quite badass in this one and I really like that. Good for her being cast as Alita, I'll be looking forward to seeing that movie. And is it just me or does Rosa looked like Kaya quite a bit?As for Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), I think that he really is the glue between the bonds of these Gladers and how his character affects the decision Thomas will have to make in this movie but of course, to those who read the books, you already knew it.As for Ki Hong Lee (Minho), I don't have problems with him when he's running or he's fighting bad guys, but when you just put him in a scene where he just sits, I just can't connect with his character on the emotional level. I don't know, perhaps his face acting is a bit flat for me. So I am not that invested with his character that much.Surprisingly though, I find Will Poulter's portrayal of Gally interesting. Poulter's really good at portraying this type of characters.And lastly, Aiden Gillen (Janson) helps elevate this movie being the bad guy. I wished his co-actor in Game of Thrones' Natalie Emmanuel (Harriet) and Braking Bads' Giancarlo Esposito (Jorge) have more screen time because they're such good actors as well. Overall, I think that this is still an enjoyable movie and for someone that read the books I find it satisfying. I got to give Wes Ball a credit for not entirely ruining such good source material and of course James Dashner. Go see it!","52 out of 97 found this helpful.

Not that it really matters. I just didn't really know what to expect. So I was hoping for some moderately adequate post-apocalyptic sci-fi fantasy film. Boy was I wrong. All I got was moronic garbage in pretty much all the colours of the spectrum. The story was basic, not to say primitive. You want to pretend you can see the future? Go see that film because everything that you think is going to happen, is going to happen. Perhaps books were written better and offered some details that made it readable, but watching it offered me no pleasure, because to suspend disbelief I can look past WHY things are happening on the screen, but not HOW they are happening. For example, I am willing to believe that a kid can take out, with a handgun, from a considerable distance, several trained combat units armed with assault rifles, returning the fire to no success, but there better be a dogdamned reason to show for it. The dialogue is vile and riddled with every kind of cliché you've ever heard. AND seen. Characters shallow and show no real progression. Causality is non-existent, everything happens because the script says so. And this does not even scratch the surface of the tip of the iceberg. The stupidity of the scenes is mind blowing. I'd hate to think that it's so because the film aimed at teens. I can only blame the director Wes Ball for having balls to think this is OK. The film is not even mindless, it's an outright attack against a functioning cerebral process. Which, maybe, for a teen doesn't really matter all that much because they don't know any better. But a film director should. You shouldn't talk down to children just because it's an easy way out. All it shows is that the film doesn't matter. That the film makers didn't care. No one will remember this film in years to come. This film is an insult. Kill it with fire.","78 out of 159 found this helpful.

In this finale, Thomas must lead his friends through one final deadly maze, in order to break into the last city. It was directed by Wes Ball (like the previous two films), and it was written by T.S. Nowlin (who also wrote, or co-wrote, the previous two chapters). The movie stars Dylan O'Brien (in the lead once again), Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden, Rosa Salazar, Ki Hong Lee, Will Poulter, Aidan Gillen, Giancarlo Esposito, Barry Pepper, Patricia Clarkson and Walton Goggins. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office as well (although it hasn't done as well as the previous two installments). I enjoyed it. Thomas (O'Brien), Newt (Brodie-Sangster) and Frypan (Darden) are the last of the 'Gladers' (and those who are immune to the virus). They're desperately trying to save their friend, Minho (Lee), who's also immune and being held captive by the WCKD (in order to test his blood for virus cures). The trio makes their way to the Last City, with the help of other rebel survivors Brenda (Salazar) and Jorge (Esposito). Once there they team-up with an army of infected rebels, as well as another friend that they thought was dead.The movie is surprisingly intense, and very dark and bleak. The action scenes are really well done, compared to your average YA book adaption, and I think it's a quality made sci-fi dystopian genre flick. I think you have to be a fan of the series though, to keep up with all of the characters and their drama. I didn't remember what was going on with all of them, from the previous films (and I didn't read the books either). I was still pretty entertained by the movie though. It's a bit long, but it is action-packed and always exciting. I look forward to seeing what this director does next.","18 out of 30 found this helpful.

The first offered mystery and the second offered a bit of horror (more or less). I will admit though, the second is the weak link of the three, and the first being the best one (in my opinion), and The Death Cure delivers something that the last two didn't.....tons of action. From the opening scene to the last, the action basically never stops. Although some of the action sequences aren't emotion rich, they are still very entertaining. You will certainly never be bored. I do feel the plot was a bit thin, but that in no way makes this a bad movie, if anything it makes it easier to watch. I just feel a deeper, more complex plot would've added to the drama and action of the film. The actors portray their characters extremely well, especially Dylan, he can truly make the audience feel what he's feeling. Although character development was not a strong point in this film, i feel it didn't need to be. Because if you've seen the other two films, you already know how the characters are and how they feel towards other characters and what they believe is right and wrong. For me, the first two films provided the character development, this was just the ending. There are some very powerful and emotional scenes in this film especially towards the end (I, myself did tear up at one point), and the ending, i feel, was really satisfying. Im still trying to decide if they left it open for a fourth or if this really is the last one, if so, i wont mind at all. I do believe that fans of the books and the first two films will enjoy this film a bit more than just your average movie goer, but it does still deliver even if you're not interested in the whole story.All in all this is a great movie, it delivers on the action and the heart and even has a couple of slight twists and shocks. This was just a satisfying, brilliant and sad end to a terrific trilogy. The end was indeed WCKD!!","62 out of 124 found this helpful.

It has the main protagonists getting into a seemingly impossible situation, only to devise a novel escape plan.The Maze Runner trilogy began in 2014, then followed with another in 2015. This one is purported to be the final one. A virus is ravaging the world, turning people into a type of zombie, but some of the kids formerly trapped in the maze have natural immunity. Their only hope is to use their blood to manufacture a vaccine that will cure the infected.Much of the action comes across as very silly, but there is a lot of action and the movie is entertaining for those seeking that kind of movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

And it is quite decent, even if it has its flaws. But at least they kept the whole thing quite short. Reoccuring characters and events continue to unfold. So it does make sense to have seen the other movies. Not sure how it is compared to the novels. Probably will not look as good for those who have read the source material.The action and the effects are good. There may be some logical errors that you can decide to overlook or not. But it's overall a fun ride, especially if you have formed some kind of bond with the characters.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

So why is it that bad ?

From the awful enemy's aim that kindly avoid hurting the main cast because they're not allowed to perturb the story-line, to the cliche turn of even, every action leave a bitter taste. 
The story main story might be great, but the detail are poorly written, which makes every scene difficult to believe in, and for that reason, it takes a lot of determination or stupidity to finish that movie.","29 out of 60 found this helpful.

 In 2014, we were introduced to a rogue set of teenagers trying to get by in a maze full of wicked things, until one day a boy shows up to dismantle the maze and to bring down the very government that was keeping them from fulfilling their true purpose in life - survival. 
 In 2015, that same band of teenagers that were stuck in a maze finally gets their purpose to bring down WCKD - the agency that was controlling them and using them to build their own personal army of hybrids to take down the world system. The Scorch Trials would be the undoing of the band of friends, but they came out on top of it all. 
 Now we come to 2018, 3 years later, it's the end and WCKD is back at it again but this time, one girl could change the fate of the way that we look at how we are made. Thomas, the teenage boy who was brought into the maze, the one that helped his friends escape from the maze, now faces the ultimate decision and prize to give up something so precious that it would be the end of him - his blood to change the mutation of the world. 
 In a word: AWESOMENESS! The Maze Runner Series is by far the best dystopian societal movie since The Hunger Games. This movie ends on a high note where the victors come out on top as always. Wes Ball creates this world to the pristine uniqueness and gives us the words off the page all thanks to T.S. Nowlin. The cast, the crew and everyone who had a hand in making this trilogy did a remarkable job. Thank you for letting us dive into this messed up society.","13 out of 21 found this helpful.

And while this third chapter is a bit more interesting than the second one, it's still nothing to rave about and still suffers from the same clichés, plot holes, and being as predictable as the other two movies.

I have read quite a few negative reviews about this film but let me tell you that this movie is very good conclusion to the franchise and if you liked the first two films, you will certainly appreciate this final installment as well.Everything isn't perfect of course. The story is very predictable. Obviously, one could blame the source material here. However, some twists are foreshadowed in a way that anyone will see through them. To give you one concrete example, there is one character who is constantly looking at his arm, rubbing it, sighing, feeling weak and looking around gloomily. When it is revealed that this character is infected by the virus, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone since the foreshadowing was completely overacted.Other than that, the movie is great from start to finish. Some people claim it was overlong but I never felt bored and thought it was entertaining from start to finish. The action sequences are truly intense and make for a worthy Hollywood blockbuster. The special effects are more present than in the first two films but they have the purpose to make for a bombastic finish and especially the final third of the movie is absolutely breathtaking and epic. The acting performances are as solid as in the first two installments and the protagonist has a really strong moral compass as the movie teaches us to never leave your friends behind and always believe in yourself.To keep it short, Maze Runner: The Death Cure might be the most spectacular action-thriller of the year. The special effects and action sequences are extremely strong. The acting performances and the characters are also above average. Only the story is a little bit predictable and simple. If you have the chance to enjoy this vivid film at your local cinema, go for it as it will help you get into this bombastic finale. Another option would be to watch all three parts and see the development of the different characters and the story line. Ignore the overtly negative reviews and enjoy this blockbuster for teenagers and young adults.","19 out of 33 found this helpful.

As for those flaws in this one specifically, the dialogue here is really cliché. I was literally whispering the line that I thought each character would say next to myself, and I was right a surprisingly large amount of the time. The visuals are still pretty good, but not as good as its predecessor, although that might just be because of the change in location. The villains are also comically bad, especially Jansen, who is in no way intimidating.But still, from the solid characters, enjoyable action and satisfying ending, I still enjoyed this film a whole lot. There were some great individual sequences during the middle which helped to keep me engaged (although I do think the runtime is a touch too long), and I still just enjoy seeing these characters in these scenarios. The emotional moments weren't perfect or even good, but I think they worked well enough. And overall, even though my film buff brain is telling me that this isn't a good film, I can't help but at the very least enjoy it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Going into the third film after quite a large break since the second installment, I found myself wondering if it was too little, too late. Happily, I can admit that this trilogy of films stays pretty consistent with one another in the fact that each consecutive film builds on the previous one. If you've followed this trilogy from the beginning, there are definitely some true moments of drama surrounding Maze Runner: The Death Cure and the final act of this film shows that the filmmakers care about wrapping this story up nicely. Here's why I believe you should check this one out, but also watch all three films back-to-back if you haven't seen them.While I'm not going to try and ruin the previous films, I would just recommend seeing the others before reading this quick synopsis. That being said, Maze Runner: The Death Cure picks up right where the second left off, as the remaining survivors of the Maze, along with a new crew of combatants, set off on a quest to gain back their friend in Minho. This is the core premise of the film, and this particular aspect of the film lends itself to a nice conclusion, but it's not the only thing going on. As the film progresses, we also get a glimpse into the corporation known as WCKD and what they've been planning all along. Viruses are wiping out the world, but who's really to trust anymore? This film raises some interesting questions, which keeps the audience on their feet.Once again, Dylan O'Brien proves himself as not only a worthy action star but a true actor in the making. I can't wait to see where he branches off to next because I've loved everything about his portrayal of Thomas from the very beginning. That's also due to some solid direction by Wes Ball. He's not a household name for film fans as of yet, but if this trilogy of films is any indication, he has a very bright future ahead of him. The way he brings out solid performances from the entire cast, with the few highlights being Ki Hong Lee's portrayal of Minho or Thomas Brodie-Sangster's Newt. Minho and Newt were always likeable characters from the beginning, but the fact that they're just as involved as Thomas now, makes the conclusion feel worthwhile.Where the film may lose some viewers is due to its slight long run time. Not to say that movies have to be less than two hours to not feel slow, but there are quite a few moments throughout this film that I felt could've been trimmed down. There are quite a few things that need to be wrapped up along the way, so I can see the need for a 142-minute duration, but it does feel its length at times. There is some terrific action spread out throughout this movie, which is another plus, but that also hurts the movie, because the movie seems to slow down quite a bit in between the excitement, which is something the other two films balanced a little better in my opinion.Without giving anything away, there is an element to all three of these films that are never brought up in this film whatsoever and I personally felt cheated as a viewer. Look, not everything needs to come full circle, but there were a couple opportunities where something could've been written into the movie as a nice bow, but just wasn't. Like I said, I enjoyed the ending to this trilogy quite a bit, but there were definitely some missed opportunities.In the end, Maze Runner: The Death Cure cares about its fanbase and closes this trilogy out on a solid note. A few tears may have been shed, a few goosebumps may have been had, and although there's nothing spectacular about these films, it's nice to see a director getting the opportunity to make all three films in the series and wrapping everything up nicely. The Maze Runner trilogy won't go down as one of the greatest trilogies of all time, but I do believe that the fanbase will expand over time. This is a solid trilogy worth sitting through. I recommend this third installment to fans of the first two and I recommend the trilogy to those who haven't given it a shot.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was supposed to make a big name for itself, which, sadly, did not happen that way. I can imagine screenwriters and executives, avid for more but willing less, sitting at the same table discussing the different - absolute? - closing possibilities to this treacherous trilogy. They were of course conditioned by the book written by Dashner from which they had to adhere their ideas, however, it's perceptible the dependent additive has managed to balance the degree of honesty and divergence with the inspiration source, screenwriters' narrative additions and executives' postulates, in a comparable amount, are even praiseworthy at certain times, but not fascinating and even jarring and laughable. At first glance and although the writers could not move freely at all - although in Hollywood times we see that this isn't an impediment -, betting to go back a place from they just get out seems incoherent, a simple mechanism setting up more action and ostentatious moments, only voided sporadically by tools that blind for a limited time extremely melodramatic lines or melancholic dramatic scenes. The story is commonly designed, that is to say, we follow the fight of the hero, he's defeated several times, but finally wins, the interesting and peculiar thing is that on the way loses important supporters, ergo there are two significant heart-breaking moments that take a vital role in main character's personal development that boost the purpose of destroying WCKD. It's hard to find ways to turn a standard ending into a memorable one, but not impossible, and I don't mean pessimistic conclusions, just, getting something different, something the spectator doesn't expect, sadly, this feature film chooses common solutions, falling into also habitual cinematographic oblivion.It's already a custom that over-the-top set-pieces offer good-approach choreographies, which, although are not at the level of those present in the second installment, excite and provide a dazzling experience as soon as a cohort of infected arises. These moments are acceptable and even enjoyable, however, there are a couple of sequences that go beyond. On this occasion, the first sequence shares the setting of one of the previous installments, with the daring young runners jumping, as if they were superheroes, from the top of a building. The second and personally the best-sketched-and-accomplished sequence is starring Rosa Salazar and an autobus full with innocents, and despite it doesn't get a completely true result, it made my hair stand on end for the fate of the kids in that unstable bus; an excellent moment, the only one I'd say.Aesthetically, it does not become a focus of praise either. Keeping a predominant place for darkness and a little presence of vivid colors, the film becomes a little dull, no different settings or racking focus are used, simply, the camera follows or remains static to the actions of the characters. This doesn't mean that it is lackluster and anodyne, it's just one more rescue in which the colors don't have the role they should, leaving expectant to the spectator by a much better visual splendor. Of course, special effects used to get this futuristic city are fantastic and complex, they never feel synthetic or manipulative, as in the compendium of buildings or whitish laboratories take place two key moments. Thus, the conclusion of film trilogy ""Maze Runner"" at the hands of Wes Ball, the same filmmaker of all the three movies, provides an independent film, endless, but dynamic, laughable but entertaining, cliché about the hopeful fate of its characters. ""The Death Cure"" shows a good handful of set-pieces and won't mean a tortuous or incoherent time for those who decide to buy a ticket, however, for the most loyal fans and readers will be an idea that relegates great opportunities to stick an ideal conclusion, predicted and lack of the surprise factor. Even so, as a whole, the saga, despite being below Katniss Everdeen's tetralogy but far above ""Tris"" Prior's unfinished tetralogy, is worthy of a Sunday afternoon to enjoy run-of-the-mill Hollywood adaptations brimmed with action, where what matters is not how getting out of the maze, but, ironically, looking for a way to get back in.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I liked the Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials. I did not like the Maze Runner: The Death Cure. The series has been continuously getting worse. The plots are less and less original, and the movies keep getting more boring. The main problem with these movies, is that they stray way too far from the source material. I would've enjoyed the movie a lot more if it had followed the path the book had, so I could get a visual of what was happening in the book. Instead, the movie goes in its own direction, which usually I don't mind, but if a movie goes in that direction, it has to be good. There really isn't much of a plot here, just a lot of mindless action and when that is stretched into 2 hours and 23 minutes, it becomes a total drag. The movie also doesn't make that much sense, bringing back characters that were killed, which doesn't make that much sense. They don't even explain how they came back, which was very unsatisfying. I also didn't like how there was barley any time spent showing cranks. Those were a major element of the books, and one of the most entertaining parts. In the movie there is only one short scene with them, which kind of wasted a huge enjoyment factor with removing them. Also, the movie is just so long, especially with such a threadbare plot. There are so many boring parts, and so many repetitive parts, which made the movie really bad. There were a couple good things though. The first one is that the visuals are pretty good. If the visuals weren't good, the movie could've been even worse. They are sufficient because they aren't an eyesore, and not distracting. The other good thing was that the fight and action scenes were really well put together. They were heart pounding and interesting to watch, with new elements thrown in. In short, Maze Runner: The Death Cure is just one really long fight scene without a big entertainment or enjoyment value.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

"7","/10","For a genre that aims to create a discussion, the end of the franchise presents some interesting sequences, but it misses the opportunity to end a cycle","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6726738/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","21 March 2021","With the subtitle ""The Death Cure"", the last chapter of the trilogy has a lot of adrenaline, but it pulls the brakes more than in the previous two films to explain why everything that happened before. The motivations end up not making much sense, but the plot ends in a satisfactory and even a little daring by today's standards. This third chapter comes to conclude the franchise with dignity for book fans, but perhaps it will only be on the big screen with history enthusiasts. The film begins exactly where the second, The Scorch Trials, ended. The script does not make much of a point of locating the viewer in the plot and the most overlooked must have difficulty remembering some facts. This is also aggravated by the premiere delayed by more than a year, due to a serious accident that the protagonist Dylan O 'Brien suffered during the recording of the film (the studio was forced to stop filming for about 10 months and postpone the launch for the full recovery of its protagonist).By giving up science fiction - and it is possible to feel it in the first sequence - and embracing action cinema, director Wes Ball makes it clear that he will no longer have an interest in the discussion that the previous films (also directed by him) sought to take on. In the opening minutes, we have a chase of cars, trains and ships that take your breath away with bold and creative camera shots in the middle of the desert and put the actors (and stuntmen) in the middle of the whole operation. Director Wes Ball, who started his career in visual effects supervision, has a special eye for both practical effects and CGI, finding a satisfactory middle ground and bringing the best of both worlds. This sequence goes back to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with touches of Mission Impossible and Resident Evil, the end result is fantastic.Even so, a very high level of suspension of disbelief is needed to accept the lazy solutions that the script gives us. It was not enough for the resolution of a conflict to arise at the exact moment of need (the famous God ex machina), new elements are presented without at least a justification. The plot unfolds in this war between CRUEL and the rebel group and, if the first two thirds of the film flow in an organic way, the conclusion lacks in lengthening the narrative and including a huge number of God ex-machina - the unexpected solutions that appear to save the protagonists. Most of them are caused by the weak villain experienced by Aidan Gillen, who is not convinced by the discourse of choosing between who should and should not receive the cure and borders on the cliché in many parts. The exaggeration of plot twists ends up tiring those who do not know the story through the publications of the author James Dashner.The problem with the production is in its script, which drags the plot too much and leaves the film tiring. The second act is very long, which hinders the progress of the story and leaves the audience tired. The final act, full of frantic action, follows the same path by adding several false endings. It looks like the movie will never end. However, it is necessary to highlight the aesthetics of the film. If the previous film had the desert as its main scenario, in this conclusion of the saga, the action moves to the last city, where the base of the organization CRUEL is located. The design of the city is beautiful, referring to the over-lit urban centers of the cyberpunk universes, and the people who are outside the walls also have a beautiful composition. In the midst of all this, we have buildings and locations decimated by the sun, denoting the contrast with the Last City, bringing that ruined scenery with incredible realism. The color palettes in the photograph are incredible: we have a bluish palette for scenes within the city that refer to 'Blade Runner', and an orange palette for chaotic scenes outside the city that resemble 'Mad Max'. In fact, this film is very reminiscent of the 'Resident Evil' franchise.In addition to being excessive, the script destroys a considerable part of the film's support. Wes Ball's direction, on the other hand, is effective in not transforming the conclusion of the story into a completely abhorrent product. Wes Ball knows how to direct frantic scenes and who knows, especially within indoor settings, how to create interesting visual compositions. In a specific scene, Ball contributes to Gillen's performance, elaborating a situation in which the villain enters the scene through the smoke, creating a sense of maleficence. We have an inconsistency, however, in the tone that Ball gives to some particular, but very important segments. While the director knows how to be as cheesy as possible in dramatic moments, pulling for the manipulative melodrama, he, in contrast, hits on some plans that invoke the despair of the characters, such as when a passed out body is pulled exhaustively on the floor.There is also a certain insistence on keeping the characters poorly resolved until the last act. If on the one hand this brings a principle of discussion, after all, right and wrong are subjective concepts and in a conflict both sides believe that they are fighting for what seems to be the best, the film soon abandons this possibility, making ambiguity just an easy resource for trying to create tension. Thus, the conflict of generation Y (something present in the previous films) gives rise to the rush. People infected and doomed to live like zombies (an analogy that worked very well for the generation of millennials) are also reduced to wallpaper. Their presence only serves to create a false sense of urgency, in addition to an escape scene that is just a badly used cliché.Although there are certain problems in terms of character development, Maze Runner stands out for working well with this gray area. It is not as eight or eighty as most films of the genre. It may even slip at a more villainous moment than necessary - like Ava contemplating the beauty of the wall she built - but it is interesting to note that it does not work with the notion of redemption. People have different and unique worldviews. If Teresa's betrayal in the previous feature had been a big surprise, here the character gains space to show her side.In the cast, Dylan O'Brien who really stands out, with a convincing performance and an evident evolution of character. This time he is more convinced in his decisions, even though he still doesn't seem to understand what his leadership figure means. At the same time, Teresa (Kaya Scodelario, from ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge"") remains the most interesting character in the franchise. The character shows the duality of a person who, even understanding the evil he is causing, prefers to sacrifice everything for a greater good. The script is only lost when it prolongs its final redemption. Because it is the end of the franchise, it is difficult to give depth to all the supporting actors that permeate it, but the actress Rosa Salazar, the rebel Brenda, stands out among so many, showing the strength of the character through a solid and coherent interpretation.Lawrence (Walton Goggins, from ""The Hateful Eight"") is a fascinating character with an incoherent conclusion. He appears to assume a role similar to that of Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito, from ""Okja"") in the second film, as the man who is in this situation only for profit. Jorge, however, when he loses his role in the plot, is relocated to another role. Lawrence, in turn, suffers the common consequences of scripts that do not know what to do with characters after fulfilling their roles in the plot, which in this case is to cause the final battle. The ultimate conflict between C.R.U.E.L. and residents outside the city are free, adding nothing to the plot, just reinforcing how much the script preferred to give up science fiction to focus on a grandiose and exaggerated action.This, however, does not mean that there are no good moments in the film. Some of the action scenes are well executed and, even with exaggeration - which becomes a problem when the film tries to take itself seriously -, they create interesting sequences, despite the constant use of camera shake. Between a great chase scene and another, the script delivers some of the answers to the questions asked in the previous films and several plot twists (some very obvious), which end the plot in a very decent way. In addition to the first sequence, we have an incredible jump from a building with the camera following the protagonists, great and tense sequences of invasion of the CRUEL facilities and a final explosive and engaging act.Maze Runner: The Death Cure can even work well with the post-apocalyptic theme within literature, and fans of the literary trilogy will probably have different positions if this has been a faithful adaptation or not, following the desires of a youth-childhood interested in photocopied portrayal of a previously lived experience that cannot be matched in another medium. If it followed the original story loyally, James Dashner's work certainly conveys many negative things to his film adaptation. If not, T. S. Nowlin managed to transform everything Dashner wrote, possibly even a relevant commentary on the society in which we live, into an action film with a generic dystopian-teen story.Perhaps the time for franchises, whether in literature or in cinema, of dystopias that look at the generation of young people who search for identity in a confused and complicated society is approaching the end. ""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"" chooses to leave aside concepts that were fundamental in its origin and get lost in the basics. For a genre that aims to create a discussion, the end of the franchise may disappoint those who identified with the work from the beginning. What is left is a film with some interesting sequences, but it misses the opportunity to end a cycle.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I started watching the movies before I read the books and, surprisingly, I enjoyed the films better. As an author and an avid reader I've very rarely enjoyed a movie adaptation over the original novel. However the Maze Runner trilogy made all the right choices when it came to changes from the books.To top it off the acting was perfect. Believable and moving, each actor captured their character beautifully. Where Dylan O'Brien was inspirational, Thomas Brodie-Sangster offered some much needed emotion that made for two powerful performances for a film meant for young adults.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

S. Nowlin's Maze Runner series packs quite a punch with Patricia Clarkson's nearly expressive face. While the storyline is predictable, the live action pieces stitched together bears an uncanny resemblance to Steven Spielberg's Minority Report. While 20th Century Fox did its best to up the popularity factor by casting Lord Baelish from Game of Thrones, there is hardly any espionage or mind games being notably played. 
 Though the crux doesn't deviate from the James Dashner's book The Death Cure, it is quite referential to the current times of unrest between superpowered countries today. The film does take you on a quest of Gladers trying to get inside the Last City and barring a few action sequences, there isn't much other to experience. 
 A must for the die-hard Maze Runner fans. A one-time watchable film for the ones who got stood on a date and wish to pass their boring Sunday.","15 out of 36 found this helpful.

Also none for those who found it predictable. It's based on a book, of course it's predictable. Now for the movie...The Maze Runner Series is one of my absolute favorites (except The Kill Order - sorry, Mr. Dashner, hated that one). The first movie mostly follows the book, but somewhere from the end to the next movie, the screenwriters lost their way and completely rewrote this story. 
This installment, while a good movie, and better than the second installment, repeats the trend of deviating from the storyline. I like that they kept the ""who lives/who dies"" true to the book, even tho one of the deaths is as difficult to watch as it was to read in the books (it still hurts my heart every time I read it). 
If you just watch with the mindset that it's a ""good movie"" and that it's LOOSELY based on the books, you'll enjoy it a lot more. If they'd stayed closer to the storyline, they'd have gotten a higher rating from me.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and his fellow Gladers move towards a climactic battle against WCKD to save their friends.They will have to break into the unknown Last City, where WCKD headquarters are located. A deadly mission that can finally put an end to all of the unanswered questions that they have since the maze.The YA (Young-Adult) genre is long dead and buried since these films always feel cliche and they are regularly horribly written and directed. However, when The Maze Runner was released, it felt different. It had a mysterious story and surprisingly well-directed action sequences with remarkable acting and a strong lead. Sadly, the ending was awful and it ultimately wrecked the movie. The Scorch Trials had to begin where the first film failed and despite a solid first act, it lost its track midway through, only slightly recovering in the last 15 minutes.That said, I was neither expecting the final movie of a ""fine"" trilogy to be mind-blowing or terrible. I went to the theater hoping to have a nice yet enjoyable end to a saga that I actually like for one reason or another. Truthfully, I enjoyed way more than I ever hoped to!First of all, Dylan O'Brien ... Damn, this guy can act! The production had to stop due to an injury Dylan suffered while filming and that just proves how committed he is to perform his own stunts. He carries the whole franchise and he surely has a bright future in front of him. I hope he gets the chance to star in a huge blockbuster soon because he deserves it. He embodies Thomas and flawlessly leads the film, taking us through emotional moments and exciting action set pieces.He and Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Newt) share a lot of screentime together and their characters' relationship is what elevates the movie by delivering the payoff everyone wants to receive. Newt is very well-developed throughout the runtime, but the same can't be said for everyone. Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) goes back to being a mere plot device and one-third of an unnecessary love triangle with Thomas and Brenda (Rosa Salazar), something that does not even come to play out.Every actor is pretty good in their own roles, but unfortunately, their characters are not developed enough for me to actually care about them. Brenda might be the only addition to the first film that works, but partially due to the excellent performance by Rosa. Of course, Giancarlo Esposito as Jorge is great as well as Barry Pepper as Vince. On the other side, Aidan Gillen (Janson) has to portray a very dull villain, Patricia Clarkson (Dr. Ava Paige) has a couple of character development scenes but not enough since she is supposed to be a big deal and Walton Goggins (Lawrence) is yet another plot device.I have to give credit where credit is due: Wes Ball has his own trilogy. How many directors can say that?! His movies are not amazing or ground-breaking, but they are way better than the ones we have experienced from the YA genre. Wes confirms the marvelous eye he has for filming action because he thoroughly nails every single action scene. They are exciting, inventive and the sense of urgency and danger feels extremely real. I have never witnessed a more impeccable handling of a shaky cam and the way he elevates the third act is impressive, to say the least.The cinematography is on point, with beautiful shots in the first act (a Mad Max: Fury Road vibe) and a very well-designed city where the second half of the film occurs. The editing is great, it has no major flaws. I can always understand where everyone is in relation to one another and once again the fantastic action sequences are improved by this. The score is really good during the movie, especially in the third act where the soundtrack alone can get some tears out of you.Every other aspect of the film has its ups and downs. The screenplay is able to correct some plot holes from the other movies but I feel that the three films struggle to tell a very simple story. Additionally, not everything the movie explains is entirely logical and it still has a lot of silly YA cliches. Despite the action scenes being awesome, they sometimes cross the line between the somewhat possible and utterly ridiculous, taking me out of the film for brief moments. The ending is also very predictable since the ""cure"" is pretty obvious since The Scorch Trials.The tone and pacing could have been more well-balanced. The first act starts with an extraordinary 10 minutes train assault scene, followed by some more well-filmed action, but then it stops. The whole second act is filled with dialogues after dialogues, which abruptly ruins the movie's great pacing and it is kind of boring. I have to wait for the third act to get my heart pumping again and it all feels a bit convoluted, proving that the film is way longer than what it should be.However, the third act compensates a lot. With all of the story's issues in mind, I was truly entertained by the last half hour. There is so much going on, there is always something in the background blowing up or getting set on fire, so the feeling of danger is almost palpable. I actually love the ending (even if it feels like The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, with several endings) for what it wants to be, it emotionally satisfied me and it is a suited end to an entertaining yet flawed trilogy.All in all, Maze Runner: The Death Cure is undoubtedly the best installment of the franchise. Its cast continues to be the standout with terrific performances by pretty much everyone, but Dylan O'Brien is the main reason why these movies work. He is incredible and I hope he gets a chance at one of the big films in the future. Wes Ball adds his own trilogy to his filmography (he directed all three movies) and confirms his phenomenal eye for filming exciting and innovative action. However, this film is JUST able to deliver a satisfying end to a simple yet very flawed story. It contains some YA cliches and it is impossible to deny the lack of logic in storytelling. The second act's boring pacing and the third act's predictability and cheesiness might be too much for viewers to handle, but the lack of secondary characters' development is what brings the movie down for me since I couldn't care less for them.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Whereas the 1st movie was no masterpiece but good with an interesting concept and a good shot of suspense and mystery, the 2nd one could not hold the level, but still was okay/solid. 
But this last one is really annoying - action scenes for the sake of action (and badly and plain boring executed) and to fill playtime, and a plot so predictable and boring, well, I never read the original books, but lets say, all the conclusions of the story are so boring and predicable like Ridley's revelation of the Aliens origin is. Better to reveal nothing if you have no idea how to reveal something original. Last note: maybe some scientists could make a survey to examine a possible correlation between the legalization of dope in some states to the downfall of quality in such a many movie productions/scripts. 
Imo writers should quit using drugs or should not write anything (not every writer is a Hunter S. Thompson or sth of that caliber). The simple truth is: everything looks good if you are stoned. But for the not stoned audience such ""fantastic, ueber-creative"" ideas aren't most times. But maybe one day, we, the audience, get some drugs with the tickets, so we can enjoy that s**t too.

Thomas plans to rescue his friends from the clutches of WCKD & also find a cure to the life-threatening 'Flare' virus. Maze Runner: The Death Cure is an awesome movie. Director Wes Ball makes sure that this finale to the Maze Runner series, lives up to the brilliance of The Maze Runner(2014). It makes up for the slightly disappointing, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials(2015). However, the 2014 original is still my personal favorite in the trilogy. The highlight of the film is the action set pieces. My favorites are the train scene & the climax. The visual effects are flawless. The 3D is effective, for the most part. Dylan O'Brien is fantastic as Thomas. Ki Hong Lee is brilliant as Minho. Kaya Scodelario is outstanding as Teresa. Thomas Brodie-Sangster is spectacular as Newt. Dexter Darden is good as Frypan. Will Poulter is excellent as Gally. Rosa Salazar is superb as Brenda. Giancarlo Esposito is great as Jorge. Patricia Clarkson is unforgettable as Ava Paige. Aidan Gillen is perfect as Janson.

It's up to Thomas to figure out the mystery of what makes himself so important in WCKD's true purpose.As thought-provoking as each pivotal moment revealed, it left me even more curious on seeing how this objective would play out. Despite how watered down the most violent and disturbing scenes showed (like already at the boundary line of a zombie film), stars Dylan O'Brien, Thomas Sangster, and Kaya Scodelario delivered amazing performances. Some parts of the plot did fall short on the true intentions WCKD was trying to accomplish with a so-called ""cure"" as well, but what had me stay focused was seeing that the answer would lie where the adventure initially started for the Gladers: The infamous labyrinth. Director Wes Ball definitely made it this far by showing a pathway to how Maze Runner stands out alongside the other familiar young adult novels.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

In any case, it was with pleasure that I decided to see this film. I still like it, but it was the film with the most flaws and weaknesses in the trilogy (or tetralogy?).In this film, Thomas is still disappointed with Teresa and tries to overcome that. But the desire to save Minho and take revenge on WICKED is evident and leads him to take a dangerous path, which will lead him to the mouth of the wolf, to the headquarters of the organization that, in the name of good and medicine, seems to have totally lost the notion of ethics. It is a film that fits well with its predecessors and gives the trilogy a positive conclusion, if they decide to stop it here. In fact, I noticed the film does not seem to know if it is a continuation or the conclusion of a franchise. I still don't like zombies, I've never been a fan of zombies. The film has good scenes of action and suspense, the ending is really well done but, after a certain moment, drag on and lose the rhythm. I also noticed some flaws in logic and continuity, like the fact that Ava says the virus is aero-transmissible, and it just won't be said or developed later. And, for God's sake, how did so many healthy human people suddenly appear?The cast is generally good. Dylan O'Brian is safe in his character, but there's not much more for him to show us that he hasn't shown before. Scodelario continues to shine and make an interesting character, more complex than he appears to be. Aidan Gillen was a sinister and inhuman villain. Thomas Brodie-Sangster receives additional attention and does his job in an excellent way. Ki Hong Lee disappears for much of the film, although his character is decisive in the plot. Giancarlo Esposito seems to be determined to win a Cavalry medal, because he always shows up to save his colleagues at the right moment. Rosa Salazar practically disappears from the moment the screenwriter decided that her character was not going to fit Thomas.The film has excellent production values and there is a lot of money tied up in high quality CGI. The desert and inhospitable world seems great, and the city of WICKED is futuristic, elegant and of remarkable visual beauty. Infected human creatures, as I said, are the least positive thing and, in this film, they almost disappear from the scene. The film has excellent cinematography, is visually magnificent and makes the most of light and colors. The soundtrack also deserves mention. Composed by John Paesano, whom I did not know, it is an intense soundtrack, with an epic and deep sense.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The negative side is that is unnecessarily long, especially the last couple of scenes and that it feels quite predictable at times (again, young adult, based upon a book trilogy, we've seen some of these story lines before) Definitely way better that the second part, that movie was truly disappointing.
I also wanted to point out that I've only read the first book and even though the movie is really different I like them both, because the main aspects of it remained intact. I didn't read the rest and by comments by fans of the book I've learned that the writers changed pretty much everything after the first film. I can get why people are so upset.

The long time between the release of the previous film and this one is largely due to star Dylan O'Brien suffering a serious injury on set in 2016, pushing back production almost exactly a year and doing the same to the release date. Before seeing this one, I went back and read summaries of the first two... because 2015 was a while ago... and I found the first two kinda forgettable. But... what about this one?Thomas (O'Brien) is back as the young man leading a group of rebels through a dystopian future in which a corporation called WCKD uses human experimentation to research a possible cure to a world-wide plague which turns people into zombies. Thomas' main goal throughout the movie is to rescue a fellow experimentation victim named Minho (Ki Hong Lee) from WCKD's clutches. If Thomas is to be successful, he'll need the help of his friends (Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden, Rose Salazar and others) and they'll have to go up against WCKD's leader (Patricia Clarkson), her henchman (Aidan Gillen) and the young doctor (Kaya Scodelario) who was once a friend to Thomas and company.This movie doesn't skimp on the action and the stakes in every scene are high. It's true that you don't have to see the first two to appreciate this one, but it helps... and it makes it more likely that you'll see this for the satisfying conclusion that it is... even if the whole thing still suffers in comparison to the ""Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" films. Still, ""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"" isn't half bad. ""B""","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But one, lone Saturday I stretched on my sofa and sought out something to watch. Lo and behold, The Maze Runner showed up, just about to begin. I figured, what could it hurt? Seems like everything's about teens and twenty-something's saving the world anyway. 
I was pleasantly surprised. So entertained, I went to theater to see the second movie, with leads to the final installment- Maze Runner: The Death Cure. Was I just as surprised?
Picture
Maze Runner: The Death Cure was just as good as the first book. It carried all the intrigue, suspense and action as the previous movies. There was no lag, there was no boredom and there was truly no hope for Thomas, for a while! The conclusion tot he series is about freedom, friends/family and a cure for what ailed the world. Movie three picked up where the second left off. Minho was taken and they had to get him back. In order to do that, they had to make a deal with a crazy ""Crank"", who wanted nothing but to go out, in a blaze of glory, for the cure to the ""Flare"" plague. It takes a great author to write a book series like this. It also takes some amazing screenwriters, directors, producers- the whole lot, for the FX and stunts in Maze Runner: TDC. Unlike other movie franchises, I never grew tired of it and now I'm thinking I may have to get the books after all. EVERYBODY was right! It was amazing and so worth the purchase. So check out Maze Runner: The Death Cure. If you haven't seen any of the movies, you should, but you don't have to in order to enjoy this one. It's an great movie. All of them. Original, fantastic and sure to please, I give Maze Runner: The Death Cure two thumbs up. Cheers!","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

Yes, it's predictable and kind of generic with a lot of cliches, but because I waited for the movie since 2015 and I've liked all the characters since the first movie the movie had an emotional impact on me and made me kind of biased. But if you don't feel any connection to the characters in the movies and don't find them likeable you probably won't like this. I prefer the first movie over this one but I definitely feel like this one was better than the second. If you want to watch this and haven't watched the previous movies I highly recommend you do so.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Another car keep escape from the helicopter that try to shoot them. When the helicopter stop and walk into the trap. How they can guess it stop and those people walk into the trap? They are genius. At night time near the beach they stay they open the light, just turn off immediately when they hear those people come. Why those airplane cannot notice the light. This movie still keep 2 hours and half cos of Ming Hoo but that is fine as he has many fans. 
Thomas and his friends go to help Ming Hoo and accidentally met the zombies and his friends with another car come to help. Can it be? Even when they come from the shelter in quietly but still those guys come follow them. Logic? They found the city, they try to get in. Lucky he met that ghost face guy and advise him to go inside it. That is great but why they dont let those people that wanna go inside go into the city? And the end why they destroy this city? Cos of jealousy people inside the city? Destroy for what? They are racist. There are many buildings but they can find her through objective lens. They are lucky that go inside the room and try to escape and downside has a pool. They are so lucky again. When the bus try to escape and block my police, that place is the same where the hug waiting. That bus is good quality as the front steel can carry one bus with many people inside it but unlucky it almost broke and lucky again they fall close to the ground. I was wondering why thomas keep saving his fri who is already zombie? He just know what is zombie today or know he has medicine to treat his friend? He spend around 5mn for this useless part. Say the true that Thomas can save the world cos of his blood. The part when they come to the roof top, he almost die because of fire but helicopter come to save him but not that girl? She wanna die by herself or people on helicopter dont want to save her? It is so close and not much different about distance and it should be lady first. Not him. I just know the island they move to live is already plant the corn.","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

But now it is time for the Maze Runner to come to its conclusion, and after seeing the Death Cure, I can proudly say that this Maze Runner ended...mostly the same as its predecessors.It can be fun at times, sure, but the film still suffers from the usual problems the other Maze Runner films usually have, like a story that is heavily reliant on cliches and has the trilogy's signature predictable moments, characters who mostly feel as basic as they can get, and a mostly slow pace that isn't really as problematic as Scorch Trials, but it doesn't mean much when the film itself turns out to have a longer runtime than that in order to tie up loose ends. Yes, the actors did a great job, but you know they've always had minimal materials to work with, and it can feel like many of them don't want to go back when this is over!However, even with those flaws, it does still have some prominent strengths the franchise is known for, and it even includes some new aspects in order to make itself a minor improvement from Scorch Trials. Just like the other movies, Death Cure is an AMAZING looking piece of eye candy, delivering on great visual effects and selling on the teen dystopia genre in a convincing way with all the sets, costumes, and visual style in order to expand the world it's set in, on top of having thrilling action scenes to quicken the pace. That, and it does get progressively better as the film continues, having an action-oriented and hectic third act full of intensity, tying up as many loose ends as possible, and finishing off Thomas's journey with tears and relief, resulting in an exciting and INTENSE finale that proves that you can still have fun with the franchise.Overall, this is exactly how you describe the franchise. As average as teen dystopia movies get.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The story is well written, the visual effects are amazing, I really liked the sci-fi design of the Last City with all the neon lights and futuristic skyscrapers. The lore is not very complex, but the movie deepens a bit better the context of this dystopian society. The character of Lawrence was a nice addition, despite not having much screen time. He really makes you understand how messed up the Maze Runner world is; how pointless are the efforts of WICKED in front of the decayed Earth. Wes Ball delivered once again an action packed movie, plenty of well directed fighting and shootout scenes. The intro sequence was full of adrenaline, while the final confrontation between the rebels and the big pharmaceutical company is just the epic conclusion of a civil war between the privileged and the common people. However, some scenes looked a bit cliche: towards the end there are some moments that make the flick a bit too predictable. For the rest, this production was entertaining and these two hours and a half had gone like a breeze.Do not be fooled: this franchise might be targeted to teenagers, but it can be appealing to an older audience, and this is one of its added values. My favorite chapter remains the second one, as certain action sequences are simply unbeatable in terms of creativity and dynamicity. Overall it feels like a proper conclusion and I am happy that they stopped here. The last thing that I want to see is a TV show watering down this story or a reboot/continuation. Leave it be. ""The Death Cure"" deserves 6.8 stars out of 10, while the mark for the whole franchise is a solid 7.2. If you like dystopian and post-apocalyptic worlds, you have to watch this trilogy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That's something to keep in mind while watching these types of movies.People tend to like the first movies more (then get disappointed in the follow-ups), because they're usually just about the pure, raw survival, keeping the plot simple, and I get it, but there has to be a bigger picture why things happen in the first place or the movies wouldn't go anywhere. I liked the fact that in this movie they showed both sides of the situation. The Wicked wasn't portrayed as black and white as in the previous movies.Sure there were cliches and predictability as expected, but all in all this movie was fun to watch. All of the movies were a bit too long in my opinion. I also didn't really connect with the characters that much, because there wasn't a lot of meaninful dialogue, and we didn't really learn that much about the characters. Most of the new characters we got to know in the second movie were pretty much irrelevant in this one.Fun movie to watch if you enjoy dystopian adventures.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Overall, it was phenomenal. The soundtrack is good, the action is intense, the sound effects are on point, and there's not a dull moment for the entire time. I only have two gripes that prevented me from giving it a full 10; number one being that Thomas' and Brenda's relationship I don't believe was portrayed accurately from the original book. Any other movie goer would never notice so that's not a huge deal. Number two is that I'm frustrated Dylan O'Brien, who is 26 years old, played the role of a character who is no older than 19 years old according to the book. While if he was opted for a younger actor, it would've caused uproar, it somewhat frustrated me. What O'Brien did prove is that he can act very well and Kaya Scoldelario has also turned herself around from her past few acting disasters. Overall, Wes Ball showed that he's serious about Hollywood and knows his way around a movie set. So far, this is the best film of the year in my book and I can't wait to see more movies not only from the actors who did so well in this movie but Wes Ball, too, as a director.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

"6","/10","An adequate, but not aMAZEing conclusion","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4050926/?ref_=tt_urv","Field78","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3100637/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2018","The finale of the Maze Runner trilogy has taken a bit longer to arrive than expected, due to a severe accident involving leading man Dylan O'Brien on set. That can cause all kinds of false expectations, but now that it's finally here, we can assess whether it is the movie that satisfactorily completed a series that was one of the more enjoyable among all those young adult franchises that flooded the cinemas in the last 10 years. And my answer is both yes and no.Let's start with the good: the unwritten sequel rule that each next installment should be bigger and better is certainly followed. The opening scene involving a train chase/fire fight has so much momentum and action that we are immediately sucked into the story, and the rest of the film also features several epic setpieces and grand-scale action scenes. This is a big budget action movie where you can see where the bucks went, which is always a good thing. Like the first two movies, the post-apocalyptic production design is not merely a backdrop, it is shot with so much care that it almost becomes a character in its own right. And all the dilapitated ruins form a nice contrast to the pristine, state-of-the-art city that is the scenery for the second and third act (after all, it's science fiction). A compliment must be made to the special effects department; no doubt plenty of CGI has been used, but to great effect because I can't easily tell when and where.What is really too bad is that after that high-octane beginning, the story gets into a bit of a slump. The second film made it clear that WCKD is bad, and that a group called the Right Arm is trying to stop their nefarious experiments on young people. Thomas and his Glader friends joined that group, determined to help take WCKD down. Unfortunately, not much of that noble sentiment remains in The Death Cure (TDC). Not to spoil too much, but the story doesn't take the most exiting direction after the beginning. While I understand that not every opposition can muster up a Rebel Alliance to take on an empire, this lack of delivering on that promise definitely causes the plot to limp after this development. It doesn't help that we learn of other, even more fanatical groups that openly oppose WCKD. There was potential for an interesting subplot here that sadly remains underused.Our main character Thomas (O'Brien) also gets curtailed by this. He only seems interested in getting his kidnapped friend Minho back. And that's where we see the film's (and arguably the series') main flaw: in all that action and mystery, there never was much time for rich plotting and character development. It didn't matter too much for the first movie, because it had a titular maze to drive the plot; and although some people didn't like The Scorch Trials much, it had some twists and interesting action to keep things going. But TDC feels a bit empty, with its minimal plot stretched over more than 2 hours. Almost the entire first half relies on a rescue mission for someone we barely know or care about, making it a boring affair (save for some strategically scripted zombies) and the movie way too long. The fact that Dylan O'Brien isn't a very charismatic lead didn't matter that much when he was still running for his life, but now we are supposed to relate to him and Minho, and the film falters as a result. It would have made a real difference if either Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) or Teresa (Kyla Scodelario) had been abducted, as they are much less one-dimensional, but they have other roles to play in the story.The second half fortunately shows improvements, with the legitimacy of Teresa's betrayal as one of the more interesting subplots. It arguably makes her the most interesting character in the film, and it serendipitously leads to a revelation about the cure that plays a major role in the end. Both Newt and Teresa's parts in the story give the movie some of the heart and substance that is lacking from the rest. The epic climax is another great sequence where action and emotion come together in a satisfying way, and the epilogue keeps things sufficiently ambiguous.That is not to say that the second half fixes all the flaws in the story. The other movies had a challenge to compensate for plot, and this movie seems to be missing both. The Maze was the obvious test in the first film, the second movie had WCKD, zombies and a very nice apocalyptic landscape doubling for a maze, but the third one lacks a properly challenging environment. The trailer sold the futuristic city as the new maze, but in the movie it is surprisingly easily navigated, and the protagonists have no difficulty getting into anything. The lack of a decent nemesis may also be to blame. Dr. Ava Paige was teased as the main antagonist in the first two movies, but she is so underused here that she hardly seems to matter anymore. We are left with Aiden Gillen as Mr Janson, who falls back on his duplicitous Littlefinger act from Game of Thrones, but his lack of relatable motivation and some questionable actions make him a token villain who is only there to ensure an ending.So in conclusion, TDC wraps up the story of three movies, but it is hard to deny that most of the drama was already used up in the previous two, leaving too little to justify a 140-minute ending. Technically it is well made and enjoyable on the action level, and its flaws are not too unforgivable. But unlike the Harry Potter or Hunger Games series, we never get the feeling that all the set-up of previous movies really pays off in the end, or that its plots and subplots come together in one glorious conclusion. Thank God for that awesome beginning and end, though.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Before I review this film, I would quickly talk about the previous films and books. I watches the first Maze Runner and thoughr it was an amazing film. Possibly the best Young adult film sincw the Harry Potter films. Then I watches the second film and thought it was ok. Then I read all three of the books. The first was wss good, the second one was great and the third book was ok. But when I rewatced the two movies before this one, my opinians completely changed. I was suprised by how much they changed and altered the first movie. But the second movie I was SHOCMED by then pretty much remaking the story. I was pisses by this change as certai characters are either completely pushes aside or changed. The third one I felt the same way. The only thing I liked about the movies were the guys who played Gally and Chuck. I also LOVED the cinematography and VFX. They looked amazing. But the amazing plots of the booms were totally changed. I have very mixed feelings as I can understand why they did this. Certain things written in the books wouldn't have worked as well on film. They also had to alter certain plot moments to make it more cinematic. But other times they remove really amazing plot elemts from the books and add stuff in. So, to be honest, I would recommend reading the books first and then watching the films.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

And the writers have created a third and different type of film: a mission-based action thriller. Kudos to them for changing things up.Also, the entire film has good pacing, despite its length.In the shadow of an actual pandemic, however, the story feels undercut by actual historic and political happenings. Instead of adding relevance, they distract from and minimize the relevance of the film's story.Still, the effects and the production values are excellent, as in the first two films.Those who see this franchise as part love story might be disappointed by its resolution. Similarly, the conflict over the value of the individual to himself versus his value to society-which can be seen as the central theme of this series-ends with some ambiguity. That can be something to ponder for those who choose to explore this theme.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

 u could easily mix up the first movie in the likes of a cube movie or of an ""unknown"" movie in which strangers are put together in a place by a madman like jigsaw.
 then at the end of the first movie u get the feeling it's more than that.
 in 2nd movie u get a total different thing. 
 u suddenly realize this is not belong in the genre of the jigsaw or the cube films but in the genre of the hunger games and the divergent movie serials.
 And u get excited as the 2nd film is the best solving a lot of questions and has great and constant action and suspense.
 unfortunately those elements of surprise are gone in the third film which is an extension of the 2nd and it could be also titled........""mino's resque"" as the movie for nearly 2 hours was about that dude's resque.
 fortunately in last 40 minutes or so the movie picked and at least we got an ending full of emotions and the outcome was positive but no way this final outing was better than the previous installments.
 I was hoping they would make also the two prequel novels in to films but now this third outing flopped in America with just 50-60 millions (it will not make above 60 millions) I wonder if they ever gonna make those prequels.
 good thing is the film is doing well so far overseas so if this saves the film then we might get the prequels in to films or we will have to read the books anyways. until last 40 minutes the movie was average with a C+ grade.
 last 40 minutes were very good with a B+ to an A - grade so overall I give this film a B- grade (7 out of 10)
 not a bad film overall and very emotional at the end but not as good as the previous films were mostly due to the lack of the surprise element.
 from the first scene u knew what u would expect from the movie to happen. I just hope they make the prequels too.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

In order to succeed in saving their friends, they have to enter the legendary last city which is controlled by WCKD. A new labyrinth is ahead of them and anyone who makes it out alive will get the answers to the questions about the maze and the whole world.I have to admit that I expected for this movie to be even worse than the second but I was happily surprised that it was not. Since I had low expectations for it I would like to say that it was a nice movie to watch and I enjoyed it. It has an interesting plot with some plot twists that I did not expect and an average written script. The direction which was made by Wes Ball was average and not the worst as many reviewers mentioned. I liked the interpretation of Ki Hong Lee who played as Minho and I believe that he was the best, I also liked the interpretation of Thomas Brodie-Sangster who played as Newt. Regarding the interpretations of Dylan O'Brien (Thomas) and Kaya Scodelario (Teresa) I have to say that I expected more.Finally, I believe that ""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"" is an interesting movie and you aren't going to waste your time watching it. It's not the best movie of this trilogy and of course, it cannot be compared with the first movie but I recommend it to anyone who already started this trilogy.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Yet, whilst the Divergent series remains unfinished and our imaginations are free to soar to the (limited) possibilities as to how that could have ended, this franchise goes out with a whimper. An incomprehensible plot (go where to do what with who now?) with forgettable characters, who at no point feel in jeopardy, despite the bullet and explosion driven special effects chaos which litters the over-extended run time like brackets litter this review. Indeed, other than Will Poulter (stoic/bored) the pyrotechnics are perhaps the only bright spark in the dark post-apocalyptic world - which wastes both other actors (Kaya Scodelario, Walton Goggins!) and the time of talented individuals who contributed to the production design and the visual effects. The mysterious promise of the first movie is never exhumed from where the even worse Scorch Trials buried it, a missed opportunity for the screenwriters who fail in epic fashion to make you engage emotionally with the characters - meaning the climax to the movie also falls flat. In short, not as advertised a cure for death, rather a blandly lazy way to move yourself two hours and twenty-three minutes closer to it.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

They are a huge distraction at times!This is a good third instalment to a good film series, but, even though I haven't read the books, I can tell that there is a slightly rushed element to it and that there is more information to be had. I personally think the best format for stories like these is a TV series, where the authors work can have justice done to it. It needs a true fan of the books to take it on board and do it the credit it deserves in the same way that JJ Abrams obviously loves Star Trek and Star Wars, based on his versions of those.There are no stand out performances and as much as I love him, I'd love to see Aiden Gillen play a different part every once in a while, for me he's still playing Stuart from 'Queer As Folk' with hints of Littlefinger from 'Game Of Thrones'It is a good story and I'm sure that there are lots of teenagers out there that absolutely love it and worship the actors. They are the target audience after all. It's just not outstanding, although it's definitely better than 'Insurgent+'.If the Maze Runner films had been released in the 80's, they would have been all over 'Look In' and 'Smash Hits' magazines.The only big criticism I have is that you can tell how these films are going to end now. Having watched Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, Insurgent+, Etc, they are all getting to be a bit predictable. I'd like the authors out there to think about that and for the producers to consider this when finding new projects.706.77/1000.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The first half of the film would have you pulling your hair out cause of the lack of momentum in the flow of the plot.When you pass the train of 'boredom' and get into the second half of the film you'll be relieved because the film catches up the necessary momentum without being too slow leading up to the climax.The down side here is that it gets coated with several unintentionally comical illogical scenes. ( specially the one where Janson decides to stare down at Thomas and fellow fugitives who are fleeing with asset without shooting them when he clearly had a pretty good shot)
Having said that I must also compliment the performances..
Specially, Dylan O'Brien who is the highlight of the film with his convincing performance as Thomas yet again..
Watch this for him..I wanna go with 5 stars for the film but gonna have to add 1 more star to commend the performances which literally saved the crumbling and kinda illogical plot.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Among the last few to have remained immune to Flare, the deadly virus that has laid siege on a majority of the world's population, the Gladers are running against time to find a cure. As they attempt to sneak into the Last City, they encounter a series of obstacles that threaten their very existence.The actors portray their characters extremely well, especially Dylan, he can truly make the audience feel what he's feeling. Although character development was not a strong point in this film, I feel it didn't need to be. Because if you've seen the other two films, you already know how the characters are and how they feel towards other characters and what they believe is right and wrong. For me, the first two films provided the character development, this was just the ending. There are some very powerful and emotional scenes in this film especially towards the end (I, myself did tear up at one point), and the ending, I feel, was really satisfying.Coming to the cinematic experience, the cinematography was top notch. In recent times it may be the second best to Blade Runner 2049. The Vfx was stainless. Kudos to the cinematography team. The movie though had some loose plots but the pros do cover up these potholes. 
The first half was a bit laggy as compared to the other first two parts of this franchise but the second half kept the audience at the edge of their seats. Second half was very well executed. Although the movie could have been trimmed off 10 mins but the cinematography covers this up. 
All the humor were well placed and the action scenes were fast paced which suited the Story line.
If you're a fan of the franchise, enjoy watching 'save the world from the apocalypse' type of action thrillers and have been following the story over the years, this finale might be of interest to you.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The second one was a bit boring and this one offers a fitting finale, like the kind of season finale some series get.This doesn' mean this is a good movie. The main character is an idiot who thinks he can save the world and take on an entire army by himself. It's like he knows the bad guys always miss or wait too long when they fire their guns. Strange. This seems to happen in a lot of hollywood action movies. Luckily our heroes always hit the bonzai when they fire themselves. In a way that's also normal because they are teens who grew up without guns and the bad guys are a heavily armed and highly trained military. It's normal that the latter suck at shooting a gun.The story line itself is basicly action, problem, deus ex machina, action, problem, deus ex machina, etc. It's easy to write a story like this because it doesn't have to be clever or good.But hey, it's a teen movie and I should look at it this way. It's better than other, similar movies so yeah, there's that. It's well directed, pretty good acting and the action music's spot on. I only finished this movie because the first one was really good and I wanted to see how it ended.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

this review is mostly about how disappointing it is
I used to enjoy these but had a bad taste, now I remember why, i'm not sure how true to the books this is, but i remember I had a lot of fun reading them, but very confused watching this,1) the CGI and film tech in general should be mature enough to showcase many of the plot lines in the books, but they did not get them in to the films, simple stuff like the teleportation field.2) Tomas is a joke in the films, its either the actor or the character, but I could not relate in the least
3) it has some fun action/horror sequences, but they really did not commit to the violence/gore parts. It is a semi horror movie but feels like they were made for kids, boring as sidewalk gum
4) ending feels rushed.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I didn't like Death Cure it's not in due of the hype, because even before, my expectations about the last installment were not so high.
The opening sequence reminds Mad Max, it's a good action scene, but then the main story starts being a little boring. It's almost 2 hours and half with the characters saying always the same and doing the same stuff. It would be better if this film was shorter.
There are some good scenes, and a lot of scenes that could be better done, the poor final act is an example about how some scenes could be better done. Even the ""zombies"" (they have a different name in this film) are weak in this film, there is a zombie outbreak and we don't see a lot of zombies.Sometimes, Death Cure looks like a soft Resident Evil or a soft Mad Max for young viewers. I didn't hate but I also didn't like. I'm sure the teenagers will love.Rating: 5/10","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

-Reduction of Characters A third installment for a popular book is a challenge Hollywood continues to fight in this modern age. With the Maze Runner, the series has struggled to captivate me the way the books did and thus I had doubts of what the third movie had to offer. Fortunately, the team managed to get a strong opening out into the film, hooking one into the film with the excitement you hope the rest of the movie will have. This tale is only further enhanced by the acting, which continues to grow with each film, and further bring these characters out in the heat of the moment. Watching these characters to develop in this suspenseful tale kept me invested into the story, holding my attention as I anxiously awaited to see who would not survive the ordeals at hand. And after such an exciting climax, the ending concludes the story with the emotional drive and relief you'll need to take you down a few gears, though I would have liked all the answers at the end. 
 Despite all this intensity though, the movie had a few areas of improvement for me. A nice review could have helped get me back up to speed, but this minor dislike is not my main concern. Instead it's the lck of balance this movie had in terms of length and character usage. The movie is over two hours and there were dragged out moment that didn't quite require the extra half an hour to get the full effect. These drawn out chases and heavy banter loaded hold ups just didn't impress me and the serendipity conclusions to these endings were more funny than fulfilling to me. As for the characters, the main cast gets their adequate screen time, but newcomers and key characters are reduced to background moments that were disappointing for me. 
 Overall though, this movie has more positives than benefits and gets extra points for being an entertaining and emotional finale of the trilogy. With the intensity of this movie and all the integration of their key characters, one will find this movie hard not to become engaged in. You just need to have 2.5 hours at your disposable and be willing to except the drawn out moments and reduction of characters you grew to love in the first two movies. This imbalance isn't the worst I have seen, but had this been given another round of editing tricks we could have an even better movie. Still check this one out in the theater.","13 out of 29 found this helpful.

It was filled with action, adventure, comical moments and some quite sad parts.The acting was phenomenal, especially that of Dylan O'Brien and Thomas Brodie Sangster. I thought the soundtrack was good as well, but it wasn't a Hans Zimmer, but who can be?I think you need to see these films for what they are. I know many people will rate a trilogy like this down because it wasn't as good as the book, or they left out some vital parts. Coming from someone who has also read the books, I know you can't include everything, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. You really begin to feel for the characters. These films definitely deserved higher and better ratings than what it has got, and I'm sure many would agree with me.Another thing is, some people came to this trilogy thinking it was going to be 100% realistic, which it is, but in its own way. It is woven together tightly so is hard to unthread it, but it is science fiction, but people didn't seem to know that when they came to watch it. If you're going to enjoy it, you need to let yourself become engrossed in the movie, like I did.Special effects weren't amazing but they are what they are. They were saved by an awesome plot line. You need to respect these films for what they are to enjoy them, and understand sometimes you need to let your mind drift a little.I recommend watching this trilogy because they are incredible, and very entertaining.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

During the production of this film in 2016, Dylan O'Brien was severely injured on set. Because of that, the film was delayed and is just now being released. I'm so sorry about Dylan's accident and believe that the wait was worth it, as I love this movie. This is the third and final installment of the Maze Runner trilogy. Thomas and his friends head to the last standing city to save their friend, Minho and take down the Government Association known as WCKD. I'm quite a fan of the Maze Runner books, so I can vouch for the accuracy of this movie. Quite a bit of the story is different from the book. Even the plot of saving Minho isn't in the book. He is with the group in the book. However, all the major events are still the same as both stories involve taking down WCKD. This movie is fast moving and heart racing. In almost every scene something exciting is happening. The film barely gives you time to rest. I feel like this keeps you on edge and it works. During some scenes I tensed up, with my fists clenched. The action is actually very effectively exciting. There are tons of explosions, and fire and gunshots. And they are all so cool. The special effects are really impressive. This film is a dystopian story. The reason the world ends in this story is an illness known as the ""Flare"" that turns people into zombie-like creatures. The makeup used for the creatures, known as Cranks, is outstanding. Here's a shout out to the entire makeup department. The acting is also really good. Dylan O'Brien, who plays Thomas and Thomas Brodie-Sangster, who plays Newt, have incredible performances. I will not spoil what happens, but one specific performance from them had me in straight up tears. Also, the city where most of the film takes place, known as Last City, has a very neat design. It looks intimidating, yet beautiful. It felt like Los Angeles, but darker. I'm curious if the director, Wes Ball, plans to do the prequels, as there are two prequels. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18.Reviewed by Calista B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

The problem is with the message it sends. It's horrible. I get it, it had to appeal to 15-18 yrs old audience, but sending that kind of message to teenagers is simply wrong.What's the message? ""Adults are wicked, let's kill em all and take matters in our own hands"". There is no other way to interpret it.It does not matter there were not enough people to repopulate (you need at least 10000 to be safe from degeneration and inbreeding), it does not matter they had basically nothing on that island to keep them alive - no doctors, no medicine, no drinking water, no food, no real shelters, and more important, nothing to keep science and culture alive.The false hope they try to infuse in the ending ""this will be a good home"" is the cherry on the top. Anyone with a bit of common sense realize in a couple of generations the island will be populated by a bunch of starving people, with a lifespan of about 40 years, barely capable to talk - basically the ""rational"" version of the infected. But hey! Who am I to judge their version about a good home, right?Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Unless you are a 15-18 years teenager and have family issues. In that case you will love it.

They got angry when it wasn't, and thus scored it badly. They did not understand the full movie because they narrowed their focus to a single episode or perhaps simply did not pay enough attention during the whole thing or did not even watch or perceive the entire trilogy as one.Everything is explained in the full trilogy, so if you are left with questions after watching it; don't worry, just watch it again and try harder :)

Now, it's 2018. Do you think I remember what happened in parts one and two? I would if they were interesting enough but unlike a Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars, or Hunger Games even--this series was not nearly captivating enough for me to remember the characters and plot points. I think I watched Death Cure just to finish what I started. I don't want to be known as a quitter.They attempted to make this movie a little more dire, serious, and portentous. Yes, it was all that but I wasn't feeling it. The world is dying, hopelessness is abundant but to me it seemed old hat. I've been here before via sooooo many other movies--other better movies at that.

That is true.... But to evaluate this movie as standalone, away from past two, that is simply stupid. This movie, as a part of trilogy, is simply the best issue for past 5-6 years. 
I was a bit skeptical about the third installment of the ""Maze runner"" saga, because, in first place, starting the first movie it seemed to target teenage audience, as was probably right. And considering I had extremely low opinion on Twilight saga, I really thought I will see another lame teenage money grabber. 
If anyone bothered to watch any of my recent movie review, you could see that my thoughts of newest releases are bad, but this movie changed my mind about today's Hollywood.
It's is simple, logical conclusion of maze runner saga, but with much of action, drama, thriller elements, and, I have to say, almost unexpected end. 
When I reached the final 25 mins of the movie, I thought I was watching another conclusion in the stile of Matrix. But I have to assure anyone reading this, you couldn't expect better conclusion than this.
It still remains the fact that this movie is purposely mad for younger audience, and that is my grade a bit lower, because it IS a little naive. But it 's nothing like newest releases in that domain. With previous two releases (which I gave 7 and 5) makes great story, which should, by own means, be watched if You are in need for quality entertainment. 
For the first time in last 5-6 years I really can say that time spent is time spent well.
(I tried not to insert any spoilers, so this might be a bit lame).
Hope no one think of the sequel, because It would be sooooooo wrong......","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

To be honest, I thought the book was lazy, so I expected the movie to be about the same. It wasn't. It was great! The opening scene alone was one of the best parts of this movie. It really does not slow down. It's intense action, and thrills! There were times where I was on the edge of my seat and felt my stomach drop. (I saw this in my local equivalent of an IMAX, so the screen was bigger than normal, so that may have had something to do with it.) Certain scenes drag out the inevitable ""boo!"" quite effectively. I very rarely jump at jumpscares anymore because they've become cliche, but there was one that actually made me jump. Sometimes the plot was a little too convenient and a little redundant. It seems like the goal has been met, but then the characters need to reach that same goal again. They end up in danger, get deus ex machina-ed, end up in danger again, get deus ex machina-ed, repeat for whole movie. It could have used more variety in the plot, but that's more-or-less how the book was, so I can't blame that too hard. Aidan Gillen does a great job as the villain. He's chilling, yet you like him for his charisma. There were twists and emotional moments that actually made me cry. Bring tissues, because you will cry at the end. (If you read the book, you know what I'm talking about). I'm sad to see this series end, but have enjoyed the journey since the very first one. It's a bittersweet ending, that's still very satisfying. It's the finale this trilogy deserves.

"5","/10","Umm...there's a film in here somewhere","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4130803/?ref_=tt_urv","samuellickiss","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20802169/?ref_=tt_urv","15 April 2018","*Written from the perspective of someone who has read the first book only and seen the previous films*. First of all, I'm glad I waited until I could borrow the DVD off a friend rather than paid to see it in the cinema. It's a long film, clocking in at nearly 2.5 hours. I'd be lying if I said I sat in front of my TV and watched it start to finish without distraction. The film opens with a big action set piece - Thomas and team attempting a train heist. It's cool - nicely shot with decent enough acting. However, my first distraction came when I realised I had no idea who anyone, asides from Thomas, was. I'd completely forgotten the events of The Scorch Trials (which says a lot about the quality of that film...) so I ended up revising the plot on Wikipedia. There's not really anything of substance in the film. The action set pieces are cool, but they're not Mad Max Fury Road cool (I mean, what is?). The music does the job, but that's all it does. At some point while watching the film I decided to find out who the composer was. I'd never heard of Joe Paesano, and there's a reason for that, because the score is devoid of melody (just chords played on strings the whole way through) and completely forgettable. He's no John Williams or Danny Elfman. The costuming is fine, but not Star Wars The Phantom Menace fine (costumes were definitely a redeeming feature of that film). The acting is fine, the editing is fine, the directing is fine, the story is fine...it's all just fine. To be honest I'm not really sure what the plot is. There's a generic zombie virus that's infecting people (because that's never been done before...) and some kids have special blood that's immune or something. I don't know, it's not clear. The bad guys are experimenting on said kids to develop a cure, but apparently that's a bad thing so a war breaks out. The movie is so desperate to have an antagonist that it has to be manufactured at every possible moment. Littlefinger (or whatever he's supposed to be called in the film) has no obvious motive for anything. He and Effie from Skins plus generic scientist lady sort of do some sciencey stuff and yeah it probably wouldn't get past your average ethics committee nowadays, but this is a post-apocalyptic society with a virus busy killing everyone, so perhaps we can be a bit flexible on this. The problem is that everybody wants the same thing, including Littlefinger, who's the big bad evil, and really that's the problem. I'm still not sure why Littlefinger is the bad guy. I'm still not sure why Thomas is the good guy, either. The film tells us this, but it seems like the whole conflict could be avoided if everyone just sat down and had a conversation about the whole thing. They're trying to kill each other, but why?I've even googled this, and I've yet to find a website that will enlighten me,The film is attempting to go for moral complexity, and fails utterly in this respect. Game of Thrones does moral complexity, and Littlefinger is at the scheming heart of that, but the whole Maze Runner franchise is just confusing. It seems like James Dashner had the idea of a teenage boy waking up in a maze with no memory tasked with escaping it and thought, 'yeah, I like that - that's cool.' And it is - the first book (and film, to an extent) are pretty neat. The problem is, Dashner seems to have realised at some point that he needed to explain why the maze existed in the wider conflict. At that point, Dashner lost all his creativity, because the Maze you see in the first film/book are quite honestly the only original ideas he had. Overall, that's the problem. It's merely passable. It just exists. I'm getting married next year, and I hope to have children of my own. I suspect when they're old enough I'll read the Harry Potter books with them and watch the films. A few years on from that, maybe I'll introduce them to the Hunger Games, but the Maze Runner (and Divergent and a lengthy host of cloned YA stories) will have been long forgotten, relegated to the part of Netflix you have to scroll several pages down to find. There's no longevity here. I don't regret seeing it. As an aspiring novelist myself, it's purely mediocre films like this that tell me a lot about what not to do (that said, I'm guessing Dashner made a fair amount of dosh from it all).","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The necessary dose of realism required for a succesful sci-fi, action and thriller film has been completely forgotten. The protagonists are undefeatable and the antagonists are 100% evil guys who will 100% lose, even if the protagonists are a bunch of children and their enemy is a high-tech corporation with seemingly infinite resources. Ending was straight out horrible. The story behind the movie had great potential, to which the first and, to a slightly lesser extent, the second movies lived up to. With misses here and there they managed to pull something out of it and make them entertaining to watch. I rated this movie 5 because it is a final to the first two which I had enjoyed, otherwise if this was a standalone movie it would have gotten a 2 or a 3 from me.

A bunch of egocentric people on every side fight for vanity, for their utterly stupid version of a good life. Neither could I relate to anybody, nor was there reason to any of it. Those that fight for mankind's survival are the bad guys, but they (like all others) seem to believe violence, ignorance and self-interest the best means to go about it. The ""good guys"" fight, kill and destroy for a handful of friends aparently - at the expense of global civilization. Sadly even that ""love"" doesn't convince: It's just a presupposed facade most of the time. Admittedly this poor excuse for a plot doesn't give the cast much of a chance to convince. Even so it's mostly embarrassing. Not making sense isn't always a problem for a film, but there's really nothing here. It's dull, flat, meaningless AND stupid.If this is what we are at mankind is doomed indeed.

There's no point in sugar-coating it. I had my fair share of expectations for the movie because I enjoyed the first movie so much. Heck, even the second movie had its moments. But not this one.
The story is pretty straightforward; the protagonists try to rescue one of their own while the ""bad guys"" try to find a ""cure"". If you've seen the prequels you already know the power dynamics between the ""rebels"" and the ""establishment"". If you haven't seen any of the Maze Runner movies yet I'd suggest you to watch the first one. It's still one of my favorite Young Adult sci-fi movies to date (and the strongest link in this trilogy).
One of my main gripes with the movie was the fact that almost all the deuteragonists feel superfluous in the sense that they don't really contribute much to the story as a whole. The only exception here is Brenda. The movie does have a lot of action scenes but isn't exactly exploring deep philosophical questions. In the first movie e.g. when the protagonists find out the truth behind the maze we're exposed to an interesting ethical dilemma. A dilemma that at least explains the motivations of the ""bad guys"" and why their actions could be justified. As a whole however this ethical dilemma isn't profound enough to act as a proverbial basis for the entire trilogy. It works for the first two movies but then becomes gimmicky in the third.From a storytelling-perspective the movie makes 3 big mistakes that end up breaking the movie. The first one I've already mentioned; the fact that most of the characters in this movie don't really do anything that's ""important"" is bad writing. But let's not dwell on that fact. The other two mistakes are in my humble opinion even bigger deal-breakers.
In the synopsis of the movie it reads that the legendary last city is protected/surrounded by the deadliest maze of all. Well, don't get too excited about it. Even though that's true we never actually get to see that maze. I know, I was disappointed too. Really disappointed. It would've been the perfect ending for this trilogy. If the movie ended with the protagonists making it through the mega-maze the whole story would've come full-circle. Unfortunately, that's not the ending that this movie showcases.
And last but not least I'd like to criticize the fact that the ""bad guys"" find the ""cure"". Now, normally I would've prefaced this part with a ""Spoiler Disclaimer"" but given the fact that this movie is literally titled ""The Death Cure"" I don't think that's necessary. It's pretty obvious; one might say ""too obvious"". And that is a problem. It's as if they spoiled the movie deliberately. They're literally alluding to the ending by nonchalantly inserting the keyword into the title. And no, there are no earth-shattering plot-twists in this movie. Yes, there are some surprises here and there but they're not enough to save the movie. If the rebels had discovered the cure e.g. it would've made the story more interesting. That way they could've cured the infected and by doing so build an army to rival the obviously over-powered antagonists. It would've leveled the playing field and raised the stakes for the ""bad guys"".","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie included perfect acting, a sad amazing story and the reason i gave 9/10 is that some random people showed In the movie that were never mentioned before...

A pretty good action film, it really pulls no punches. The kind of Mad Max like setting also works too, even though I liked the last two films of this series. Everybody gives a good performance except for Dylan O' Brien, not that he was terrible, some scenes he was good, but others he was kind of bland while trying to be strong, instead looking uninterested. But all in all still an enjoyable film.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

this movie have the first scene which is good and they made the trailer from the only first scenes of the movie, this movie grabbed my attention because i love virus sci-fic movie but this movie have nothing few zombies which do nothing in the movie, just doing break dance in front of all cast, but zombies is only in 2 scenes of the virus movie called ""cure"". i didn't find anything about virus in the movie, just taking, taking and love track, and at the last they try to make me fool through the last scene but i didn't make me fool like the other who gives the movie positive movie, there is nothing positive in the movie, they add some scenes in the last but i didn't find it interesting, its too illogical and boring, and some elements in the movie which i like is the daughter and father duo, they both are amazing but they didn't get the large screen time, dylan is the zombie of the movie, he just stand and stare in the movie, he have nothing to do, and his dialogue delivery is like zombie (only in this movie). second kaya, she is just looking pretty from outside but inside she is so dumb and her character is poorly written. Ki Hong Lee is the guy who stretched this movie, if he was rescued with all the guys in the bus, so they didn't make this boring stupid movie, Will Poulter which is just perform eyebrow dancing performance and carrying gun in the whole movie, but he doesn'nt shoot well, he try to compete with dwayne the rock by giving his looks but fails, Rosa is the only one who gives her best with his dad gian carlo, their duo is superb. barry peper is the most worst villian of the year, they should give him the oscar of the most dumb and word written villian,
all said and done! this movie is garbage, with a lot of scenes which the leading cast is walking with the peoples , and just put the guns on the hand, don't waste your time .","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

It had amazing characters, a great plot and it was visually fantastic. I was so ready for the sequel. Then when the sequel came out, I thought it was okay. Nowhere near as good as the first film but good enough. It ended with that cliffhanger that definitely left you hanging for the ending. That's when this came out...This film is extremely bad which really sucks because as someone who loves closure to trilogies, this really broke me. Trust me, closure is NOT worth it. It's best you left your mind wondering what happened afterwards by just assuming the good guys win and picturing your own story. It is a LOT better than what you're going to get. There is SO MANY things that are awful in this film. It is extremely long with so many cliches and unnatural dialogue. There is very hollow, shallow and unrealistic romance in here and so much more. The only good thing I can say from this film is that it is visually good but even THAT is not enough to redeem this horrible film. For many people, they will desperately want some closure and just for that, skip to the ending but even that's not worth it as it STILL leaves you hanging even though this has ended! Like I said, this film is not worth it.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

The pacing of the story is slow, and the plot lacks the same level of tension and excitement as its predecessors. The acting is decent, but the characters fail to make a lasting impact.One of the biggest disappointments of the film is the lack of development in the relationship between the main characters, Thomas and Teresa. Their romance is rushed and underwhelming, and it feels like the filmmakers were more focused on wrapping up the story than exploring the complexities of their relationship.The special effects and action sequences are well done, but they are not enough to save the film from its shortcomings. The ending is unsatisfying, and it fails to provide closure to the story.In comparison to the first two films, ""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"" is a weak conclusion to the trilogy. It falls short of the high standards set by the previous films, and it fails to deliver the same level of excitement and tension. Overall, the film is a disappointment and a letdown for fans of the series.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Fearful that their friend is going to be dissected, maze survivors Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) disobey the resistance leader (Barry Pepper) and head to the Last City.But they cannot penetrate the citadel without help from some unlikely allies (Walton Goggins, Kaya Scodelario).While the initial installment of this post-apocalyptic franchise was intriguing, this third chapter in the adaptation of the YA book series is the complete opposite.

This movie here has every single most stereotypical trope for every scene you encounter! Also the bad guys have a hit-rate of 0%!

The actors try to make the best of it. 
Hard to care for any character though, since they seem to suffer from brain-damage.So why the 5 star rating then? Hmmm, visuals.The enemy security troopers look nice! Nice gear. Well, if you're into that sorta thing.Some interior sets are nicely detailed and have got an overall pleasant design - if maybe a bit generic.Very nice lighting throughout this movie! 
The framing and composition of most shots is also nice. Nothing experimental or overly daring, but they're safe choices that work. 
The various techy UIs are uninspired and cheaply done, though. Hacking the enemy = updating Ubuntu 16 from default repositories? C'mon, guys!!!No abuse of lensflares, though!So the bottom line is...

Almost no other directors have stayed with a film series based on a young adult novel series the whole way through (Gary Ross left after the first 'Hunger Games', Neil Burger left after the first 'Divergent', etc.), and Ball certainly has a knack for directing sweeping action sequences. The problem for me is the overall script, but I'll get to that later. Dylan O'Brien overcame a life-threatening injury while working on this film, which shows his true commitment as an actor, and I have to say, he still gives the best performance and has the best character in this franchise. In fact, most of the cast does a great job with the material they're given, and they sell it the best that they can. Back to the script, though. About an hour and a half into the movie, it felt as if the inevitable conclusion was near. I was actually enjoying myself, despite the relatively repetitive nature of the story, and if it had ended where I though it would end, I may actually have given the movie a fresh review. However, the film then proceeds to go on for another hour, which wouldn't be as much of a problem if that damn repetitive nature of the script hadn't continued. I knew where every plot point was going, making the last half particularly boring for me. Although I do prefer this than to split the last film into two parts (that's a shot at you, other young adult franchises), I just can't help feeling like a good 20-30 minutes could have been trimmed off the second half of the film. If you are a fan of the franchise, this is pretty much in line with the previous two films. However, for the rest of us, I just found the runtime on this film to be much too long to warrant a positive review.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It had the very commercial hollywood twist to it which would easily make it a blockbuster movie loved by kids. With that being said, Film critics and adults would laugh at such a calamity.

Because it has been 3 years since the 2nd movie, the interest in this series may have suffered from a lost in momentum and interest. The movie could have used maybe a 10-minute refresher of the prior two movies at the beginning to bring the audience up to speed. That would have made it more interesting to watch.Granted the delay was due to O'Brien's injuries in filming this threequel, I am glad to see he is okay, and he definitely needed to be in this one to bring closure to the story.

"","","The Maze Runner: The Death Cure ***","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4048681/?ref_=tt_urv","chrisjhembury","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32603923/?ref_=tt_urv","30 January 2018","The third and final instalment of the Maze runner franchise arrives seeing the final showdown in the apocalyptic new world of the survivors of the disease that has wiped out population battle the powers that be for the cure. 
 
The film hits the ground running setting the tone for this action packed finale with a prison break train heist. It's this action heavy hand of the film's narrative that really helps you forget any weak areas of the script of potential plot holes by hitting you hard with action after action which is all handled and delivered very well. 
The film never raises to the heights of greatness but certainly completes the franchise very well and you'll struggle to find to may films that tie up trilogies as entertaining as the film here does. Sure there's Return of the King, Return of the Jedi but then there's Godfather part 3, The Dark Knight Rises, Spiderman 3, God forgive them Taken 3. 
 
The Maze Runner has delivered a entertaining trilogy where by each sequel has gone bigger than the last and delivered a finale that will please loyal fans and newcomers as well. 
 
The trilogy may not be Shakespearean in content but popcorn pleasing fan fare in it's purest indulgence.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
