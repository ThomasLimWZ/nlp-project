Lot's of very negative reviews not sure what they were expecting, I don't think anyone involved was planning a trip to the Oscars. Sometimes it's good to just relax and not over critique everything.","31 out of 38 found this helpful.

I remember loving this when I first watched it over a decade ago and after a recent run of disappointing movies I wanted to see something I knew or thought I'd love so I went with this.Straight off the bat, I noticed how much more believable cgi and vfx used to look in the 2010's and you can see that with other movies like iron man or transformers, while new movies now just look like video games more often than not. I loved how even though it's set in the 'future', the surroundings felt relatable, not all super shiny, slick new tech, adds to the plausibility of it all even though it's scifi.It's not complex plot or avant-garde script because it's made just for fun. Has everything you'd want in a feel good action flick; it has flare, blood pumping fights, great soundtrack, story, carnage, an underdog to root for and it even has heart as we get to see a father and son bond together. The movie is sweet and heartfelt at it's core behind all the metal bashing. One thing that stood apart for me about the movie is the end, it ends at the perfect moment, most movies would want a moment of reflection or something after an epic finale like that but Real Steel leaves you while your adrenaline's still pumping. If you haven't watched it, go watch it, and if you have, rewatch.","10 out of 11 found this helpful.

It stars Hugh Jackman, Dakota Goyo, Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, Kevin Durand, Hope Davis and James Rebhorn. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Mauro Fiore.Set in the near future, robot boxing is a big crowd pulling sport. After a struggling robot operator is introduced to an 11-year-old son he has never known, they stumble upon a discarded robot at a junk yard....We can all moan about the mimicry of an idea and the clichés that dominate Real Steel, but you really got to hand it to the makers for what they have achieved. They have crafted a family film that's very much perfect in this day and age. The story is one that any adult Sylvester Stallone fan can acknowledge and appreciate, the human heartbeat pleasingly steady, while the premise of big colourful robots beating the crap out of each other delights youngsters and us adults who are still young at heart. Film pretty much does what any other film of this type does, lays on the syrup in the last quarter where second chances and family strife come thundering through the plotting. Undeniably it's hugely derivative, events are joystick operated to get an emotional response from a family audience, while product placement reins and the script often sags under the weight of unoriginality. But it does uplift the spirit and getting to the end is easy since it's so much berserker fun. Yes it's the robot Atom, the people's champion, yes it's David vS Goliath and yes! It's Balboa vS Creed. Nothing wrong with that really.The cast don't really have to offer up much beyond being adequate within the context of the material, though a muscular Jackman finds good paternal chemistry with young Goyo. In fact Goyo is pleasingly not annoying, always a bonus is that. Inevitably the robots are the stars, they're a triumph of design and visual effects and a sight for sore eyes, while Levy has a good handle on staging the fight sequences - even when cribbing from Balboa. The near future look is terrific as well, with Fiore's colour photography very appealing. Coining in over $290 million at the worldwide box office (over £180 million in profit), Real Steel found the family audience it was looking for, proving once again that there is a market for simple and effective popcorn carnage. It's not high art or intelligently scripted, but was anyone seriously thinking that was going to be the case here? If you want brains with this premise then seek out Twilight Zone episode ""Steel"", starring the excellent Lee Marvin, otherwise just sit back and enjoy the ride and let the botty bots and human interest raise the pulse and gladden the heart respectively. 7/10Home format release is a sparkling print, extras are annoyingly short but the blooper reel is fun, we get a stunt deconstruction, and we learn about the influence a certain Mr. Spielberg had on the production.","36 out of 50 found this helpful.

The Ending - Original and Motivating, showed it had a moral to the story (If you watched the movie, you would know)HOWEVER, unfortunately the kid put me off immensely. I appreciate his confidence in acting but his screaming and his cheesy lines were just off putting. I also noticed that his technological understanding was ridiculously high, which is rather unrealistic...And that is an understatement.That being said, I can sense a 'Real Steel 2' and would hope it turns out as good as this first one. Sequels are very hard to perfect especially for this movie, but I digress.This movie is worth watching and if you plan on watching it, be sure to prepare your tissues.","43 out of 70 found this helpful.

It's a bit strange because of the fact that robots fight instead of humans. With that said, the robots are perfectly anthropomorphized so you feel like they are men.But the special effects are robot fighting are only worth about a 6/10. Hugh Jackman's struggle to be a good father is actually well-acted out, both by him and the kid. The heroine role is also acted out well by a very beautiful woman.This is not a perfect movie, but it captures many human emotions and seems to be a good movie for family-oriented people to flock around for an emotional, Rocky-like romp.","12 out of 18 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Spielbergian movie with a lot of heart","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2499428/?ref_=tt_urv","Happy_Evil_Dude","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3168214/?ref_=tt_urv","7 October 2011","Most of the time, if a film director hits the big time, it's usually that one of his films, early on in his career, has made a huge smash and given him status and power. This is the case for people like Spielberg, Lucas, Coppola, Shyamalan, Cameron, etc... However, if there's one director that has been steadily moving up the ranks of the Hollywood over the past ten years or so, starting out small and tackling on bigger, more ambitious and more prestigious projects as he goes on, it's definitely Canadian filmmaker Shawn Levy.The man started out directing episodes of Nickelodeon and Disney Channel shows such as Animorphs or The Famous Jett Jackson in the late nineties, moved on to directing kids from those types of shows in their big screen efforts, such as Big Fat Liar and Cheaper By The Dozen and used the success of these films to bag ever more prestigious comedies, from The Pink Panther remake to Night At The Museum to Date Night. And while critics have mocked him and dismissed him, calling him an untalented hack, he has now graduated to a big, science-fiction blockbuster produced by Steven Spielberg himself, Real Steel.Like a couple of other recent sci-fi releases, I Am Legend and The Box, Real Steel is based on a story by celebrated genre writer Richard Matheson. Well it is actually loosely based, or as the credits put it ""partly based"" on it. Indeed, Real Steel basically only retains the fact that robot boxers have replaced human boxers in the future from Matheson's story, which is probably a good thing as its twist ending is now so widely known.Real Steel takes place in the very near future, barely ten years from now. Not much is different other than the fact that robot boxing is one of the most popular sports in the world and the phones, computers & co are much more advanced. Charlie Kenton, played by Hugh Jackman, is a former boxer turned small-time ""robot trainer"". Constantly in debt, he tours the US in his truck, looking for fairs where he can have his robot fight for cash. Things get complicated for him when the son he never cared about enters his life, finds an old robot in a scrap-heap and decides to have him fight.Earlier this year, media outlets all over made a big fuss about the fact that Steven Spielberg had produced Super 8, which in their mind made Super 8 as much a Spielberg film as a JJ Abrams film. For some reason no such fuss has been made about the three other films Spielberg personally produced this year, be it Transformers 3, Cowboys & Aliens or Real Steel. Interestingly though, Real Steel is just as Spielbergian as Super 8, if not more. At the world premiere of the film in Paris, Hugh Jackman told us how the film was about a son and his father, and how the young Dakota Goyo is the heart of this film. I initially scoffed at this but when the film ended a couple of hours later I knew he was speaking the truth. The science-fiction robot ass-kicking element of the film is just a sheen under which the real subject shines through: the relationship between a father and his son.Real Steel is actually a sports movie. The fact that it is about boxing robots is essentially irrelevant and simply serves to give it an identity and a cool factor. It could have been about human boxing, football, baseball, car racing, whatever, and the story wouldn't have changed, which is in my mind one of the film's big strengths. The story of Real Steel isn't particularly original, but it is instead a classic story, that speaks to our primal emotions as human beings. It is a David vs Goliath story that had the packed theater cheering, clapping and reacting like I've seldom seen a movie audience react.The film is beautiful to look at, the fights are cool and the acting is of high caliber. Danny Elfman's music is effective but not particularly original and will remind you partly of his ""emotion theme"" for The Kingdom and partly of every sports movie music ever made. The rest of the music is mostly comprised of Eminem songs, apparently the most popular singer in the future. Contrarily to what another reviewer here said, I found the ending to be realistic and hugely satisfying.The big difference between Super 8 and Real Steel is that while Super 8 is perhaps more enjoyable ""in the moment"" due to it being more high concept and having more stuff going on all the time, like everything JJ Abrams does it seems to lack in something and is somewhat forgettable. Real Steel, despite featuring many cold, metal robots, as a warm, beating heart at its core and for that I say: well done, Shawn Levy, well done.","14 out of 25 found this helpful.

Well before its release, and before any intricate plot details became known, this sounded like an intelligent film in which robots are forced to engage in brutal fights for the entertainment of their human masters. Where the story would've gone from there is left to the imagination, but it appeared to have all the makings of critically acclaimed, self-conscious science fiction. The final product differed heavily from initial expectations, however, and we are left with a hollow, albeit bearable alternative prompting those such as myself to ask: What could have been?In the very near future (2020, according to director Shawn Levy) the human art of man-to-man combat has become obsolete. One-time fighters have been replaced by robots that do the dirty work while their human controllers reap the rewards. Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is one such promoter, recently down on his luck and who lives not for the bright lights, but to make just enough money to survive. At this most inopportune time, he is forced to take care of his estranged son (Dakota Goyo), whose burgeoning friendship with an outdated sparring 'bot named Atom convinces Charlie to give the big time one last shot.For a movie that has the skeleton to accommodate exploring the concept of human qualities in machines, a la Blade Runner or Artificial Intelligence, as well as (warning: pretentiousness ahead) the theme of 'ethics and morals of humanity', it actually does everything it can to avoid those topics entirely. My hopes for such a film were all but dashed with the casting of a child- a sure sign that the story would be strictly focused on Max and Charlie's relationship, and in that respect the plot seems unnecessarily restricted. This results in an inherently out-of-place scene in which Atom, all alone before a big fight, gazes into a mirror as if to question his existence. Its inclusion into the final cut is sure to whiz above the heads of its pre-teen target audience, while more mature viewers might interpret it as a cheap attempt to inject some heart far too late into the story.Indeed, its family-friendly status is the biggest letdown of Real Steel. At the forefront is the misguided characterisation of Charlie's son, who is portrayed as, in my opinion, a spoiled brat who's so cocksure of himself all the time that a little part of you wants to see him fail. The child as an authority figure may appeal to those of Max's age, but it detracts from the contrasting, gritty realism of Jackman's character, and shuts down any hope of character-based realism in the process. Other attempts to please the male tween market include obvious allusions to toy lines and video games, as well as a mind-boggling assault of product placement, which becomes more than a little irritating during the second half.The script is not disastrous. The writers dabble in clichés occasionally, but not quite to the point where it numbs the mind. On a more negative note, the screenplay does allow for an assortment of cringe-worthy moments (which some might call 'heart-warming', depending on personal perspective) that include dancing robots and the introduction of more than one excessively cartoonish side character, again limiting the level of engagement one can make with this movie.The action set pieces in the film were visually pleasing, exploiting a decent amount of camera angles to give the viewer an intriguing look into the mechanics of robot rumbling. The CGI is impressive, and the clunky (as opposed to slick) movements of the robots actually work well, reflecting what a realistic fight between two heavy machines would look like. Jackman does his best as always, but he alone can't salvage a once-promising prospect that instead settles for being the very definition of blockbuster mediocrity.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*","233 out of 477 found this helpful.

He tours the small circuit looking for fights in an attempt to break into the big time. Charlie isn't the most likable of characters. He's got a drinking problem and a son he's never met named Max (Dakota Goyo). When an opportunity arises to make a buck off being a parent, Charlie has to take Max along for the ride.The effects behind Real Steel are the real showcase. CGI is prevalent during the robot boxing matches. Though not necessary, the effort was clearly made to use some actual robots in close-up. The difference between the two will go unnoticed by most, in big part due to the smooth animation. I actually prefer the robot action in this movie over that of the Transformers series because the confined location of a ring or cage makes the action significantly easier to digest.Real Steel comes from director Shawn Levy, whose entire niche is family friendly fare. As for story, this is a movie about family bonding more so than robotics, the sweet science, or training. It hinges on Hugh and Dakota so that's it's simply not a collection of brawls. The two get along fine, and though Max is written like the father figure many will take relief in his maturity. Real Steel has a plot that's aimed right at the kiddos with easy to distinguish good and bad figures. Of course the ice-cold Russian-Japanese duo behind the reigning champ Zeus don't have relatable family struggles to put them in a gray area.There's some disbelief to suspend. An unsponsored robot fighting among tiny crowds in a bar isn't going to generate enough revenue to break into the black. There must have been a half dozen child endangerment offenses that were eradicated in the near future, around the same time 8-foot fighting robots first come into existence. Of course it didn't take long for the price to drop like a rock as the closest you can get to Atom today is Honda's ASIMO, and it's big feature is that it can balance itself. Real Steel also features an inordinate amount of robotic engineers, and focusing on a boxer turned robot operator is like finding a writer who repairs Kindles.Real Steel has the robot action that will appeal to kids and the ultimate package isn't far from getting the Disney seal as distributor over the Touchstone marquee. It's a movie about bonding and values without the odd comic characters usually seen in a movie intended for children and dare I say less violent than Star Wars.","14 out of 26 found this helpful.

The movie was amazing.Story was pretty decent, acting was phenomenal, special effects were OUTSTANDING and everything just clicked in. It wasn't lacking anything; action was there, drama was there, comedy was there, romance was there ... from minute one to 127 it kept me glued to the screen, holding my breath at robot fights and laughing even at the smallest of jokes. What I liked the most was a chemistry between all characters; Charlie, Max and Bailey and each and every other character in the movie. They all brought the core of their characters to screen and blew our minds with their performances. I must say that I didn't expect this movie to be this good. My expectations were high for special effects and Hugh's acting, but what this movie brought was more than just that.Recommended for watching : it should be first on your non-watched movies of 2011 because it stands out by it's greatness and pure mind-blowing performances.","33 out of 71 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Doesn't lead us down the road of ""coolness""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2566010/?ref_=tt_urv","StevePulaski","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23483288/?ref_=tt_urv","14 February 2012","My response to Real Steel is almost parallel to Hugh Jackman's reaction to the robot fighter Atom in the film. Upon initial advertising and trailers, I wasn't impressed by the film one bit. It looked like another film that glorified the ""coolness"" of robots, and then tried to tack on a contrived story of a father and son relationship. Never did I believe I'd see it and actually award it a positive score. Just like in the film where Jackman doesn't believe Atom has what it takes to be a successful fighter, and then is greeted with a rude awakening.The film takes place in the near future, 2020 according to director Shawn Levy, where human boxers have been replaced by large metal monstrosities that do the dirty work while the humans occupy the controls and the commands for them. Charlie Kenton (Jackman), a former boxer, now spends his days using the robots to fight, but finds himself in a rough patch of failures.After being informed his ex-girlfriend has died, whom he had a child with, Charlie must now take care of the kid for three months until his aunt and uncle return from their second honeymoon. The kid is eleven year old Max, played efficiently by Dakota Goyo. The two meet awkwardly, but experienced moviegoers like myself know that these two will soon become a cheerful father and son duo.During a junkyard visit where Charlie and Max are searching for new parts for their robot, they stumble upon Atom, a small, yet relentlessly strong bot who is abandoned but still able to fight. They repair him, and then discover that with voice recognition and shadow effect, where the robot mimes the moves of a human) that he is a bot with a strong amount of potential for success. The rest of the film depicts the father and son's efforts to take Atom all the way to the championship.The digital effects work very well together, and are much more eye appealing than the similar ones used in the Transformers series. For one thing, the fight scenes are coherent, entertaining, and extremely well scored by Danny Elfman, who this time gives us some delightfully different music.The robots are captured using a variety of digital techniques. Some are animatronic, some are used through motion capture animation, where actors get fitted for special suits and imitate the motions of the character, and some just plain ol' CGI. All of these three techniques are blended very well together, and make for a very entertaining visual spectacle. Even the motion capture isn't as sketchy and glitchy as it normally is. In Ang Lee's Hulk back in 2003 it was clearly jerky and underdeveloped, in Mars Needs Moms, this same year, it was unnecessary and obtrusive, but here, it seems the effects team has gotten their act together.I think the only fault here is the screenplay. but what makes it a bit better is the fact that the cast approaches it with optimism and the mentality that they will ""make it work."" Jackman certainly does, pulling off a sleazy, ignorant father who grows to appreciate his son and his job a bit more, and Dakota Goyo, like I said before, hits almost every note just right. The problem is the screenplay hammers us with several movie clichés we've seen many times before. The rags to riches story has shown itself many times, not to mention one's rise from humble beginnings to a successful career. At least Real Steel recognizes the movies it's paying homage to, like the whole end scene that slightly mirrors Rocky.Director Shawn Levy has successfully made success out of two underdogs; the film itself and Atom. His previous flicks like Just Married and Night at the Museum were lightweight innocent features that failed to include anything on the same level as Real Steel. By the end, the film had given me a feelings I like to possess when I come out of a film I thought was going to be lackluster; reassured and surprised.Starring: Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo. Directed by: Shawn Levy.","35 out of 54 found this helpful.

"","","A Nutshell Review: Real Steel","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2499043/?ref_=tt_urv","DICK STEEL","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0317399/?ref_=tt_urv","6 October 2011","Real Steel is a science fiction fantasy piece that imagines a world in future where all that is possible, where humans take control of giant robots to do battle on their behalf in the boxing ring. But those looking for robot fight after robot fight might be better off with watching the Transformers trilogy from start to end, since you only get a handful of robot battles, with the bulk being montaged away in the midsection and the final fight even, which leaves behind an aftertaste of being short changed on the entertainment front, since we're like the spectators on screen, ready to see some hard hitting action from the get go.Instead this film takes on a more human dimension, which is rather formulaic if you strip away the robot and machine component. Hugh Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, an ex-boxer turned robot gladiator who travels from arena to arena with his machine to fight the odd match for money, with little luck since his limited funding means a pile of debt and little else to spruce up his robot with any upgrades. To compound the problem, he gets to hook up with his 11 year old son Max (Dakota Goyo) he never knew, and forms a testy relationship fueled by stubbornness from both parties, which you know will turn for the better with their discovery of Atom, a sparse sparring robot they found in a junkyard.It plays on the human themes of courage and never giving up when in pursuit of something, which of course gets translated via Atom in its many fights in the ring, designed to take plenty of hits, yet always having something extra within itself to stand up and continuing doing what it's meant to do. Through the inanimate object both father and son start to bond - Max being the convenient kid tinkerer of parts fueled by his belief and idealism, and Charlie bringing experience in fighting to the table, both becoming partners as they take on whatever gigs that come their way, until an outburst by Max meant a shot at the world title against the incumbent champion Zeus, funded by what seemed to be Russian money and Japanese expertise, a plot development you'll see coming very expectedly.Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo share a wonderful chemistry together that worked wonders for the film, and especially Dakota for his ability to come off quite naturally without being in awe of his more illustrious co-star. Jackman continues to build his filmography with appealing, alpha-male type characters that never cease to put a wrong foot in, having the honour of being trained by the legendary Sugar Ray Leonard to prepare for his role as a boxer. Evangeline Lily plays Charlie's girlfriend and the daughter of Charlie's trainer in his days of being a boxer, and Anthony Mackie was severely under-utilized as a bout organizer and punter. Subplots involving a custody battle, and gangsters to whom Charlie owed money to were quite unnecessary, if not to pause the film a little to fill in the space between the robot fights.The designs of the robots were definitely the highlight of the film, with names mirroring the ability the robots possess, and the animatronics were top notch naturally, with motion capture employed to detail the bouts. Plenty of thought went into the mechanics of the machines, from wireless control panels to components unique to each robot thanks to cannibalizing of others. Unique to Atom is its shadowing ability, since its built as a sparring bot, heavy set to allow for plenty of punishment, and like a sparring partner can mirror one's exact movements, which presents an angle of argument that machines that have that human touch, is probably blessed with the best of both worlds. I won't be surprised if Atom will get inducted into the annals of great cinematic robots one day for its endearing exploits in Real Steel.Artificial intelligence versus human intelligence, awareness and experience is something that recurs in each of the featured battles, and in the real world, this challenge is something that continues to intrigue researchers to one day play God and create something that can mimic our human mind and decision making close enough. From defeating world champions in chess and Jeopardy participants, no doubt the computer on board can defeat a human opponent, but as far as I'm aware this competitive advantage has not reached a more physical arena, at least not yet to the level as shown in this film, but it will be intriguing if one day we do get there.A glaring plot point I cannot reconcile will involve the super-robot Zeus which was touted to be the best of breed with being autonomous in learning from mistakes and from its opponents in real time. Alas we don't see much of those, if at all, in the film taking effect, which makes it a severe system flaw in failure of execution, or the usual marketing talk in building up hype, which is common in the real world. Which serves to explain that while machines can perform rote functions perfectly, humans will still always have the upperhand with creativity and innovativeness almost always worked into our solutions.But don't let that detract you from this entertaining crowd pleaser coming from director Shawn Levy who knows a thing or two about crafting broad based films that appeal, even if it does follow a repackaged formula - tell me if you don't see similarities with Sylvester Stallone's Over The Top about a father and son, and in the competitive arena of arm wrestling - exploiting the popularity of robots in film in recent years.","15 out of 29 found this helpful.

"","","Real Steel? Try Real Stupid","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2501377/?ref_=tt_urv","ArtandJoyofMovies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27866793/?ref_=tt_urv","10 October 2011","Real Steel? TMG says Real Stupid. This movie is just dumber than dirt from the get go. I am sure some eleven year old boys who are into sci-fi and robots will think this film is really cool. But if we judge any film by that standard, snot on a grasshopper's back is entertaining and cool too.Hugh Jackman plays a forty something eleven year old named Charlie Kenton who never grew up from playing with toys. The year is around 2020 and apparently the world has descended into a bunch of violence crazed degenerates who never bathe and spill beer everywhere and all love robo-boxing. This is a great start for a film targeted at pre-teens. During the scenes at the ""Crash Palace"" I really thought I was watching some outtakes from Waterworld (1995) and Dennis Hopper would come back from the dead with a black eye patch on. This just goes to prove what a piece of junk $100 million can buy you in a movie.Charlie is a former boxer, irresponsible no-mind, who builds boxing robots with money from loan sharks. His lucky day hits when he learns his ex-girlfriend has died and has left him with his biological eleven year-old son Max (Goyo). For the good of no one, Max's Aunt Debra wants to adopt Max, so Charlie makes a deal with her uber wealthy husband for Debra to keep Max for $100,000.00. Max's loving Aunt Debra then immediately turns him back over to Charlie for the summer while she and hubby vacation Europe. This is all just dandy.Little Max turns out to be a way too smart, way beyond his years smart ass of a kid, who of course is a genius at building half-ton ton, artificially intelligent robots. He runs from county fair to county fair with dear old Dad building and fighting robots against skin heads and the dregs of society–which is pretty much the entire earth at this point. All the while, Charlie manages a ridiculously contrived relationship with the daughter of his former boxing trainer. In the interim, we get a 2010 film tech adaptation of father and son playing and updated 1964 era version of Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots.Charlie and Max, down on their last dollar, build a scrap heap robo-fighter from a junkyard and name him Atom. No spoiler at all what happens next as they rise to the top of the robo- boxing world and find love. I wanted to just puke. If this terribly written plot and cliché driven dialogue represents the future of of anything, I don't want to live that long.I did notice a few things along the way. Goya looks and acts amazingly like young Mark Sway (Brad Renfro) in The Client from 1994. I wondered if they were actually brothers. (Let's hope the promising young Goya fares better than Renfro who died at 25 from a drug overdose.) I noticed, oddly enough, that all cars in 2020 all look like 1990′s models. I also noticed that giving an eleven year old boy a line like ""Anything you don't need, you just throw away"" is not even heart inspiring in a totally absurd movie. One hour in, I was bored to death and was frankly surprised few adults were walking out. Perhaps they did not realize films like 50/50 and The Way and The Help were showing right next door. Real Steel even made Thor look inspiring, well written fun and believable and I didn't think that was even possible.And what is with all the scenes of prairie windmills in this movie? It really looked like the Director was trying to make some political statement on energy for no reason. Fact is, if those absurdly inefficient bird killers on the Kansas plains are still running in 2020, we are all in real trouble. Maybe we will all be wearing sleeveless shirts, go un-bathed, and drink beer all day while playing with robots and reading Al Gore's biography. Nah. . . . I don't think so. It might be cool if Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots comes back though.","27 out of 63 found this helpful.

The idea is adapted from Richard Matheson's 1956 short story ""Steel"" previously shown on TV as an episode of ""The Twilight Zone."" Just think of ""Rocky"" being played by a robot and you are as close to what Real Steel is about as you can get. Besides the novelty of Robot Rocky, there is only the usual estranged dad-and-son storyline with a little uncanny romance thrown in. Considering that this is a Disney film, you can expect to have your heartstrings tugged - and other predictable stuff.Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a has-been boxer who now travels the country promoting his tin-can fighter robot. He owes a lot of people money and he finds a way out of his predicament when he gets news that his ex-wife has died in an accident, and he must attend the custody hearing of his son Max (Dakota Goyo, who was last seen in ""Thor""). Charlie practically ""sells"" his son off to his ex-wife's sister (Hope Davis) and her filthy-rich hubby (James Rebhorn) for adoption.For the time being, however, Charlie is stuck with Max who also happens to be a fan of video games and robot boxing. Together, and with the help of Charlie's girlfriend Bailey (Evangeline Lilly), they patch up used robots for tournaments. When they come across an obsolete sparing 'bot named Atom, Max sees potential in it as an underdog droid capable of taking on the top robots in the Real Steel matches.""Real Steel"" holds thrills for boxing fans because the action is as gruelling and crunching as the human matches. Top that up with realistic-looking effects, we even feel for those boxing machines - just as we have felt for droids like R2D2 and C3PO in the ""Star Wars"" sagas. Among the human cast, Jackman is in top form as the debt-ridden hustler of a dad who finds a match in his own flesh-and-blood. Indeed, Goyo steals the show as the Dr Pepper-guzzling kid who is highly confident in himself and his abilities. Together, Jackman and Goyo exude fantastic screen chemistry.Lilly (of TV's ""Lost"") provides the requisite feminine presence as Charlie's long-suffering girlfriend but the relationship poses some disturbing questions for viewers: like, what is a pretty girl like her doing, waiting for a loser like Charlie when she can have any guy she wants? And as can be expected, another winning performance comes from Atom the cute 'junkyard dog' that dances like a butterfly and takes heavy beatings without flinching. Another entertaining family treat from Disney. (Full review at limchangmoh.blogspot.com)","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

Over The Top because there's a man, his son, and a truck. Rocky because it's obvious. Put these films together and add robots and minus Stallone. Real Steel is not very innovating though but it's excitingly great and has plenty of heart. It's also the return of Hugh Jackman although we just saw him a little last June. There are lot of things to recommend in Real Steel.The premise isn't really that intriguing. It's boxing replaced by robots. Films with Giant CGI Robots are not innovating since we have Michael Bay's Transformers. But the heart and soul lies to the relationship of Charlie and Max and their robot, Atom. It's fun to watch them. The fighting scenes are pretty exciting. That is what most underdog fighting movies do. The only problem here is the weak major antagonist. It's not really that threatening or a big deal. Ricky was more threatening than the gigantic Zeus.The filmmaking is pretty decent. Well shot scenes. The CGI robots and the music score are good enough. Nothing to say about the production design except Charlie's truck. It looks fascinating for some reason. The performances were great. We don't see Hugh Jackman in action movies after two years and there's a small cameo of him, flipping off two characters(it's obvious but I won't tell you the title). Here in Real Steel, Jackman is energetic and somewhat perfect for the role. Dakota Goyo is a bit charming. Chemistry of him and Jackman shines through the film. It's fun to watch them together.There aren't much new here in Real Steel but in the end, it's enjoyable and has plenty of heart. The climax isn't so much overwhelming but it intends to be more heartfelt. Again, it's like Over The Top which the father is trying to make his son proud and Rocky because it's boxing and add some robots in it. Even without thinking much about the robots, there is always human heart in this film. Hugh Jackman does it again. The underdog fighting movie genre does it again. It's really a fun film for the whole family.","88 out of 161 found this helpful.

I've watched some incredibly skank films on the whiff of a rumor that there might be a halfway decent fight scene in it or it features an unknown (to the West) martial arts choreographer whose names rhymes with ""Bang."" I am also a connoisseur of giant robots. From MechCommander to Cyberball, I just can't get enough of them. Frankly, I would have been extremely happy if it was just a crappily animated CGI version of Rock'em, Sock'em Robots.But no.

"7","/10","If you take it as a kids movie, it's really pretty good!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2563875/?ref_=tt_urv","Boba_Fett1138","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1416505/?ref_=tt_urv","10 February 2012","It probably was aiming for a wider audience but the movie in essence really is a movie that will probably be enjoyed the most by young kids. You could say that this is the ""Rocky"" for really young kids, about an underdog, taking a shot at the boxing title. It only doesn't involve human boxing this time but robot boxing instead.The premise is really awesome of course but I must say it probably works best for the first part of the movie and at the end. In the middle the movie starts to take a more dramatic approach. Nothing wrong with that of course but it doesn't ever feel like anything gets developed properly and involving enough.The movie is really filled with missed opportunities. For instance at points they decided to give the boxing robot, named Atom, some almost human like emotions and characteristics but the movie does far too little with this. It could had created a real special and heartfelt bond between the little boy and the robot but instead the movie is only really sporadicly doing this, so it just never becomes anything truly effective.Also the story itself is far from anything believable of course. And no, I'm not just talking about the fact that it involves robot boxing but more so about it that it features a story in which an 11 year old boy builds his own fighting robot, pretty much from scratch and not only that but he kicks some robot butt with it as well and even after just a handful of fights gets to take a shot at the world title, against a robot that obviously cost millions of dollars to build, train and maintain and had years of experience at the top. But oh well, this is of course a story lots of young boys want to see and get excited about. So again, as a kids movie it definitely is serving its purpose but also as an adult it also all remains perfectly watchable, since there still is plenty to enjoy for them as well, also story-wise.Luckily the movie has plenty of great elements in it to make up for its weaknesses. Because all in all, I still did really liked this movie and was even loving it at times.First of all, it's a great and spectacular looking movie. It uses some great cinematography and the special effects are really topnotch. It truly does feel and look like the human characters are interacting with the robot ones and the use of real shot stuff and CGI blends in perfectly and seamlessly with each other. Also the music by Danny Elfman and its sound design truly adds to the movie!Also the fights themselves, and lets face it, that's what the movie is all about, are truly spectacular and thrilling to watch. They are well put together and puts you right into the action, which really makes you want to root for Atom. Seriously, to me it was almost just as thrilling and exciting as any of the fights, from any of the Rocky movies. One thing that does still puzzle me is why boxing is something that always works so great and spectacular on film, while in real life it really isn't every anything half as exciting or spectacular to watch.Hugh Jackman really needed a movie like this again. There once was a time, not too long ago, he was asked to be in basically everything but now days, after a couple of not so big successes behind his name, he most likely didn't had lots of big movie offers being thrown his way. But with this movie he shows he's still in good form, also psychically. He really gave away one fine performance, even though his character maybe isn't exactly the best written. The young Dakota Goyo also did a more than great job. Little kids in movies can so often get incredibly annoying when they have to act in all sorts of situations with all different type of emotions but Dakota Goyo really manages to pull it all off really well and convincingly.The movie is further more being filled by some other great and also likable characters. Now, some of them indeed feel a bit comic-book like at times but in my opinion this actually suited the movie its overall atmosphere and way of storytelling very well.So a movie with hits and misses but luckily still mostly hits. And sometimes when the movie hits, it hits really well!7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

It's funny and you will immediately catch one of it's core concepts: boxing robots.The action scenes throughout the movie are exciting. They're fun, intense and somewhat over the top, and yet they retain a good deal of gritty contest. It's a competent blend.The plot, however, won't impress. It's been done a million times and it has no effort of novelty. If you're familiar with underdog movies (Rocky), or if you watched cartoons and teenage movies as you grew up, you'll recognize each worn out scene, and each cartoonish villain showing contempt for the pair of heroes.The acting is good, but the lines and character development didn't help one bit. Although the characters are frequently relatable, they're also filled with cheap lines and riddling behavior, often too simplistic or contradictory, a few times baffling. I think what for a lot of disappointment was the few storyline gems it threw along, but they turned almost immediately abandoned or under-hatched, and it frequently feels undelivered.Watch this movie expecting to be carried away as the crowd roars around an amazing match. It's a fun CGI movie, with lots of cool fighting and cheering scenes.The companies' intention at selling toys is understandable, but it comes off somewhat disdainful, because you step into the theater expecting a movie (movies have stories), and you walk out feeling like you attended a Vegas' prizefighting night - be this good or ill.","8 out of 21 found this helpful.

Barely did I know that I would end up seeing a magnum opus, a perfect cross over movie transcending from modern day fiction to a timeless classic. There are very few movies made which can cater to the likes of each individual movie goer, but then there are the occasional ones like ""real steel"" that qualify for such prizes. Its a brilliant plot, yet not sketchy and achy as the transformers, not too much into the future to rattle your brains. Its a perfect blend of all sort of emotions while giving the cinema goer the daily dose of excitement. Good acting by the leads, Butler is very impressive, watch out for the kid..

Director Shawn Levy brought us the ""Night at the Museum Movies"" and I guess that's about the same audience he is after with this one. You probably won't get this comparison anywhere else, but ""Dreamer"" with Kurt Russell and Dakota Fanning is the film that this one most reminds me of - A spunky kid trying to prove everyone wrong in an against all odds competition. But I would not put this one at the level of Dreamer, which had better performances and a much better script.Hugh Jackman is a pompous, bombastic, self-centered hustler who tries to stay one step ahead of the collectors chasing him. He is always looking for a big score in the robot boxing game. What? You aren't familiar with this sport? Well the film is set in not too distant future, but the only thing I could tell had evolved was the technology of robots and video games. Jackman's world gets jacked up when his 11 year old son (Dakota Goyo) is thrust into his life after the mother dies. Yes, he has been an absentee father and the kid is ridiculously smart and cute.The two of them set off to make noise in the robot fight world with a dilapidated old model that they rescue from the junk yard. There are very few surprises along the way, but father and son develop a bond thanks to the success of their robot.Supporting work is provided by Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, Kevin Durand, Hope Davis and James Rebhorn. These are all competent actors who deliver fine work, but there is nothing special to the script. The one thing that makes this one a little different and will certainly appeal to 10-12 year old boys, is the fighting robots. The fights are action-packed and enjoyable to watch. They actually look like boxing matches ... only with metal creatures, who for some reason are built to mimic human movement.There have been countless other robot movies: Transformers, Bicentennial Man (Robin Williams), I Robot (Will Smith) and, of course, Lost in Space! Don't expect much more from this than those.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Glad I finally did.Setting aside a couple of quibbles (a contrived setup, circa 2011 automobiles everywhere ... except for that weird truck, and a few other annoyances) this was a fun and very decent film, er Movie.Jackman, who gets the masthead, does a decent job with his character; but Dakota Goyo, playing his estranged son, steals the show. The movie wouldn't have played nearly as well with a poor performance from ""the kid"" and Goyo - whoever he is - deserves props for a heartfelt and way cool performance.Evangeline Lilly also did a nice job in the girlfriend role and the romance stuff is peppered in just enough to not get too annoying. One wonders though, what the hell does she actually do - there's never a soul in her fathers old gym. Anyway - she fit well.I thought the CGI was wicked good; roger rabbit good. It folded in seamlessly, looked great, and there were only a couple of issues with the actors trying to play to the green screen (is it me or was Jackman way too close to Atom in sparring).Jackman was pretty, er, jacked for the film. Must have worked out like two months straight before the film. Helped the plot realism anyway.That dude James Rebhorn (Mr. Trask from Scent of a Woman) was in the film as well and he was actually decent, but he's like way too old to be the kid's step dad. Hope Davis must have married someone like way older than herself. Anyway, just a thought.Nods to Rocky, E.T., and Wall-e are not unevident, and there was an awful lot of product placement crap, but I guess you have to hedge your bets somewhat when you spend $110 large. They probably should have released this in the summer instead of October since it plays well to kids and adults alike. Atom - the robot - could have been a touch more bad-ass but I guess I'm glad he slid to the rear a touch in the grand scheme of things. The actors stood out more.Anyway, it was a good movie and I'm rating it a 7.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I enjoyed it more than Transformers 1!Yes, I agree with the critics, its the regular Hollywood fare, the kid was slightly annoying, yes, but wasn't he supposed to be like his dad, genetically annoying? And he has been tossed around and he is angry, so I think what they were showing was correct. Thats why in the end he is sweeter and more like a normal kid.The movie is a lot like rocky, the strength of the underdog. And THE best part of the whole thing is - ITS REALISTIC.The robots are super cool. When I say it like this, I know, if I were to read this, I would just think, Oh, that guy is some robot freak. I myself am surprised! They never overdo it, and they keep showing us different different robots. And I think the best part is, the robots don't talk. A big relief. ;-).........This is also a great KIDS MOVIE. Much better than the many Disney movies that had come out this year. The kid is involved throughout and has as much presence as Hugh Jackman.There is a good morale weaved in. In the beginning we see Jackman having good and powerful robots, but he never has any respect for them, because he has no respect for himself. And like all regular adults he is just money minded, and just can't see the greater beauty. The kid comes and seeing his innocence and positivity, like all normal kids, Jackman starts respecting his life more, and this is so nice to see. :-).............And it was really nice to see Kate from the Lost TV series. She was perfect as the tough strong girl, preserving her father's legacy. She is sort of the robot mechanic.Go see it. I promise at the very least, you won't feel as if you wasted your time. :-)...............Cheers!","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Sure, why not...Actually the story in ""Real Steel"", despite it being so predictable that it is bordering on being sappy, was entertaining enough. You know the outcome of the movie right away, but still it works out well enough. Why? Well, because this family movie is good entertainment, has some nice CGI effects, and actually does have a deeper meaning to the storyline and not just robot fighting.The story in ""Real Steel"" is about former boxer Charlie Kenton (played by Hugh Jackman) who is now doing fights with robots, but he is barely making ends meet. When he is left with his estranged son, Max Kenton (played by Dakota Goyo), Charlie has to step up and take responsibility and grow both as a person and as a father.Yep, sappy family storyline right there. But it is actually fun to watch. And the robot fights does actually make it worthwhile to watch. There is a lot of adrenaline and hard punches. And truth be told, then it was nice to see robots like this and not as in those God-awful ""Transformers"" movies.The people they have cast for the movie were doing good jobs with their given characters.""Real Steel"" is entertaining for the entire family, as it has action, family value, some morale ethics and a good wholesome feel to it. So if you have a 127 minutes to spare, then put on ""Real Steel"", lean back and put your feet up, because you will be in for some serious punching with these robots. This is a true underdog story in all its meaning.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The storyline and the screenplay keep you engrossed throughout and prepare you for the final showdown. And what a climax you have(i feel it was better than 'The Fighter')..!! In a movie's war/fight you always know who is gonna win..but the real talent lies in the way you WIN it. But it manages to WIN your hearts more importantly.

Hugh Jackman is always fun to watch and Dakota Goyo channels Rick Schroeder in his The Champ like performance. Jackman and Goyo interacted well together and their relationship anchors the film. It is only Evangeline Lilly who doesn't hold her own, but to her defense she isn't given much to do except where unflattering tee shirts and complain a lot about Charlie in the old days. I wish they had given her more to do; showed her technical expertise in helping Max with ATOM. I have to admit that I am not a boxing fan and thought that the fight scenes were not great. They should have channeled Gladiator more and Cinderella Man less.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Maybe because it really very quality and closely the thought over project, that will can please every viewer and even very experienced. In ""Real Steel"" are excellent mixed sports drama, action, touching family story, special effects and kindness of old family movies, whose sometimes was filming Steven Spielberg long time ago. I very liked this movie and I with great pleasure will be re-watching its with my little daughter.

Kevin Durand is awesome as well, you hate him, yet you find him appealing. Evangeline Lilly doesn't really play a big part in the movie, but she does it well.Dakota Goyo. Now he played his role perfectly, he was convincing, there were emotions, but... he is the star of the show. And we all know what that means. Yup, its a kid film. Directors really need to understand that a 12 year old isn't as mature as a 30 year old and doesn't act in the same way. And writing a script, where a child has the same capacity and reactions as an adult... it just isn't natural. It looks like a child, but it isn't really. This really ruined the movie for me, not just this one, any movie that wants to have a child main star (see A Dolphins Tale, The Super 8, etc). The movie itself delivers great atmosphere - you will cheer, you skin will shiver, you will be excited, so emotions will be present, especially at the end. But when you see it through, you will get this feeling you've seen this move 6 times already. It really resembles any Rocky film made so far, just that there are now robots involved.Final conclusion: not bad, but not great. There are worse and there are better titles.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

If you are looking for solid entertainment that is technically brilliant with very good boxing action - then look no further than this. You will have a very good time in the cinema seat enjoying some popcorn and a cool drink to go with it.Don't think about what you see too much, though. Because then you may find out that many characters in the movie are stereotypes you have seen before many times. There's the father who is not keen on his son at first. But this changes over time, of course. A boxer beyond the best of his days. An evil thug from the past messing around. And most of all a little wunderkind with a cool attitude and language way beyond his years. He is e.g. capable of helping to repair robots.Another problem is predictability. Even though the fight scenes are very well executed, I was able to figure out the outcome of every single one of them well before their end. Even the final fight is a straight rip-off of one of the greatest boxing movies ever made: ... Ehem, I did promise no spoilers... But you will know what I mean once you see the grand finale.So, bottom line: Rock solid entertainment with great visuals. You can be thoroughly entertained if you forgive this movie its stereotypes and predictability.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

You may have seen this type of story before, but trust me when I say that this father and son story works very well in this film. The storyline had enough heart that can lead to audiences to care about these characters and wanting to see the bond between the father and son grow. Just seeing their bond grow as they find Atom and booking matches with this robot adds strength to the storyline, making you want to see that happy ending. It was a very good storyline that focused very well on the characters, never going offtrack and focused only what was important.I really liked the idea behind the film presenting a futuristic world where robots replaced humans in the boxing world. Although the film is set in the future, I liked the fact that the director made the time period no different from how it is today. This film does not present a CGI world with Jetson planes or people using crazy technologies; the only thing that was futuristic was the robots and this allowed the whole story to feel realistic and allowing audiences to be well attached to the environment. The CGI that was used was pretty nice, especially toward the movements with the robot action.The robots were pretty cool with all of their awesome designs and the creativity behind them. When it comes to the action, I will be lying if I said that the boxing sucks. Being a fan of watching these types of sports, it was pretty exciting and fun to watch these matches; especially toward the final matches. Watching Atom fight off against the ultimate Zeus was absolutely electrifying. These matches captured the excitement that you will have if you went to watch an actual boxing match. Exciting, fun, and entertaining.The acting was pretty good. Hugh Jackman as the down luck father, Charlie, Dakota Goya as his son, Max, and Evangeline Lilly as the long time friend of Charlie. You will care about these characters since the film did a very good job of focusing on these characters, portraying the growing bond between father and son, and to show character depth that was surely unexpected. I was surprised about Dakota Goya's acting since kid actors are usually a hit and miss. Goya was never annoying, as you see in many films with kids, and acted well enough that didn't ruin anything that occurred in the film. Everyone else was pretty good as their roles. However, I found Kevin Durand's role as Ricky to be out of place near the end. He was good from the time you see him, but had no place at the end of the film.Just like other movies of this year, I was surprised of how this film turned out to be. I liked this film more than expected, really liked this heart-felt story that the film had, and I am not embarrassed to say that I became teary eyed near the end. Good acting, fun and exciting boxing matches, and a good storyline.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

After making a bet that his robot can win a match at a rodeo he is once again in the hole to someone. When he is told that his ex has died and he is now in charge of his 11 year old son he finds a way to pay people back. When his son finds a old robot that he fixes up Charlie's outlook changes. This is a movie that is hard to review. On one hand (for me at least) it was pretty sappy and felt like a remake of ""Rocky 4"". On the other hand this is a great family movie that younger boys will love. The action was very good and the boxing was fun to watch. The dialog and story were pretty cheesy but in terms of a family movie they fit. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you are looking for a manly boxing movie with lots of fighting and action then you may be disappointed. If you are looking for a family movie to watch with your son then this is what you want. Overall, a good movie for families.

This film was shocking. OK in 2000 the special effects alone would have made this a great movie but its 2011 now and the special effects in this are pretty much the norm.This film had a good IMDb rating and so i thought I'd give it a go at the cinema. What I got was vomit inducing sentimentality, characters that were either borderline parodies of themselves or entirely unbelievable and a story-line that left a lot to be desired. In addition the science required a suspension of disbelieve that was beyond me. I mean; fighting robots that operate via voice recognition, or even more laughably in ""shadow mode"" where they simply copy what they ""see"". Where's the immersive VR suites with biofeedback? That would have been a lot more believable. Fighters controlling their robots via the web from the comfort of their homes. It wouldn't have taken a lot to make this aspect of the film a lot more believable. Also it was set too near in the future. By the time we have robots as advanced as these we won't be filling up trucks with fossil fuels (something I noticed happening more than once - sponsorship from big oil?)In its defence the kid actor was pretty good insofar as he could be with the sh1t script he's been given and the idea that kids would speak Japanese in the future due to the superiority of their online games was a nice touch (though I think Chinese is just as likely).All in all a huge disappointment. I left the cinema after the final showdown about 5-10 minutes before the film ended when I just couldn't take any more of the attempted tear jerking. My friend left after an hour and preferred to sit outside playing on his phone until the film ended. An 11 year old might like this. Any adult with a normal IQ will not.Oh, and watch out for the prolonged Budweiser product placement at the beginning of the film. Considering this is a kids film I thought that was a little bit naughty!","55 out of 119 found this helpful.

We have seen it in ""Rocky,"" in ""Mighty Ducks,"" in ""Cool Runnings,"" even in ""Ice Princess,"" and so on and so forth. As it was quite evident in its trailer, ""Real Steel"" will undoubtedly follow this same tried and true formula.Despite being very predictable, and yes, cheesy, ""Real Steel"" still succeeds to entertain the audience. I believe this is mainly because of the interesting premise of robot boxing replacing conventional boxing in the near future (this movie is set in 2020). The special effects of these robot boxing matches were very exciting and exhilarating. The action in the boxing ring still remains raw, palpable and realistic, even given its mechanical fighters. This is definitely NOT like the messy Transformers.A big factor is also the goodwill and charisma of lead actor Hugh Jackman in the two aspects of his character Charlie. He had earnest performance as the father trying to establish a relationship with an estranged son. He also had a very energetic performance as an ex-boxer now the controller of a Robot Boxer. He is very likable in both aspects, as well as with his chemistry with his co-stars, Dakota Goyo (who played his headstrong son Max) and very pretty Evangeline Lilly (who plays his girlfriend Bailey).Therefore despite already knowing how this film will end, even as early as the trailer several months ago, I would say that it will still be worth one's time to go and watch the awesome action sequences on the big screen. I think these adrenalized action scenes strike a good balance with the rather hokey yet unavoidable (given the father and son theme) melodramatic scenes. There is something for everyone here.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

At least this one doesn't do the thinking for himself, although since there will be a sequel in 2014, who knows. For now, let's concentrate on the plot: the age old story of a father reuniting with his son. Sure, its been done, but when the acting is good and the story is given a new twist, it will keep you entertained, if not enthralled. Jackman brings his talents to the forefront in this role, a departure from the grizzled Wolverine and the computer hacker in Swordfish, and his performance creates the air of reality in the film. Evangeline Lilly is easy to look at and plays the part of the tomboyish woman brought up around athletes, savvy businesswoman, and neglected love interest well. Dakota Goyo fits the role well, and you feel the emotion when he speaks and looks at Jackman. ""What's with those eyes?"" While his role is small, using James Rebhorn as the husband of the sister in law who wants custody of Max was an excellent move. I have long admired the ability of this character actor to pull you into the scene. And speaking of character actors, Kevin Durand is quickly becoming one of the more versatile players, doing good guys and bad guys with equal skill. Real Steal is a treat for the family, a film that will entertain and surprise you with its ability to bring you in. Too early to tell if it's a collectible, but you never know.","13 out of 29 found this helpful.

Jackman brings his great screen presence, bubbling personality, and charismatic charm lifting what could have been an unlikeable character into someone you really do root for. The plot is very similar to both Sly Stallone's ""Over the top"" and of course ""Rocky"", but everything is done well enough for this to be on the whole quite exciting at times, meaning this has the power to bring on enough thrills and spills along with a very enjoyable ending. So it may not have an original bone in its body, but as far as well made family friendly movies go that parents will enjoy as much as the kids, then look no further.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It certainly has many good moments however, the effects are superb, Hugh Jackman delivers an inspired performance and plays his character in a very realistic manner. The film felt very bloated, it had science fiction, it had boxing, it had drama, it has a difficult father-son relationship, they probably thought they were being clever by featuring all these elements, but it simply made it hard to focus or even truly care about any of them. The relationship with Jackman's character and his son easily could have been a powerful and uplifting part of the story, which it certainly wanted to be, but Max was a very unlikeable character, he was a brat and was ungrateful for everything his dad did to win his affection, I didn't care for this character and thought this movie would have been better without him. Though it certainly has its moments, Real Steel is mostly an over the top and messy film that you would be better off avoiding. A former boxer finds his luck challenged when his estranged son teams up with him to construct a champion robot fighter.

Charlie (Hugh Jackman), a former human boxer himself, is having a bit of trouble with cash flow despite having no problem getting all of his robots destroyed in the ring. But his struggles continue out of the ring, where he is forced to take care of Max (Dakota Goyo), the son he never wanted. By chance, Max discovers a fully built robot, Atom, discarded in a junkyard. He retrieves it, and convinces Charlie to help train him to fight in the big leagues.What works for and against Real Steel is that there is not much else to the plot after this. Much like the recent travesty Warrior, the set-up and execution is in the synopsis. Knowing what we do about film history and genre tropes, I imagine you can figure out exactly what comes next piece by piece. And as much as I enjoyed watching the film, the predictability hangs over it like a plague. It really is Rocky with robots, and it makes very little attempt to try anything new. It finds a niche very early on, and just keeps hoping it will not break. So while everyone loves an underdog story, it may be a little hard to swallow the film doing everything we have seen way too many times before.What Real Steel does do differently, and what I enjoyed immensely, was how it connected and reimagined human boxing with robot boxing. The sweat and smell of the unsanctioned underground leagues, the spectacle of the pay per view spectacular in a live arena; it seemed silly watching the trailers and thinking of robots taking the place of humans in the ring. But it is so naturally executed here that you wonder why you doubted the film in the first place. Every precaution is taken to reinvent and enhance the sport, to the point where it makes a case for this idea being viable in the future. Much the same goes for the technology in the film, which seems like a natural progression to where we are heading in reality. For such a silly and ridiculous concept, it seems to have its finger on the pulse of a hotbed of real life ideas. Another great element to the film is the special effects that bring the robots to life. Using a nearly seamless mix of animatronics and CGI, we watch as these robots bridge the gap between fantasy and reality. They look, feel and act real, managing to beat the life out of one another in one scene, and then silently emote without the use of any real expressions. While an early scene involving a bull looks awful, every scene afterwards just looks better and better. I had a hard time distinguishing the puppets from the CGI, it is that well conveyed on- screen. And really, when was the last time a big budget film like this went with animatronics over full blown CGI? Thankfully, Jackman is also one of the best things about Real Steel. The trailers suggested he was playing the character very loose and over-the- top, but he is surprisingly rather reserved for the most part. He plays a washed up has-been very well, and manages to really make the audience feel for him – even when he is being a reprehensible jerk. He brings the charisma and edge to the role that he has perfected as Wolverine, and helps rise above the material he is given. He is given a lot of silly stuff to do no doubt, but he smiles and glides through it with ease. As Max, Goyo brings gentleness and naivety to the role that really sells the idea of robots boxing. Seeing the wonder in his eyes is like watching our own wonder playing out on-screen. He is a more than capable child actor, and I look forward to seeing him light up screens in the future. Evangeline Lilly, as Charlie's love interest Bailey, is good in small doses, but is not afforded the time or development to really be anything other than a plot device. Anthony Mackie is great as the bookie Finn, and even if the role is completely one note and silly, Kevin Durand does pretty good as Charlie's nemesis Ricky.What I found really took away from the film, was the focus on the broken family unit between Charlie and Max. When they are apart and interacting with others or alongside Atom, the film works increasingly well. But when the family struggles start being the focal point of scenes, it just feels pushed and rushed, as if it was an afterthought to add a bit more drama to the film. Jackman does what he can to salvage these scenes, but they just became progressively more irritating and more predictable as the film goes on. I wanted to ignore them and enjoy watching the boxing robots, but even thinking back to these scenes now, they just seem overdone and out of place. Less would have been better, and perhaps would have assisted in a lot less of Danny Elfman's surprisingly atrocious and annoyingly upbeat score.I wanted to enjoy Real Steel a lot more than I actually did. Jackman is great, and the ideas at the core of the film about robot boxing and technology are more astounding than I would like to give the film credit for. But its inherent predictability, not to mention a forced family friendly redemptive storyline, drag the film into a mediocrity it does not deserve. This should have been a really fun movie about a ridiculous idea that turned out surprisingly well. Instead, it is a film that struggles between the idea of what it is and what it wants to be, and is never able to truly balance itself out.7/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I went into this movie with the expectation of seeing maybe a 7 and ended up seeing a 10. I was absolutely amazed at how great this movie was put together. This was truly a great movie. The characters, acting, and plot were all done very well. The ways the characters interact with one another seemed very genuine and they somehow even find a way to give the main robot Atom a personality you'll love. This movie has drama, humor, a lot of action and maybe even a little suspense. There are a few words that some parents may feel are unacceptable for younger children but overall I felt comfortable letting my 7 year old see it. There was nothing too over the top language-wise in my opinion. Also, this is the first movie I've ever been to where a good amount of people in the theater applauded with excitement during 2-3 scenes and also when the movie ended. You can always tell a really good movie by the smiles on peoples' faces and by listening to people discuss their favorite parts as they exit and there was definitely a lot of that afterward. All of the robot animation and fight scenes were very realistic and not cheesy looking at all. This is a great movie for a family night out, a date, group of friends or just about anything else I can think of. It also has some great life lessons and self reflection aspects as well. I cannot honestly say for certain if I would have seen this movie in theaters had I not received free tickets but after seeing it, I know it would have been well worth paying the money to see it, especially in IMAX!! Really the only opportunity I think this movie had to be better would have been to have filmed it in IMAX 3D. That would have been awesome. I highly recommend if you are thinking about seeing this movie or are not 100% sure, GO SEE IT!!! You'll be glad you did.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

And by god, do i hate 'Transformers'. The last thing i need is another Michael Bay wanna-be action flick. Hopefully this is anything but.The summer of 2011 was missing a lot of fun with their action. Only on maybe 2 occasions did i walk away from a movie feeling like i had a great ass time. I only wish this came out during the summer time, because it would certainly have made up for the giant gap of fun.Words cannot begin to explain how much fun i had watching this film. It was one of those action movies that made you WANT to be a kid again. Some might call it predictable or cliché'. But it's acting and it's story and it's action tie in so well together that you don't even care. You cannot help but just sit back and enjoy this ride.The story does start off somewhat slow......well, that's what i gathered at least from the people around me. But for me, i saw nothing but character development. A washed up boxer who doesn't have the ability to make a right decision. I mean hell, the guy abandoned his only child, and when the kid finally comes back, he STILL doesn't want anything to do with him. You never see that in a big budget Hollywood flick......especially one with Spielberg's name attached to it.Now here's where a bit of the cliché's fall into place. They find a robot in a pile of garbage, pretty much symbolizing Hugh Jackman's character. He's beat up, and nobody wants anything to do with him. Obviously you know where the story is going to go from here........but like i said before........i didn't care ONE BIT.They did a great job of establishing a certain amount of depth within each of the central characters, sure they did it a cliché' sense. But the acting and direction combined with another amazing score by Danny Elfman really made it shine. I kid you not, i almost cried at the end.........really.......a movie about fighting robots ALMOST made me cry. So to pretty much sum it up......it's a cliché' done right.However, the majority of this movie REALLY had to rely on the fighting. I mean, if it wasn't intense, then all that character depth is just wasted. But rest assured, you easily get your money's worth with the fights. A lot of the elements they used are somewhat stolen from the 'Rocky' series. But then again, so is Mike Tyson's Punch-Out, and i don't see anyone complaining about that game. If you're a big 'Rocky' fan, you'll easily see some of the similarities. But watching robots act them out......it's hard NOT to like. It's intense, it's fun, and it's easily AND obviously the best part of the movie. And trust me, you get TONS of it too.Bottom Line........Like i said before, it's one of those action movies that makes you feel like a kid again. You see, this is what 'Transformers' should've been. Well put together, action packed, heart felt, and just plain fun. This is easily one of THE best movies i've seen all year. It's not artistic with it's action like 'Drive'. It's doesn't have the intelligent depth like 'Planet of the Apes'. It's just plain fun. I only wish it came out during the summer time, because it would've fit in perfectly.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

We soon discover that this is future- set story where robot boxing is a popular sport and centered on a struggling promoter (Jackman) who thinks he's found a champion in a discarded robot. During his hopeful rise to the top, he also discovers he has an 11-year-old son Max (Dakota Goyo), in the midst of a custody battle with Charlie's deceased wife's sister and husband (Hope Lange and James Rebhorn). Charlie, ever on the outlook to pay off his debts and find financing for buying new robots to train for boxing matches, makes a deal with the couple, and agrees to care for Max for a summer while the couple visit Europe. Max wants to know his father but on his terms. The two males are aided by the owner of Charlie's training gym - Bailey (Evangeline Lilly) - and it is her intervention that helps the two males join forces and become involved with a discarded robot, Atom, they make a champion by working together.The tenderness of the film takes a while to settle in, but in the end it is not easy to deny that the story of a reluctant father and a self sufficient son finding that arm platform of relationship, able to endure disappointments as well as triumphs. Jackman and Goyo are a terrific team and the other cast members, especially Lilly and Anthony Mackie, are solid. Shawn Levy's direction deserves credit for pulling the whole thing together. This is not just another silly CGI flick: there is a core a beauty to the film that makes it not only entertaining but heartwarming, too.

Actually it's more like another Sylvester Stallone classic though, 'OVER THE TOP', due to the fact that it's about a father spending the summer with his eleven year old son, he just met for the first time, while trying to make money in underground fighting, robot fighting that is (rather than arm wrestling). Hugh Jackman stars as the father and Dakota Goya (who played young 'Thor' in 'THOR') co-stars as his son. The lovely Evangeline Lilly (looking as adorable as ever) also co-stars as Jackman's ex. The film was written by John Gatins, Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven and directed by Shawn Levy (who's directed a slew of family films including two 'NIGHT OF THE MUSEUM's, 'DATE NIGHT' and the 'CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN' and 'PINK PANTHER' remakes). The movie is pretty cheesy kids fair but it is well made cheese and enjoyable if you like fight movies and robots.The film is based on the 1956 short story 'Steel' by Richard Matheson and tells the tale of a world (set in 2020) where robots have replaced humans in boxing. Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, an ex-boxer who now enters has-been robots in illegal underground fights to make money. His robots are constantly getting ripped apart though as he falls deeper and deeper into debt. While eluding some thugs he owes money to he finds out his ex-girlfriend has passed away and left their son, Max, to him. After finding out that the boy's rich aunt and uncle (Hope Davis and James Rebhorn) desperately want custody of him Charlie sees an opportunity to make some big cash. He makes a deal with Max's Uncle that he'll take the boy while he and his wife are vacationing for their second honeymoon and then hand him over to them with full custody in exchange for $100,000. Max is not happy to hear his father 'sold' him but once he gets caught up in his dad's obsession with robot boxing the two begin to bond. Especially when Max finds an old abandoned sparring robot named Atom that the two turn into a cherished underdog champ.The movie is pretty bad at times. It's the type of film that will probably be remembered as a corny moneymaker years from now that was never actually very good (like a lot of 80's films). I think being too critical of films like this is a bad thing though; it dampens the creative spirit and youthful imagination. Sure this film is full of clichés and recycled scenes from dozens of other films and can be predicted every step of the way (but not quite; the end has a few surprises) but it's still entertaining. I did also have a problem believing that robot boxing could ever be as popular as the real thing, there's a lot more at stake with real people involving real emotions and real blood shed, but it is just a movie. Of course it fails in comparisons to the great fighting movies like 'ROCKY', 'WARRIOR', 'FIGHTING', 'LIONHEART' and 'ROCKY II, III, IV and VI' (it also pales in comparison to 'OVER THE TOP', of course, as well) but it is a decent genre buddy to movies like 'TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN'. Definitely not a classic or even a very good film by any manner but it is fun and well made for what it is. Movies like this empower the kid in all of us.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISB6jfqAMe0","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But, what makes it cohesive and entertaining is that it does it's main attraction of robot boxing superbly where it's brimming with ideas that elevates all it's themes beyond the hum-drum.Although often compared to Transformers, the robots give off a different feel of movement; it's the feel of hydraulics with heavy machine parts that makes robot punches have impact. This makes the robot fighting engaging and full of tension and not a blur of colors and movement with robots doing incredulous things. The movie takes the old boxing ring structure and expertly enact robots as boxers and make everything look fresh and exciting. Max in the movie says, ""people want to see something they've never seen before"", and if this is true then this movie has that in spades. The shadow feature, that's shown in the trailers, where the robots match the human movements is one great show by itself in the movie.It is one of those movies where the audience will be cheering in the theaters as if they were by the ringside. I highly recommend the movie not just to sci-fi fans but to boxing/sports fans, parents looking for a family drama for their early-teens and people who like dramas. But, most of all I recommend this to people who want to see something they've never seen before.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Sadly, I have long since realised that I like 'low-brow' films and the concept of big robots smacking seven shades of sparkplugs out of each other while under the watchful eye of Wolverine, did kind of appeal to me (especially in the light of the disaster that was the Transformers money-spinning bandwagon).Therefore I waited in trepidation for this film to be realised. Then, when it finally came out, critics started using words like 'heart' and 'father/son bonding' when talking about it. That was the point when my expectations severely lowered. I didn't want to watch some sort of coming-of-age drama. I wanted to see droids' pro-wrestling or whatever it should have been.And so I ended up not really caring when or where I finally got round to seeing Real Steel.Amazingly, it contains both. There was plenty of bot on bot smackdown and a healthy dose of human-interest as Wolverine (oh, all right, Hugh Jackman) learns to love and look after his son of eleven years who he's only properly met (due to the boy's mother dying unexpectedly).Okay, so my only gripe is that Real Steel is a little long. Personally, I would have trimmed down the human side and focused on droids stomping on each other from a great height. But, at no time did I want to fast forward the human stars.Stephen Spielberg is among the behind-the-scenes people. I just wonder why he never bothered to make Transformers like this? Don't expect wall-to-wall action. Don't expect wall-to-wall sentiment. It actually splits the two quite well. Hopefully they'll make a sequel where Wolverine gives his droid some claws. Now that'll be worth the price of a cinema ticket any day!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And with ever-increasing technological advances, robot death-matches may be a coming attraction destined for a venue near you. Though probably not in the not-to-distant future depicted in this Hugh Jackman science-fiction movie.It's 2020 and Charlie Kenton (Jackman) is a boxer whose days in the ring are long-behind him thanks to the emergence of robot boxing. He now controls other fighters (robots) from the sidelines. Unfortunately, he's had a long run of bad luck and is in serious debt. He's then hit with the news that the son he never sees was recently orphaned when his mother, and Charlie's former girlfriend, died. At the custody hearing he sees Max (played by Dakota Goyo), Max's wealthy Aunt Debra (played by Hope Davis) and her husband Marvin (played by James Rebhorn). Marvin (Rebhorn) tells Charlie that while they want custody and know that he doesn't, they have plans for the summer and they are willing to pay a six-figure sum if Charlie will care for Max until they return. And at that time he'll relinquish all claims to Max. Soon Max and Charlie find a robot to replace the one lost in Charlie's most recent bout and embark on the process of training it and repaying Charlie's debts.I wasn't expecting much from this film given the premise and the fact that some of Jackman's previous films (the X-MEN series and Wolverine follow-up) left me disappointed. I was surprised and very pleased to see this film outshine those in execution and conclusion. Jackman's role isn't all that different from ones past but the tone and supporting characters make for an extremely enjoyable two hours and seven minutes.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Kind of sad that they didn't just take the quote directly.Overall, this is the story of a down-on-his-luck robot boxer, he controls the robot via remote control, who gets his son dumped in his lap. A son who he never talked to, and he doesn't even know how old he is. Hugh Jackman's character reluctantly drags the kid around as he tries to get his career back on track. In the end the kid teaches his father to believe in himself.Yes, it is a pretty sappy movie in a lot of ways. It's loaded with clichés and terribly trite one liners.

It's not compelling or even that interesting. The 'bot fights are obviously CGI but the story line sucks the big one. Move along, don't waste your money... You're supposed to fall for the kid who's father is a screw-up but it's hard to feel sorry for a manipulative kid who's no better than his own father. Some have suggested that this is ""Rocky"" on steroids but the script is anemic at best. The closest you'll get to an emotional connection is to the girlfriend running the gym. At least she knows where she stands! For the rest of the cast, it's like lost sheep. Baah! Seriously, this movie, despite the hype, is one you should take a pass on. There are a lot of much better actions movies out there. If you're into a retro vibe then pick up some James Bond on Blueray, sure to appeal to both men and women. Any of the Jason Bourne (Idnetity, Supremacy, Ultimatum) videos are far better than this piece of tripe. Then again, your mileage may vary.","27 out of 57 found this helpful.

I couldn't have been more wrong.It says the story of a man who changes, learning to be a father, learning what responsibility means, learning to love, learning. It is the story of a little boy whose determination, huge heart and good nature wins and changes people around him.

Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a former human boxer next to championship that loses his big occasion and uses his robot for clandestine fights, but when it gets broken during a fight against a bull in a rodeo, Charlie leaves without paying his debt. When he arrives in his workplace he receives news that his former girlfriend has died and Max (the kid he had from the deceased girlfriend) has to stay with him when the aunt and her wealthy husband leave for an holiday. With the money given by Marvin Barnes (James Rebhorn) Charlie buys an expensive Japanese robot named Noisy Boy and, assuming it's undestructible, he arranges for a fight with a robot named Midas that unfortunately destroys and defeats him. Charlie and Max then go in a dump in the hope of finding some discarded robot and, when Max accidentally falls from a ledge, he ends hung on a robot's arm and they free it (naming it Atom) but unfortunately it's a robot only for training. Believe it or not, they take it for a low-level fight in a zoo and Atom manages to defeat his opponent. Atom wins another match but out of the arena Charlie is assaulted by the rodeo's organizers. Max's aunt comes to take the kid and Charlie accepts, but soon he redeems because he knows that they have a common objective. They make Atom fight with Zeus which is much more powerful but somehow (I won't spoil anything) they make Atom win and beat the components out of Zeus.Despite I liked the TRANSFORMERS franchise I didn't have lots of expectations for REAL STEEL and thought it was a bad copy of those. Well, I was wrong. First, it had a nice direction by Shawn Levy (who is famous for having directed the NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM trilogy). Second, a great and endearing performance by Hugh Jackman as a loser that doesn't give up more for the love of his son than for anything else, and does his best for making his robots work. Third, the inspiring nature of this movie because it kinda gives the lesson of never giving up on your dreams, and it has also a great feel good nature about it. Fourth, the robots' fights were so well crafted that looked like it's natural for them.Overall, one of those movies that despite a simple concept manages to exceed your exceptations in a great way and, greatly entertaining for all ages (safe for children too).","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Silliest of premises with a run-of-the-mill story filled with so many corny moments might actually make you think that it is one of those movies that are so bad they become good to watch. It is actually a well made movie that is good to watch.Set in the near future where it is a rage to see robots box with each other in a gladiatorial setup, Charlie (Jackman) is a small time traveling robot boxing participator who loses everything he has due to over-confidence and stupidity. When his estranged son was given to his custody after the mother dies and joins him in his exploits, they find a bond and a winning combination.Acting is as silly as its premise with Jackman confusing us for who is the robot and Evangeline Lily as his girlfriend who shows exactly the same 3 emotions as she does in the entire Lost series. Relief comes in the form of his son played by Dakota Goyo who is charming, passionate and innocent at the same time. The robots and their fights are choreographed excellently as they look natural (mechanical) instead of the CGI stuffed transformers. They even have a robot vs. bull fight which I guess was the best part of the movie.Rambo vs. Transformers vs. (any father son bonding movie)","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie sees robot boxing as the new top sport and a father, son and broken down robot go for the title. Now Hugh Jackman is one of the best actors in Hollywood today and he absolutely owns this role. He starts off as an arrogant character but due to the great writing and the great performance you end up liking his character and rooting for him. Now I wasn't sure about the kid when the film started but he really grew on me as the film progressed and his relationship with Jackman was what really drove the film forward. Evangeline lilly plays jackmans love interest and she is a really great addition to this film and delivers a pretty memorable character.

Moreover, the movie almost constantly bombards its unsuspecting viewers with the widest variety of an obtrusive product placement, from HP computers to Cadillac cars, from Dr. Pepper sodas to ESPN channel. Because of that, ""Real Steel"" has even managed to earn a rarely awarded negative distinction from Netflix – ""red flag"" for consumerism.On the other hand, despite the futuristic entourage and the sci-fi elements, the movie is about normal people and their normal relationships. Nowadays, most of the filmmakers for some reason prefer to focus on anything but normal, preferably on something dark, twisted, sinister, or quirky, or something unbelievably silly and shallow, something that most of the people would never experience in their lives. The movie makers all over the world happily explore the intricate and charming relationships between drug dealers and drug addicts, prostitutes and criminals of all kinds, and prisoners of all sorts. They cheerfully portray mysterious sadistic serial killers and dangerous insane maniacs.For movies with big budgets, they ecstatically create whole universes where poor humanity miserably suffers under the tyranny of all kinds of powerful and scary supernatural beings: mighty mutants and alien monsters, aristocratic bloodthirsty vampires and beast-like wild werewolves, wizards, witches, living corpses, and mysterious ghosts of all kinds. For movies with a smaller budget, anything goes, as long as it is strange or out of the ordinary: from freaks and weirdos, to unstable neurotics, to special agents and shady gangsters, to eccentric millionaires and crazy scientists. That is why it is so rare and refreshing to go to a theatre and see a movie where the characters act as normal people under normal circumstances of life. It is so rare and refreshing to see a movie about regular folks rebuilding father-son relationship, regaining personal integrity, taking responsibility, overcoming cowardice and greed, making tough choices, being faithful no matter what. It is so rare and refreshing to find a feel-good, inspiring movie that upholds simple and basic values that lie in the foundation of healthy and strong families all over the world.If you throw the outstanding visual effects and the exciting robot fights into the mix, it becomes even easier to explain why, with all its flaws, ""Real Steel"" is still a good movie to watch.Again, here is the dilemma, men.Is ""Real Steel"" just a convenient escape from your demanding or boring life into the adrenalin-filled colorful fantasy world of the robot fights? It can offer you that, no problem... It can offer so much more though, if you are ready to accept it.Are you ready to confront your demons and ask yourself tough questions, that same tough questions the main character asks himself in the movie: Am I a good husband? Am I a good father? Am I taking a responsibility for my life choices and for my family? Do I act as I value my ""big boy"" toys and my convenient habits more than the well-being of my loved ones?""Real Steel"" offers you a real deal, but it is up to you whether to accept the offer.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

A real plot, continuity and interesting twists (though on expected lines). The underdog formula always works if the director builds it up till the end - Shawn Levy did it pretty well.The high point for me in this movie was the screenplay. This movie could have so easily ended up being another sci-fi flick, but the screenplay actually gave it so much more depth - made it more human. Each character was well researched and portrayed - jackman's portrayal of boxer past his prime had to be burly but not muscular (knowing how jackman can really tone up his body), the portrayal of Tak Mashido's character was flawless - geometrical face-cut and doesn't speak much (had to be an egoistic geek). Mark of an effective screenplay is how it builds up to the finale. Real Steel had this quality. And finally, not to miss, the graphics were believable too. Robots looked & moved in a believable fashion. Overall, 7 out of 10 for me. Entertainment guaranteed !","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I think that It borrow ideas from Japanese subculture in that respect, but it can be said that it is a nice story that took a sweet spot and mixing the ideas well to be a very good entertainment. Especially the battle scene is very interesting. I can hardly complain.
But I want to complain. Why is this also a family drama? Family drama is not only tired of watching TV dramas, but the is also reflected in sports broadcasts, and we often see family dramas on TV CF. Why do I have to see a family drama again in the cinema? And this one has such a wonderful subject! Wasteful. I wanted another human drama that was not a family drama. Family drama may be a safe line for business, but it's too cheap. Why does that guy work so hard? For the family. Easy to make a story.

Speaking of the robots, they are incredibly well-done and one of the better parts of the movie. I can see why it was nominated for an Oscar for visual effects--they are highly realistic and seems to have their own personalities.The acting, too, was actually pretty good--definitely better than in most action movies like this. Hugh Jackman was quite good in his role, and you could definitely see the determination in his face. Evangeline Lilly was good too, although she could've used a little more screen time. However, the standout performance for me was by Dakota Goyo, who was a surprisingly good actor (and a pretty decent dancer, too...). He acted just as a kid should act--he wasn't overly mature, he was at times overemotional, and he pretty much just wanted to have fun. Some of the interactions and dialogue between him and his father was very well-written and realistic, although each character throughout the movie definitely has their share of cheesy lines.The movie overall, though, is pretty entertaining--it's impossible not to get attached to the characters, and thus entertained. The fight scenes are very exciting, although the ending was an interesting choice. I didn't necessarily see it coming, and at first didn't understand why someone would choose that ending, but then it dawned on me: it doesn't matter what the ending is like, it just matters how you got there, and I think that's what the characters realized too.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

In this, Hugh Jackman plays, Charlie, a dead beat dad, whom fights robots. The mother of his son, Max, dies and Charlie is left with custody. He doesn't really care, but Maxes Aunt wants to raise him. The Aunt's hubby offers Charlie some money if he will watch Max over the summer until they get back from Europe. So of course, Max loves the robots and is into the boxing. Max finds an old robot, fixes him up, and the robot becomes the people's champ.Of course Charlie changes over the course of the film.FINAL VERDICT: Good special effects, the robots were neat.

Who knows when fate (disguised as the timetable of the Paradise Cinema here) decided I have to watch it, I just go with it! How does my zero-expectation journey turn out? It is definitely not a spin-off of Michael Bay's idiotic metal collisions, REAL STEEL has provided its audience some bona fide fun and a roller- coaster emotional voyage. Literally the film centers on the recuperation of the long--distant father-son relationship, the re-ignition of a former boxer's combative zeal for life, sounds corny? yes! But the maneuver is smart (a premature cute young boy versus his robustly rookie father, which the conflicts and warmth within are always gratifyingly welcome among family audiences). I feel much solace that the robot gambit did not steer the film to an A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE mode of humanizing the steel machine as director Shawn Levy (whose previous work includes DATE NIGHT 2010 and NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 1&2) is neither Spielberg nor Kubrick, the sole exception is the scene before the final battle, when Robot Atom is looking at the mirror inside the waiting room, as if Atom has the edification of transforming into a real flesh, which is the most heartrending moment for me and it hits my soft spot.The CGI robots' verisimilitude is astonishingly precise to detail, which is absolutely adrenaline- driven but at the same time doesn't hurt the plot too much. A great revelation here is the birth of another teen-star, Dakota Goyo, who is unequivocally stealing everyone else's glamor and delivers his debut unbelievably compelling in a major Hollywood film.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Then the trailer came out, and the story was revealed to be touching family film about a dad and his estranged son with robots thrown in. A sweet family film? Ugh. I immediately took it off my viewing schedule. Then the reviews came out, and even Entertainment Weekly gave it an excellent review, saying that it is actually way better than you would expect. Pair that with big box office, and my curiosity started to come around again. Finally, it got an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects, and thus, I no longer had a choice.And I am here to tell you that you should not believe everything you've heard...my initial reaction was wrong, my second one was right: ""Real Steel"" is a big load of absolute junk.Set in 2020 or something, when boxing has been replaced by robots, Jackman plays Charlie, an ass ex-boxer who impregnated a girl and whose son comes back to haunt him fourteen years later when she passes away. ""Forced ""to spend a summer with this kid, they realize they bond over boxing robots. Robots, mind you, that seem to FEEL something when they are hit (like, c'mon...).With an absolutely juvenile script that is just as much pieced together from every cliché family movie just as some of these robots are pieced together with junk, ""Real Steel"" is nothing more than a high-tech Lifetime movie with one of the most preposterous scripts of the year. Every line is meant to tug at your heartstrings and make you feel fuzzy inside when it's not trying to impress you with its mediocre visual effects. It's tries to be nothing but ""cute"" from start to finish, so saccharine that it quickly ends up nauseating.Right down to the kid using ""shadow technology"" to make his robot do some silly hip hop dance moves. Like, really? What person over the age of twelve enjoyed this film? ""Real Steel"" is nothing more than a scrap yard of emotional manipulation that really has no redeeming qualities for any adult. But yeah, your kids will probably like it.","63 out of 150 found this helpful.

Despite reaching for nearly every cliché in the family- oriented sports underdog drama handbook short of titling the film ""Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots,"" DreamWorks delivers a undeniable crowd-pleaser with ""Real Steel.""Just as Hugh Jackman's Charlie tells his estranged son Max (Dakota Goyo) as they train a rusted-up sparring robot to be a champion boxer, it's all about putting on a show for the people and that's exactly what ""Real Steel"" does. For better or worse, robot boxing is cool, cool enough that should it ever cross into the non-fictional world, people will pay to see it, just as they will to see this movie.In championing old-school sports movie values with a contemporary video-game-like twist, ""Real Steel"" is a 9-to-12-year-old boy's fantasy and one that dads won't mind taking their kids to see. Other than a script that tosses around the word ""ass"" like it's the new way of saying ""cool"" (or as if the MPAA finally gave PG-13 movies permission to use it), there's a good heart and moral to the story.In the not-too-distant future, former boxer Charlie Kenton trains ton-sized robots to fight in the ring for a living, only he's constantly running up a sizable tab as his bets don't usually pay off or up. When he learns his ex has died and custody of their 11-year-old son has defaulted to him, Charlie strikes a deal with the boy's rich uncle to sign custody over to his family for enough money to buy a new bot, but it also entails Max staying with his ""dad"" for the summer. As it turns out, Max is a bit of a robot boxing fan with twice the stubborn charisma of his father. Together they uncover an old bot in a junkyard named Atom who helps them put aside their ill will and get back in the gameYes, ""Real Steel"" is 100 percent cookie cutter — an old blind hound could sniff out what's coming next — but when sports montage comes to uplifting Danny Elfman score, a cookie cutter still makes cookies. In this case we're talking giant-sized robot cookies, and it's that shape that makes all the difference.The likable qualities of ""Real Steel"" all come down to presentation, from the unique premise of robot boxing (ok, unique enough) to the charm of the lead actors to director Shawn Levy's sound and instinctive storytelling style. Jackman and former ""Lost"" star Evangeline Lilly try to create a chemistry from a subplot that's barely accounted for (her dad trained him, they've always been sort of on-again-off-again), but they make it work, mostly because they're beautiful people with a decent measure of likability and talent.Levy makes the whole mold come together with an eye for what casual moviegoers like most and the presence of mind to know just when to say stop so that the script's pouring of sap doesn't make the whole thing soggy.The robots though, they steal the show. (I initially typed ""steel,"" which I thought was worth mentioning.) If I had at least 15 fewer years I'd already be out buying my Atom and Zeus action figures — maybe Noisy Boy too. The bots are well-conceived and expertly branded with unique names and appearances.Speaking of branding, product placement runs rampant in this film. Max downs three Dr. Peppers before teaching Atom some dance moves, the robots are controlled by HP hologram computers and ads in the boxing arena rep XBox 720. If that kind of excess turns you off in a film, well, it's not like you could call it surprising.The heart comes from the father-son relationship, which evolves over time after starting out maddeningly immature. Charlie treats Max as a mere pawn at first and Max oversteps his boundaries as an 11-year-old. The script puts them on equal footing: Son seems to know just as much as father and youthful optimism seems a force as powerful as logic. Of course the optimism wins; we're at the movies after all. Hope could definitely last five rounds in the ring against even the fiercest robot.""Real Steel"" can be counted among the rare films that offer an argument for the perpetuation of the Hollywood machine, but if all formulaic movies could handle the characters this well it wouldn't matter. Truth is, it's as easy to despise the movie in principle as it is to just enjoy it at face value — provided you dig giant fighting robots.~Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

If you have a pennyworth of sentimentality, you will cheer at some places and might even fight back a tear here and there.In this age of ""A. I."", this movie leaves you pondering the extent to which a machine could actually become conscious, or be aware of the affection a young human has for him. But although the film wisely does not attempt to delve into this area, you leave the theater feeling that you know the answer.An excellent family movie, even if you watch it alone.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But these aren't robots like your Roomba or ""Bot Wars"" little bots. These are 1- ton, 8-foot tall behemoths. In this future, boxing has been outlawed and now only robots can fight in the big ring. Charlie is down on his luck and scrapes together spare robot parts and works his robots in small-town carnivals and flea markets.Charlie has an 11-year-old son, Max (Dakota Goyo) whom he has never seen. Max's mother has died and his aunt wants custody. This is fine with Charlie who makes a deal with the rich uncle : Charlie will take the boy for the summer so aunt and uncle can vacation in Italy in peace. In return, Charlie receives a large chunk of change that he can use to pay off his seedy loan sharks.Charlie and Max take up residence with Bailey Tallot (Evangelene Lilly) who is the daughter of Charlie's old trainer. She runs a training ring for new bots. On a trip to the robot junk yard, Max finds an old sparring bot (Atom) that still has some life in it. It turns out the robot can ""shadow box"" and can learn Charlie's ex-fighting skills. Max wants to enter Atom into the fights and convinces Charlie to take him on the circuit and win some fights. And we're off""Real Steel"" is a very formulaic, predictable, and immensely fun sports story. And like any good sports story, it's not just about the sport, but about the relationships surrounding it. In a season with films like ""The Fighter,"" and ""Warrior,"" ""Real Steal"" (with its PG-13 rating) is clearly aimed at younger audiences. Still as an adult, I still found the movie very entertaining with its fine performances and fast pace.Hugh Jackman plays the role of Charlie as an every-man, down on his luck and trying hard to make good. But he is impetuous. Max is played by Dakota Goyo and is intelligent and adorable. He walks the line between smart-alecky brat and wise-beyond-his-years. And he comes out very warm and endearing. Evangeline Lilly is little more than the dispenser of exposition and eye-candy. Which she does quite well.If you've seen any of the movies I've mentioned or ""Rocky"" you'll recognize the formula. But it is played out with exceptional special effects and warm characters. You'll be rooting for the underdog and booing the bad guys and smiling all the way through the final scene. For good acting, great special effects, a story we all have seen before and can't seem to get enough of, I recommend you ""See it in theaters.""","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

'Real Steel' is essentially a combination of both these sports, but it has robots doing the boxing! Now, that's an entirely different matter! Add Hugh Jackman and I'm interested...In the not too distant future robot fighting - or boxing - will probably be a reality. Hugh Jackman stars as Charlie Kenton - a loser, to put it mildly, who lives for robots. His life takes a turn for the worst - for him - when his girlfriend from whom he is separated dies, and he has to take custody of their 11-year old son, Max. Dakota Goyo, by the way, is excellent as Max.Charlie is an arrogant and over-confident guy who doesn't have time for kids, and he doesn't make a secret of it either. The only person who can tame him, is his good friend Bailey (Evangeline Lilly). I enjoyed the chemistry between them!Despite the film revolving around robots, this is a movie about human emotions. It is touching and endearing and hits the right spot on every level. I loved the way Max stole Charlie's heart, and the way it affected their lives. This is so much more than just a robot movie, or sports movie for that matter.The vibrant soundtrack makes for a lively film. 'Real Steel' is an excellent production. It has a beautiful ending for an all-round satisfying film. I love it!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Full of clichés and visually amazing, ""Real Steel"" manages the feat of, in the midst of brutal fights, showing innocence by Max's vision","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9065670/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","19 May 2023","Directed by Shawn Levy, the feature introduces us to Charlie (Hugh Jackman), a former boxer in a world where no one cares about fights between humans anymore. His career controlling fighting robots, the country's favorite sport, is going from bad to worse. After the death of his ex-girlfriend, he is forced to spend a few months with his son, Max (Dakota Goyo). Accidentally, the two discover an old robot, Atom, in a scrapyard. The discredited machinery could be Charlie's key to the top and, in the process, help him connect with the boy.Initially, John Gatins' script establishes the world of 2020 well, where the story takes place, something strengthened by the art direction. Small technological details, all based on our current technology, and behind-the-scenes discussions of the sport (whether in the underground or in the main championship) help to give some credibility to what we see on screen. The question is precisely in the main plot. To be fair, the film had to give credit to Sylvester Stallone, given how big the influence of the ""Rocky"" series is during the projection. Most apparent are the training sequence, the way the fights (especially the final one) play out, and of course the villains.The antagonists are the couple Tak Mashido and Farra Lemkova, played by Karl Yune and Olga Fonda respectively. The impression given to the public is that Gatins simply took the script for ""Rocky IV"" and copied and pasted the lines of Ivan Drago and his wife. The one-dimensionality of the characters makes it impossible not to notice these similarities, something that underscores the dislike we feel for them, in a bizarre case of transference. Even the robot controlled by Mashido, Zeus, has a look that refers directly to Megatron from the original ""Transformers"" design, completing the ""twenty-something"" atmosphere that takes over the projection. Let's look at Atom's look. Simple and slender, its design is very functional. However, what ends up drawing more attention is a ""smile"" on the robot's face. This is one of the signs of one of the most preposterous plots I've ever seen, in which an attempt is made to sell the idea that Atom has consciousness. Such an idea comes out of nowhere and is developed in a subtle way like a sledgehammer, through a scene where Atom stands in front of a mirror, and goes absolutely nowhere.The picture of the world in 2020 doesn't look much different than it does today, with the exception of screens, whether cell phones or monitors with a thin, translucent display. No flying cars, bizarre houses or fancy machines. Except that in this world, there are robots that replace humans in sports fights, like boxing. The film touches very little on the ""where, how and why"" society exchanged real fighters for robots. He mentions that the sport became very violent, and that the robots did not cause sequelae in the competitors and that they excited people much more. It implies that at a certain point, all fighters retired and robot disputes gained official status in society, while they were also successful in the underworld, with illegal robot fight clubs, where there are no rules for combat and robots are dismantled. Until they become scrap.The interesting thing is that these details of the film's universe are placed on screen in a very natural way. There is no reason to feel strange about the fact that robots are only used for fighting, and that with all this robotic technology the film does not explore other aspects of this idea. I don't think it would fit, since robots don't have artificial intelligence, they are actually controlled by humans, like those remote-control cars that many had in childhood. They are machines. They don't have that reflection of conscience of films like ""I, Robot"" just to cite one example. And that's a positive point for the film, as films with robots almost always become films about artificial intelligence. Not here. By the way, it makes much more sense for technology to evolve to a point where we can control robots with remote controls similar to the joysticks we have in video games than to create a conscious robot that moves by itself right away.However, the film is not really about fighting robots, but about the relationship between a father and a son that he never had contact with. The robots are there as a visual effect, keeping the audience interested in continuing to watch. Especially because the theme ""father who never had contact with his son"" is one of the old Hollywood clichés. The duo's relationship is developed quite naturally by the script, explaining Max's resentment for his father, who is not very interested in his presence. Having lost his mother recently, he finds himself torn between his aunt's family or the arms of Charlie Kenton. Shawn Levy, well involved with good effect, establishes a parental degree of discovery, demanding complicity, which emphasizes interests: the father sees in the boy the possibility of making money, perceives the boy's talent in controlling the machines, but does not abandon his pessimism about what Max, a stranger to him, has to offer. In this way he seeks facilitations throughout the narrative. Max experiences the novelty, being the target of attention and living with someone who, in addition to being a father, has become an idol, despite the repressed torture.Also functioning as a motivational exercise - the uttered ""you can"" should excite - the film will stir up emotion in the audience, not only for the innocent proposal, but for the energy of its narration. Very moving, the work uses the best of motion capture to give the robots veracity. Sound mixing is another significant attribute. In the combat scenes, we hear the bodywork crumple along with the movements of the hardware turning over. In this current dispute in the best Rocky Balboa style, the rescue of a dream comes true with Charlie Kenton getting back to doing what he always liked: fighting. The glorification takes place in this return to the rings and in the possibility of creating a powerful fighter and a winner for life.""Real Steel"" brings many of these reflections without having to invent, just reproducing. For this, it has a script (by John Gatins), as said, full of clichés. Gatins (""Power Rangers"") starts from the principle that, to reach the unknown, it is necessary to use what is already known. Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum trilogy), who has always demonstrated competence in managing banalities, directs in an energetic manner. Each scene seems to overflow, be it dramatic exaggeration or strength... Levy's incursion is clear: he wants to convey a message that is between the lines and, to achieve it, he needs excess. And the praise is due to the special effects. The robots are unbelievably real in the movie, ""Transformers"" quality, without Michael Bay's rollercoaster camera to loop and spin every five seconds. You can actually see the robots moving and fighting. Robots really look like robots, with all their imperfections in the way they react to certain things and even when they get hit a lot and the bodywork is all destroyed.In this scheme, the direction of photography by Mauro Fiore (""Avatar"") and the production design by Tom Meyer (""Orphan"") lavish creativity and grant fundamental details to the subjective understanding of the story. From the play of light and shadow that alternately hides the face of an embarrassed Charlie (Hugh Jackman) and illuminates little Max (Dakota Goyo); from the rusty and faded robot Ambush, passing through the samurai warrior Noisy Boy until unleashing on the masterpiece that is Atom (the robot that moves the plot) and its resemblance (which goes beyond aesthetics) with the Tin Man from the classic ""The Wizard of Oz"", everything seems to be built on effusive but solid foundations. If Danny Elfman (""Batman"") can demonstrate a certain delivery to an autopilot, even so his composition has a very well balanced and organic mix that ends up triggering a kind of heavy-rap-metal. Unfortunately, on the other hand, his emotional interference seems to want to squeeze the audience at dramatic points in order to extract the tears that had the potential to be more natural.In addition to so much, ""Real Steel"" manages the feat of, in the midst of brutal fights, showing innocence. This, of course, thanks especially to Levy's choice for diluting the story by Max's vision. The boy, who shows fundamental feelings for the dissolution of the script (mainly admiration and curiosity), has as much charisma as his scene partner. Jackman doesn't make much of an effort to be a brute he loves, a Wolverine without Adamantium, and in that way, for his trajectory to matter to the audience. At the end of the day, no one who is interested in the poster for this film will pay the ticket to see good acting or an innovative story. If the spirit is to offer the same as always, but with good visual effects and plenty of beatings, at least that is met. Even if it is through a proposal of reality as unreal as it is improbable.Shawn Levy film (produced by Steven Spielberg) is a futuristic recap of ""Rocky: A Fighter"" (by John G. Avildsen, 1976) interspersed with ""The Fighter (by Darren Aronofsky, 2008)"" and ""The Fighter"" (by David O. Russell, 2010)"". Probably not with the weight of these three, but it is a bold and valid enough blockbuster to continue going far beyond the box office (or subsequent profit) and the role of entertainment. A coherent film in its main insinuation, that, in the future (perhaps not too distant - but no longer in 2020), as we humanize robots, we will reach the power of gene creation.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is great family entertainment that both me and my son loved. Plot In A Paragraph: In the near future, where Robot Boxing is the worlds most popular sport. Former boxer Charlie (Hugh Hackman) struggles to make a living with patched-up robots in dodgy venues. When he unexpectedly has to look after his 11-year-old son Max (Dakato Goyo) for the summer, they go on a road trip, things look up for him as they bond over a robot Max found in the junk yard. Hugh Jackman is a handsome man in great shape, has charisma in spades and also happens to be one hell of a good actor. Dakato Goyo is not as annoying as most child actors in this type of role. Evangeline Lilly is great as Bailey, Charlie's landlord/friend/occasional love interest. All the cast do well in their roles Kevin Durand is perfectly annoying (he does so well, I'm disappointed I never got to see him get his comeuppance) James Rebhorn is as reliable as always and Anthony Mackie is fun in a supporting role too. Though the movie does follow the cliché of the stubborn child, teaching his immature father a life lesson it is very entertaining. A great father and son movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It really is like a cross between Rocky and Transformers. It's your typical Disney underdog story, but the special effects were nice and the kid (also played young Thor in Thor) was pretty funny. I really enjoyed it, even though it was predicable, but no one says that just because a movie is predictable doesn't mean it can't be good. It has some cursing, but nothing you wouldn't hear on network TV.

Mixing the formulas together over the backdrop of a near-future where robot fighting has replaced human boxing as the violent sport of spectacle results in a movie that's often sappy and tugs at your heart-strings with obvious intent. Still, it's also occasionally thrilling. I'd honestly be surprised if the majority of viewers didn't have a smile on their face and a positive mood by the end of the movie, as it does manage to strike some genuine notes, especially near the end. Hugh Jackman plays such a convincingly selfish man that it actually means something when his character has his inevitable change of heart. Dakota Goyo does a decent job as Jackman's young son, though the dancing and over-the-top cuteness of the character did seem a little much at times. Evangeline Lilly has a rather small part that will nevertheless appeal to those who are following her post-Lost career. Nothing about Real Steel is outstanding (aside from what I feel is a very good performance by Jackman), but I liked it. The robot fight scenes are well-done for the most part and the acting is good, but what makes this movie worth watching is that despite how many similar movies I've seen, this kind of story still brings an emotional connection.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

But it's sort of hard to dislike Hugh Jackman. Though his character's written as an utter asshole. Dakota Goyo was breathtaking. Fantastic discovery! He'll remain an actor to watch if he hones his talent. Anyway, the script was too slow-paces. The film failed to draw me in within the first hour. Emotionless remote-controlled robots are just not very appealing. Then again, if you give a robot a personality and emotions, sending him to a fight like a dog or bull or cock is just inhuman and cruel. The film picks up visibly in the second half. The kid takes the lead, educating his father. That is quite nice to watch. But there are still some spots where the pace is lagging. Then again, the last fight was intense and refreshingly ambivalent. I found it a bit disappointing that they left the ending open concerning Max' and Charlie's fate. Be that as it may, this film would definitely have done better with only 90 minutes. Visually, it was more than okay. I watched it in crap quality but I really never stopped to think about how the robots were all just computer-generated. They looked real enough. Good job by the CGI-department here! The soundtrack was well-chosen, too. Normally I'm not one for rap music but it fitted. And Danny Elfman wrote a moving score for the parts in between. So, maybe not the most thrilling film I've ever seen (I was immensely bored a lot of the time because the story just didn't move on) it's an okay way to spend the evening. It did have it's moments.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A film that is, at it's core, supremely generic but has some great visual flourishes to capture your attention for brief intervals. Real Steel is a father/son movie with a boxing facade put over it and while it's actually enjoyable enough in it's own right it's pretty forgettable when you take away the main attraction. The big selling point here is the fighting robots. I mean, boxing robots? Yes please! The fact that it actually looks surprisingly decent is a huge boost as well but it's just not enough to distract from how vanilla the rest of this thing is.Until the ending. I do think there is something about this ending that is really great. It goes beyond your typical sports film and even the normal father/son fair because it doesn't so much focus on the relationship as much as the rekindling of lost passion and I give this points from breaking that mold just a bit.Overall, pretty generic movie but with FIGHTING ROBOTS! It's decently fun, just don't expect any next level filmmaking here and you'll be in for a potentially fun ride. Like I said, great as background noise to pop in, ignore the nonsense and just focus in on the awesome robo-boxing matches.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film is set in 2020 where boxing has been replaced with robots beating hell out of each which are controlled by humans. Hugh Jackman plays Charlie, who is a former boxer now attempting to find a way to making money in this new robotic sport. Unfortunately for Charlie though he is constantly failing in his goal and his robots are being smashed up by either other robots or rodeo bulls. His other trouble is his arrogance in that he keeps gambling his make believe money on fights he believes he will win but ends up losing, meaning he owes lots of people lots of money. After hearing the news of a former partner's death he learns that he has a son who he must now care for. A son that he instantly sells to a former relative for money towards his next robot, the only catch is he has to look after the boy for the summer as his new parents are off across the World. Charlie continues on with his life despite the interference of his new son, and once again continues to lose his robots, up until his son becomes his lucky charm and finds a robot buried in a scrap yard. This robot was generally used as a training machine but the now Father and Son team begin to train the robot and slowly begin to rise through the ranks to the major leagues of the robot boxing world.As you can tell this is definitely Rocky with robots. The underdog will rise through the ranks, he will get his title shot, he will be the people's champ, and he will connect a bond between other people in his life. This could simply be what Real Steel is and from watching the trailer alone it is showing us a generic story made completely original. This really put me off in the trailer and I was never fussed about watching it but to be honest I am so glad I did.This is definitely one of those films that will be many people's guilty pleasure. It is such fun to watch and really has an emotional core to it that I didn't expect it to have. Everyone loves watching robots beating hell out of each other but what is good about this is it stops that before it has the opportunity of becoming boring and propels us to the other story which is the building bond between Father and son. These are not the only two story threads however as there are others that connect Charlie with a love interest, former relatives, and former enemies without even mentioning their main nemesis in the robot boxing world. For a story that seemed so unoriginal in the trailer it really does have many story threads to keep you gripped. That certainly was a shock for the system.Hugh Jackman is known mainly for playing Wolverine but here he plays something completely different. Granted he won't win any major awards for this performance but at times I forgot who he was and believed he was Charlie. Other than a couple moments of over acting and a few cheesy lines, he pretty much nails this performance. Dakota Goyo is also a strong performer as his son Max, my only quibble about him being that he seems awfully knowledgeable and confident for an eleven year old kid. Everyone else in the film does the job they set out to do.The script is also surprisingly good. It does have many cheesy moments especially in the final act but the dialogue throughout is realistic and there is some obvious and subtle humour put in there. At times there are some great lines, delivered really well, that are so subtle you need to really listen to hear them, and they are great. The direction is also really good, especially the fight scenes which will have you on edge. The CGI for the robots also looks fantastic, and despite the fast cutting to avoid continuity, look very realistic for the world they are in. The robots also look like they are standing alongside humans and not actual effects.The film is definitely a pleasant surprise. It does have a few cheesy moments and the second act does have a slight lull but there is enough in there for everyone to enjoy. It is a film I have seen twice now and I enjoyed it as much the second time as I did the first. This isn't just Rocky with robots, it certainly has something more.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Seems to be all prominent movie writers has no sense of morality whatsoever with their self-interpreted/broken christian theology or none at all.
In almost every american movies, the main character is always started as an immoral person; cheater, liar, conman, bully etc. because they think it's relatable to audience (read: americans -- thus everyone else on earth seemed to have a much higher moral standing).
Then after some cheesy redemption, the main character become a hero or a chosen-one, regardless of what he/she has done, no retaliation (as long as you believe blah-blah-blah, all your sins will be forgiven and enter the holy kingdom).
In non-american movies (particularly traditional asian) the hero is always pure and virtuous from the beginning, however wrecked the world the protagonist never bargain with his/her integrity. that's also the very reason why he/she become the chosen-one.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Although I am not a smarmy critic, everyone (self included) in the theater was cheering during the entire movie. For a movie to cause that must mean they are doing something right. Now while some think the formula is overplayed, it is well performed, and unique enough to really get you going. This movie is a real sleeper hit.

The plot keeps you excited about what happens next and there was a perfect balance of action and drama. The fight scenes were very realistic and we are dragged along together with Atom, Charlie & Max throughout the emotional journey that they are undertaking. Hats off to the writers who created a main character (Charlie Kenton) who is an asshole but you cannot stop rooting for him. From the first minute of the film, you start to feel involve with him and this doesn't stop until the last minute.

So, this movie is basically about a bunch of mechanic robots fighting each other, controlled with a video game controller. The movie, ""Rock-em, Sock-em Robots"" (just kidding!), I meant ""Real Steel"" has a perfect premise to this movie and it delivers more entertainment, more perfection, and more better action than the mighty crap of ""Transformers 3"". Director Shawn Levy finally improves his career after directing hit comedies like ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", ""The Pink Panther"", and ""Night at the Museum"". He really made an interesting movie that makes sense to everyone, and it's something that everyone could relate to. All the action scenes in this movie worked perfectly, and the special effects are extremely groundbreaking. The music is super inspiring, and the cinematography is so totally super. Hugh Jackman delivers one of the best performances in his career, and he steals the show in every scene he is in. I also really liked Evangeline Lilly in this movie as Jackman's ex who still believes in him. Dakota Goyo makes a total breakthrough performance as Jackman's long-lost son who suddenly is inspired to join the ring with his father. But out of all that, this is a movie that contains a warm spot, a real heart to the story is added. That's the type of robot movie that is perfect to watch, rather than the unexplainable ""Transformers 3"". ""Real Steel"" has a perfect script, a brilliant cast, amazing visual effects, awesome fight scenes, and the heart of the story works perfectly, which proves that this movie is one of the better movies of the year. ""Real Steel"", in my review, ""a heartwarming feature, with groundbreaking visuals"".","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

In fact when I popped it on, I was sure I'd be witching it off after 15 minutes. But in the end I was rooting for the little underdog robot fighter, despite there's not one original bone in the movie.What it boils down is, that Real Steel is a feel good movie. It knows everything in it has been done before in sports movies and father/son bonding stories. But at the same time the movie manages to do those all so familiar plot twists and turns pretty well and with ease many other movies, that aren't about robot boxing and sons looking to bond with their estranged fathers, simply aren't able to do.So, after doubtful start, I was, in the end, in a pretty good mood. Every plot element I had guessed before hand, but despite the ending that is riffing Rocky and pretty much every underdog sports movie, the movie had made a big smile on my face. It isn't a masterpiece, but it is a fun little movie, that aims to make you feel good, because in the end everyone learns a lesson and a sun peeks from behind the clouds.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This one — to judge from the tickets sold — picked good enough bits. Father stuff; coming of age stuff; techno; Karate Kid; Iron Giant.But a viewer demographic must be a vexing thing to these factory filmmakers, because some viewers will see the cobbled together being and see parts that were missing, parts that would have made the being stronger. Such was the case with me because I saw this foremost as a boxing movie and I looked for the cinematic thrills that could have been there.After all, the boxing movie is one of the primary paths where we evolve our notion of the camera. Scorcese of course, but many others brought us novel ways to think about who we are in the choreography of how a closed bit of the world dances.And that wasn't here even though our combatants are computer generated and our greatest advances in camera choreography have been in cameras whose placement and movement are not restricted by physical bounds.Nope. None of that here. We may as well have just been watching muscle cars in a demolition derby.Boxing, some might say, is the only true sport. One man against another and the first one that cannot continue loses. Sport — at least this notion — is about losing; the dream is about winning. It is a strange thing, the notion of contest. It is between two men, but if it were truly pure, they would go off and conduct the contest in private, as many do with say the contest of chess.But this seems to have been designed more for spectators. Rules having to do with space. With gloves and rests designed to make it last long enough to be worth traveling to gather in large numbers. Commentary and statistics that one can carry from contest to contest. A personality industry so we believe we have some choice in who we prefer.These are exploited here, well enough I must admit. But there is no dance.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

And the story gets more in common with the more recent family movie where the father figure is told as a reluctant, if not in denial, at first as a daddy. The developed story goes on as the common fatherhood movies, where the father and the kid finds the one thing they like in common and build relationship and bond more on it, despite it being a long shot, and eventually wins out the long shot. What's good about this one is that, unlike most other fatherhood movies where it's only the father that gets to do the struggle while the kid only shouts from behind to lift his spirit up, this movie presents that actually the kid can do something too. Jackman, as always, played this one nicely. It's good to see Dakota Goyo can balance the aura of Hugh Jackman.

Fortunately, the pubescent manager of the steel-plated pugilist in this sci-fi movie has got too much integrity for bribes.Following his mother's death Max (Dakota Goyo) becomes the ward of his affluent aunt (Hope Davis).But with a vacation on the horizon, she must bribe his father, an ex-boxer (Hugh Jackman), to safeguard him until her return.Under his supervision, Max recuperates a robot, which he and his dad enter into bouts. On the eve of their title shot, however, Max is removed from the event after his dad's creditors come looking for their cut.In spite of its cheesy lines and flamboyant bouts, Real Steel has real heart underneath its steely exterior. And while watching boxing with your absentee father can be healing, beating him up would be more rewarding.

A worthy movie to watch in theatre.. The end was a good one since it shows something realistic.. While coming to characters Dakota Goyo outperformed Hugh Jackman..lol Real Steel comes from director Shawn Levy, whose entire niche is family friendly fare. As for story, this is a movie about family bonding more so than robotics, the sweet science, or training. It hinges on Hugh and Dakota so that's it's simply not a collection of brawls. The two get along fine, and though Max is written like the father figure many will take relief in his maturity. Real Steel has a plot that's aimed right at the kiddos with easy to distinguish good and bad figures. Of course the ice-cold Russian-Japanese duo behind the reigning champ Zeus don't have relatable family struggles to put them in a gray area.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

The robots are fun, but inconsequential to the story itself.You see, in a world where boxing matches are done with robots, an old generation bot is tough and relies more on its handler's commands than on its programming. In the end the father and son team battle the robot of a rich Russian woman and her pet Japanese programmer. Yeah, they used a tiny bit of Rambo as well, apparently.The film was a nice feel good movie. The technical aspects were ludicrous, but again, not relevant, the actors played well and the story, as predictable as it can be, was nice nevertheless. A thumbs down for using women as walking clichés. A thumb up for using Kevin Durand, who is among my favorite bad ass actors. Bottom line: everything I expected and a little more, thanks to Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo, who carried the film.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

What a surprise! Although it feels like a very expensive kid's movie, I have to admit I had not enjoyed any aimed-for-the- adults movie so much for quite a long time. The movie and the outcome of every single match were very predictable (it's a kid's movie after all!) yet it somehow managed to get me all excited. Right now I'm thinking if I've seen a real action movie that came close in delivering this level of joy and excitementFace/Off maybe. The CGI used here is some of the best I've seen. You can't tell if the robots are real or computer-generated. The actors do a really great job in showing a wide range of emotions, although the ending failed to make me all emotional due to the childish nature of the movie. The fights were really exciting, even though the end result was clear from the start, and this has to be the movie's greatest accomplishment. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who feels he/she can still communicate with the child within.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Think ""The Champ"" (1931) with elements from ""Transformers"" (2004), ""Rocky"" (the 1976 original), and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991).At its core it is another redemption tale as aging boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) gets a chance to be a father to the now eleven year-old son he abandoned at birth (Max Kenton - nicely played by Dakota Goyo). Charlie is informed that his ex-wife has died and he leaps at the chance to cut a deal with his wealthy sister-in-law to give her custody of the boy. But through a series of somewhat contrived events the jaded Charlie ends up with Max for the first summer.The secret to this type of fairy tale lies in how well they connect with viewers; if the movie can get viewers to strongly identify with the character (in this case Max) as he gets a huge rush from suddenly becoming part of the robot-fighting world, the viewer will get hooked. Then the challenge is to keep them hooked for as long as possible. ""Real Steel"" hooks you and provides this vicarious rush well past the midway point, in large part because of the twist of having Max bond with the robot as a surrogate father, much in the spirit of ""Terminator 2"" but also nicely integrated with the ongoing dynamic of the old robot being Charlie's twin or at least the piece that completes him . But eventually the wheels fall off, or in this case get knocked off by a ""Rocky"" scripted overreach. The illusion bursts and most viewers crash back to reality because it takes too much mental energy to suspend disbelief when the team breaks into the glitzy celebrity world. From that point on it is just overwrought melodrama, with the inspirational ""redemption on steroids"" theme aggressively shoved down each viewer's throat.Of course this surfeit of cliché might have been palatable but for Kevin Durand's overplayed heavy. Like a series of cardiac arrests the heart of the movie first begins beating irregularly during his debt collection sequence, is then severely damaged by his lame homeboys routine, and finally succumbs from his sequence at the conclusion of the first round of the climatic fight. These would make great deleted scenes for the DVD release but should have been mercifully trimmed from the already too-long film.The one positive of the glitzy sequences was Olga Fonda's ""Farra Lemkova"" character, an amped up to super-hotness play on WWE's Stephanie McMahon. She provided the film's most interesting images, a kind of an embodiment of slick temptation. Can't say the same for Karl Yune's Asian robot designer who essentially was tasked with the Apollo Creed role. Part of Rocky's success lay in Creed's newly acknowledged respect for Rocky at the conclusion of the film, this allowed the ending to transcend its cliché elements because it nicely blunted the obvious good vs evil dynamic. Yune was not allowed to play his character this way and ""Real Steel"" loses considerable depth, dimension, and IQ points because of it.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

With high octane fights and acting not too bad to say this is made up with lots of CGI, The producers of this film really don't do a bad job in getting it all together and one of them executive producers is none other than Steven Spielberg. The film itself is a good length and although it made me feel slightly sleepy at times, it still conjures up good things. Hugh Jackman is OK as the main character Charlie and his son played by Dakota Goyo is actually well cast, as Goyo seems to fit well with the story and he could be a young actor to look out for in the future. Evangeline Lilly is charming as ever and although not at her full potential as an actor here, she still brings a certain air of calm headed coolness and seems a refreshingly different pace in the film.Shawn Levy directs this and his eye is not immediately on point it can seem and parts can be a little, say dodgy with too much action in certain parts but then none at all for a good length of time. I felt the heavy metal score placed down on this film was not one that drew me into the fighting, it only caused me to want the fight to end but I can see for some that they would find it more exhilarating than me. It is written well and the two guys who do the screenplay(Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven) don't hurt the movie but don't provide any assistance to the already seen type of plot.The effects are one thing that stand out in this movie and on reflection they are very nice and it's no wonder it got an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. It may seem or feel that the effects could over shadow the true feeling in the film but I felt any emotion the characters show is shown well enough through all the big budget stuff. It's not over dramatic storytelling(although the ending without spoiling is well, cheesy cheesy and more cheese), you'll notice if you see how the movie starts slow but really picks up a pace and although not rushing into it's ending, seems to want to finish without a bang.My review may seem as if I did not enjoy this, or maybe even like I liked this much more than I did but in truth I found it kind of OK and although not quite Good, still acceptable in the vast CGI action movie catalogue, that seems to get bigger every year. I gave it an OK-ish feeling review and that may seem harsh and I know for sure that some people will read this and completely disagree with what I have been saying but you have to like action to like this, not just Sci-Fi story telling, you have to like straight all out fighting. The film has true heart there is no doubt, one last thing I want to say about this is that you can feel for those involved and Hugh Jackman although maybe not at his absolute best, still draws you in. Give it a go even if you don't enjoy all out action because it may just surprise you how much you actually liked it, not easy to like but possible and it is wrong to say only a certain demographic would enjoy this.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The picture gains complexity from Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Charlie, who must balance parenting, atonement, and the unshakable bond formed in the harsh world of robot boxing. With visually stunning robot combat and an intense bond between Charlie and Max, the movie finds a balance between heart-wrenching scenes and jaw-dropping action sequences.

A sport where the contenders can be smashed, decapitated and executed at the crowds will.Robot boxing is big business with a huge following, neither phrase could ever be applied to Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman). Charlie is a struggling washed up ex-boxer, always believing he is just one win away from making good.Following one fight too many, he is sans robot, not a good space to be in, when fighting is your game. Fortunately Charlie has a long suffering back stop, on/off girlfriend Bailey (Evangeline Lilly), who in real life would be backstop for nobody.Charlie needs to score some serious cash soon. Fortunately he can sell his 11 year old son, by gifting his custody rights to a well meaning sister in-law. Motherless, poor old Max (Dakota Goya) has been living in miserable luxury but his Aunt wants to make it all official.Soon the pair are on the road, following a convenient hiatus as the rich folk go to Tuscany, Charlie is not happy, he just wanted the money, not a moppet in tow.Maybe Charlie has gone too many rounds, as his business sense leaves something to be desired. Max who rather fortunately, is a massive Robot boxing fan, has his head screwed on better than Charlie's robots.Alighting on a old Sparring bot ""Adam"", the pair start their journey from the bottom, Max with stars in his eyes and Charlie with his eye on the main chance and one last shot at glory.Charlie is an unlikeable character and Jackman literally pulls no punches in his ambivalence towards Max, involving him in scrapes and situations, no responsible parent ever should.The effects are seamless, CGI robots interact with the live actors and environments, the audience believing immediately they are real. Goya is no cute movie moppet, giving as good as he gets and clearly having the time of his young life. Jackman is solid and believable and as mentioned, does not take the easy acting route.Ultimately this is robots fighting in a ring, which is hard to dislike. However, if you imagine what you think this movie will be like, add about another half as much again, for the real emotion and drama the film manages to evoke.When watching the simulated Robot boxing sport, it's not so much a question of will this ever exist in reality, it's just a question of when.Finishing with a rousing and well staged ending, the Director is clearly confident enough to pause the action for a worthwhile and poignant slow motion sequence, leaving you with a smile on your face.Summary If you are expecting a standard formulaic father son bonding flick with added robots, this covers those bases, but adds depth and much more.Good crowd pleasing stuff, recommendedhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Robo-Boxing Family Drama","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4588829/?ref_=tt_urv","tabuno","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0972645/?ref_=tt_urv","17 January 2019","13 February 2012. Take Rocky (1976) and a plucky boy who appears to have more maturity or is more suited (as the script calls for) being the father of the typical movie father who abandoned his son, lost his custody of his son and who apparently never grew up (for most of the movie anyway).The son's character is a bit grating at times and takes the dominate role while his father almost appears to be witless and can't avoid being child (no wonder his wife divorced him). Unlike strong children, seemingly all girl leads such as in Where the Lilies Bloom (1971), Winter's Bones (2010), Fly Away Home (1996), The Secret of Roan Inish (1995), Little Miss Sunshine (2006) or for a strong boy role Hugo (2011) or Incredibly Loud and Extremely Close (2011), Dakota Goyo comes off cocky and full of himself from the movie script. One strong child male protagonist with a more balanced adult-child relationship can be found in The Cidar House Rules (1999). While such a character might delight to young kids, such enterprising in your face kids seem more like a daunting force for humiliation and embarrassment for adults, not of a parenting role model for parents to experience entertainment. Another young brash and sometimes uppity child character was found in the remake of True Grit (2010) though many found the movie among the best of the year and Winter Bones (2010) both young female leads.The best movies that seem to have children who are able to survive and prosper because they need to are reflected in such movies as The Secret Garden (1993), the animated Coraline (2009), or when children get to just explore and interact among themselves in both a childlike or adult way as in Stand By Me (1986), Holes (2003), or The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (2005), and more recently Super 8 (2011). Perhaps among the closest child-relational parallel movie to Real Steel may be the sci-fi children drama A Wrinkle In Time (2002) that has an nice balance of creativity, child-adult thinking mix and humor and drama and some of the best of young adult movies Whale Rider (2002) or The Lovely Bones (2009), The Tree of Life (2011), even the animated Incredibles (2004) or Spirited Away (2001).Another underdeveloped theme of this movie was the wasted potential the robotic-human interface dynamic which could have been used to an incredible affect with an almost A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001) mystic that was overlooked. Even today, the animated standard of motion capture has already established that the technology exists even today to replicate what is being presented as come futurist sports game (which if the audience interest and investors were willing could become reality today). To its credit, Real Steel avoids the overly dramatic stereotypical divorced wife hysteria though more could have been developed to even make these scenes more potent. Too little was shown in the way of Atom's rise through the ranks and then the sudden the title fight ultimatum and its resolution seemed overly simple and the antagonist too unnecessarily two-dimensional.The net result is another interesting but not particularly innovative nor creative movie that uses by the numbers' plot points and a boy character and using a robotic theme that could have generated a new level of experience.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So, chessy acting, predictable story, hack writing, good (not remarkable) special effects and yet this drivel went on to make $256 million, not including licensing, which I assume will be gigantic when Real Steel 2 comes out!?!?

I thought it was going to be another one of those cheesy, campy, not really believable, warm fuzzy, type of underdog/rags to riches movies. I was actually surprised. It had some great plot twists, it had a real storyline. And while yes, there is some language sprinkled throughout, it did make a good family movie for older kids, 10+ (my opinion). The ending wasn't quite what I was expecting, but looking back I think I liked it better for that. Who wants an ending they can see coming to the entire movie?It had some great comedy moments. The relationships between the actors felt genuine and not overdone or forced. The robot animatronics was good. The robots themselves were fun and imaginative and definitely made me wish we really had this sport. I would so be there!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Very few prominent robot films in mainstream Hollywood.The action sequences with the effects of the robots are very well done. The overall look and designs of the robots are well designed and it shows the creativity of these artists.The father son relationship is something which many people love seeing and although it is predictable, it's more about the journey along the way seeing the eventual growth of these characters.The story did grow once the son found the deserted robot ""Atom"" and it becomes more about him and the robot. Of course from there, we get the sense of where's it going, but it is wholesome in the sense of fatter and son bonding.Several highlights including one of the robot boxing matches with Atom and the red robot with two heads. Very thrilling and great choreographed. The finale robot battle with the great Zeus was also great all be it predictable.Considering this was a family targeted film, a happy ending here was definitely needed in a feel good way.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And I go not watching that movie for year, unless I came to know original plot from a friend. pathetic but true!!!But luckily I watched Cinderella man, and then that movie got me into boxing movies. Then I watched The Fighter. Those movies touch my heart. When I heard about Real Steel where Robots fight Boxing. I had no high hopes about it, but felt interested because the movie got The Wolverine. Now, I liked it and I like it much, seeing how realistic a science fiction movie can be. Seeing how a unknown son can change a father, how a son can rebuild a father's heart, I love the movie. FYI, this is the movie which will freshen your mind better than lots of comedy. No hard scene, but you may attempt to cry watching happy moments.A movie to watch with family.

Then next is love, love the climax match between Atom and Zeus it really feels like a Boxing Match or at least the highlights of it, and just the fact that not only they have The Announcers but also the official ESPN logo was attached to it makes it feel that much more real. As if there really is a official Robot Boxing League in real life and this movie is just happens to be about Robot Boxing. Just like ho Rocky is a movie about Boxing, or The Wrestler is about what else? Wrestling. So much so I really was Routing for Atom to Win every time that I watch it as if it's not only my first time watching it every time that I watch it every year, but also as if it was an actual Robot Boxing Match. Anyways they way how they explained the History of Robot Boxing was so thought out not only in terms of the History itself but also when and how they decided to talk about the History of Robot Boxing.Just loved all of the Designs of the Robot Boxers including the 'Hero' of the film Atom. And speaking of Atom in an interview they said that the reason that they never gave Atom a Face instead they just decided to give him that Fencing Mask as a Face, is so that us the Audience could imagine ourselves as Atom. And not only that since Atom is a Sparing Bot and Fencing is a form of Sparing, I think it was very Cleaver of them to give Atom that Fencing Mask as a Face. And then I just adore the Journey that Charlie goes on through out the Film. Then one of the thing that I loved Best is that this Film is that it's more than just a Robot Boxing Movie, in fact the Robot Boxing part is only a Catalyst on what this Film is really about. And Not only that but what this film is really about is Extremely Relatable to almost everyone. One of the things that I love best about this film is that it starts out Calm and then at the Climax of the Film it is the exact opposite, instead of Calm it is Highly Charged with Energy and Exciting. The Acting is Superb aside from one stay tune for the Bad for that, and even that his Performance was Alright not the best in the Film but still serviceable. Even if this Film wasn't set During the Summer I would still get that Summer Feeling with the Film. Because in a way this film is Summer Personified. And Unless I'm Missing anything else that she be it for the Goods.The Bad= As Much as I enjoyed watching this film every year I do still have a few issues with it. The first and foremost is that I Feel the character of Max is not only Annoying some times but also I feel his level of his Intelligence feels unbelievable literally in addition to be really Whiny at one point in the film and oh I can't forget a also a bit of a brat. Now I'm not saying that a Bad Actor or anything no that's not what I'm saying I'm just saying that I My Own Personal Opinion he should have gotten better material to work with. Then the next is that it is suggested that you can learn Japanese just by playing video Games, and hare's my issue with that is. If that was true than how come every one isn't speaking Japanese all of sudden? I feel that is unrealistic and obviously untrue, anyways that is my little Rant about that. Then next is that I feel the character of Ricky as Good as a Actor that he is not only have much to do but also he doesn't feel like that much of a threat to me as he was only a small dusting of the movie. Then Next but first of all I kind of understand why they did this, but I still feel that the Zeus Boxing Bot feel way too Advanced for that world is like creating the T-Omega or whatever with the Ability to Transform into a Mini Tank and along with the ability to go invisible to both the Radar and it could also create New Terminators whenever and where ever it wants along with all of these over-the-Top Abilities including Time Travel as is with Skynet in tow for the Terminator Universe. And my next and Possibly my final point is that I understand why they didn't do it but I still think that it was Really stupid for both Charlie and Max and even on part of the WRB to leave Atom On Stand By Alone like the they did, to attend that meeting with Farra Lemkova. And unless I'm forgetting anything else be it Good or Bad that should be it.Final Thoughts= According to an interview this film takes place in the year 2020, because back in 2020 aside from COVID I really did felt I had just as tough fight through out that whole year, 2020 felt like the equivalent to the Big Match between Atom and Zeus. And it was all over I really did felt like a Champion like Atom at the end of the film. Dur to all of the Extra Challenges that I had to go through for that year, and now I Associate Real steel with that film, so much so whenever I pick up the Physical Copy of this film I always instinctively hug it to my chest all the while repeating ""We Did It We Did It...."" And not only that but also for 2020, Real steal is one of the last Films that I was able to watch before I had to simi put it away for what feels like years. In prep for one of those Extra Challenges of 2020.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In reality, if you are going to watch this just for him, you will be mightily surprised. The movie completely takes over and you enjoy the movie for what it is and not for the actors that bring it to life. The emotional bond between father and son, between childhood friends who turned sweethearts and the battle between one man and himself is all so beautifully woven. This movie has robots, fights, boxing, emotions, a story line, survival of the underdog and so much more. I have wanted to see it for such a long time and i am really glad that i finally got down to watching it. Much Much worth it. I personally think it is a movie for all ages, men and women alike, for the movie teaches you one important life lesson. If you work hard and you have faith, nothing and no one and stop you.

The concept and idea of robots boxing was super original and make for a super fun and entertaining movie, the story actually is at times emotional for the relationship between father and son and it mixes so well with the boxing idea. Obviously the boxing scenes are the best, the punches and movements do feel like actual real boxing and the cgi is also great at all times.

These are all questions and ideas that I'm dying to see and hear. Did Charlie's dad get married and get the gym back to full tiptop shape or did they let that go?

You'll really believe the robots are right there fighting each other. The connection between Atom (the robot) and the boy is done really well, without resorting to giving the robot false emotion. It's just done by how we see the boy react to Atom in a childlike way. He wants to believe Atom has a connection with him, and so we want it too and it works very, very well. Hugh Jackman plays quite an unpleasant, selfish character to start with and it's nice watching him find himself again through his new and this time real relationship with his boy.
Story reminds us of Rocky of course, but with more humor and the characters are that much simpler drawn than the truer nature of the characters in Rocky. But this is a different movie, aimed at a different audience so it's all good.
Totally recommend!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

His robots are old out of date junkers. His showboating costs him his last robot. When his kid's mother die, he's left with the kid. Not only does he want to abandon the kid, he blackmails the kid's aunt (Hope Davis)'s rich husband (James Rebhorn) holding the kid hostage. Ladies, he's a real keeper.My biggest complaint is that Charlie is a huge douche. Why do they have to go big douche? He could be a loser without being such a horrible douche. He's a douche. Why would I root for a douche? Bailey Tallet (Evangeline Lilly) is hot for Charlie. She lets him stay in her gym. The kid (Dakota Goyo) is real mouthy. When he's told his father sold him to his aunt, the big thing he wants is his cut, half of the money. Neither of them are that likable. I guess the point is they grow together. But I lose interest in these characters pretty quickly. I do like the robots thought. Robot fighting is kinda cool.

Hugh Jackman is a wonderful choice for the unsuspecting father. His performance is a joy to see. He plays an ex-fighter too wrapped up in pursuing his second career to care much about his now motherless son. His second career is also boxing but now with second rate robots in the near future.His son is Dakota Goyo who made me think of Jake Lloyd the young Anakin in Star Wars I though this role at age 11 is far more convincing and enjoyable. Dakota matches Jackman beautifully and the movie would have fizzled without it.But the real cornerstone of this very well crafted film is the robots themselves. They move exactly as you wish the real thing would and never once did I get the feeling they weren't actually there on the set.Is the story itself fairly routine? Maybe if you discount the magic of their having created a believable world from whole cloth in the first go. This film practically screams megahit.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

If I had to pick one movie to watch for the rest of my life, it would probably be this. It was just that good. Hands down greatest movie I've seen in a long time.

Usually you can expect a somewhat respectable performance out of Hugh Jackman but during this movie he overacted to the point of annoyance.

I'm the Merchant Ivory, art house, history buff in the house and I want a good script and actors who know what to do with one when they get it. My son is the ""long week at work Adventure and comedy don't make me think"" aficionado, and my grandson is fine as long as it is loud, has crashes and someone speaks in Japanese. We ALL loved Real Steel. Look for your cynical film buff button and press ""OFF!"". Gather up everyone in the house whatever their age or gender and cart them all to the theater. Real Steel is your family feel good about being together, movie of the year. Hugh Jackman gets to act up a storm in a movie that for once he doesn't have to haul up by its boot straps to make better just because he is in it. Shawn Levy has given him a vehicle he can ride all the way to the end showing what the actor you knew was there can do with a decent script and cast. Dakota Goyo is that young talent you keep hoping sticks around for the long haul who is now at the beginning of his career, and the supporting cast (special nod to Anthony Mackie) does what it is supposed to do: Provide the tension and get out of the way. Real Steel may not be a movie for the ages, but in an era of too much over the top noise, empty characters saddled with poor writing, worse acting, and explosions instead of emotions, it is definitely the one movie you want to see this year, the one you will want to add to video collection, and the one that will make you stop for a few pleasurable moments to remember when flicking through the channels in years to come.(slight spoiler sentence follows)The rogue learns to be a good guy. The dejected but sharp kid gets a dad. The right robot comes out on top and while all of that is happening, you get to cheer, punch the air, and whoop or well up tears in all the appropriate places.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I should say off the bat, this film is much more engaging than I originally expected. It IS predictable in every way, however, it is (actually!) an enjoyable film. I think that Dakota Goyo (Hugh's son in the movie) was excellent. He truly stood out. Hugh, of course, was charismatic as a deadbeat dad, and former (pre robot boxing) boxer, that had a title shot but never made it. The visual effects were excellent, as expected. The sound effects were amazing (at least in the theater I saw it in) and added to the Robot fight sequences (especially) and the overall film. This is a great family movie, and a surprisingly engaging film, even though it is predictable. It has fun characters, cool robot fights, and the classic story of the underdog rising to the top. If you have kids it is a family friendly film, that everyone (like adults!) can enjoy. If not, its basically Rocky but with Robots and a big budget, so if you want to re-watch something you have seen before but with a big budget robot twist...this is for you...","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

If you're expecting Hugh Jackman to play a rough and somewhat edgy character in this movie, similar to his Wolverine character in the recent X-Men movies, this movie is not for you.In this movie, Hugh Jackman is Charlie Kenton, who is a retired fighter that now fights robot fighters and is also a ""bad bet,"" as stated in a scene in the movie. Rather than explain the plot and the dynamics of this movie, I would rather focus on the facts that I feel make this movie worth going to see.Yes, the movie is predictable. Let's be honest, a lot of movies today are but that being said it is a ""feel good"" movie and it did follow a common evolution that we have seen in many other good movies. Where I feel that Real Steel differed is that it was a fresh take on a very common storyline that did add a new twist of action and entertainment. I found the movie very positive and enjoyable and was actually disappointed that I wasn't able to share the initial viewing with my two son's, who I believe would have enjoyed the movie also.I would recommend this movie as an excellent family movie that is well worth the new movie ticker price.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The more films I review the more I try to avoid films that are just noise, that take the money and run, or just don't deliver - and we all see a bunch of those.Real Steel just doesn't hit and run - it's got heart, and it's a fun watch. The idea of fighting robots is well-developed and the CGI is flawless - simply the best effects of its kind, and it's currently one of the twelve films nominated for an Oscar for special effects with good reason - the robots really look and feel as real as its possible to imagine. But more than that the human story is good enough to make this work. Sure, it's a little clichéd and schmaltzy, but, and it's a big but, Dakota Goyo, who plays Max - the boy who finds his father and a robot, is a legitimate star - and one this reviewer believes will make it huge as he keeps going forward. His emotional range is exceptional, and he clearly upstages Hugh Jackman in several scenes.This is Rocky for robots, it is thrilling, and though there is a strong element of violence running through this, honestly GI Joe was worse and more gratuitous.Above all it's a blue collar film - it's about having fun at the movies and the sequel is sure to be a hit too. I was surprised at how much I simply wanted to cheer along while watching this - it's a knockout!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Now, in the midst of fall, when the Oscar films are dropping, he takes on Real Steel. Real Steel is about a sleaze ball named Charlie (Hugh Jackman) who trains fighting robots. One day, his son, Max (Dakota Goyo) decides to travel with him through a series of tournaments involving the fighting robots. Now, I must say, Shawn Levy has had his first real big disappointment with this film. I feel like I might be in the minority here, but I felt it was a long slog for nothing. That's not to say that Real Steel doesn't have its fair share of really cool, and even touching moments. That's just to say that Real Steel goes on for over 2 hours and it doesn't ever really feel like anything was worth sitting through over 2 hours for. I might have been more pleased with the film had it been ninety minutes or so. That way, it wouldn't have felt so long, and therefore wouldn't have been such a long haul. Also, at ninety minutes, a lot of the unnecessary stuff could have been cut out. With all this being said, Real Steel is good enough movie, it just could have been so much better, and so much less of a chore to sit through some of it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Hollywood's running out of ideas fast and this is the first major film to be adapted from a game (not a video game). Luckily for Hollywood's sake it has worked. It's not the smartest film in the world, it can be a bit predictable but it does have some interesting aspects which really carry it as a whole. Unlike many typical films, not many of the characters are likable; Hugh Jackman plays a drunk, debt-riddled, nearly unemployed man who abandons his child at a young age and forgets about him almost instantly. As intended, he does begin to grow on you and Jackman plays this part very well, he convinces you easily in the beginning that he is not a nice man. Dakota Goyo is a breath of fresh air, his character is unique in the sense that he does not play your average cute little boy who says something insightful every half hour, he's sarcastic, cracks jokes, is confident and really does bring the film to life. The only main acting flaw I could see was Kevin Durand who's character was supposed to be the antagonist but really didn't have much on-screen presence.The script is okay, it's predictable but it's certainly not bad. The dialogue is quite realistic and is often really funny, particularly between Jackman and Goyo. The plot is a bit interesting but the whole 'getting stuck with the kid' idea can become tiresome in films, luckily they managed to make it more interesting with the boy actually having a personality. The CGI is mostly great but there are some parts where it is lacking something. The soundtrack works really well with this film and carries a lot of major scenes. Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this film, especially if you have children they will love this. Adults can enjoy it too, it's funny, has a lot of action and keeps you interested.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie had sunk to sub 6.0 - as it deserves - but astrosurfers make it fly above 7 now. ""Two thumbs up!!"" I guess. We all know what this means for the boring Hollywood industry.I had said it and I say it again, one more step down and Jackman will hit WWE's payroll. Jackman is a good actor and we all need to make a living, I can understand.This movie is utter thrash. Not only does it rip from movies like Rocky or Over The Top - and Stallone wrote Rocky, but it's just plain bad. It has none of that underdog coming back to the top through effort and pain spirit. It's all about gimmicky robots and a petulant child. The young actor is quite good, luckily we can see him play in some quality movie. Please don't waste young talent on stuff like this.It's violent, it's not about a sport - boxing is a sport because human train to achieve such levels of dexterity and endurance. It's just a vehicle for product placement galore and bad music and CG. This is no family movie despite what those douches would have you believe. It has no soul or value. Do some meaningful activities with your children and talk with them. Hollywood makes a terrible nanny.Please vote with your money. Say no to turdish stuff and support independent, original ideas, or even Hollywood but with quality direction. Good luck - you'll need it.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

This is a classic underdog wins the day movie, but it feels fresh and crisp. Was also a nice surprise to see Kate from lost, although you don't see her enough. I'm not a massive fan of Robot wars, but this movie might have converted me. The CGI affects are top notch and blend in naturally with the rest of the movie. I won't give you any spoilers but I enjoyed the start too. It is just a good blend of action, drama some romance and I think most people will identify with at least one of the characters. It is also girlfriend safe which is a double bonus. She might not sit through a mindless action with you, but she'll sit through this one - trust me.

No matter from the plots or the process of the story, it is a stereotype. However, as a movie, at the same time, as well as a communication tool between the director and the audience, it is a successful master piece.The same as other boxing films, have come into the screen times by times, the only difference this time is the robots. A lovely boy who has his dream even the dream is so naive and a father who seems like a asshole make a fantastic win. They, of course, begin from small people, through training and matches, they turn to stronger and stronger with their robot. There is no doubt they will beat the boss regarded as invincible at the beginning. And no surprise for me that we can only watch three games by Atom though the film as same as every 'hero cultivation' film. I even can know what will happen next every time just not only because I have seen many films, but the plot is too easy to predict. Finally, the film shows the political point by laughing at Russia. Do not deny as the evidence is obvious in the film.However, as I said, when I spot it from another side, this film is a good one for inspiriting. A broken father desires money so much that he even uses his son to change money, but when Max is one foot stepping into death, you can see that Charlie is a real father, he can be a great father and at the end of the film, it proves he made it. By which I mean that it does not matter how worse you are a father, once you are, you can do what a father can do. A charming girl who supports the gym by herself and did every effort she can to love the guy she dreams. How huge this love is, she never gives up to love, even the guy has no sense of responsibility and also has the potential of a gambler, to some extent, he absolutely is a gambler. Fortunately the guy changed by his lovely son. Although the one next is also a stereotype, but it worth to be told again and again, it is facing the tough rather than flee away, it is getting a dream and fighting for it, and it is being confident just say ""yes, we can"" like Americans did.I have to admit that this film nearly burst me into tears by several scenes, so I give it an eight!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

My skills at movie making are not even as good as Uwe Boll's. Rather than list spoilers I will say that the ending was a twist on what I thought would happen. But, the path to get to that twist was paved with glitter glue and rainbows. It is beyond me on how IMDb users give movies like BloodRayne a 2.8 and Real Steal a 7.1. And I have not even seen BloodRayne. My thought is that 80% of the people who watch BloodRayne would know that the acting, directing and plot are going to be abysmal and would then say...wow...this movie is just like what I thought it was going to be so I will give it a 5. Who watches BloodRayne and thinks maybe 6 or 7 tweaks could have raised their USER rating from a 2.9 to a 7.1? BloodRayne was never meant to be a 7.1. I guess I need to remember that some people may have given Real Steel higher scores because they were looking for CGI instead of an intriguing back story and believable characters. Oh well, to each their own I suppose.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

With an underdog story – the similarities with the Rocky series are abundant – and a father-son dynamic at its core, this semi-futuristic tale about arrogant ex-boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman – reliable as always) being given another chance at redemption thanks to the new relationship he forms with precocious son Max (Dakota Goya – slightly annoying) offers exhilarating metal bashing in equal portion to human drama. Sure, the screenplay is littered with eye-rolling clichés and cringe-worthy Disney moments, but if you can roll with those punches you will be in for a satisfyingly uplifting picture.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It had been jokily been called the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots the movie, but it turns out that Real Steel is an entertaining film for the whole family.In the near future robot boxing has replaced human boxing because people wanted the carnage without the bloodshed. Charlie Kenton (Jackman) was a boxer who was forced to turn to a robot operator. He is constantly in debt, always on the road to fight underground, avoiding debt collectors and has to make deals to find new robots. At a rodeo in Texas he is told his ex-girlfriend has died and he is the next-of-kin to his son Max (Dakota Goyo). Charlie is willing to get Max's aunt (Hope Davis) care for him, for $100,000, but only if he takes care of the child when they she is on her second honeymoon with her husband (James Rebhorn). The aunt is not aware of this deal. Over the summer Max finds a old sparing robot Atom, and over the course of the film improve it. Atom some raises up the underground scene to the point he can challenge the best robots in the professional league.Real Steel is a sports film, a sci-fi story and most importantly a father-son story. Charlie starts as a real jackass, avoiding his creditors and willing to sell his son for a quick buck. Of course Max is not thrilled finding this out but slowly they bound and as characters they grow. They story is the main element of this film and Jackman and Goyo were good performers together. The boxing was also really well handled: Shawn Levy was able to mix animatronics and CGI seemingly as knocking seven bells out of each other. There is excellent camera work, editing, special effects and a soughing score by Danny Elfman. Levy was able to make the human drama compelling and deliver on the robot action, making all the robots look different and have different styles and moves. He would be a much better choice to direct a real Transformers reboot.The acting was solid throughout. No one was Oscar worthy but they did good job particularly Jackman as his character does change and grow. Some people have said that Goyo was annoying but I thought he did a good job and shows a lot of promise. I think that it is more the writing behind the character and I think there are some just reasons behind that, he just lost his mother and dumped with a father he does not know or cared about him. Even though this is a paycheque film for most of the actors they did at least put effort in their performances and for someone like Evangeline Lilly hopefully Real Steel can be a stepping stone from her role on Lost to a promising film career.As a sport film it can be a little clichéd but as a whole it is still very well done, still exciting and action packed. Some elements could have trimmed but it is a decent little package.As a film it is good family entertainment. It is a drama, but not dark nor really light and there are some comic moments. Tonally it is just about right to show for children over the age of nine to adults.7.5/10","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movie is so good it actually grabs you and makes you a part of the movie. Watching the robot matches was like watching a live boxing event or a football match on TV! It's so good! It makes you go Whoaa, Oohh and Ahhh!! The emotional scenes were spot on! It actually made me cry! The acting was really good especially the little boy (Dakota) and Hugh Jackman. They were amazing and I love their father-son relationship. Evangeline Lily also did a pretty good job. And since I'm a music freak as well, I'd like to add that the soundtrack was pretty good.I wouldn't mind watching this movie again, because once you start watching it you can't stop till the credits roll.

At times. Were there plot holes everywhere? Yes. Is it totally unrealistic and does it disregard basically everything physics has established? Check and check. But despite it's many shortcomings, I love this movie. First off, it's got great action. The blend of animatronics, motion capture, and CGI comes off really well and the fight scenes coupled with a good boxing soundtrack get your heart pumping and man do I feel inspired every time I see this movie. Jackman, Goyo, and Lilly all do very well with the roles they are given and manage to make the clichéd roles not only bearable, but enjoyable. All the side characters were well done too, without anyone coming off as to over the top. Also, it's great to have a (mostly) clean movie. A few swear words, one human fight scene that might be a bit intense for younger kids, and a couple kisses, but overall this movie is appropriate for everyone, something which is increasingly rare these days. But I think the real reason I've watched this movie again and again is that it has heart. You cheer for Charlie and Max and Atom not because they are cast as the good guys or even the underdogs, but because you love them.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

True it's filled with some underdog cliché's, but it works really well and never to the detriment of the story and characters. But strip away the robots and technological jargon, and at it's heart, lies a father and son with a loving bond. A bond that can never be broken by fame, fortune, or personal glory. Themes that resonate through us all, if we can keep it and with the two main characters in very good performances, that sentence alone is clear enough.I've known Industrial Light and Magic can make stunning and dazzling special effects as they have done so with the Transformers movies, but in this film, it's actually kept to a satisfying amount without going overboard; letting the audience focus on the story. And it's great to watch the inner and outer struggles of the main characters. But at it's core is a story of a man and child trying to bond and make up for lost time. As for the robots themselves, they are really well designed and for once actually make out what IS happening on screen. Movie directors please take note.So for all intents and purposes, Real Steel is the real deal. Well written script, likable characters, easy to follow robot action, and more. But it's the heart of the story that makes it stand out.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I have to admit that when I first saw the trailer I thought this was going to be another Transformer like fiasco, but I was pleasantly surprised with how well the movie was presented. The robots were simply secondary characters and the true heart of the film relied on the human characters and their relationship. It mixes sci-fi with the classic David against Goliath underdog story and some heartfelt drama focusing on the relationship between a father and his son. The special effects and the boxing robot scenes are great, but I am so glad that wasn't the actual focus of the film; there was so much more to it. Hugh Jackman is a great actor and he really delivers a lot of heart in his performance, but the actual star in this film is the young Dakota Goyo who really shines in each scene he's in; he has so much charisma on screen; I am sure he has a great future ahead of him. The relationship between his character and his father (Hugh Jackman) is the true focus of the film and what made Real Steel stand out above the rest of the summer blockbusters. Shawn Levy (Date Night and Night at the Museum) directed this film which is loosely based on the short story ¨Steel, ¨ and the screenplay was adapted by John Gatins. I found some parts of the screenplay similar to the original Rocky movie, so in a way Real Steel could be called the futuristic remake of Rocky.Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) used to be a professional boxer before the sport was banned and displaced by robot boxing. He was an average boxer who could take a lot of hits, and stood his own against the then champion of the world. Now he barely survives as a boxing promoter, taking his robot across the state to small rodeos and promoting small fights. He is not very good at winning and owes a lot of people a lot of money. He lives with his former coach's daughter, Bailey (Evangeline Lilly) who also loves boxing and works as sort of the robot engineer as she tries to fix the different parts and pieces of the damaged robots Charlie brings back. She admires Charlie, but also knows that his life is leading nowhere. Charlie's life changes when he spends a summer with his eleven year old son, Max (Dakota Goyo), whom he had never met before. Max's mother passes away so legally Charlie is in charge, but the boy's aunt Debra (Hope Davis) wants to take full custody of the kid along with her wealthy husband Marvin (James Rebhorn). Charlie sees the opportunity of making some money off his son and offers to give them full custody of the kid as long as they pay him 100,000 dollars. Marvin makes a deal with him as long as he keeps Max during the summer while he travels with his wife to Europe. Max and Charlie don't get a long at first, but their passion for robot boxing brings them closer together. Charlie can find a chance at redemption when Max finds an old and abandoned robot named Atom which was used for training, but with some few adjustments they might have found a winner.Real Steel was probably one of the most fun films I've seen this year. Yes, it has some flaws, it's not perfect, but it was really entertaining. The film has some corny dialogue, it can be predictable, but it is a winner thanks to the great cast. I'm also a sucker for underdog stories and this is probably one of the best sport movies I've seen this year. It has its emotional moments and I really loved the performances from Jackman and Goyo. The kid is just fantastic on screen and his charisma is unbelievable. You can't help but route for this kid. I also enjoyed Evangeline Lilly being the Lost fan that I am and it was great to see her in a decent role. The scene where she talks to Max about how Charlie used to be a great boxer was great; you can tell how much her character cared for Charlie by the way her eyes light up when she talked about it. I wish she would accept more roles in the future; I loved seeing her on screen. The robot boxing scenes were also great; I can remember two or three fights that were absolutely engaging, and the final fight is just a great homage to the original Rocky movie. Real Steel is real fun and real entertainment. I absolutely recommend this film and it will surely be among my favorite films of 2011.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

And i loved Rocky filmography. The story of Real Steel takes place sometime in the future (on earth) where robots have taken the place of human boxers. A fighting promoter is trying to succeed in the sport, placing his bets on an old robot with the help of his 11 year-old son who suddenly appeared in his life. I liked the whole use of technology concept. Still controlled by humans with no AI embedded yet, or at all.And i'm talking about actors and robots working on filming on the same set! You got to thank Concept Overdrive for this great movie (the same company that developed the real time motion systems used on 'Avatar'). Overdive uses the ""Simul-cam"" process which combines computer graphics robots with real world actors and sets. So that gave the director of this film, Shawn Levy, the experience of shooting the whole scene live. The film's real-world hydraulic robots were created by Legacy Effects, who utilized an Overdrive system to perform animatronic robots. The result was simply amazing.Hugh Jackman is a great actor and he proves it once again. Strong, convincing, sensitive performance. The key character here though is 12 year-old Dakota Goyo. Some of you might remember him from his recent small part in 'Thor', where he played young Thor. Very talented. Also, Evangeline Lilly is gorgeous in her supporting role.Now, who's responsible for the music? Danny Elfman of course, amongst other artists. Hip-hop is the main sound and it delivers the sport's atmosphere quite right. The scenes are mostly indoors and industrial but the exterior ones carry some really nice photography.I really enjoyed it. It was live, intense and sweet. It's worth the watch if you're an action/ sci-fi -or even sports- fan.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The characters, the plot, the twists, the story-building... they just aren't there. It's like a Giant walking through the forest drinking Fanta and eating mushrooms, making it all up along the way.Summing it all up: Real Steel is an exploitative, rampant, brazen, malevolent and harrowing piece of junk for the REAL FILM FAN (unless you're under the age of 10).But please, DO find out for yourself if you still have any doubts! Why still 2 out of 10??? Damn, for the effort I'd guess.Good luck watching this awesome film!! (You'll need it, really ;)","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Easily the most fun I've had with any 2011 movie. Those robot fights are stellar.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2508006/?ref_=tt_urv","Ryan_MYeah","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur11848670/?ref_=tt_urv","24 October 2011","We've still got two months in the year left, but I'm about ready to crown Real Steel as the most fun I've had with any 2011 movie.The year is 2020. The world has outgrown traditional human boxing, and has moved on to fights between robots controlled by their human owners. Former boxing pro, Charlie (Played by Hugh Jackman), has suffered a string of losses and broken bots. He gets a wake up call when he meets his son, Max, whom he hasn't seen since he was born. Hoping to make a change in the robot arenas, Max finds a robot named ATOM, a robot ""designed to take a lot of punches, but never dish out any real punishment"". But Charlie begins training ATOM, and the bot becomes a rising name in true underdog fashion, helping Charlie to fix up his life, and even learn to be a better person.Real Steel works best as a warm homage to the underdog films of the '70s and '80's, specifically Rocky. Once you get past the silly premise, what follows is an unexpected triumph for Shawn Levy. Finally, he makes a movie driven more by genuine heart and honest characterization rather than the barrage of fast paced slapstick humor and eccentricity that plagued Cheaper by the Dozen and the Pink Panther remakes.Some may argue that the screenplay has faults. At just about every turn, you can pretty much predict what will happen next. But you know what? Predictability has only been a problem for me if the story isn't any good. There's times where the movie gets obnoxious, and when it seems to slow down, but those are my only major gripes about the film. Yes, there's schmaltz, but Real Steel does schmaltz right. It's also a long movie, but I was so into it that it just flew right by......part of that may be due to the robot fights, which I can only describe with two words: FREAKING AWESOME! They're slickly edited, incredibly exciting, and the visuals and sound design are rendered and mixed with surprising finesse. They collectively form more fun than I've had with any of this year's summer blockbusters I've seen combined. Finally, I'll close off by commending composer Danny Elfman. With any luck and any justice in the world, he'll be on his way to the Oscars with a nomination for Best Original Score.I give Real Steel *** out of ****","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

After hearing a review for this film from BBC Radio 1's movie reviewer, I decided to start my own review page. She reviewed this film seeing nothing more than the robots. She totally missed out on the whole plot of the movie, and then her comment ""the climax takes a long time to come and it happens right at the end"" made me want to climb into the radio and tape her mouth shut. I know where I expect the climax of a film to be, and I know it is nowhere but at the end of the film. Yes this film has big giant robots in it, but the plot is way more than that, it is a story about redemption and doing the right thing no matter how hard the journey. I got that much from just seeing the trailer, she saw the whole thing and missed the whole point.OK rant over.This is a good film, not a great film but very good. Hugh Jackman is good in this but to be fair he is good in most things. He gets to show off a bigger range of his acting skills than he has in the X-Men films. He plays Charlie Kenton, a former boxer now heavily in debt due to pushing his fighting robots too hard and expecting more than they can give, like fighting a 300lb bull! This also stars Evangeline Lilly in I believe her first role since the series Lost ended. She is also very good in this. However, the star of the film is Dakota Goya as Max Kenton. He shines as the child thrown together with the father he doesn't know. He enters the world of robot fighting with his father and manages to rescue a robot from a scrap pile. He then convinces his father to enter the robot in the fights. You really get to experience the wonder of the Robots through him. The other star is the robot he rescues, Atom. Although not sentient, the director manages to bring him to life with good camera angles and subtle sounds. You really start to feel for the robot and you manage to forget the fights aren't real. The other very clever part of the film is the setting. It is set in the near future, but the only really futuristic thing is the robots. There are no fancy cars or clothes and this enables you to connect with the film easier.The climax of the film (at the end!), is a big showdown with the undefeated champion. Instead of just two robots bashing each other, you get Atom, the underdog, controlled by Max, and helped by his father. You see and feel each blow the robot takes and through the acting skills of Dakota Goya, you forget it's a machine and you can't help but cheer him on.This could have been an average film, but the fine performances by the cast and the skill of the director in bringing Atom to life with just the use of camera shots and clever subtle sounds turns this film in to a joy to watch as you take the journey with father, son and giant robot.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

And please consider I have no preconceived ideas about this movie, I watched Transformers and I actually thought It was pretty good and entertaining, but this one here didn't feel that way. First off, sentiments. If the relationship between the father and the son is important for the story, develop it, and if not, just don't put it in there, but to see characters showing great feelings for each other out of the blue and with no explanation whatsoever really reminds me of a B-class 80's action movie. Well, this is not a B movie given the budget and these are not the 80's. This movie spills cheese all over in the wrong decade.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

As I mentioned in the title of my review, Over The Top is the first movie I thought of as the credits rolled by. This movie was so much like my fav. Stallion movie from the 80's that I had to revisit the story line a few times to make sure they just did not substitute a ""arm wrestling"" with a ""robot"". In the end, it seems that since this movie is based on a short story that was written in the 60's, it could not just be a remake of the classic 80's movie so just MAYBE Over the Top used snippets of this short story to create the Stallon movie...who knows. All I DO know is that this movie has it all...action, drama, humor and sci-fi all wrapped up into a enjoyable movie that the whole family should enjoy. I did not want to look away..the action followed well, the drama was not too intense and the story line was believable enough that Im starting to wondering WHEN exactly we will see ROBOT boxing in our future.. They often say inventions are based on movies and TV right? Well, when Robert boxing starts...i will be there for sure thanks to this movie! Loved it and its well worth the money you spend on it. Its a keeper..kinda like an Ironman or a Spiderman movie. Get this one! Cant wait to #2 comes out in 2014.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Some well chosen tunes intersperse the action, which works well, although some of the music wasn't to my taste. The performances were all very good, particularly Hugh Jackman as Charlie Kenton, he really had me believing Charlie was a complete idiot at the beginning of the film (always a good sign). Dakota Goyo also did a decent job as Max, a little annoying at times, but eleven-year-old boys are like that in real life, but still a decent performance nonetheless. Finally there's Evangeline Lilly as Charlie's former trainer's daughter, Bailey Tallet. Quite a straightforward role that she played very well.A film with very much a feel-good factor, but not one that makes me want to jump in the shower to wash the saccharine off. I've heard it described as 'Rocky with robots' and I can see how that comparison could be made. There's plenty of action and in between, more than a little drama as Charlie and Max try to figure out their relationship. For me, it didn't let me down on the entertainment front despite its shortcomings (little character depth and a slightly predictable plot) but it still gets the SteelMonster Seal of Approval!...

Well, Real Steel had a story, for better and for worse. But just a typical Hollywood story, unfortunately. Nothing new at all. The kid was rather annoying, and unbelievable as well. I was simply unable to accept the fact that he had such a large part. This should have been Hugh Jackman's movie, but it felt more like it was the kids movie. Seriously, haven't we seen this kind of story too many times already? Kid reunites with his dad, but hates him at first. Kid gets obsessed with his fathers interests, kid challenges the world, kid tries to get his father back on track, who pretty much acts like an adult baby throughout the film. They argue, they win, they shed some tears, and so on and so forth. And then add robots. Even though Hugh Jackman was mildly amusing at times, the story in whole was rather bland. The whole robot part was great though, I just wanted more of it. Way more. That's what I wanted from a movie called ""Real Steel"" anyway. Real Steel should just have sticked to what it was best at: a robot film, while keeping the standard Hollywood fare to a minimum. Real Steel could have been great if it had dared to go beyond Hollywood, but it didn't.Moose finds this film worthy of an 8.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Real heart, real characters, real emotion. Oh, and robot fights","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2524999/?ref_=tt_urv","xamtaro","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19392148/?ref_=tt_urv","27 November 2011","""Real Steel"". The title itself calls to mind loud, frenetic, bot-on-bot battles the likes of Michael Bay's ""Transformers"". Promotional material and trailers featuring quick cuts, bad ass one liners and humanoid machines beating the nuts out of each other only heightened that expectation for a souless, action heavy, gear grinding testosterone charged movie.Surprisingly, Real Steel has real heart. It is less like Transformers and more like Rocky or Karate Kid. Simply put, it is an emotional tale about a down and out loser reconnecting with his estranged son over their passion for ""robot boxing"". You see, in the future, ""Bot bouts"" have replaced traditional fighting sports like boxing as a way to up the excitement factor. Robots can, after all, take a bigger pounding, and dish out more damage than any human can. Sadly for poor ex-boxer Charlie Kenton that means he's out of the job. Without a purpose He desperately tries to get into the Robot fights circles to relive his glory days but his bot is trashed, leaving him in debt and with shattered dreams. Charlie's stubborn dedication to a lost cause is broken when he is given custody of a son name Max whom he never knew he fathered. Things go from bad to worse but through a stroke of luck, Max discovers an old training Robot in a junk yard. Christening the robot ""Atom"" Max convinces his dad to retry for the robot fights.This is where the movie throws its first surprise left hook: the robot fights are only secondary to the human story. The terrific chemistry of the cast, especially between Charlie (Hugh Jackman) and his son Max (Dakota Goyo), is full of old school charm. Jackman's Charlie is superbly developed; he starts off as a self centered and stubborn man who learns responsibility, patience and the value of family. In a way, he represents the common workaholic who aims too high and has lost sight of the little joys in life. Newcomer Dakota Goyo plays Max as the perfect foil to Charlie's thick headed immaturity; an endearing kid, full of spunk and energy which rubs off on his dad and gives him a new purpose to keep fighting for. They are a lovable pair, slowly opening up to one another.But fear not fanboys, it is not all drama. There are the promised robot fights. And when they come, they come like glorious uppercut in slow motion. Shawn Levy's directing style is clear and even, yet energetic with none of the whiplash cuts and shaky cam; a welcome surprise seeing as how this is Levy's first time directing a sci/fi movie. Perhaps the most astounding aspect of the film is its special effects. The robots are a combination of computer generated images (CGI) and physical animatronics which give them a heightened sense of realism in both their look and the way they move. Furthermore, the fights were overseen by former boxing hall-of-famer ""Sugar Ray"" Leonard.Real Steel is the tried and true underdog story set against a science fiction backdrop. Sure, it might seem unoriginal, but the writers weave in some clever themes to set it apart. Under the mechanical mayhem lies a clever jab at the commercialization of modern sports. How the big money holders will constantly try to squash ""the little guy"" from reaching their dreams. It also advocates the old saying about how it is not the destination that matters but the journey. And lastly, it advocates a pro-family theme about how good old fashioned joy of sports bring people together.This is a true family movie for everyone. Accompanied by Danny Elfman's rousing soundtrack, the atmosphere is so contagious, you just cannot help but cheer our lovable protagonists on. Action is exciting and the fights are intense with the outcome never clear. For fans of Japanese anime, Real Steel incorporates some familiar stereotypes such as the immature adult/mature kid pairing and the designs of some of the robots. Plus, the whole gimmick of shouting out attacks for the robot to perform will remind any kid of something like Pokemon. Yes it is slightly unreal, it is wish fulfillment at its very best. What child would not want his very own fighting robot? Like its protagonists' and their robot ""Atom"", Real Steel is ""the little guy"" when stacked against the year's big hitters like Transformers 3, Harry Potter 8 and Pirates of the Caribbean 4. It only has a fraction of their budget and no franchise power to flaunt. Yet Real Steel comes through with incredible action sequences that are only secondary to what matters most: characters who are easy to relate to, a heartfelt emotional narrative and compelling themes.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

His recent outings include the two successful 'Night at the Museum' films and the Steve Carrell driven 'Date Night,' and with his latest effort 'Real Steel' he carries on this trend of bringing a large-scale, blockbusting picture to the big-screen that appeals to both children and parents alike. As expected with a film involving fighting robotic androids, it's an over-the-top, CGI-laden action-fest that never attempts to be anything else which somewhat works in its clichéd favour.It's the year 2020 and human boxing no longer exists due to human beings insatiable taste for increasingly violent blood sports reaching new, unbridled heights. When society wouldn't sanction anything more violent and deadly, the World Robot Boxing league was created to satisfy man's urge for destruction. Here huge, metallic robots battle each other in front of hundreds and thousands of spectators to determine which man, woman or child has created the ultimate, well, killing machine. Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a former pro-Boxer and full-time loser, his arrogance and stubbornness is a constant contributing factor towards his failure in life to provide for himself and his friend Bailey (Evangeline Lilly). But when his ex-girlfriend dies and he is left with custody of his eleven year old son Max (Dakota Goyo), he must not only juggle his job as a poor man's robotic boxing coach, but also a young, animated child who understands that the man before him is only his father by blood and nothing more.Cheesy dialogue, energetic action sequences and exaggerated emotions prosper in 'Real Steel,' because Shawn Levy has decided that this film does not need to be taken seriously by any members of the paying audience watching in a nearby theatre or home cinema. Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo play overstated characters whose emotions are literal thrown at the viewer. When they're feeling a bout of sadness, arms flail, voices rise and tears flow. In no way do the characters react to the subtle nuances that govern everyday life, but instead, they perform to an overstated level, because everything in this film is placed into entertainment overdrive. The robots are huge, meandering objects of destruction, and the underground arenas are stereotypically on the 'bad part of town' (except for a Zoo, of all places). While the script perfectly encapsulates the desperate, stereotypical situation this father-son duo find themselves in both financially and emotionally, as their relationship slowly develops throughout the course of the film. Essentially all three elements combine in their own tawdry way to create something which can easily be described as; harmless, brainless fun.This film is a case of; if you drop your cinematic guard and allow yourself to be sucker punched, you'll probably come away happy. If an audience member goes into 'Real Steel' with high expectations, he or she should come away feeling mildly disappointed, however if the audience member in question goes into the theatre with low expectations, there is no doubt that they would come away feeling somewhat satisfied. This doesn't necessarily mean that every scene contains engaging entertainment, but the majority do, including the final act, in which even the terribly tacky product-placement can't ruin a predictable, yet enjoyable conclusion.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Its glossy, twee, well shot but sadly all too mechanical. Just like Super 8 before it, the film suffers from an odd focus on a saccharine set of characters, who when in the midst of the fantastical dangers of the films plotting still seem all too concerned with their own social dynamics and shattered family histories.I felt no sympathy for Hugh Jackman, who was likable and believable, as the film seems to champion the notion that sometimes we aren't good enough and that we should just give up. There seems to be a natural order at work, that the people with all the money will inevitably get what they want and that this is ultimately right. Case in point, Jackmans offspring ends up with his wealthy aunt or that Jackman's 'everyman' robot eventually loses the title fight, one or the other would have sufficed. OK, with regards to the fight, it is almost a cliché in the sports movie that our hero should take the moral victory rather than to actually win but here it would have been much more fitting given the set up. If Jackman had won the final fight he would have exercised his previous boxing demons and proved to the kid that anything is possible. As it stands, the ending is flat and depressing.The CGI is fine but i still feel disconnected from CGI heavy action. I felt similar disconnection when watching Transformers, i don't want to watch rubbery CG robots throwing each other about, i might as well stay in and watch someone else play their Playstation.Also, the film has an odd and uneven tone. It seems to be a kids movie that rides the ropes of a very adult genre. There are character clichés here that kids wont understand and that subsequently get lost the rich tones of the films thick veneer. The films opening 'bull fight' in retrospect seems flabby and without merit, a truer piece of cinema would have cut this and gone straight for the jugular. A useful reference point in this respect is the original Karate Kid, it follows a very familiar pattern but without all the bloat and needless melodrama. There is a rush and a zip to the Karate Kid that seems to have been lost in modern cinema especially those movies catered toward kids. Children don't need 4 scenes reiterating an emotional beat, 'REAL STEEL' could have been a really enjoyable 95 minute romp instead its limp and fatty. It is a common mistake by the Spielberg endorsed film-making crew, length seems to be a substitute for weight.All that said, i would rather watch a well made piece of tosh than a poorly executed average movie. The cast are all fine, with Jackman continuing to impress as he juggles being handsome, likable and even menacing when needs must, its a shame he has to waste his time on toss like this.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It gave many viewers. But today I decided to see it and really surprised me. Very few movies have caused me such emotional encounters of sadness, joy and excitement as this. The performances are really great. Both Jackman and child were amazing. The sparring robot even with simple and rugged design, makes you fond of him. Really amazing. A movie that actually shows almost all human feelings despite being robots. Love, adrenaline, and steel. Excellent. The interpretation of Jackman doing selfless parent is formed and then as his love for his son and all that that entails, or to fight for is awesome. actually, I was thrilled with this movie. to see family and especially with children","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Often trailers give away too much or completely mislead you, this one does neither. It doesn't raise expectations of being this generation's Rocky but it also isn't a mindless flick. It has heart and great performances and it has the action that makes it a fun movie. Props go to Hugh J. for being utterly dislikable when his character needed to be. Many might think i mean he's kind of like wolverine where he presents a rough exterior but secretly you love him, no i mean there where times I wanted the power to walk into the movie and smack his character, he was that much of a jerk. But the real star was the kid who played Max, Dakota. To be able to go toe to toe with Hugh & also bring life to Atom, well that takes spunk and this kid had it in spades. There is a line in the movie where the character of Charlie says "" are you kidding me with those eyes?"" I think it describes the relationship that these two actors are able to foster. This movie isn't perfect, to be fair no movie is if you ask too many questions, but it delivers as promised, it's fun, inspirational and frankly pretty cool. I give it a conditional 10/10 as long as Hollywood does NOT make a sequel. There are some movies that do warrant a revisit of the characters but this isn't one of them.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Review of Real Steel","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2534170/?ref_=tt_urv","linaskk","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22628049/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2011","Movies about ring fighters have always been popular – just remember titles of multi Oscar winning movies like Rocky, the Wrestler, the Fighter, Million Dollar Baby etc. Shawn Levy, director probably best known for Night at the Museum, also decided to make one, this time about...robots. Yup, in close future (2020) robot boxing is a new incredibly fascinating hype. Our protagonist Charlie Kenton (played by Hugh Jackman, known from movies like...oh come on, everyone knows Jackman from somewhere, whether it is X-men or Australia) is a boxer forced to retire because of growing popularity of roboboboxing. Charlie could not keep away from boxing, so he joined new wave, though, he is experiencing not the best stage of his life: sleeping in his truck together with old pieces of junk he uses for various meaningless fights, falling into debts and, what is worst, losing robots in battles. At this stage, out of the blue, Charlie's abandoned son comes into his life, surprising Charlie himself. Of course, raffish ex-boxer is far from being a good father, but this is where father and son relationship begins to emerge, and they emerge by doing the same robo-boxing together. Hugh Jackman is one of the most popular guys in modern Hollywood, men think he is cool thanks to roles like Wolverine and Van Helsing, women love his charisma and appearance. What is best, he fits in this hot-headed, careless, but deep down inside kind hearted guy's role perfectly. Seems like he was born to do roles like Charlie Kenton. However, Jackman is not the only guy who shines in Real Steel. Dakota Goyo, playing Charlie's son Max, gives really impressive show, being only 12 years old, he outperforms most of the actors two or three times older and more experienced than him. Chemistry between Goyo and Jackman works here well; their problematical father and son relationship looks believable and true. This kid might have hell of a career if he continues working on his talent and skills. Also, Evangelina Lilly finally escaped from mysterious lost island and joined the crew. Though, she had not much space in the plot to expose herself, there were a few scenes to show her potential; she was a nice touch to this movie overall. Probably the most important stuff to mention in a robot movie is special effects and visuals. Real Steel shines here too, robot animations have never looked so realistic; add huge variety of totally different robot designs, most of the time reflecting their master's personality, and you'll get really great looking portion of action. Camera work is also worth applauds, beautiful landscapes combined with superb lighting makes Real Steel true eye candy. Sound of the movies is pretty rarely discussed as a separate part, but Reel Steel's sound work deserves a paragraph. Fight sounds do not not leave you any chance to doubt that this is how bashing other robot's head sounds like. Soundtrack, a powerful combination of hip hop/rap music (songs by Eminem, Timbaland and other famous names) and rock (Foo Fighters, Tom Morello) can easily make you blood boil on every fight you see on the screen.It might sound almost idyllic so far, but not everything is so perfect. The weakest point of Real Steel is its plot; it can be predicted from very first 15 minutes, as soon as you understand what this movie is all about. Careless father's and son's reconnection theme has been touched numerous times before, fighting and climbing to the top is also not a new thing, too. Struggle between human's mind and artificial intellect is one of the most unique aspects, but I, Robot did it almost a decade ago. So, Real Steel is basically a mix of stories seen or heard before, dressed in new clothes, damn attractive clothes well put together. Real Steel is far more than just a mix of Rocky and Transformers; it is very atmospheric boys action movie, which surely leaves you entertained for whole 130 minutes and it passes like half an hour. It probably will not get an Academy Award or make a change in film history, but it surely is one of best movies this fall.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This year was no different. I saw a few movies I enjoyed but didn't really love, and a few I actually hated and could not believe they actually did them. The Three Musketeers which I saw today belongs to the latter bunch; a waste of money and pretty faces. Real Steel was the exception for this year, like A Single Man was two years ago for me. It moved me and engaged me like no other movie this year did and upon leaving the cinema I felt like sharing the experience with others. It was by no means perfect, but it was the best effort at storytelling I have encountered in the recent years from Hollywood. Most of them try, but get it wrong; these guys got it right for once. It felt good to watch a movie again and really enjoy it. Loved the acting too; Dakota Goyo was amazing and Jackman very convincing.

I honestly believe the scriptwriter teamed up with the director and blackmailed a bunch of people into that. if anything else made this movie happen I really have to doubt reason and accountability of a lot of people including me, as I unfortunately managed to watch the first 30 min of that masterpiece. This isn't even good enough to watch it witch one eye half open, while lying in bed trying to cope with your hangover. Are people getting dumber by the second, or is there another reason why Hollywood manages to put out one decent movie every two years. I honestly don't get it, but somehow feel insulted. How is a rating of 7.4 possible, how is it possible that according to IMDb this movie made more than 200mil?There are watchdogs who prevent people from watching explicit adult material or gore and violence - why isn't there anybody who serves the public by placing a stupidity or intellectually-insulting rating.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

In this updated story written by Dan Gilroy and ably directed by Shawn Levy, the suggestion has taken hold. The year is set around 2027 and boxing between humans has been replaced by gigantic Robots and spun into a metallic yarn called "" Real Steel. "" The movie centers around a former boxer, turned fight promoter and near-do-well called Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) who discovers he has a growing list of failures and a loving son called Max Kenton (Dakota Goyo). The boy finds a discarded and very primitive Fighter Robot called Atom, who has an ability to mimic human actions. During their growing companionship, Max discovers he needs the help of his reluctant father, who finally agrees to help train Atom and school him to challenge monster robots much larger than himself. Along the way, both father and son learn from each other and their Robot that in order to achieve success, one must never give up. The movie is filled with much robotic excitement, electronic drama and human pathos. One cannot but suggest that the film, the actors and it's never say die attitude has indeed earned a place in the annals of the Classics.

Note I said Feels like. The premise is simple . Charlie Kenton is a former contender for the Heavyweight Championship his one moment of glory is when he almost took down the number 2 contender for the Title. Boxing loses popularity even UFC and MMA style events lose popularity and becomes outlawed leaving former fighters promoters and managers to invest in fighting robots. Charlie invests in one bad robot after another and gets involved in one bad fight after another. He's in debt and he's barely hanging on. Then his Ex Wife dies and a son he barely remembers comes back in his life. Charlie hands custody over to the boy's only other living relatives his aunt and uncle who ask Charlie to look after the boy for the summer while they go on a trip. Charlie and Max barely get along as Charlie introduces Max to the world of robot boxing. Charlie loses his last robot and as he scavenges for parts in a robot graveyard they discover ATOM a generation 2 sparring robot who Max and Charlie convert to a fighting robot. The rest of the movie does become cliché. ATOM is the little robot who can and he does take them right up to the Heavyweight Championship. Father and son bond. Then something comes along that threatens that Bond and they have one last fight that makes that bond stronger. Hugh Jackman gives one of the best performances he ever has. He comes across as unlikeable charming and he's a conman who's willing to sell his son to his uncle for 50 thousand dollars. He's so selfish and willing to wheel and deal that you wonder if he has a heart of steel. eventually you find that Charlie has a heart and after a lifetime of being hurt and beaten down he's built a shell of steel around himself.It's a shame Jackman was not nominated for any awards because he creates a character so different from any other role he's played. Don't pass this movie by take a chance watch it and be surprised because the movie actually is just as good as Rocky it's got that same vibe and it's got some great action.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

However, if you are one of those people that are stuck up and hate every movie you watch because you know what's gonna happen, you might as well save your money for the next shutter island. It wasn't just epic the whole movie though, because the emotion and personality that the characters show stir conflict you can really feel, and that's the only thing that can make an epic movie better!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Fun for all ages.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2574335/?ref_=tt_urv","vincent-bullock","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23919731/?ref_=tt_urv","1 March 2012","It is easy for films like Real Steel to give in to sloth and rely on CGI robot fights and Hugh Jackman's presence for an easy buck. To my delight, Real Steel doesn't opt for the lazy approach to blockbuster films and pulls off the whole production with a great script, brilliant acting, amazing directing and the best CGI robots I can recall seeing.Considering the premise for the film sounds more like an feature-length ad for a line of action figures and video games and that it is taking a big risk by selling itself to both an adult male market and a children's market, it really is impressive that the result is such a passionate and endearing story about a father and son.Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo feel perfect side by side and the latter is living proof that child actors aren't always obnoxious distractions from an otherwise good action flick.I also have to commend the film for going for a slightly different and original dynamic regarding boxing films. Hugh Jackman plays a washed up, past his prime, jaded boxer who has lost all his aspirations due to the shift in fandom from humans to robots. Dakota Goyo plays Hugh's estranged son who has good reasons for hating his father. Naturally, Goyo shows a spark of talent in the field of robo-boxing and the two join forces for a shot at the title of world champions. The twist is that everything revolves around Jackman and his journey of rediscovery, coming to terms with his misfortunes and mistakes while mending his relationship with Goyo; it is a much braver and refreshing storyline than the typical Rocky formula: old guy teaches new guy his old tricks.If you are looking for a film to watch with the family, this is probably it. The subject matter is approached with all the respect and seriousness you could ask for while the larger narrative is fast-paced and simplistic assuring it can captivate the majority of audiences.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Hugh Jackman is too likable to be a failed father, while the son is just simply very annoying. I can hardly bear the son because he is arrogant, rude and have little respect for others.

They learn and grow together as father and son while overcoming obstacles together. Insert Rocky IV ending.The movie does pay tribute to Rock em sock em robots and the music appeals to the younger crowd featuring Eminem.What stands out in the movie are the ""moments"" which the actors portrayed quite well. The acting in this movie was very convincing and drew in the audience to keep the movie flowing. The only part of the movie that another poster had brought out was that there was less technical input from Haley. She plays the stereotypical supportive female role that Hollywood seems to perpetuate rather than empower. I think that if there was more character development on her end: maybe have her include some refinishing touches to Atom before the final fight then I would have been satisfied with all of the characters fitting in with the movie.all in all: 6/10 but the acting gave it an extra point.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

They must be in high demand or something? My opinion is, if you see a negative review about this movie...just ignore it.It is VERY RARE that you get any type of viable/watchable Sci-Fi in any form these days. Most Sci-Fi is very cheaply made, with poorly written story lines, and second rate actors cast in them. And, little to no descent looking effects.Real Steel: Is not a ""Cheap"" made movie. The actors cast in the movie are ""GOOD"", and the story line is very family oriented. It can appeal to both a younger, and older crowd.The CGI effects are good, I like the close up views on the Robots.I would recommend that if you like Sci-Fi, you should give this a view. If you remotely enjoyed any of the vast ""Marvel"" movies that have been spewing out of Hollywood as of late? I don't see any reason why you would not like this movie. This movie is just as good as any Super Hero movie that has came out...With a sort of ""Rocky"" touch to it.And, you can let your kids watch it. Which is the least you can say for a lot of movies coming out these days.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

But it hides a little something for everyone, along with some surprisingly deep messages on the way.It's the future! Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) was once a boxer, one of the best. Was, of course, until the sport of robot boxing took over the spotlight as more entertaining. Now, he rides from place to place, trying desperately to get some money. That is until he learns that his ex-girlfriend is dead, leaving him with an eleven-year-old tech-savvy son, Max. The boy's mom will take custody of him, but only at the end of summer. This is how an adventure starts, and when Max finds Atom, an old sparring bot in a junkyard, it only picks up speed. Despite the fact that Atom is not build to fight, Charlie and his son have no other choice left - they will have to make do with a small, weak robot. And with the ex-boxer teaching him to fight, who knows how far they will get?Real Steel makes no sense. Really. In fact, it's quite possible that you'll spend half the movie wondering about how the robot works and why, exactly, is Hugh Jackman using voice control instead of a remote. If you can look past the ridiculous plot, however, you'll see a story about how a boy reunites with his dad and how archaic beats the modern. Kids will enjoy a movie about 1000-pound robots beating up each other while the adults will appreciate it for the story.See it. You'll be surprised at how much you enjoy a movie about boxing robots.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

When the film finally got to Detroit for this big fighting tournament, I didn't see any of them. Then I find out afterwards that since the incentives never came through, they cut their parts out. Did I think I wasted my time? Well, not really.Real Steel is about Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) owing people he can't pay who now wants to beat every inch of his life, and relies on big robots to fight tournaments for him. He keeps losing. However, a turn of events happen and his ex dies and leaves their son in his care. Well, actually her sister takes custody as Wolverine basically sells him. But then it turns into this father and son story where they work together to win these tournaments.... like what we've seen in the trailers.The problem with Real Steel is that it's very formulaic, by-the-numbers, like we've seen this in a hundred films before. It's a tried and true formula and it can be heart warming, but by the end of the film where characters are supposed to change, it just feels forced. The third act alone just feels forced and rushed, and the robots themselves which should feel like the forefront just seems to be shoved in the background for this father and son story. Maybe they were supposed to be shoved in the background, but I really wanted to explore the kid's robot, Atom, a little more but I never really got that. It never felt like a character to me.The kid (played by Dakota Goyo) steals the show. He is very good and well written. I might even go as far to say that the kid and the writer probably had fun with this character. I also enjoyed Evangeline Lilley's performance as Bailey Tallet. She delivered a strong performance and she was gorgeous to look at. Hugh Jackman (not his fault) just seemed too douchy in this movie. He's just a jerk to this kid and everyone around him throughout the whole movie that when it came time for his redemption, I just didn't buy it. There's also this forced emotion in the ending of the film, and me and my date both agreed it was pretty lame.Real Steel is just an average sci-fi movie that has an interesting concept that seems plausible but the execution of being a film just landed on the Okay Express. It's a shame none of my Michigan buddies made it in the film, but then again, maybe it was for the best.","6 out of 21 found this helpful.

All of these movies were guided by well written characters and strong story lines. In Real Steel the special effects are abundant; however, the wonderfully developed characters and the storyline are what make the film more than just Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots.Director Shawn Levy has put together a quality resume of family films, including Cheaper by the Dozen starring Steve Martin and both of the Ben Stiller Night at the Museum films. In each of these films, the central character is the father; in Levy's Real Steel, things are no different. In the film, Hugh Jackman plays former professional boxer turned ""trainer"", Charlie Kenton. Jackman's portrayal of the ""unlucky"" Charlie feels real; he's an everyday man, who's made mistakes in his life and learns from them. Having starred in three X-Men movies and a solo film as the now iconic Wolverine, Jackman's good looks and action hero status have been front and center. However, it should be noted that Jackman is also a very talented actor. Dakota Goyo, who plays Charlie's estranged son Max, gives a very fine performance of his own. Max's stubbornness and determination, both traits inherited from Charlie, help in bringing the two together for a common goal. Evangeline Lilly, best known as Kate from the TV show Lost, plays gym owner Bailey. Although given a back story and history with Charlie, the character as a whole is underutilized. The interactions between Jackman and Goyo are at times funny, serious, and engaging, which make for great father and son cinema.Having seen the film in IMAX, the movie was visually impressive. The action sequences stood out prominently on screen and during the boxing sequences, each landed punch was enhanced by the powerful theater surround sound. The robots in the film are ""pretty cool"", as my son put it a number of times. They are intimidating by their massive size, but incredible to watch in action. If technology ever advanced to the point that something like the WRB (World Robot Boxing) organization existed, society today would not be able to contain their excitement. Real Steel borrows quite a bit from Rocky; however it does so in a fashion that doesn't leave you feeling cheated or unsatisfied. Make no mistake, Real Steel stands on its own as a very enjoyable film. I anticipate we'll be seeing more of Atom and the WRB in the future.whether on screen or in real life.Grade: B+ visit our site at www.twodudereview.com","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

YES -- the idea is not original and has been kicked around a few times in the past century. But, let me tell you this .. NEVER have I seen an action/sci-fi movie with this much heart and emotional depth to it. As a hardened male ... even I had to hold back tears at times during the film. The screenwriters developed the relationships between the characters so well that as a viewer you will deeply care about all of the main characters ... and that INCLUDES the robot.With an 80 million dollar budget, you can expect top notch visual effects and expert direction. The movie easily succeeds on those levels, but it doesn't try to bog you down with excessive special effects and action. The robot boxing is simply the backdrop to an underdog story and the relationship between Jackman and his estranged son. That is where the story really grabs your emotions ... especially if you can relate to the sorrow of a dysfunctional family .. especially if you can relate to always being considered less then great by those around you ... if you've always been overshadowed by someone greater or have never lived up to your full potential ... as an individual in a world filled with 6 billion++ .. the reality is that most of us ARE underdogs wishing for one day to be great .... that's why this film hits hard on an emotional level despite being an action/sci-fi. I wanted Jackman and his son to succeed so desperately bad that I almost forgot it was a movie and that it was all fiction. When art imitates life to the point where it can bring you to tears .. that's when you know the art is great.Overall, the acting, direction, story, and visuals were all expertly crafted ... making 'Real Steel' one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time. YET ---- of all those who worked on this project ... I must say that I give the most praise to the screenwriters (who never get enough credit in Hollywood). They put on a screen writing CLINIC throughout the course of this film. Anyone who has ever studied fiction would agree with me and be able to realize why the writing is so great.In a word, this movie is pure GOLD and it will be nominated for more then one Oscar. 100% guaranteed.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It incorporates all aspects that a truly great film needs;emotion, action, drama. You name it its got it. I was sweating with excitement and anticipation most of the way through the film. It also really pulls on the heart strings. Great movie, best I've seen this year. Hugh Jackman really plays the part well and brings realism to the film through his boxing. The boy also acts great. Special effects are unreal and the robots are astonishingly cool. See this movie if you like transformers etc, but really anyone would love this film. I did, and am reeling from the amazing experience. P.S its definitely on to watch at the cinema as it needs the big screen to provide the spectacle and the atmosphere.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I wish that Hugh Jackman would do more films like The Fountain or The Prestige, that utilize his impressive emotional range, but even in a role like this he has such a great, likable presence that makes him enjoyable to watch and easy to root for. It's unfortunate that the writers had no idea how to write a child role and turned in a character that was right from the start doomed to be one of the most annoying things of the year.Dakota Goyo could probably give a half-decent performance under the right writer/director, but here he's saddled with a mess of a ""too cool for school"" kid that grates on the nerves almost immediately and only gets worse as it goes on (the scene where he grabs the microphone in the ring might honestly be the most annoying thing in film this year). Hard to care about the father/son relationship when I wish the son wasn't anywhere near the screen. The subplots with Evangeline Lilly and Kevin Durand are dreadfully thin and totally worthless, but in a film loaded with clichés it seems kind of silly to complain about a couple of smaller ones tossed on top.Still, in spite of everything, I think my graveyard low expectations helped me to kind of enjoy it for a while. It wasn't anything great, but it was some inoffensive, light and easy entertainment and didn't bog itself down too much with the clichéd melodramatic themes for the first hour or so. Then came the second hour which was pretty much one nauseatingly saccharine moment after another. By the time they did a slow motion shot of Goyo and Lilly crying while watching Jackman box, I had completely checked out and resigned to hating myself. On a side note, it was nice seeing Anthony Mackie in a small role just having a lot of fun after doing such serious stuff for the past few years.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

👨‍⚖️ Review : Children Love Robots and Men loves Boxing, what if a movie mixes these two elements. Real Steel is a Hollywood Action Fantasy drama starring Hugh Jackman and Evangeline Lilly. Its a futuristic action drama and there are tons of brutal (if gripping) scenes of robot combat, some of which gets pretty intense. The despite having great intense action scenes there is a touch of human emotions of the sweet drama this movie encapsulates while Hugh tries to reconnecy with his long lost son. Director Shawn Levy distinctively articulates a simple straightforward screenplay which flows like water and still intrigues us in those high intensity scenes if Robot combats.Hugh Jackman is flawless and he beautifully transforms from a reckless, irresponsiblean to a caring, honest and dedicated father. Dakota Goyo is praiseworthy as the son of Charlie (Hugh).Overall Real Steel is a beautifully blended story with poignant relationship of a father and Son and how he wins his sons respect by supporting him in his journey of Robot Boxing.
Beautiful And Engaging.. Dont Miss.

It has took me a long time to understand that but this movie help. you can learn a lot from watch movie like Real Steel. Many life lessons. Know that you have to be willing to take your bumps and lumps and keep going. These movie tell the story of the ultimate underdog. No one believe that he can make it. The Hero get the chance to prove the world wrong. This is about a man his son that he has never met before and a robot name Adam. They find these old robot and little do they know it would change there future and life forever. They take this training bot. He keep takes on the best in the w2orld and keep getting better. When they get really good have a chance to win it all. These movie is really good. I thought it was going to be lame. Then I show it and like to watch it ever time it come on TV. It is very good if you don't have to like robots to watch the movie. This is a movie that will speak to people that are look at as under Dogs.

This ""film"" is a Real Piece of Garbage, truly assembled from the scrap yard. It has just about every cliché Hollywood has to offer all humble jumbled together to create a sloppy sappy movie about a jerk father who suddenly reaches a moment of clarity and gets the hot girl, then insert robots and a soundtrack only Hallmark could produce. I seriously think the only reason they put robots in the movie at all was to lure people who enjoy sci-fi. Bad acting (sorry Hugh, we're cool, it wasn't your fault), bad script, and overall bad.....everything) In fact even the way the robots fight is ridiculous (they use remote controls). This movie is the illegitimate child of Battle Bots/Rock Em Sock Em Robots/and (insert any Hugh Grant or later John Cusack Movie.I'm generally fairly open-minded when it comes to movies, but I have no problem saying this movie is complete garbage.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It is infused with sci-fi, but that's what enhances the movie.In the future people fight large anatomically correct robots instead of each other. The cost is probably just the same; boxers get paid millions of dollars as it is already. Now a person can watch this gladiator sport guilt-free because some guy isn't getting his brains beat in for our enjoyment.Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a washed up robot fighter with debts. He has several loan sharks after him and his last robot got destroyed in the ring by a bull. His way back into the ring and into some money came via his estranged son, Max (Dakota Goyo). Max's mother just died and his rich aunt, Debra (Hope Davis), wanted to adopt him. Charlie would gladly sign over all rights to his son if Debra's husband, Marvin (James Rebhorn)--the money Debra married into-- would pay him $100k. That would get him back in the ring and out from under his creditors (um, loan sharks).Marvin would agree to the deal as long as Charlie watched Max for the summer while he and Debra go to Europe. Deal. Max stayed with Charlie, Marvin and Debra went to Europe, and Charlie got to buy a tricked out new robot to fight.The rest of the movie is a touching one about a man getting to know his son while also redeeming himself.The two of them made a good team to fight robots which brought them closer together. Like I said, it's pretty much your average boxing movie with a sci-fi enhancement which I think does wonders for it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

During his hopeful rise to the top, he discovers he has an 11-year-old son who wants to know his father."" My summary: ""Welcome to a world where a displaced former boxer must come to grips with his past career and create a new future in the robot boxing arena. Along the way, Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) learns what it means to accept responsibility and be a father to his son Max (Dakoto Goyo) by discovering that ""Real Steel"" is from the heart."" Plot/Storyline: The movie picked up the solid and refreshing idea from the short story ""Steel"" which breathes life into the characters and action sequences. Although, there was nothing mind-boggling like inception, Real Steel did have its humorous and uplifting moments that gave it sparkle and character! 7/10 Cinematography/CGI: Filming is the place which often makes or breaks a film after the storyline is concerned...Real Steel did not disappoint in this arena. The Animatronic robots built for the film and the motion capture technology were state-of-the-art. You started to even ""feel"" sorry for the robots that were getting pummeled into the ground. 9/10 Acting/Action: Acting and action sequences were another great element to this film. Hugh Jackman and Dakoto Goyo both act a great father and son duo. In addition, I really enjoyed the range of emotions: the tension, anxiety, joy, and even the cocky arrogance...You watch the movie and you will know what I am talking about. 8/10 Overall Shock and Awe: What is the last movie that you heard people clapping not once, not twice, but at least three times? Yes, my showing had an audience of parents, children, grandparents, and teenagers, and all of us were cheering and clapping for Charlie, Max, and Atom many times throughout the movie! 9/10Go ahead and take your family out for this one, its an inspiring film that will stick with you long after the show is over!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It won't win points for creativity or originality and many of the plot elements feel vastly familiar, but for those willing to accept that: it can be considered good mindless entertainment.Aussie-hunk Hugh Jackman delivers an appealing and lighthearted performance as Charlie: a bankrupted ex-boxer who lies, cheats and steals in order to avoid inconveniences. He devotes most of his time to robot boxing, even after owing everyone money and rarely cares about the people he endangers or hurts. When he's asked to take custody of his eleven year old son: Max (played with genuine affection by newcomer Dakota Goyo), Charlie is torn between having to abandon his selfish acts or loose the only real thing that's ever mattered to him.Skillfully directed by Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum), this is an uplifting tale of a man who finds redemption after discovering the importance of family, hope and forgiveness. It's also a unique character study that demonstrates how someone with a cold and cruel personality can have a change of heart after a good natured event has the ability turn their lives around.The fight sequences are exceedingly well choreographed and feel realistic and it was even rumored that real life boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard was brought in to portray the robots using motion capture technology. Jackman and Goyo are perfectly matched and you can believe the father and son chemistry that exists between them, but even more extraordinary is the touching connection Max has with Atom (the previously generated robot which Charlie and Max discovers and trains.)Even though this is one of those films where you can figure everything out before you watch it; the special effects are spectacular, the action is exhilarating and Jackman reminds us of how he became a genuinely charismatic movie star.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Purely a guilty pleasure. I felt like decades ago when I was a kid watching undemanding celluloid. No deep thought required.  No complex plots to follow.  No intricate twists.  Just a fun, feel good movie. More human relationship stuff than Transformers. A lot more cool special effects than The Champ. The robots were hyper realistic and surprisingly varied. Very creative. The soundtrack, which in any other situation I would have found distracting, worked so well with the on screen action that a found myself tapping/stomping my feet through most fight scenes.I really like Hugh Jackman in this. Very real. Very human. And very funny (at times). Obviously folks will talk about the kid with the big blue eyes. And he did a fantastic job at playing an 11 year old with a 40 year old's heart. Witty, tough, yet still vulnerable. I think a good role model for kids who see this. But Jackman belies the ""never work with children or animals"" saw. He's strong and affecting and definitely holds his own against the young heart throb.Certainly the robot boxing is too violent and painful for really young children. But the surprisingly low quantity of foul language and total lack of sex makes this a rare action movie these days that I think can be seen by preteens.It's certainly not going to be anyone's movie of the year. But sometimes it's okay to just be entertained.A simple joy. I smiled the whole way through.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie was filled with apt amount of everything : Drama, Romance, Fights, Father-son Relationship, Comedy etc. The Concept of futuristic Robo-boxing was presented and executed to near perfection with the advanced graphics. Another high point of the movie was its background score which provided the right kind of adrenaline rush that gets amplified on many an occasions. The best part of the movie were the ones wherein the shadowboxing was executed by the Robo- be it in the final round or Robo Dancing on the steps of the Wonder Kid played by Dakota Goyo, which certainly added the charm and innocence to the movie. The best part of the movie was when Hugh Jackman was fighting the last round having Robo shadow box in the ring against all powerful Machine Robo. This movie stands tall based on its strong storyline/plot, heart pounding Background score and Steel Plated power packed performances by the two central characters played by Dakota Goyo and Hugh Jackman. I am giving this movie a 9/10 rating. A good enough watch for all generations and especially to those who wanna see a Robo incarnated Rocky like the great Sylvester Stallone in the ring beating the Hell out of the opponent.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It has charm, heart, and is very care-free. It has a nice story and is just a nice movie. There really isn't anything to complain about really. Just a fun flick. What's more to say? The robots are great and the characters are neat too. Its a nice father-son story. Real Steel ain't a masterpiece but why complain? Maybe some things may bother you. Like, I noticed a bit of product placement, but that just makes the movie feel a bit more real and there isn't anything wrong with that, even if there are 12 foot robots. Real Steel is a nice, fun movie and the cast do a great job too. I say, go check it out. Bring some friends for some extra fun.On an A to F scale I give Real Steel, a B.Or for the sake of IMDb, an 8 out of 10.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Of course it's for anyone, but a father and son might be the best audience for this, that is if the father and son both like this type of movie (action). Hugh Jackman does a really great job with his role as the father of Dakota Goyo. At first he isn't really much of a father, but as the movie progresses he learns how to be a better and more existent one. I also really loved Dakota Goyo's performance as his son, his performance is very impressive for him being at such a young age at the time and it's very tough/ballsy. He's not afraid to stand up to his father and to tell his father, in a kind of harsh language, the truth. The chemistry and the father- son dynamic between the two of them felt very natural and it seemed to be very real. And it's absolutely crucial that that seems natural and genuine in the movie since a large portion of the film focuses on that. The visual effects are very well done and the film was well deserving of that Academy Award nomination. I really enjoyed watching this movie because it's so well written and well acted and the visual effects are so well done. If you have kids of an appropriate age, then I suggest watching it with them because it's really heartwarming at times, it's not just all action and fighting, there's a large part that focuses on the father-son dynamic and how they care for one another after a not so great relationship in the past. 8/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

You want a movie with plot? You want a movie that makes your adrenaline runs?Watch Real Steel then.Whenever people talk about Real Steel, the first thing that comes into their mind is probably Transformer. Some people are amazed by Transformer, though not to me due to its plot, but guess what? Real Steel is definitely much better than that. It has good plot (not very strong one, but good enough for its kind), good fighting scenes, and even some heart-warming moments too. The robots are awesome. The way they fight is just fantastic. Some of us have complained that the fighting in Transformer ends too fast, and the good side can always turns the situation around no matter how bad their situation is. That just looks too fake. But, not in Real Steel. You'll know it when you watch it. It is so much more realistic than Transformer.However, I have to admit, at the beginning of the movie, I thought that this movie is going to disappoint me. The starting is quite boring, honestly. But it picks up later. When the robots fight, you really feel your heart pumping. I even have an urge to stand up like the crowds in the movie, to shout at the fighting robots and cheer for them. If they have a 3D version, I'll definitely watch it. But too bad, there isn't any 3D version in the cinema.The weirdest part in the movie, to me, is probably Max, the son of Charles. Max is only 11 years old, but in the movie, he looks very mature. The way he thinks, the way he talks... Too mature. He looks like a grown-up more. That's just inappropriate.In short, this movie is definitely worth watching. I wanted to rate it as 7 out of 10 due to the character of Max, but it's really not easy to make a film full of techno stuff and good plot nowadays. Therefore, one extra point for it.Lastly, I just want to say, Max is just too lucky.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

But the excitement and the journey from where they were to where they are at the end was spectacular. A movie with numerous layers, Real Steel surely did succeed at all levels. The fight scenes were well executed- i was at the edge of my seat, clenching my fist and cheering all the while.It touched straight to the core- that i teared up in the end.

Fortunately, Hugh Jackman's excellent performance made him just redeemable enough for me to watch the second half of the movie after initially turning it off.The special effects are great, and watching the robots fight is exciting and fun.The writing is heart-warming if a bit predictable.Overall a fun and uplifting movie if you can get past the protagonist's many shortcomings in the early scenes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I knew a little about this movie beside this is about robot doing boxing etcetera etcetera, but from first scene I realized that this is not some CGI-vaganza with little to offer. This is something more.Hugh Jackman is really good as ex-boxer/estranged father who thinks he knows all about boxing robot business yet we sensed that he's such a looser all along. With the arrival of his estranged son (great Dakota Goyo) and ATOM a robot that really captures what human really is, he finally learns something more about his life and his purpose.And Evangeline Lilly, what can I say? She infused vulnerability, humility, and beauty at every scene she's in. I think in the future she will be one of A-List star, if not already happening.And did I tell you it is possible to cry during ROBOT movie? With Real Steel I can assure you that it is much much possible. It's beautifully written and executed. Every moment counts - something that Michael Bay should learn :) - and I can't wait for its sequel.BRING IT!!!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Part of this agreement was some money and to spend some quality time with him, which viewers know how it's going to turn out such as the rapport they build together as a result of partaking into ""Real Steel"". It attempts to hit plenty of sentimental notes without answering specific questions, such as how come adults do this kind of thing and not teenagers!

Relaxing on the couch with drinks and snacks we started playing it in our PS3... and next few hours I didn't speak a word but watching the movie, enjoying its every bit, the fights, and most - the characters. To my opinion, it is not just an action movie. Besides the bot-fight tensions comes up the tension of father-son relationship. I think at this point, this movie becomes a meritorious one. I just loved the characterization, the presentation of story (though the story wasn't an epic one) and the two main characters' acting was superb; especially the kid -- his acting was so naturally flowing and spontaneous, really blown my mind!

But what I got was much more, this movie is not only entertaining but it was outstanding. This is not a dumb movie, yeah the story is simple but it's worth investing yourself into it. Dakota Goyo who is a child actor was superb and did a fantastic job bringing out the emotion on screen and even for the audiences. Sometimes it really did feel like he carried the movie. I never cheered in a theater before but I was so very close to doing it, like really wanted to get out of my seat and cheer. Because the character development and the way it carried the emotions was so well done. This is a excellent family film that is a must watch if you enjoy watching movies. Movies like this is why I go to the theaters and it was worth every penny.

And character you think of one way changes after the story progresses. But Charlie was passable even for a prick since it was played by Hugh Jackman, since it's very difficult to hate that guy. To sum it up this movie is about robots bashing the hell out of each other in the ring. But it's amazing how for a movie like this it really does tugs on the heartstrings and will get most audiences emotionally invested in the characters and even the robot itself. Some may say this is a rip off of ""Rocky"" but I don't care since this movie was great to the point some of it's flaws are forgivable. This is a must watch and will be looking forward to the sequel, hopefully it will be at least as good as this one.8.5/10","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

You will be in love with this film too. Gripping action and fun all the way through. I had to register to the this site just to express my views as it is definitely going into my all time favorites. My kids loved it and well want a robot so if anyone knows of where I can get one please let me know ha ha. WATCH IT and you will see. Don't watch crappy copies this is worth the Cinema. The actors are great and it makes you come out of the cinema doing the robot moves and saying you want one of those robots. A sure all time winner and I will definitely be buying it on blue ray when it is released.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Right around this time an attorney comes to see him and tells him that his son is up for grabs as his mother died and he has to come to his court date to decide custody, he comes reluctantly and tries to sign over his son as soon as possible only to then realize that the family he is going it is wealthy and makes a back room deal with the father to take the son for the summer for $50,000 and receive the another $50,000 when they get back. As the story goes on they find fights and more bots and bond over the experience and I wont spoil the rest but its pretty good.This movie has all the key elements to making a good movie, good acting, a great story line, some personal touches, and a decent amount of CGI. I have to bring this up because the second I got done watching, something felt very familiar, and then it dawned on me, this movie was a combination of 2 other movies. Granted it was put together brilliantly but still if any of you have ever seen ""rocky"" and ""over the top"" you can appreciate that this movie was a perfect combination of the 2. So I have to say the director might have been watching a Stallone marathon one day and it hit him if he combines those 2 and throws in a robot it would make the perfect movie. Yes it did work the movie is a great success not to take anything away from it but the plots are very much like those 2 movies. 9/10 almost perfect except for the virtually unoriginal storyline.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

As it was I watched about an hour and decided I'd had enough. Even the well done CGI and Hugh Jackman couldn't save this for me; sappy, clichéd, and overacted in a very Disney sort of way.It's a father-son story about a former boxer turned fight promoter (Jackman) who trains robots after humans are replaced by them in the ring. Jackman also tries to establish a relationship with his estranged son Max while they assemble and train the next robotic champion of the world. As an FYI this is listed as a ""sci-fi sports drama"" which is a movie genre I can't say I've ever heard of before.11.13","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Even programmed controllers, voice command, and shadow functions. With all these parts to the robot they even made they have cool or extravagant exterior designs.

When he divorces his wife she re marries an older wealthier guy. When they leave on a trip and ask Charlie a favor to watch a kid he sees as a way to get easy money from them, and so with that money he receives he goes out and buys fighting robots.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

For the emotional part of the movie I must say it really got to me! As much as fighting robots are unreal (yet), the story is more real than it could be! I do not wish to write spoiler so I'll be as brief as possible by saying that this is mostly father-Son movie you have to see!Reviewers who write that movie is ""cheesy"" are unaware or to young to know that bond between father and son is something that is real and not movie-makers imagination!

The film didn't bomb but it was quickly forgotten. I seen Real Steel opening weekend and I own the DVD. Real Steel is a fun, charming sports film.The acting is good, maybe some people feel its mixed. Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo are a good team. If they didn't have chemistry, this movie probably would of tanked. After Real Steel came out, I assumed Goyo would make a few big movies but he vanished three years later. Goyo was a teenager so he needed to focus on his education and family.The story is predictable but I don't think its painfully predictable. Does anyone say ""painfully predictable?"" The film is cheesy but not extremely, it has the same tone as The Goonies and Back to the Future. The film is family friendly but not too much.The fights are intense hence the PG-13 rating. A few robots lose limbs which shouldn't scare anyone. The robots are mostly digital, animatronics were used here and there.Shawn Levy directed Real Steel, he's proud of the film. Levy and Jackman are interested in a sequel, they naturally don't want to rehash the film. Levy's latest film Free Guy which was just released on home media is a huge hit so Disney quickly asked for a sequel. I really enjoyed Free Guy but I rather see Real Steel 2.Overall, Real Steel is a fun, charming sports film. If you like Hugh Jackman, you may want to see it. Real Steel is family friendly but not too much. If you enjoyed Free Guy, you should enjoy Real Steel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

With a high level of drive and action, there is nothing terrible in appearance or in the style of ""blood splashes on the walls"". At the same time, a fairly good cast and a very well-made script.It is worth mentioning the special effects, which, for all their seemingly insignificance, nevertheless fit well into the overall outline of the film. So it turned out to be quite a decent adventure tape, actually for family viewing. Probably, it will be especially interesting for teenagers, especially considering the second main character.So I recommend it to all fans of good action in the movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I laughed it off like many other people as a Rock'em Sock'em Robots the Movie type of joke. I spent six months joking about how Huge Jackmon just tanked his career. Well time started passing and the trailers came out. I claimed ""well the bots look good"", but continued bashing the movie. Now normally when I bash a movie, I am pretty damn close to being right. But I was WRONG. Dead wrong. I took back every single negative thing I said about the movie. In front of my fellow workers. They all laughed at me, but they said that it was cool that I admitted I was wrong.Well...First off the effects and the boxing styles in the movie are solid. It filled me with joy watching the boxing in the movie. ACTUAL BOXING. Sugar Ray was a great man for helping them out with this.The plot is basic. Father messes up relationship with son...accidentally redeems it. Father son bond, and make a happy ending. You know the story...yes this is that story. We have seen it a million times, and well I am sick of it. But the performance from HJ and the boy, NAILED it. Normally I do not like child actors, and think they should simply be seen and not heard. (yeah its a crass thought but really most of them are annoying as hell and have ruined what could have been grate flicks). This kid. Dude didn't suck. He pulled it off. The chemistry he has with HJ was believable as hell. You actually care for both of them. Even when HJ is being a douche bag about everything. It matters. When the kid finds out that he was ""being sold"" of sorts...it hurts. Which brings us to the writing. Its pretty solid. I do not feel like their were useless characters in the movie. Now I am writing this review after it being a while since I last watched it, but I remember it being very tightly written. Then editing was solid. At no point did I feel like things needed to happen during a montage (even the montage) or in fast forward. Or deleted out right. Then comes ATOM he has no face outside of his 'eyes' and to be honest...It works. He felt like he was played by an actor and was performing just like the rest of the cast. The mo-cap is solid in the movie, and the team responsible for bringing him to life, should be paid again. For if ATOM did not work, then the movie would have failed. HORRIBLY. Yes the final fight is similar (very very very) to Rocky, but honestly...it doesn't matter. Simply because the main story line, the true story line, is solid. Now I am not a huge fan of the director, for I haven't cared much for his NATM movies, but he nailed this. I am very upset that we have yet to have a sequel, for their are lots of questions I want answered. And I do not want them answered because of plot hole reasons, or because things just didn't make smarts, I want them answered because their is a world here and that world has lots to tell...","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I remember how I used set aside furniture in the living room to create space for an arena. I would gather my toys in that arena, and our gang would have some fun. I thrashed them all around, pounded them against each other, and flung them against the ruthless ceiling. Things would be cooler if my stuff could do more than just withstand nonstop hammering, but it was a restriction that my imagination couldn't handle.""Real Steel"" is the giant robot action movie my inner child has been waiting for. It demonstrates deep affection for its robots by investing in aesthetic qualities that similar movies are indifferent to. Each machine is skillfully designed. All the robots enjoy such a specific shape, physique, color and theme that we can identify any of them upon sight. And because professional boxers were motion-captured to generate the mechanical fights we see on screen, the movements between these visually appealing robots are authentic and in harmony. Here is a good example of a special effects movie that doesn't depend on computers to do all the work.The world in ""Real Steel"" has reached a time where man is no longer permitted to box. The roars of the crowd appear to like the replacement of human fighters: huge, towering robots that are assembled to disassemble their challengers through brute force. Robot boxing has become so popular a sport that we see it being held in vacant alleys, dark warehouses, and luxurious stadiums. This is the kind of sport that I would prefer to watch from afar. You do not want to be in the front row, uninsured, when one of those massive robots gets tossed out of the ring.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/real-steel-movie-review/","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I thought it would be all brawn, but no brain. Surprisingly, this testosterone-filled film really does have a big heart amongst all the fighting robots. This movie plays big on family relationship themes as our protagonist struggles to maintain a relationship with his son.Shawn Levy's film is set in the future, where robot boxing has replaced human boxing. Charlie Kenton is a former boxer who found a beaten-up robot he figures he can use to get him back in the game. But to his dismay, he has a son he has to deal with. Despite their early struggles, they must rely on each other if they want to win.Hugh Jackman is good as always even if he is a bit grumpy. For whatever reason, I felt he would suddenly morph into Wolverine. Dakota Goyo was okay but I felt he was very annoying by the way he kept on screaming. The supporting cast is pretty good but I especially liked Kevin Durand who can certainly play evil as he did with his promoter role.Overall, this is a fun film to watch. Of course with sports elements being incorporated in the film, there are some clichéd moments. But this film is more about the father-son relationship and how it strengthens over the course of the film. The visual effects are great and I liked the robot designs and the way they combated each other. Believe it or not, this movie will try to play with your human emotions so tissues may be needed. I rate this film 8/10.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I get the impression that Hugh just kind of drifted through the scenes, totally uninvolved. His personal interactions all seemed somehow forced; as if he was somewhere else in his mind when he should have been focusing on his costars (who deserved better from him).The robot showed more genuine emotion. Child performer Dakota Goyo is a delight to watch. I laughed at just about every punchline he delivered (most at the expense of Jackman's character). Thankfully the film did not degenerate into a sappy love fest with happy ever after ending. The action was superb and the CGI was the best I have seen. The transformers movie franchise needs to take notice. The robots looked very real and the interactions with humans and other bots were just about flawless.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I think it is a rather good concept (at least far better than the Cowboy Alien movie), as it caters to a variety of audiences being an action movie with science fiction and a little bit of father and son family drama.All we hope for is a movie like this does not disappoint... And it didn't. Although the plot of the movie is nothing too bizarre or unexpected, but it met the requirements to be an enjoyable film. Typical but relatable, and definitely does not bore.Hugh Jackman was brilliant, and still possessed his charm in the movie. I do not recall if he had ever portray a father figure in a film. But after this one, you know that he could, although he was not really much of a father in the movie. Their relationship was more like friends. The kid or his son in the movie was quite good too, annoying at times, but he had done well with what his character needed to be.Director Shawn Levy's previous movies are certainly not unfamiliar to everyone (Date Night, Night at the Museum, etc.), but most of them were comedic. I believe this is his first attempt on serious action movie, and he has certainly done a good job. The actions were intense enough to keep us in our seats and at the same time he had successfully captured the emotional moments in the movie. No doubt he could deliver as his previous comedies were good too.If I were to critique I would hope that the dialogues in the end could be more touchy, or it could have extended a bit more, as Hugh Jackman never really commended his son as his son from the beginning towards the end. But overall, it is a great movie which lives up to its expectation.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It tells a story in which a previously absent and careless father bonds with his son, and his son bonds with him. It's a tale of setting lofty goals and exceeding them. And it's about a selfish, damaged man achieving redemption. Hugh Jackman is superb, and completely convincing as a formerly gifted boxer. The actor that plays his 12 year old son is great. Evangeline Lily is very good, and suitably attractive as his female friend who might be more than that. Anthony Mackie is suitably larger than life. This film, even just 11 years later, would not get made now, at least not in this incarnation. Everything out of Hollywood now has to depict broken homes, dysfunctional families, and men, especially straight, macho, masculine men, as bad guys and disposable, if not worthless. At the very least, if the movie was made now the son would be gender swapped to be a daughter, which completely defeats the object of the whole story. It's ultimately touching, and the climax is superb, rousing and uplifting. Highly recommended.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Neat, futuristic robot boxing tale undermined by predictable character machinations","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2720040/?ref_=tt_urv","Turfseer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0225436/?ref_=tt_urv","15 December 2012","'Real Steel' is based on the 1956 Richard Matheson short story, 'Steel', which was later made into a Twilight Zone episode starring Lee Marvin. You might recall in the Twilight Zone episode, Marvin gets into the ring with a robot opponent after boxing has been outlawed in the future. 'Real Steal' doesn't aspire to such tragic heights: here, the robots are merely controlled by their human handlers at ringside with WiFi-like control boxes.What 'Real Steel' does have is a solid plot. The New York Times may be correct in assessing that it is a ""well wrought out entertainment"". On the other hand, it's basically geared toward the pre-adolescent market with a very predictable storyline.My problem with the film are with its principal characters. Hugh Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, the former boxer turned robot trainer/manager who is pretty much a caricature of a dumb, impulsive, child-like man who's solely driven by material concerns. This is a role that probably would have been better played by a young Mel Gibson in his heyday. Here, Jackman tries hard but fails to make an unlikeable character, likable.Kenyon is unsympathetic from the get-go--welshing on a bet with the sleazy promoter, Ricky, and then skipping town. The dark moment of Real Steel's second act, when Ricky and his goons beat up Kenyon for failing to pay up on the bet, is indicative of why we're unable to root for Kenyon, even after two thirds of the story is complete. Even Kenyon can hardly protest, as the beat down appears not to be completely unjustified.And then there's little Max (Dakota Goyo), who Charlie accepts $100,000 for from the boy's wealthy aunt and uncle, in exchange for full parental custody. The precocious Max, for my tastes, appears to be a little too aggressive and confident for a preteen, and the sight of a father and son, interacting on just about the same level of maturity, comes off as more comical than realistic.The strength of 'Real Steel' lies in the escalating tension of the fight scenes. The robots themselves (most of them anyway), seem to be modeled on 'Transformers'; but Atom, Max's 'bot', rescued from a junkyard, is more a cross between the steely intelligence of a humanoid Robocop and cuddly Spielberg extraterrestrial.Perhaps the best of the fight scenes occur early on. In the opening scene, Kenyon's obsolete robot, 'Ambush', lives up to his name, when he's slaughtered by a real-life bull at a rural fair. Using the money he obtains from giving up custody of Max, Charlie purchases 'Noisy Boy', a secondhand 'World Robot Boxing League' (WRB) Japanese model, who also ends up as a pile of junk, while being roundly destroyed by Midas, the illegal circuit champion.After the discovery of the discarded 'Atom', an obsolete 'second generation' sparring bot, Max and Charlie try their luck in an unsanctioned outdoor meet, featuring a crowd of unsavory boxing enthusiasts who look like extras from a Mad Max movie. The spiked hair trainer with a robot called 'Metro', steals the show, as he attempts to take down Atom with great panache, but ultimately ends up having his own robot destroyed in the process.A montage follows with the media soon promoting Atom as the people's champion. With his growing fame, Max and Charlie obtain a legally WRB sanctioned fight with 'Twin Cities', a double headed robot, who Atom easily knocks out. This gives Max the opportunity to get up in the ring and challenge Farra Lemkkova and Tak Moshido, the Russian mogul owner and Japanese computer genius trainer, of the intimidating world champion, Zeus.SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD: To the writer's credit, the underdog Atom, does not defeat the physically superior Zeus. True to form, the world champion retains his title, winning on points. Still, Max and Charlie can take comfort that Atom is now the 'people's champion', and he was able to stand toe to toe with the champ.In the end, 'Real Steel' proves to be a real mixed bag. You have a great deal of variety in the various fight venues and a clever mix of actors in giant robot suits doing their thing, coupled with some excellent Avatar-like effects. But the overwhelmingly predictable tale of loser father redeemed along with an in-your-face, overenthusiastic pre-teen boxing enthusiast peddling his win-at-any-cost unwholesome wares, tends to turn this somewhat compelling narrative into a less than successful 'B' picture as opposed to a high-level, sci-fi fantasy entertainment.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

A robot film for the guys, a weepy modern remake of The Champ for the girls. But no. It doesn't work like that because the tears, feelings and relationship subtexts will alienate the guys and the endless violence will bore the ladies.Chick flicks and macho action films are not cojoined twins, no matter how much we wish they were, and while the modern world loves a politically correct idea like girls who love fighting and men who love ponies, in reality each sex invariably falls back on their comfortable clichés. Clichés for a reason. It might not make the post-modernists happy but men and women tick in different places and at different paces. Which makes Real Steel one whole heap of a confusing mess.First there's Hugh Jackman as the lady's favourite (see Australia) and the man's hero (see Wolverine). Perfect for the androgynous role of pathetic macho ex-boxer wild card romantic roboteer. Then there's the muscular chick from Lost as the owner of a boxing gym. Frankly I'm surprised they didn't plaster her in jailhouse tats and shave her head, but then again the ladies like a bit of glamour with their love interest. We learned a lot from GI Jane didn't we Hollywood.The robots are part Anime part Iron Giant and, bar the prevailing champion bot 'Zeus', seem ill-conceived and boring. We've seen better and with more imagination in recent years for these guys to make so much as a dent in the panel of memorable robotic CGI. D- definitely must try harder.On top of the confusion, there's the usual repulsive Spielbergian formula. Orphan kid, doe-eyed love interest, themes of redemption, family love, decisions of the heart and so on and so forth. It's all rather wearisome at this point in the second decade of the 21st century and frankly I'll be glad when the old school moguls retire their typewriters and we can see something new.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

And it's as juvenile and uninteresting as it sounds; this kind of premise could only work well in a quirky B-movie (I'm thinking of stuff like ROBOT JOX or the various Japanese flicks) as it feels staid and bland in a Hollywood context.Australian star Hugh Jackman works hard playing the main character, a boxing coach now fallen on hard times (gee, where have we heard that one before?). All goes well until he ends up saddled with one of those bratty kid characters, the type that American housewives seem to love while the rest of the world hates. From this point in it all gets very predictable, with good guys and bad painted in broad strokes and a singular lack of originality throughout.The highlights of the film should, of course, be the fight sequences, but I found them all very predictable. The CGI effects are excellent but it doesn't matter when the subject matter is so derivative and clichéd. You know exactly what's going to happen right at the outset and at no point does the film surprise you in any way. The really good boxing movies, like THE CHAMP or the early ROCKY films, are winners because they expose the heart of the fighters giving it their all. These robots have no character, thus the experience is a soulless one.","3 out of 37 found this helpful.

However before handing him over he gets to spend a few weeks with him and they come across an old robot which his son finds and fixes up and they start to win some fights.The film is cheesy as hell. Dakota Goyo is decent enough but the script makes him an irritating twerp, its not the actor's fault that the script is lame. This is a kid whose mum has just died yet he seems to be high as a hill of beans!The CGI and robot fight action is very good, I even find the kid dancing with the robot charming but it steals too much from Rocky. The climax even steals from the Ali v Foreman, Rumble in the Jungle.The film starts off very badly, Jackman's character is also charmless at the beginning and of course father and son do eventually bond.

But sadly it wasn't. It's a combination of 2 Stallone movies (Over the Top and Rocky) with a heavy side plate of Transformers and designed to be a very family friendly film. Odds on I guess since Shaun Levy directed.It's very well produced, has a great blend of CGI and animatronics and Hugh Jackman, who invariably turns in convincing performances, even among kids, animals, robots and mutants.What it doesn't have is anything original to say, outside what has already been said in the above mentioned 3 movies. We've seen it all before. Insufferably precocious kid, bonds with long time absent dad whilst driving around the countryside in a big truck (Over the Top), whilst overcoming obstacles to battle their way to the top of a robot boxing competition (Transformers & Rocky). It's overlong and almost remarkably formulaic in nature.The person I felt most sorry for besides myself was Evangeline Lilly, who despite being the female lead is reduced to playing a Burgess Meredith ""Mickey Goldmill"" type role, without the good lines. Her character Bailey is totally marginalised by the presence of the brat and is reduced to playing a reactive type character whose emotions mirror the fortunes of their bot in the ring. Any chance of building a worthwhile onscreen relationship with Jackman's Charlie in this way overlong movie, is dashed by the perceived need to build a family friendly movie based on the father/son relationship and their interactions with their robots.That's about the nuts and bolts of it folks. A $100+ million budgeted spectacle with not an original thought buried in its professionally presented, but oh so predictable format.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Just a few movies deserve it, but –this year– I've found out that Real Steel 2 is the only sequel I strongly wish it turns to be a franchise.I wasn't this intrigued by any other movie, and I don't think anyone else in the theatre had. Of course, that's what happens when big strong colorful metallic boxers come all together in an unrealistic arena in a not so far future.This is the kind of productions Spielberg needs to support –was it a sound editing nod over there? –. Impressive rounds of fighting robots, a funny dancing guy, and a plot--- A faulty boxer-promoter is paid to take care of his own obsessive, idealistic and videogames-expert son for a couple of weeks, while he tries so desperately to attend his dying career as a box-promoter to save himself and the familiar busyness he helped to destroy. And while he ruins it one again and was trying to fix it, he almost lost his own son almost, 'cause, odd enough, his son is saved by an entire short, old aged robot named ""Atom"", who was discarded and thrown away to a landfill. Full of gratitude, the kid recovers the machine and takes it with him, restores it and intends to introduce it to the boxing world. He soon would find out that his new friend as a big potential, but the only way it would make it to the top is if his father accedes to train it and promote it, forcing him out of the retirement as a –human–boxer and as a looser as well, giving him some hope as a promoter, as a father and a human being.It is not so hard, you see? And, if the plot doesn't work (it did for me), the action, the visuals, the editing and sound will. And, you know what? It leaves room for a sequel.There is some kind of Pokemón air in all that stuff of giving orders to a fighter, but it changes drastically at the very glorious ending, when the orders are not an option anymore.I had to force a friend to take me to this movie, and now I'm the one who's forcing him to stop hitting me with the piston combination. That is what I was talking about when I said ""excitement"". I thought many felt it when Rocky was defeating Apollo. That's what happens when you care about a character, the way you care about the main robot of this story, Atom.With any luck, this would become a franchise, and lucky enough, a good franchise. At least, there goes a good start for any trilogy.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I can say this movie made me feel like those times again. On the downside, Jackman's character was cast as just too predictable. You could just predict his character's actions throughout. The writers could have written his character as a more believable hard luck story. Overall, the movie was very enjoyable as compared to some of the ones this year. I would not recommend for for kids younger than 6 or 7. But OK for anyone else. No murder, no bullets, no swearing, and no sexual scenes. About as racy as it gets is some cuddling by Jackman's character seeking comfort and understanding.

With Hugh Jackman starring, It's got to be a fun cross between ""Transformers"" and ""Rocky."" Well, the answer is that it's not terrible. But it's not just a gentle homage to the two incredibly successful movie franchises, but a blatant ripoff. The ""Bots"" look exactly like they were stolen from Michael Bay's private collection. And the screenwriter, John Gatins, seems to be obsessed with Sylvester Stallone. You can almost pick out the scenes that were plucked from the pages of Rocky, Rocky IV & Rocky V. But in reality, ""Real Steel"" has its roots firmly entrenched in a far less glamorous Sylvester Stallone vehicle called ""Over The Top,"" a far-fetched yarn about a long-haul trucker who has to earn the respect of his oh-so-wise and precocious son (that he abandoned years ago) by entering a championship arm wrestling championship in a gaudy Las Vegas showdown. Oh, i forgot to mention that this arm wrestling trucker, named Lincoln Hawk (Stallone) tries to fight for custody for his son with the boys millionaire grandfather. Well, there you go, I just gave away the plot to ""Real Steel."" But lest I forget the most obvious ""Rocky"" ripoffs, a very beautiful Evangeline Lily plays ""Adrienne,"" Her deceased boxing-trainer father plays the ""Mickey"" role, young Dakota Goyo, plays the ""Robert,"" Rocky's son in 'Rocky V,"" and of course who can forgot the bad-guy champion robot is a dead-ringer for the evil Russian giant ""Ivan Drago"" in ""Rocky IV"" Just in case you were curious, he wears the same exact Ray-Bans that Stallone wore throughout the unfortunate movie ""Cobra."" Getting back to ""Real Steel"", for what it's worth, Hugh Jackman is one of the very few actors who can ""open"" a movie, but unfortunately, he has to fire his speech coach. Unfortunately this time around, his American accent is as transparent as Anne Hathaway's English (Scottish) accent in ""One Day."" I couldn't tell if his character, Charlie Kenton was supposed to hail from South Philly, like Rocky Balboa, or Brooklyn. And he was working at it so hard, that he forgot to act. He is very handsome and charismatic, and seriously has the whitest teeth I've ever seen, but I don't think he'll be playing Richard III any time soon.He's also built like a professional body-builder. I've been a boxing fan for most of my life and boxers (with the one exception of Ken Norton 40 years ago) don't look like that. Just Google any fighter from Rocky Marciano to George Foreman. Boxers, especially heavyweights, don't have have ""six-pack abs"" or bulging veins on their bulging biceps. Even check out Rocky, or as it's now known as ""Rocky I."" Stallone was a big hulking guy who looked like a real boxer, which is one of the prime elements for it's iconic success. It's only when Stallone hired a personal trainer to try to replicate the musculature of Michelangelo's ""David"" did he set a new absurd standards in what men should look like with their shirts off. Forget boxers, human beings just don't look like ""Rambo."" But at least Stallone has made a career of looking like that. When did a long-haul trucker whose days are spent looking for robot parts in junk yards have time or money to hire the same personal trainer. It seems as if every man who takes his shirt off has to look like an underwear model. Jackman was supposed to be playing a washed-up ex-boxer whose claim to fame is that he got knocked out by the number one ranked contender to the champion. They even talk about his extremely unimpressive fight record. And since his retirement some fifteen years before, he's been trying, unsuccessfully, to make a living at Bot-boxing, in which giant metal robots take the blows. Does he stop at a Gold's gym in every city that he passes? To add insult to injury, Hope Davis is frighteningly miscast as the sister of his son's mother who is trying to adopt Max. Anthony Mackie,who practically stole the movie from Matt Damon in ""The Adjustment Bureau,"" is electric as Finn, a small time fight promoter, and Evangeline Lily does as much as she can in the few scenes she's in. Most of the movie is the relationship between father and son, which is so predictable that it's a little scary.What I do find seriously disheartening is that Steven Spielberg's name is splashed proudly across the screen as the ""Executive Producer."" I think that the man who has directed some of the best movies ever made should be more choosy about where he lends his well-deserved stamp of approval to. The Spielberg name is a brand. If the man is known to be involved in a movie, one has to assume a certain measure of brilliance. Without chipping away at his bearded visage on the cinematic Mt. Rushmore, the best director in the past fifty years has lent his name as Executive Producer to at least a dozen movies, not the least among them being ""Men In Black II,"" all three ""Transformers"" movies, and ""Cowboys and Aliens."" Really?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

My biggest fear was that it was going to be another CGI eye candy extravaganza. Well, I am pleased to say it was not. There is a lot more story than just the robots fighting. The effects were a compliment to the story and not the main reason for the movie. In the near future boxing is taken over by robots. People who once boxed are moved out for people who can use the robots to do the same kind of combat. With the robots doing battle the fights can become a fight to the death only without the death. The story is about a washed up old boxer who is struggling to make a living and also reconnect with his son. This is a green light film.For more on this review please go to http://fatsamuraireviews.blogspot.com/","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Quite a positive statement that is being thrashed around within the service industry and the self-help books of today. Inspiration is the mother of all success in my personal experience. There is nothing stronger than the heart of a fighter. Commandeering the box office at an estimated $ 27.3 million in its opening week and knocking out ROCKY IV from the top spot at opening weekends in boxing movie history REAL STEEL changes the game of boxing as we know it. 127 minutes of REAL STEEL clashing at its hardest against the X MEN main man Wolverine without the adamantium. A movie that is true to its teaser campaigns, a movie that will move you and inspire you and even draw a tear. It certainly did make me cry and I am moved by the emotional plot that I forced to avoid purely to protect my manhood; yet I succumbed.Charlie Kenton a boxer by background is into robot boxing however is unable to catch a break. Loss seem to be following him where ever he goes and all his robot fighters end up being sold as scrap metal after being torn to shreds buy his opponents. Charlie who is irresponsible and callous in nature sees an opportunity in the death of his ex-wife to make some money by making a deal over the custody of his own son Max just so that he can find enough money to buy a new robot fighter. This does not give us quite the good image of Charlie being a responsible father does it? Much like Wolverine, stubborn at the core Charlie meets his match in his own son Max who ends up with him during the summer as a result of $ 50,000 business deal made over the custody. Father and Son reunited after 11 years as a result of the death of the mother and also as a partial business deal is not something that young Max does take lightly, after all Max is like his father ; Stubborn to the core. Losing all his money over one night in a fight, Charlie and Max rummage an old scrap yard stumbling upon a G2 robot that is built to take a hit but not to deliver one. Max who takes ownership for the robot cleans him up and asks Charlie to set him up with a fight. Hugh Jackmans' most successful role out of the X MEN franchise and VAN HELSING, it's quite appealing to see him fit into the role of Charlie and not carry any of Wolverine along with him. Most actors of Hollywood find it hard to shed off roles that are imprinted with their names. Daniel Craig, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are few people who will always be linked as Bond, Torreto and Connor. I am still awaiting the fate of young actor Daniel Radcliffe who will find it a challenge to shed of the Harry Potter that will hang on him for a long time. Why do you think Prime Time actors/actresses find it hard to make it to the big screens once they have done like 5 seasons on prime time. My point is that Hugh Jackman pulls this off and I didn't see him one bit as a Wolverine despite his characters stubborn arrogant nature which is required to the plot. The heartbreaker indeed is 12 year old Canadian Dakota Goyo. Indeed with a little bit Justin Beiber hanging in his hair this young guy brings the REAL into REAL STEEL. The chemistry between the father and son and bonding makes this movie different; it does take time to grow on you, yet it certainly will. Evangeline Lily who plays Bailey; Charlie's girl friend is indeed a vital character although her presence may be overshadowed with all the action of metal clashing on metal. Without Bailey I feel Charlie will never connect with Max and the beautiful Evangeline Lily delivers this gracefully yet with a touch of Kate from the Prime Time show LOST. Yet another example of how roles are imprinted into the celebrities. (If you have not watched LOST; it is high time you did).Once segmented by me as a director of comedy; I would like to retract my statement about the man behind the camera; Shawn Levy. With some great comedies to his name today he proves that he can also make you cry and he also knows how to put up a fight. Micheal Bay and Ridley Scott have been my favorites as of a decade and today Shawn Levy makes the cut.Title: Real Steel Directed by: Shawn Levy Starring: Hugh Jackman, Dakota Goyo & Evangeline Lilly Rated: PG13 Rating: 08/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"","","There's a Whole Lot Of Robot in There and More","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2655427/?ref_=tt_urv","Chrysanthepop","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3872142/?ref_=tt_urv","7 August 2012","Set in the not too distant future, 'Real Steel' tells the story of an ex-boxer turned struggling robot boxer promoter (in a world where robot boxing is a popular sport) and his estranged son who recently lost his mother. As his son takes an interest in robots, Charlie sees hope at a second chance in resurrecting his life. I was excited about the robot boxing theme and even though it did sound like another 'Transformers' type action flick (I was hoping it wouldn't be that bad), I wanted to see it.As a result, 'Real Steel' turned out to be a pleasant surprise. There's plenty of action, emotion and humour. The robots are awesome. They look great and the action sequences are brlliantly choreographed. The visuals are impressive. Even the beauty of the cross-country landscape is excellently captured. The development of the characters and the relationship between them is very displayed.Hugh Jackman's chemistry with Evangeline Lilly and Dakota Goyo is outstanding. This is among his better performances. Dakota Goyo too shines in his role as he delivers a balanced performance. Evangeline Lilly makes the best of her limited screen time and she is superb.To sum it up, 'Real Steel' is fine entertainment. It's always nice when a movie turns out to be a pleasant surprise. One of the better action films from recent Hollywood.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","Chix Chat on Film review: Rocky meets Rock'em Sock'em robots.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2501565/?ref_=tt_urv","EmmaDinkins","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27203490/?ref_=tt_urv","11 October 2011","The preteen young male missing a father figure and bonding with a robot story has already been done and I liked the Ah-nold Terminator II version much better, since he wasn't remote controlled. There are also some other distinct differences in the two films, Atom was not sent back from the future to terminate Max (Dakota Goyo), he was just a tin man with no brain, oh wait that resembles another story, and Max's father Charlie (Hugh Jackman) is very much alive, but possibly the most selfish person on the planet. We know from the trailer that the fight game has changed, that Charlie was once a pretty decent boxer, but lost his place in history to robot boxing, which is now the sport of the future. Max finds Atom who is a sparring bot in the robot graveyard and tries to get a foothold in the robot boxing circuit, for the most part so that he can spend time with his father. This film tried really hard to be a something for everybody story starting with the emotional connection from a father and son bonding, it gave us a road trip, special effects with some hard hitting robot boxing following the Rocky (every single one of them) roadmap of rooting for the underdog, even a dash of romance, and still it just seemed like something was missing. Maybe if Charlie had been a less flawed character, or if anybody in the entire film was likable on any scale of likability aside from Max. Ricky (Kevin Durand) was awful but I guess that made for a pretty good villain, Bailey (Evangeline Lilly) was a sad case and could have done so much better, and for my taste there was just not enough on screen time for Finn (Anthony Mackey). OK, so I liked two characters out of the whole bunch, Max and Finn. I just wanted something or anything from this film that delivered a tab bit more than expected. After having seen the trailer and then the movie it was of no surprise to me that there was pretty much nothing left to be desired at the screening. Because of my generous nature and because I thought that the robot special effects were reasonable, although if they had contacted the NFL and found out who designed their robot's movements, the bots would have moved a lot less clunky, I give it an amber light.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As we all know, Hollywood films make our imaginations run in their movies through their brilliant graphics. As for this movie, not much graphics are used compared to the other sci-fi films like Transformers and Terminator. This movie just focuses on two characters, a father and his son. The story also isn't very dragging and heavy, but brings a deep message about the bond between a father and son. The first half of this movie is a bit boring, but this is all covered up in the second half. Despite his age, Hugh Jackman puts his full effort in his boxing moves. Overall, a great movie and should be watched by all audiences.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This film took rock 'em, sock 'em robots to the next level (although I am really telling my age by even mentioning rock 'em, sock 'em robots, but who cares). I would be remiss if I did not mention that this film was way too long for my taste. There were several times that I wanted to yell ""stop the fight"". Did I mention that I am a huge boxing fan, but I was not a big fan of watching two hunks of metal go at it. I would have loved to have seen Larry Merchant or Max Kellerman doing the commentary. Thankfully there were not a lot of fight scenes which kept the film from being too boring. Director Shawn Levy is used to bringing things to life with his Night at the Museum films and I have to say when he added some human elements to the robots it did improve the films likability somewhat. Hugh Jackman (Charlie Kenton) is probably glad to get away from his Wolverine character for a while and play a role that is more realistic (although I hear that the wolverine will be back). I think the training that he did with Sugar Ray Leonard went a long way in making Hugh into a believable boxer. Dakota Goyo (Max Kenton) was adorable. I like the fact that he acted like a little boy should, but at the same time he was smart well beyond his years (kind of like he was when he played young Thor). I am really sick of the underdog, David and Goliath type of films, although you start to really like Atom, you really wish that he could somehow speak and make the film a little more interesting. I think that little boys will really enjoy this film, but this is one case where the adults will get impatient and start screaming ""are we there yet?"" The film just took too long to get to where it was trying to go. If you do not have anything better to do then I suggest you bob and weave your way to your local theater and check it out for yourself. As for me, I am going to take a standing eight count and give this film an amber light.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Aside from trashing one of the greatest action movies ever made, they accused Hollywood of resorting to using giant, fighting robots to draw crowds in. In the case of Real Steal, you could also say that. I just came back from this movie and it was much better than I expected.I was very weary going into this film. I was expecting more of a drama about self-courage and a reclaiming the top type of story. I wasn't expecting a whole lot of actual fighting; HOWEVER, it delivers. The movie does start of kinda of slow but picks up when they discover Atom. I also must say that the Max character steals the show; and for anybody unsure of this film, you get a little bit of everything. You get drama, you get comedy, you get action, you get a little bit of romance. And best of all: you get to see four solid fights. Of all the things that I enjoyed about this film; it does have two solid drawbacks. First: the sport revolves around boxing and I'm not a fan of boxing. It's a pretty talentless sport. Second: the ending is more than disappointing, it's straight crap. Withough giving anything away, all I'm going to say about the ending is that it's really not what you'd expect which is what makes it crap Overall, it's a great action movie for the whole family","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Did you see ""Harry Potter"" and not realize that Voldemort would get his butt handed to him on a stick? This was a very engaging and emotionally compelling movie, one that I thoroughly enjoyed even for the considerable theater ticket price. Well acted, funny, and touching, and when the climactic scene finally comes, I was as emotionally invested in the outcome as I was when Rocky stepped into the ring.If you want a good time at the movies, then this movie is well worth seeing, just don't go expecting a remake of ""Citizen Cane"".

Don't get me wrong this certainly isn't the best movie ever, the best movie about boxing ever, it's not even Hugh Jackman's best movie. The story heavily borrowed from other movies such as Rocky, especially down to the ending. The movie had a basic story, but some kind of magical element to it, like the children's movies us in our 20's watched back in the late 80's and early 1990's. I remember seeing the previews for this movie, and couldn't get over the fact that it was going to be terrible, but like the small, under powered robot, ATOM the main emphasis of the movie, it surprised me and delivered. I may not see this movie again, but I will remember it as a solid, well put together fill because of the spirit and work put into it's writing, acting and special effects. There was a lot of visual things to look for, especially product placements of the future, Xbox 720 caught my eye during the final fight against the champion Zeus. References from Rocky I picked up: A down on his luck boxer gets the chance of a lifetime, The Champion is named after a God (Apollo in Rocky and Zeus in Real Steel)It borrowed elements from other stories like the robot was configured and put together again in the film, a comparison and observation I do not think was intended for us to realize, more of a coincidence.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This story is not about a human boxer coming back, but about a boy and his father who did not know each other, getting to know each other and themselves. It pulls on the heart strings a little too.The whole thing about Atom in this story, is that he his just like the Max, a object that was tossed aside because people felt he was not good, but in the end you find that the robot is just as lovable as the little boy. You also find that Charlie (Hugh Jackman) is a man that started out just trying to survive but has learned that there is more to life, and that he is a good father to his boy that he more or less left behind.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

When the sport of boxing turns lethal and uncontrollable, people place their bets on fighting robots that were programmed and designed to take on any heavy weight clanging bot. As silly as its premise may seem, Real Steel does have its heart behind the ambition of the father-son team to make it big in the Robot boxing arena. Hugh Jackman stars as the retired boxer now controlling scrapyard robots in underground matches, Dakota Goyo impresses with a realistic depiction of the nerdy cool kid and as for Evangeline Lilly......it's just sensational to watch her on screen again!Charlie Kenton (Jackman) knows boxing. Although, he's a bad bet when he enters the arena with his robot. Charlie tends to get carried away and enters matches his robot is destined to lose. Bailey (Evangeline Lilly) fixes up robots for Charlie but is quite fed up of his losing streak. That's when a blast from the past, in the form of Max (Dakota Goyo) enters Charlie's life as his son whom he never claimed. With a financial arrangement, Charlie agrees to keep Max for 2 months before handing custody to his ex-girlfriend's sister. Now, Max isn't this quiet masoom kid and he knows all about boxing robots. To the extent that when they lose a match for Noisy Boy and revert to the scrapyard to pick up pieces that would make a robot, he discovers a sparring bot Atom, who has the unique ability of shadow boxing where it mirrors the actions of its trainer. Max is attached to this robot and stays up all night to program it, to train it and engage it for combat. After a few underground fights, Charlie and Max realize the potential of the sparring bot that can take a lot of beating but can ultimately dish out brutal punches when trained and prompted. For Charlie, Atom's crusade to the big league is an opportunity to repay debts, make money and build a bond with his son whom he now gets attached to. For Max, it's like living a dream. His reaction to witnessing Zeus for the first time, spending hours with Atom trying to communicate with him and dancing to the ring with Atom to the tunes of Eminem and Timbaland are the movie's most memorable moments. Evangeline Lilly looks gorgeous even in a non-glamorous role as a scrap robot fixer in her father's gym. Her rage, disappointment and elation are depicted in a natural manner and the sweetness in her eyes says much more than the dialogue writer could ever come up with....Beyond the human elements that make up the heart of the movie, there is a whole lot of adroitly created robot action in the arena as Atom takes punch after punch, only to follow Charlie's direction at the right time and deliver the winning blow. The action sequences, even though CGI created, are just outstanding to behold. While Atom takes numerous blows, Zeus' compelling presence can make you wince under his might. You will be cheering and hooting like you did when you watched 'Rocky' and 'The Fighter', only to realize that you are cheering for artificially created robots on screen. Such is the reality in the creation of Real Steel. Characters are lovable, Robots are overpowering and their action is breath-taking. Director Shawn Levy knows when to bring in a fight and when to limit it. The effective use of an upbeat background score enhances the thrill of the fights. The movie might have concluded on a melodramatic note but it kept you engaged throughout and that's what really matters. With some excellent performances by a superb star-cast and surreal CGI work on the Robotic action, Real Steel triumphs in delivering entertainment with a metallic punch. 8.11 on a scale of 1-10.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Although there are some movie about robot (eg. Transformers, Iron Man, etc), this movie give new story about it.For me, it's kind of my dreams come true. When someday we can have gadgets with touch screen and transparent board, when we can move something just with voice recognition. I'm one of gadget freaks :DIn the story side, the funny side was entertaining. And it's really nice when drama take apart too in this action movie. The idea of robot boxing was great either.That's my review.

"","","Hugh Jackman and Fighting Robots, what's not to like.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2504374/?ref_=tt_urv","richard-s-bellamy","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23507077/?ref_=tt_urv","17 October 2011","Real Steel is a film in the robotic mould of a Rocky movie, but outside this metallic framework is that of a tale of father and son reconciliation. Levy uses the robots to symbolically and figuratively represent Jackman's character, a failed boxer who would sooner sell his son for cash than face his responsibilities. Life has left him on the garbage heap. It is that same garbage heap that his son, played with likable enthusiasm by Goyo, revives an abandoned robot and in turn his relationship with his father.The robot, Atom, is in every way the underdog, but despite his size he can take a beating. Jackman is the robot in every sense. As the father and son connect over the success of their fighting robot so too does Jackman's confidence grow. His skills become the robots skills as their robot possesses a unique ability to shadow and learn from Jackman's boxing expertise. As the film progresses, Jackman and his son reveal their robot's innate value and in parallel Jackman's own value as a fighter and a father is uncovered . He fights back against the odds and at the crunch point realises the real fight is to fight for his son.As is expected the father son tale is played against the typical boxing scenario as seen in Rocky. The underdog rises to fight the colossal champion. The fights, which are choreographed by Sugar Ray Leonard, have a genuine sense of the sport behind the robots. The part CGI / part animatronic robots have the right sense of realism to make it credible to watch.Real Steel is an enjoyable watch and as expected from Spielberg as Exec Producer the film as the production value and emotional resonance to make you want to invest in Jackman. Jackman is, as always, immensely watchable and turns a character, who under another actor's control could be obnoxious to the point of audience disconnection, into a likable rogue. Lilly is a pleasure to see acting again in the supporting role and gives a genuine barometer for the type of man Jackman is portraying. She aids in the sense that here is a man on the garbage heap and only a person who can see beyond would attempt to salvage him, just as she and his son do.The boxer and his mechanical shadow overcome the odds and his own failings and its fun to go along on the ride.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"","","Despite the flaws, Real Steel is a fun ride.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2510009/?ref_=tt_urv","leecjaster","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24281952/?ref_=tt_urv","28 October 2011","Hugh Jackman is one likable guy. It's a gift. Jackman, despite all odds, has retained his ability to somehow give a memorable performance in a movie that is far, far better that it should be.Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots Real Steel is a family flick with impressive visuals, real characters, and fun to spare. Yes, it's horribly cliché, filled with sometimes groan-worthy dialog, and includes side stories that are little more than afterthoughts, but it doesn't matter. Real Steel is going to entertain everyone between the ages of 10 - 15, and it keeps enough redeeming qualities that anyone over that age can sit through it entertained and surprisingly involved.Real Steel follows Charlie Kenton (Jackman), a former boxer known for his never-say-die spirit, dealing with life after his professional career in the ring is over. Charlie is hopping from town to town trying to make ends meet fighting robots. Charlie lucks into a situation with his son, whom he left a decade ago, enabling him to get some quick cash and get back in the ring.With his son Max along for the ride, the two slowly share a bond together, born out of Atom, a scrap yard robot whom the pair has decided to put in the ring for one last shot at the big time. As Max dances and showboats pre-fight, Charlie slowly teaches the robot some fighting moves. Atom becomes a minor sensation, and eventually leads the pair into the professional ring, all of which leads up to a showdown with the undefeated champion of the the robot boxing world, Zeus.There's no spoilers here, everyone heading into Real Steel knows exactly where the narrative is headed. The slightly flat love story between Charlie and Bailey, played by Kate Evangeline LIlly (the daughter of the boxing gym owner who gave Charlie his big break), is devoid of chemistry, but there's plenty of likability and smiles. There's no tension to the backdrop of Max's situation in regards to his mother's untimely death which thrust him into Charlie's life, nor is there anything palpable to the thrown together characters Charlie comes into contact with on his way to betting his robot in the ring.But none of that matters...The shortcomings of Real Steel don't matter in the end, because director Shawn Levy has managed to craft highly immersive robot fighting sequences that are amazingly destructive and brutal. The machines look fantastic on the big screen, and the attention to detail in the fighting sequences keeps the audience wanting more and more.The only reason the action works, the most surprising aspect of the entire production, is that Charlie and Max are well rounded characters with an interesting dynamic. It's hard to imagine this from the trailers and previews, but they absolutely work on-screen in capturing a growing bond filled with moments of strain and light-hearted joking.Real Steel is the case of a director with nothing to say (Levy also directed Night at the Museum), telling a story that doesn't have much to say which hasn't been beaten into the ground before, and doing it in a way that is so fun and enjoyable its sickening. Real Steel simply works, despite all its flaws and corny moments, Real Steel contends until the final bell.OverallNo matter how amazingly terrible Real Steel could have been, it's given life because of Jackman and the impressive visuals. Real Steel simply wouldn't have made it without a stellar looking robot fighting sequence or two, and Jackman is able to somehow take every line of corny dialog and add... something. One time it's a smirk, another time its the vague hint of a tear, and then it's that Jackman smile that lights up the entire theater. Jackman is the MVP of Real Steel, even if he is on an 8 - 8 team come playoff time.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Not much screen time for Evangeline Lilly, but she made a good eye candy.The trailer really doing injustice for this movie. At first, I thought its just another robot smash 'em up movie, but I was wrong. The connection between father and son is what carries this movie.The special effects were nice and not overly done.

I was expecting it to be far into the future but soon found it was in a time similar to ours, the not to distant future. It's a world you can relate to with characters not much different to us. Real Steel was a pleasant surprise and had a Disney feel about it, it's really worth seeing. It has a great story line, interesting characters and great robot fighting scenes. They were well-done and the Robots look so real and you would hardly tell that it was all done by computer simulation. This movie is a heart felt father son story between and ex boxer Hugh Jackman and his son Dakota Goyo. I wouldn't be surprised is there is a sequel and I'd definitely go alone and see it.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

When the two have no luck with a fantastic robot, they go to the junkyard looking for parts, and Max finds an old sparring bot that turns out to be a force to be reckoned with. I though the movie was very entertaining. The CGI really made the robots and the sets come to life. I also thought that the acting was good. The disbanded relationship between Charlie and Max was not only well acted, but provides some well-placed comic relief from the fight sequences. Although a great movie, it does have some violence. Even though the robot fights aren't gory, the fighting is some replicable behavior that little kids could bring home. I recommend ""Real Steel"" for kids 13 and up, and it deserves a 4 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Daniel Menengaz age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Imma be honest this isn't anything speical or out of this world. But it's a good flim enough to get lost in and waste your two hours.Good story but a predictable plotline with some minor flaws. But I will give my props for making a movie on robot boxing I mean who thought of that before. Great visuals, the robots looked really cool and the music was great with a mix of hip pop and country. The acting and writing were pretty good, with a kid as a lead character I thought it be a bit cringe but it isn't surprisngly. The characters are solid, you got the lead characters and decent supporting characters and antagonists.Overall an enjoyable movie.

OK, so there are no points for guessing if Jackman's down on his luck robot boxing promoter Charlie is going to change his ways by the end of the movie. But for a good forty minutes of the film, you'll probably find yourself wondering how the hell the director, screenwriter and star are going to make a single audience member give an ounce of sympathy for this most unsympathetic of schmucks.But in good old Rocky style, you will undoubtedly be cheering on the underdog when it comes to the David vs Goliath robot boxing match that is the climax of the film.The central relationship between Charlie and his estranged son Max is believable as is the setting of the not-too distant or unfamiliar future. Kids still have daddy issues (especially kids who have dads like Charlie) and all that seems to have changed is that robot boxing is the sport of the future.The robots are a brilliantly seamless blend of puppetry and CG effects and when Max discovers a battered boxing droid discarded (as he once was by his own jackass dad), the plot kicks into motion.It's an enjoyable but predictable ride with Dakota Goyo impressive as the justifiably antsy kid. Jackman carries the film with his detestable Dad and a surprisingly convincing character arc. Lost's 'Freckles' (Evangeline Lilly) is wasted in a very similar way to her recent cameo in The Hurt Locker. She needs to find a new agent that won't leave her cheering on the action from the side lines.The robot fights are realistically rendered but it's the father-son relationship that makes this film the real deal. Great for families. It's out 14th October.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.
