"8","/10","A mindless must-see.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3163721/?ref_=tt_urv","planktonrules","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2467618/?ref_=tt_urv","16 January 2015","I usually don't watch action films. They just aren't my sort of thing. However, my daughter insisted that I watch ""Pacific Rim"" and I was feeling absolutely horrible when I watched the film, as I had just gone through some painful surgery that morning. So, to take my mind off my aches, I gave it a try. And, thankfully, it turned out to be exactly the sort of tonic I needed--entertaining and crazy fun. While I didn't see it in the theater (the best way to see this type of movie), I did see it on a very large screen at home and watching it on a small screen is practically a waste of time. For once, I loved that a film has eye- popping visuals, explosions and action--and it manages to deliver an entertaining experience without leaving you feeling dumb for having enjoyed it--a problem too often associated with movie of this style. Well worth your time.","95 out of 105 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The drift is strong with this one","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5926492/?ref_=tt_urv","Darkside-Reviewer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur100147162/?ref_=tt_urv","22 July 2020","Pacific Rim really surprised me when it was first released in 2013. My initial thought was that this was just gunna end up being another movie about Colossal sized monsters similar to Cloverfield or Godzilla only with a Hollywood big budget and while it shares some similarities to Godzilla it does stand out on it's own with it's unique monsters and awsome robots plus with the movie being directed by Guillermo del Toro it has a unique style to it that only Guillermo del Toro can bring to a movie.Pacific Rims story isn't a particularly complicated one but it's certainly got some interesting ideas. When the world is invaded by Colossal sized creatures known as Kaijus mankind bands together creating a defence against the Kaiju in the form of Colossal sized battle robots known as Jaegers each unique in style and armed to the teeth which are each piloted by two pilots who control the robot via neural interfaces the only problem is both pilots must be drift compatible meaning they have to be to link minds and create a stable neural link to be able to control the Jaeger during this both pilots share each other's memorys, feelings and thoughts. The Kaiju begin appearing faster than Jaegers can be assembled so with time running out before there are more Kaijus than Jaegers to fight them the last few remaining pilots prepare for a final assault on the portal the Kaijus are coming from.The movie is like a mix between Godzilla and Power Rangers only a lot more adult and with much better effects. The Jaeger robots look amazing especially when fighting against the Kaiju monsters. There's plenty of cool action scenes which show the Kaiju monsters being shot, blown up, punched by robot rocket fists and even decapitations.The characters are likable and interesting my favourite characters personally are the two mad scientists who dissect and study the Kaijus while they are meant to be the kind of comic relief of the movie they are very funny and likable both arguing over scientific theories and trying to prove each over wrong.I highly recommend watching this movie if your a fan of movies that feature Colossal sized monsters crashing through city's while fighting with Colosal sized robots with swords, guns and rocket fists. This isn't a movie intended for kids in case your wondering this movie is definitely for a more mature audience even though the synopsis for the movie sounds like it was made for kids who watch Transformers cartoons.","42 out of 46 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Fun popcorn flick from a reliable director","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3057887/?ref_=tt_urv","Leofwine_draca","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0482513/?ref_=tt_urv","29 July 2014","PACIFIC RIM is Guillermo del Toro's tribute to the kaiju and Japanese sci-fi movies of his youth; you know, the ones involving giant monsters trashing cities and huge robots sent out to protect mankind. I had an inkling he wanted to make this movie after the giant plant creature in HELLBOY 2; well, now he has.And this is a lot of fun, a decent popcorn flick for a change and a film that's well made enough to erase memories of the disappointing TRANSFORMERS movies. It's a great Hollywood tribute to Japanese cinema, filled with all of the wonderful effects and super-sized action that you'd hope for. Del Toro is one of those directors who hasn't made a bad film yet; you can always rely on him for entertainment.Sure, the stuff with the human characters isn't as interesting as the giant stuff. But at least we get plenty of British actors in the cast (Burn Gorman, Idris Elba, Rob Kazinsky, Charlie Hunnam) which keeps it fresh and interesting. The CGI effects are excellent, as you'd expect, and while the storyline is very predictable, that's not the point. The point is to deliver huge bouts of destructive action, and that's what del Toro does. And it's a lot of fun.","26 out of 30 found this helpful.

It is not just drama or social commentary. It is not something that can be measured by terms like ""latest and greatest"" or ""cutting edge"". This movie is not Man of Steel or Star Trek into Darkness where there is a child-like obsession with being ""taken seriously"" by adding grotesque violence or depressing overtones. This is not Transformers 3 or the Hobbit where special effects and action scenes are a cluttered mess of ADD rave parties that try to up the excitement with jumpy editing. THIS IS A SINCERE MOVIE.Sure it has lack luster actors, but they are mixed with some fine ones as well. Yes this has giant robots and that is the main reason to see the film, but they are not just jingling keys in front of us. These action scenes have atmosphere. The fights are exciting because of anticipation and build up. This movie (while very flawed) should be a model example of popcorn entertainment. I came in, saw some good fights, and got a happy ending without bullshit. This was the kind of fun I remember as a kid.This is a movie (strangely enough like John Carter) that should just be enjoy. They may not have had the best plots or most original stories, but they had substance that can honestly be felt. Genuine love for what they are doing in the film and real effort in making us as the audience part of that fun. They can be dumb or dull, but it feels more like a circumstance of a rushed schedule or odd-ball casting. It feels like Hollywood at its best since they just want us to have a good time.I not only hope for a sequel, I hope for loving imitators who don't aspire to pretentious greatness (Rise of the Guardians), don't have something to immaturely prove (Man of Steel), and actually have their own story to tell even if its derivative (Star Trek into Darkness is not only a Rip-off of Wrath of con, but it is practically a sequel that is DEPENDANT on it).This is not the degradation of film, this is the much needed laxative in a world of fast edited adaptations, sequels, and reboots with emo endings.","49 out of 64 found this helpful.

It had a lot of potential. And when the movie concentrates on what we are all here to see (giant creatures and robots beating on each others with oil tankers and smashing through skyscrapers) it is very successful. But when things get quiet... less so. Too much time spent on ""Top Gun"" like fighter pilot shenanigans. Not enough nuance in the characterizations. An ultra linear plot with few attempts to confound expectations. The acting isn't bad - and isn't required to be great in this sort of film - but it is nothing special either.

The only defence against them is to kick their heads in with massive robots. Cool! Starting so quickly out the blocks I expected this to be a fast paced action movie.It really isn't. About every film element ever used, runs its course before the inevitable big battle. You get a fall from grace, a rivalry, a training period, a love story, forgiveness, reconciliation, etc. etc.The battle sequences are epic, the monsters and robots are amazing, Kids especially will love them, and the action goes on and on.The dialogue is cheesier and hammier than a 60 foot pizza monsters, and coupled with the extended scope of this film can make watching it gruelling if you are not instantly gripped.This will keep any kids gripped for hours (nearly three of them) but if sci-fi isn't your thing get comfy and bring a pillow.","43 out of 58 found this helpful.

"","","Enjoyable monster movie that doesn't pretend to be anything else","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2899043/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","3 November 2013","Part of the reason I have started completely sitting out the summer blockbuster season is that I just got fed up going to crowded noisy cinemas to be disappointed by films that promised much but deliver just basic effects and little else. With Pacific Rim though, it is hard to feel this way because it is a film that has never pretended to be anything other than a Japanese inspired monster movie where big robots hit big aliens in a way that pretty much never makes much sense when you think about it. The plot is explained very quickly at the start of the film and we then jump into the future where the war we just learned about is reaching a peak. From here we have some doubt, some lessons to learn, barriers to overcome but really what we have are big special effects punching each other. And it works.It is easy to wring one's hands and say that blockbusters are the death of film, but all things have a place as long as they are done well and this is at least an honest and fun film. I say honest because it has no pretension to it – it is plain and simple a monster movie with a very big budget behind it. The effects are good, with good monster design and generally a sense of fun and energy to the deliver. Of course it is just effects hitting other effects but it works for what it is and at least does this well – unlike other films that would aspire to more but yet can't even do this with any skill. The action sequences are large and fun throughout and the soapy drama doesn't get in the way at all. The film is loaded with references which I mostly got – the voice of GLaDOS being my favorite one.The cast are not particularly famous but it doesn't matter since the effects are the stars here. That said I thought they did a good job, in particular I enjoyed seeing Elba, Day, Collins, Kikuchi and others in their various roles. Del Toro continues his love of all things geeky with this film and in terms of direction it looks good, with plenty going on but never not being clear and engaging.It isn't a brilliant film by any means but it is a straightforward one that is honest with the viewer. Robots punching monsters – that is all that is promised and on that it very much delivers. If this sounds like your thing then this will hit the spot no problem.","16 out of 21 found this helpful.

It seems to hide away as we get older, but was always strong and persistent when we were children. We could sit down and really make something out of nothing physical, or tip our toy-box all over the floor and just go mad. Pacific Rim is Guillermo Del Toro at his most unleashed. He's been given the toys for his sandpit and has gone completely bonkers, but he has also created a sense of wonder from completely nothing.The plot is simple. Kaiju (monsters) from another dimension break through to ours and wage war on the planet and us humans must do what we can to stop them. So we build giant machines called Jaegers. General audiences are doing the worst thing by comparing this to Transformers or Battleship simply because of some simple image traits. Well I'm here to tell you that you're way off and also working comparisons in the wrong league. Del Toro has crafted an insane amalgamation of Sci-Fi, old-school thrills, special effects and brilliantly entertaining set pieces that all meld together in beautiful harmony, with just enough satisfying human moments and arcs that carry a nice balance of emotion and camp. It all blends well with the loopiness of it all. Its Guillermo Del Toro's trademarks turned up to 11, all while going nuts and having fun with his toys.There's just so much to love, that not even some minor pacing problems or a couple of sub-par performances can destroy the experience. Mainly its in the lesser background characters, but for me I'd say that Charlie Hunnam doesn't quite shine in the lead. He's certainly more than commendable, but he just doesn't break out here. Idris Elba steals the spotlight with a look and a bellowed delivery and its amusing to watch and Rinko Kikuchi has such an incredible skill with her mannerism and in her eyes, that's its a shock that she isn't in more films. Ron Perlman comes and goes and works his usual incredible moments.Pacific Rim is triumphant above the rest of the blockbuster herd. It knows what is missing from the norm and just goes crazy with it. Its a big, giant load of awesome fun. Prepare your jaw muscles, because you'll be smiling throughout.(Hint: Stay a couple of minutes into the end credits for an awesome additional scene)","475 out of 763 found this helpful.

This opening does a great job in conveying the scope of a film which is big, not just regular big, but like, Jason Biggs in 1999 bigg. entering the cinema from a world where these events rarely occur is initially a lot to throw at the audience, but it's handled so effectively and without tongue in cheek that it quickly becomes a world I had a blast experiencing. Maybe it was the incredible effects shots of robot related destruction used as a throwaway shots, but what I think really sold the opening sequence and the film as a whole is the enthusiasm Del Toro clearly has for the story he's telling.The cast is essentially a rogues gallery of TV's better dramas playing variations on roles they've nailed in the past (see: Elba, Hunnam and Klattenhoff) and some inspired casting of It's Always Sunny's Charlie Day who, as should be expected provides some effective comedic relief. Added onto this the score comes courtesy of Ramin Djawadi who's masterful use of themes on Game of Thrones is carried over to this film for some great emotional cues and many a rad motif courtesy of Tom Morello on guitar.It's appropriate Del Toro has a Frankenstein adaptation lined up as a follow up project as Pacific Rim can at times can feel stitched together from all the sources of inspiration the film has. This comes from many areas such as Japanese manga, the personalities of the actors from previous films and the imagery of robots destroying buildings which transformers ran into the ground. But Del Toro succeeds time and time again at allowing these disparate elements to fit together believably by way of some very confident filmmaking. I could easily take issue with the oft hammy dialogue and macho relationships but where the film succeeds in other areas and revels in creativity trumps the dissatisfaction one could take from these scenes. I also found Hunnams character a tad lacking in charisma and internal conflict but whatever, it's not the end of the world. Oh wait, yes it is hahahaha The films successes go beyond its imagery and continued invention within battle scenes as the script is very economical when it comes to pacing. The films battle scenes are so engaging and exciting due to clearly established stakes present which left me devoid of the ""action fatigue"" transformers loves to throw my way. And although the Kaiju battles seem to never be in short supply, the film essentially follows the rule of three when it comes to battle sequences and left me oh so satisfied.In conclusion, I give it points for being one of the funner summer blockbusters in recent memory, for being an original property and for its sheer tenacity to exist which all amount to what is just a darn good time at the movies.","473 out of 792 found this helpful.

I thought I was going to the theater to seeing two hours and eleven minutes of giant robots piloted by humans fighting giant aliens. Just about the first hour of this movie makes it more than a mindless action movie. This movie focused on the backgrounds of characters for a while and used character development to make us care about them more. That worked for some of the characters.The acting in this movie as about average. Some of the performances were better than others. Some aspects of actors' performances were better than others. Charlie Hunnam was more of a lower quality performance. In some parts of the movie, I wasn't convinced he was really Raleigh Becket (his character in the movie), because he wouldn't say some of the dialog with feeling. It was like he was just reading lines some of the time. He had a bit of a British accent in the movie, but it seemed like it was only in affect in a small number of scenes in the movie. I don't think that anyone has a British accent in only a few parts of their life, so that makes it a bad thing. That bring up another performance: Idris Elba's. He had a better British accent than Hunnam, but it still only seemed to be in affect some of the time. Also, his acting performance was good, but he wasn't able to put enough stress on words at times. When Stacker Pentecost (his character) was supposed to put deep feeling into his words, Idris Elba wouldn't be able to put enough feeling into the words. Other than those things, his performance was fine, though. Rinko Kikuchi, who played Mako Mori, had the best performance out of the all of the actors I can think of. She didn't have any accent problems, she was able to put enough stress on words, and I was convinced she was Mako Mori. Her performance was good.I couldn't find any problems with the writing in this movie. I didn't look for any problems in the writing, but it seemed realistic. In some parts, it seemed it little far fetched, though.The CGI in this movie was great. It really didn't seem like nothing was there. All of the images blended in with the aspects of the scene. When there was almost nothing but CGI, it seemed like they (the images) were real. The only time I would really tell if there was CGI (if I didn't already know) if it was compared to an actual image.Now, for the things I went to the movie to see: the action sequences. The action sequences were just CGI's fighting each other. I thought the sequences were great. They were very exciting and exhilarating. The sequences also didn't happen as much as I thought they would, but more would've been less, I think. It might have been like 'Man of Steel', where the action took a long time to get old. Here, the sequences never got old and they stayed exciting. The action was even better than I thought it was going to be in this movie. There's a clear reason for almost everything which causes less thinking during the scenes. Several points to the film for the acting sequences and events.About the first forty five minutes of this movie after the title came up were character background and development. It did introduce characters and tell their purpose in the story, too. It was interesting at first, but it got old after a while. There was some drama, but it was just slow. I don't know why this movie wanted to be slow in the beginning. Some action movies have been slow in the beginning, but it just didn't work in this one. For the mood of this movie, the logical thing wouldn't be to be slow in the beginning. Being like this almost only takes points away from the movie. Knowing so much about the characters did imply different tones of the movie later on when things would reflect on the character's past. The slowness of the beginning of the movie didn't only consist of character background buildup. Only about half of it consisted of that.'Pacific Rim' has great images and scenery, barely-below-average acting, average writing, amazing acting sequences, very deep characters, and is well done, but has some bad performances and some boring parts. It was very exciting, had explainable events and aspects, and had a good story. I very much recommend this movie and might buy this movie on DVD when it comes out. My 8/10 rating means 'Pacific Rim' is really good.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

"","","Monsters vs. Mechanical Monsters","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2829635/?ref_=tt_urv","aaronjbong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22836725/?ref_=tt_urv","11 July 2013","""Pacific Rim"" is a highly explosive, exhilarating, exuberant, energetic, and exciting hell of a ride. When I saw the trailers, I knew the action sequences would be massive in scale, but the film just blew me away because the scale was just incredibly enormous. Every action sequence in this film was just mind-blowing. Unlike ""Transformers"", this movie has a real sensible plot. Giant monsters (known as Kaijus) are the extraterrestrial beings that are currently ravaging Earth. However, they don't come from above the atmosphere, instead they come from beneath us. A portal in the bottom of the ocean serves as the method of transport these Kaijus use to reach us. These Kaijus are arriving one by one, and as they do, they increase in size. They're so massive in size (I reckon they're bigger than Godzilla) and the amount of destruction they cause is just indescribable. But the humans don't stand around doing nothing. They build their own monsters, gigantic robots known as Jaegars, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked by a neural bridge. This allows them to synchronize their movements. However, despite these mighty Jaegers, the seemingly bright future for the humans turn dim as they begin to lose the war against the Kaijus. All of this was clearly covered in the prologue, quickly but properly. Now that seems like a basic plot, but I can tell you that there's actually more than that and the story is deeper than it looks from the outside. ""Pacific Rim"" provides sensible explanations for the phenomenons that occurred in the film. Now I'm not a genius or a scientist, but the explanation is logical. The characters. Our protagonist is Raleigh Becket. He's had a bad time after his partner and older brother Yancy died in a battle against a Kaiju before. But he's recruited by Marshal Stacker Pentecost to pilot one of the four remaining Jaegers. His new partner is Mako Mori, a Japanese girl who wants to be a pilot to avenge the death of her family. Becket's and Mori's Jaeger is the American-made Gypsy Heart. The cast behind the characters were great too. Charlie Hunnam was terrific as Raleigh. Idris Elba gave a commanding performance as Stacker. Rinko Kikuchi rocked as Mako Mori. The chemistry between Hunnam and Kikuchi was excellent too. But I have to give special credit to Ron Perlman (who previously played in del Toro's ""Hellboy"" films) as the black marketeer Hannibal Chau who makes a living by dealing with Kaiju organs. He has style and charisma. I also loved Burn Gorman and Charlie Day as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb and Dr. Newton Geizler, respectively. Their chemistry was absolutely perfect and these two were just amazing. The visual effects were undoubtedly incredible. Everything was mind-blowing and the gigantic scale of the action sequences allows you to be fully immersed into the scene. And the sets were extremely magnificent and glorious. I did not feel any sense of boredom when I was watching this film. Even the drama scenes were enjoyable too. The scenes where explanations were uncovered were exciting too and the music is a prominent part of this. Guillermo del Toro also did a great job in his directing because I gradually became supportive of the Jaegers and every time they fought, I rooted for them to win. I became immersed into the movie. Every time a Jaeger was in trouble, I was rooting for them to get back up and fight back again. I wanted them to smash the Kaijus to pieces. ""Pacific Rim"" is just simply awesome. Now, it may not be for everyone, but if you love action, giant monsters, and giant robots, you'll definitely love this. Or if you're just trying to have some fun, watch this. It's got both brains and brawn. Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: ""Pacific Rim"" is an amazing and explosive ride that is plenty of fun to watch, accompanied with dazzling visuals and a coherent plot.","281 out of 498 found this helpful.

The narrative itself is based on Japanese monster (kaiju) films, and - while paying homage to the classic 'style' - manages to be very modern and fairly grounded in reality. Pacing is good and the story has a set of well-placed twists, accompanied by some interesting character development. The casting, on the other hand, is not great, but does not detract from the experience. In contrast, the direction is fantastic. Guillermo del Toro does a great job of making the large and scary feel huge and terrifying, without making a mess on-screen. Several great touches add to the 'epic' feel of the film, such as the detail on the hide of the kaiju and the fantastic sound effects. Coupled with a great musical score, this film would be one of the best this year. Sadly, there is a small problem that stops this film being fantastic, but great instead: the scientist sub-plot.Two scientists are in the process of finding a new way to stop the kaiju, and they manage to be fairly useless and rather annoying. They have a fair number of cheesy lines, which left me wishing that their sub-plot had been left out of the film. Nevertheless, Pacific Rim is still very good, and definitely worth watching. I give it an 8 out of 10.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. It was somewhere middle of the road for me. The good: Set Design, The effects(The best I have ever seen), 3D, Idris Elba, Ron Perlman. The Bad: The Script, Bad Casting.Charlie Hunnam is great on SOA, but he is pretty much a one note actor. He has no charisma at all in the film and is boring to watch. Rinko Kikuchi while pretty to look at, comes across as a Asian stereotype. Her and Hunnam have no chemistry together at all. For two people that are suppose to be link they sure don't act like it at all. Charlie Day good god, I guess he was suppose to be the comic relief. But he comes off annoying and most of his scenes could have been cut and would have improved the film.To be honest I found it over long and just OK. Which is a shame because I love Del Toro and really wanted this to be a huge hit for him. I think It really comes down to casting, as bland as the script is some actors with chemistry and charisma would have gone along way it make it a lot more enjoyable.So there you have it.","34 out of 64 found this helpful.

And Pacific Rim, for what it set out to accomplish as a sensational blockbuster, reached its aims for what I wanted. When taken in total, it may not have much more or less action than a Man of Steel, but it is much smarter, or just more creative and skilled and knowing of its audience, in layering out its action set pieces, and even in the broad strokes it takes as, basically, a B-level Saturday matinée flick. Del Toro cares about these characters, or at least tries to, deep down, and can show some of that like with the Asian pilot Mako Maori.Is any of this deep? I'm still not sure. Does it need to be an artistic meditation on the cancelling of the apocalypse? Maybe another watch or two of five - because there will always be a part of me that can keep a hold on to an inner 13 year old - will bring that into focus. And aside from the monsters-and-robot work, which contains such good sights to behold, weight and depth to the designs, and the know-how to pace the action and to let us see it – in 2D, anyway, I didn't bother with 3D so I can't speak to that experience – there's some just good fun dialog (Charlie Day! Ron Perlman!!) and a sense that, 'Yes, this is a Godzilla experience, but we can still make it EXCITING'. So much of what I wanted this summer and only got in smaller doses (look at the end of the article for a bit on that) was in full-bloom in this production, which had a 190 million budget and the money looked like it was up on the screen, and not just in the CG but in the big sets and technology, and a story told by a Big Kid that would only hope the rest of the audience can genuinely feel like Big Kids if they aren't young already.In other words, the director accomplished what Michael Bay has, over and over again, failed to do: inspire wonder, and put some basic thought into the process itself, in story and craft, and without a large dollop of cynicism.","10 out of 12 found this helpful.

Battle L.A., Battleship, last Transformers movie (was it the 9th? 11th? I forgot!), District 9 (yes, it was horrible too) etc..So when I've heard about Pacific Rim I thought ""oh no, not another one"" and ignored it. Then, I saw the ratings and some reviews here on IMDb. OK another confession now, IMDb also let me down lately because people were voting like they've never seen a good movie or good script. Go look at Dark Knight Rising's IMDb rating, for God's sake! (my right eye began to twitch involuntary when I thought of Dark Knight Rising again.. aaarrrgghh) But then one day destiny did the job for me, here I was having nothing to do with spare time and an imax cinema with Pacific Rim. I looked at other movies, Wolverine - check, I've already been to, good movie. Red 2, check - it was great fun. World War Z, unfortunately check, waste of time. Pacific Rim? OK, why not? After 2,5 hours the lights were on again and I was sitting with a big grin on my face apologizing from everyone who worked for this movie. This is really amazing folks. This is old skool fun! This is really better than last 5 years' alien invasion movies all together! This just popped out from 80's with 2010's technology. Do not miss it! And try to catch it on imax 3D!

Yes, I am a geek. But that is not the whole point. If you had the excitement of watching anime movies of robots vs monsters in childhood, this is perfect movie for you. The Kaiju monsters design reminds me of Godzilla's villain monsters combined with Cloverfield monster, xenomorph (Aliens), and TRON. As for the Jeager robots, I'll let you to decide whether they are good or very good. :)To watch this movie I needed to change my mindset to be like a 10 ten year old robot geek child, like 29 years ago. Because if not, you will feel a lot of question marks and disappointment through this movie. The story is quite predictable. The plot and pace are simple enough for children to understand. And the nerd and geek professor appearances are a bit annoying for me. But hey, that what is all about: to celebrate the childhood memory of robots vs monsters.Overall, the movie is great for robot vs monsters anime fans. It's not even close to that horrible Michael Bay's Transformers.","189 out of 320 found this helpful.

What's wrong with her face?! She does not know how to smile, does she? Then the robots. Come on. These huge machines are unable to leave deep impression on audience. The fighting scenes are of great chaos-sea water, buildings, robots and monsters mix with each other so that I could only tell that something is moving in the screen.

Was this another transformers? Godzilla MK2? Well, it was actually a pleasant surprise in many many ways.Narrative: Nothing to fault here. The story line is solid and cuts strait to what's important instead of burying us in years of back-story and needless contextual rubbish. Its a pretty strait forward affair with not may surprises it must be said, but the beauty really does lie in the simplicity with which the story is both crafted and told.Effects: This is my only gripe. I predominately wanted to see this film for the effects, and don't get me wrong they are utterly beautiful at times, but stylistically, its like someone has taken cyberpunk, steam punk, a little bit of blade runner, star wars and some minority report, scattered all that on a table and picked little bits blindfolded to recycle. There are moments of utter utter genius in the concept design that I think we will see cropping up in many a sci-fi from now on, but as a whole, it has no governing style which visually, i found both confusing and a little annoying...Cast and characters: Not much to say here really. There's not going to be any Oscar nominations but neither are there any terrible scenes. At times some of the main characters feel a little wooden and under-developed, but in a film predominately based on action, its not a huge issue and anything it lacks it soon makes up for elsewhere.Conclusion: Its worth your money at the cinema, and judging by the press not many have been parting with hard earned cash to see this, which is a real shame. This film has some real intelligence to it which I think earns it a viewing and better press. Imagine everything you hated about transformers, well this is an antidote. From start to finish it is very entertaining and deals with a disaster scenario in a very refreshing manner. If you going to watch anything besides Elysium, I would suggest this. I've given it seven stars, but if this turns out to be the classic it very well could be, I'd imagine most will be giving it 8.","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

One was giant monster movies such as Godzilla and another were giant robots. So this movie would have been right up my alley. It still is something I wanted to see as it is also very anime like in the way it plays out. It has an anime inspired look and also add the Guillermo Del Toro factor and you end up with one very cool action movie featuring giant mechanized robots fighting huge monsters that were even given the name they have in Japan, Kaiju. Granted, it was not perfect as the look of the film was spectacular and the action grand, the story just was a bit to by the numbers and the acting at time serviceable and at other times a bit like they were not being directed to do nothing more than to open and close their mouths. Still, Del Toro is more of a visual director in my view as I enjoy the first two Blade films equally, liking the first one's story better, but liking the overall style and look of the second better (Del Toro's).The story has the earth under assault. Some sort of rift has appeared in the Pacific Ocean and huge beasts are coming through causing havoc. At first, it is believed to be an isolated incident, but it turns out that these things keep coming. The earth reacts by building huge robots called Jaegers to combat this monsters. The Jaegers turn the tide momentarily, but the monsters that come through keep getting bigger and adapt their fighting style. A man who used to partner with his brother, piloting a Jaeger called the Gypsy Danger is working on a wall that is being erected to stop the Kaiju as the Jaegers and their pilots are being killed at an ever increasing rate. This man lost his brother and now is asked to team up and pilot the Gypsy Danger for one more mission to close the rift and stop the Kaiju from entering our world.Like I said, the film has great visuals and that is the star of the piece. So much so that I still give the film a nine despite the many flaws with the story. The robots look good and the monster pretty cool too as one of the monsters near the end even sprouts wings and resembles the Gamera nemesis Gyaos. However, I wish they did a bit more to make the monsters look a bit more distinct as the robots look all different, but the monsters tended to resemble one another. Still, there are some great fights and as I said with a Del Toro film it is usually the visuals that are the highlight and they do not disappoint here.So a fun movie to watch, at one point the pilot of the Gypsy Danger activates a rocket on the arm to make the robot punch harder and I was thinking ""Rocket Punch!"" from an anime I had seen as a kid. If they could have added a bit more humor to the film it would have been a near perfect film for me. The ending was a bit to predictable too. Overall, the experience was satisfying and I am a bit sad to see this film not doing better at the box office here as I would love to see a sequel mainly due to curiosity in how it would play out. So a very nice film, to bad it did not come out when I was younger.","16 out of 22 found this helpful.

This is a movie little boys imagine when they are young, playing in their sandbox. It's quite easy to see why Del Toro was attracted to such a film. It clearly shows in this film and I don't think many directors could handle a film such as this with such love and dedication to their craft. Del Toro really knows what audiences want. So is Pacific Rim his best film? No defiantly not, not even close. Is it at least a great film? No it's not. Pacific Rim however is entertainment at it's finest. It's difficult for me to rate a film like this . Pacific Rim has flaws. The human characters are pretty much awful, and the movie is cheesy as hell. I must also say 3 characters in this movie were probably some of the worst characters I have ever seen in a film. The main female, and the two scientists were just awful. However the real star of this film is the giant robots and the evil monsters. Del Toro knows how to entertain an audience and by god does he do it here. The action is fantastic and does not get to crazy like some Transformers movies do. This is the type of movie where you need to have your brain off and just be entertained. If you hate movies like this, then don't even bother checking this out, but if you have watched similar films and enjoyed them, then you will be all over this. Pacific Rim manages to be original and familiar at the same time. However because of Del Toro's fantastic direction and storytelling it's easy to overlook Pacific Rim's failures. This one redeems the mediocre summer films. Rating: on a film reviewers scale i would say 7.5 out of 10. However it's Del Toro i'm biased and above all rounding up to a solid 8 out of 10. Final Rating: 8 out of 10","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

"","","Pacific Rim Christmas came early....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2829748/?ref_=tt_urv","btnthx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44621954/?ref_=tt_urv","11 July 2013","How do you make the perfect summer movie? I'm not just talking about the best action movie, or the best summer comedy, just the perfect summer movie. Some would say lots of explosions, while others may say a good love story will always do the trick. Every year all the studios aim to release a movie that you will want to see, their idea of that great summer movie. Well I think Guillermo del Toro has figured it out, Robots Vs. Monsters.I know it can't be that simple, since we already had a Cowboys and Aliens that didn't live up to expectations, but for me ""Pacific Rim"" really is. We have always looked to the stars for where we thought visitors might arrive on our planet one day. But, what if they come from deep within our oceans? That is the question ""Pacific Rim"" poses. Creatures called ""Kaiju"" have attacked the coastal cities in the Pacific. They start in San Francisco, and then attack cities like Manila, and Cabo. After conventional weapons have little effect, the world's governments decide the only way to fight monsters, is to build monsters of their own. The ""Jaeger Program"" is born, where giant robots are built to fight for mankind. Each Jaeger is controlled by two pilots, who control each hemisphere in the Jaeger. The Jaegers become mankind's best weapon against the ""Kaiju"" and their only way to save the planet. This is what ""Transformers"" could have been, if del Toro had been at the helm instead of Michael Bay. While Bay has always been a visual director, he just does not have the complete package like del Toro. This movie has something for everyone, but above all it is just fun to watch. It is a big and loud, and one of those movies that are made to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. For everything that is wrong with summer movies like ""After Earth"" and ""The Lone Ranger"" this movie gets it right. This is not a movie that is going to get praised for its great story, even though it has a decent one. The main selling point is ""come see this movie and you get to see giant robots and monsters beat the crap out of each other."" I mean really after that what more do you need? I went in expecting to see one of the best movies of the summer and walked out not thinking any different. The performances for the most part are not anything special, except for every time Idris Elba is on the screen. Given the best dialogue, including a speech any football coach would love, Elba just commands your attention. In a world where sequels rule, we should embrace originally. I mean didn't we say all we needed to say with the original ""Grown Ups""? Do we really need another? I say this weekend when you go to the movies see ""Pacific Rim"". It's like sequels are the ""Kaiju"" and this is your chance to command a Jaeger and to tell the world you are tired of all the ""Kaiju"". And if you can, see it 'IMAX' big, because this movie doesn't do anything small.Brian Taylor http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Whilst overambitious, trying to fit a mammoth plot into only two hours, Pacific Rim still delivers.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2829470/?ref_=tt_urv","tinjo23","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20459976/?ref_=tt_urv","11 July 2013","I was so excited to finally see Pacific Rim. An ambitious idea, carried with big-budget effects, brought to you by master director Guillermo del Toro. I was pumped. I was hoping for brilliance, something to truly give other blockbusters a run for their money. The result, as I had to expect, was not that of a game changing event. Instead, it was more or less, directly in between Greatness and Disappointment. There's a lot to love about Pacific Rim, but where it suffers seems to be mostly through a lack of confidence in it's own premise.Like last years Les Miserables, Rim makes the unfortunate error of trying to fit in 3-4 hours worth of storytelling into just over 2. Which is unfortunate considering Pacific Rim's all round story is it's strongest element. Though taken from many sources, (and by no means, anything that original) it shapes a very well-throughout premise with detail and conviction. In it's execution of this however, is where the film stumbles. Mainly, the plot feels rushed. Condensing years of devastation and development, into one short montage (the first five minutes of the film covers the entire ark which Pacific Rim is built on: the first encounters of the Kaiju, the initial attempts to stop them and finally, the culmination of the Jaguar program) which contains enough story to fill an entire other movie. The intro then concludes with the untimely destruction of one of, what seemed to be, the human race's final salvation. From there is where the movie actually begins. Now while that's an interesting (somewhat ballsy) approach, this structure causes Rim to feel much smaller in scope than what it actually is. This story is HUGE as a concept and it should have translated that way. Unfortunately what is shown is both giant in scale and unjustly short. The film is set over a small amount of time, considering the attacks have been going on for years and though it covers many key events in the Kaiju war, it never really feels like you've been delivered the full picture.Now, on the positive side, if you focus your attention to what is on display, Pacific Rim excels. It flows with both confidence and conviction. Expecting a lot from the maker of Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 2, del Toro delivers with a lot of what made him great (even if you're mostly getting del Toro, the action director). The design of both Jeagar and Kaiju are brutal and majestic. The world in which Rim exists is one where any previous del Toro film could fit in with comfortably. Beautiful design. As well as that, being this is del Toro's first real entry into mega blockbuster territory (Hellboy 2 was big, but nothing close to this) there was initial concerns that maybe he would be out of his depths in bringing the all-out-brawls to the big screen. Luckily, he delivers there too.The Jaguar vs. Kaiju assaults are stellar, even if they're not the defining assault on your senses you were hoping for. When the standoffs begin, you are returned to your childhood, reminded of why you loved seeing things go bomb in the first place. It's big, it's exciting, it's unpredictable (well, some what) and it's just so must fun. Delivered, also, with a sense of peril for the characters, which is arguably the most important thing when creating great action. Which, for that, requires a group of characters to which you need to feel like giving a damn about.Though things have been said about the people of Rim, I found them to be well-rounded and developed. Though not reaching the arks of previous big-screen franchises (The Avengers, The Dark Knight), everyone is given enough to go with, to at least earn the right for us to care about them. The standout being Mako Mori played by Rinko Kikuchi who holds the stand-out scene of the movie, when she first steps foot inside the cockpit and co-pilots the Gypsy Danger... While on the other side of the hemisphere, Charlie Hunnam, taking leading position, brings the usual tough guy, stands-for-everything-right solider, with a delicacy that makes it feel more realistic than movie realistic. Supporting casts deliver also, with the always great Idris Elba doing well with a small role, while Charlie Day is much less annoying than what you may have previously anticipated and is convincing as the fumbling, genius scientist. And of course the always fun to watch Ron Perlman as shady, black market dealer Hannibal Chau. If you take Pacific Rim as a great action/adventure story you will find much to appreciate in it's delivery. Though, were it to have the self-confidence to deliver it's premise with more conviction and pacing, it could have been the best action film of the year. For what is on display however, there is very little to hate. Guillermo del Toro has done an exceptional job at bringing this mammoth concept to the big screen and delivering in, close to the way I had hoped. In the end, what you're left with is a great, thrilling experience that confirms that big robots fighting big monsters is actually a great idea for a movie.","174 out of 316 found this helpful.

Reviews were mixed, and those who disliked it (some of vehement) were particularly vocal.This said, being someone who has found much to like about some of Guillermo Del Toro's previous films, especially the brilliant 'Pan's Labyrinth' and who cannot go wrong with actors like Idris Elba and Ron Perlman in the cast, I watched it anyway. Admittedly there are flaws here and they are quite large, but at the same time 'Pacific Rim' also does a good deal right.Starting with what 'Pacific Rim' excelled with, it is an incredible-looking film. The cinematography is immaculate, the editing slick, the set/production design audacious and with a suitable amount of grit, but the star visually is the special effects on the robots, which are mind-blowing and some of the best in recent memory. The action and spectacle is exhilarating stuff and keeps one glued to the edge of their seat, they're big and over-the-top but that was what the film was going for and it succeeds wonderfully. The music score fits very well and has several energetic and haunting moments, though occasionally some intrusive ones.Del Toro does a fine job directing in the action and succeeds in maintaining the silly fun that the film was aiming for (being apparently a homage to the old Godzillas). The film does know what it's trying to be, often has some efficient pacing and target audience is never questioned, which puts it above a fair few similar blockbusters. Not all the acting is great, but there are good performances from a commanding and coolly macho Idris Elba, a expressively understated Rinko Kikuchi and an always reliable if underused Ron Perlman.Charlie Hunnam is rather bland though in the lead, while of the failure that is the comedy double act of Charlie Day and Burn Gorman Charlie Day in particular is incredibly irritating and there are some very off Australian accents (especially from Robert Kazinsky, which keeps coming and going, often speaking in his own accent). 'Pacific Rim' also has some cringe-worthy and vomit-inducingly inane dialogue and paper thin stereotypical characterisation where not much is done to develop the characters and make one properly care for them. Unfortunately, while this reviewer is not afraid to admit that she had a fun time watching the film the story does get bogged down in the non-action scenes in derivative macho drama and over-silliness, the main culprit as aforementioned being the unfunny comedy double act, and the pacing sometimes loses tightness.All in all, kind of a mixed view on this one. Fun and very well made, but not immune to flaws. 6/10 Bethany Cox All in all,","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

It shows a simple concept about piloted robots, Jaegers, fighting against sea aliens, Kaijus. This idea alone would already make a fantastic blockbuster. The surprise we get is it features more than just endless explosions. There are plenty of innovations to root for which it can almost be a new popular classic. The only less intriguing parts however are the clichés that are too known in many big sci-fi action movies. Despite of that, it kept the promise of being gigantically awesome. It's not completely groundbreaking, but it's still quite an experience.Aside from the large scale battles, the film amazingly creates an innovating futuristic alternate universe. It tells the origins of the Kaijus and how the Jaegers work, shows what society and the media have become, and throw some satires of the genre. The exploration of the vision is so absorbing, it feels like you went to it as a trip. But what somewhat halts this from being larger than life is when it takes the generic elements of any typical blockbuster, like the hero's motivations, the main robot is somehow an underdog in one scene, there's an arrogant team member, sacrifices, and so on. It's hard to not notice them since they are the central points of the story. The intriguing stuff about the Jaegers and Kaijus still took over the experience. At least it embraces its own fantasy tastes without being ""dark"" and emo like today's blockbuster trend.Charlie Hunnam's performance is fitting to a graphic novel based movie, which is kind of appropriate as his role. In the battle scenes, he gives genuine human emotions as he punches and fall. Idris Elba remarkably brings heart to the picture while being awesome at the same time. Rinko Kikuchi makes her character more than just a partner of Raleigh. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman delightfully serves more energy to the story, while Ron Perlman appears in a short screen time but satisfying enough.Now the real highlight of the picture, the visuals are overall shiny and snazzy. The designs of the creatures and robots are palpably marvelous. As the special effects move these heavy giants, the action did something better than just blowing up stuff. Although explosions and loud noises are not actually flaws(It's about giant robots, c'mon!), but a real good set piece needs a decent and genuine fortitude. In the midst of the noises, you will always get the sense of danger to the Jaegers, mostly because there are human pilots beneath the ravaging machines. It effectively made those sequences electrifying and the monsters terrifying than you would expect.Pacific Rim will have its own fans. It feels like a self-indulged blockbuster that people will end up loving. Besides, this film is said to be Guillermo del Toro's dream come true coming from his childhood. And seeing all that, there's plenty of things to explore and to be intrigued. If only the plot can break some points from the mainstream storytelling, it would have been less predictable and much extraordinary. But physically, it is extraordinary. It's both big and eye candy which is the snazziest merit you will see. Also in the action scenes where it's more into the thrills than the fireworks, because it's all about iron fists hitting on monsters' face. Again, the story may be familiar, but the setting and the action keeps everything looks fresh and amazing.","273 out of 508 found this helpful.

By the end, I desperately hoped that the filmmakers had intended some cynical meta-theme about the poor state of Hollywood films today, but I gave up hope upon reading the pretentious boasts by Del Toro and his cronies who apparently took this boring popcorn flick dead seriously.The plot is paper thin and not very interesting, mainly because the film is too scared to go anywhere remotely clever or deep with its characters, message or general story. Del Toro has said the message is meant to be the simple ""we all should work together."" Even though this statement is cheesy and borderline meaningless, it could theoretically work with enough wit & creativity. Instead, all the characters are annoying stereotypes, and the film's ""message"" is conveyed in the laziest way possible. Most of the so-called ""character arcs"" are basically ""2 characters fight like whiny teens, eventually 1 of them does something helpful or useful, the other guy immediately pulls a 180 and decides they're friends."" I couldn't stand the 1-dimensional, boring characters. Even the central protagonist we spend the most time with never amounts to anything more than an annoyingly smug, whitebread hero whose ""generic action hero"" screaming voice will have you rolling your eyes throughout the 2nd half of the film. The female lead is so flat and bland that she constantly waffles between the extremes of an ""impressive talented spunky chick"" stereotype or an ""unreliable weak woman"" stereotype. Whatever the case, the filmmakers clearly thought audiences were too stupid to understand any characters who act like nuanced, 3-dimensional human beings. The lack of any worthwhile story, message or characters is a huge insult to the audience up-front.Without a decent story or characters, what else is there? The special effects are widely praised, but every time the monsters or robots were on screen, I was acutely aware I was watching a special effect. The big CGI fights are trite and predictable with no distinct personality; they're the kind of thing Hollywood has done countless times before and will bore you to tears if you're older than 12. It feels as if the effects crew made a generic CGI effects showcase and the rest of the film was written around those hackneyed action scenes!Even the soundtrack is typical & unoriginal. Most of the time you don't notice it there, but in the ""dramatic"" moments you might notice the incredibly cheesy and corny ""scary"" or ""triumphant"" cues, again completely bland and generic.There are so many elements that serve NO purpose in this movie other than to be as derivative and unoriginal as possible. For instance, the pilots feel pain when their robot gets hit. Why? This adds nothing to the plot or message, but Evangelion did it so Pacific Rim needs to steal the idea. The computer voice is distractingly Glados from the Portal video games. Why? There's no clever reason or hidden meaning; it just adds to the vibe that this film is a patchwork of borrowed ideas for one meaningless mishmash. You could no doubt write a shot-by-shot analysis of all the influences and sources this flick rips off, and I'm sure that all the original sources this film steals from would be way more entertaining and worth your while than this bloated pastiche.I won't even bother touching on the glaring plot holes and inconsistencies. The internet already has a LOT of material about the ludicrous flaws that pepper the film's already flimsy script. Personally I could forgive the countless illogical concepts surrounding the plot if it were a story worth telling, but Pacific Rim never even comes close.If you want a film with any respect for its audience, skip Pacific Rim. This film seeks only to make easy cash by giving people the same things they've seen before, except without any cleverness or depth that might make them interesting.","26 out of 41 found this helpful.

You expect a fight scene between a 250 foot robot and a 300 foot monster to be cheesy and in your face but they aren't. All of the technology is explained very well and the camera angles are ones that allow you to see everything going on. I highly recommend that everyone on this site go see this movie now.

"","","Great Throwback to Giant Monster Films","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2830308/?ref_=tt_urv","Michael_Elliott","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13134536/?ref_=tt_urv","12 July 2013","Pacific Rim (2013) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Guillermo del Toro's latest is a grand throwback to the days when Godzilla and other large monsters stalked the screens. Set in the future, the Earth comes under attack by giant sea monsters so they create giant robots controlled by two pilots so that they can be destroyed. It doesn't take long for the monsters to recapture the upper hand and as time on Earth is running out the humans must come up with a new plan of attack. PACIFIC RIM isn't a masterpiece but it's about as good as a film like this can get. While there are a couple flaws to be found along the way, there's still no way to deny that this here is pure entertainment from start to finish. Obviously del Toro knows his genre so fans will see all sorts of winks to earlier movies but the director takes it to the next level and really delivers something that is a lot of fun and full of wonderful action. I'm one who usually speaks against CGI not because of the technique but because so many directors don't know how to properly use it. That's certainly not the case here because the monsters, the robots and the broken down and destroyed cities all look real. This here is very important because it allows one to really connect with everything that's going on on the screen. Another major plus here is that the action scenes are full of wonderful imagination. The battle sequences are usually long, very destructive and oh so much fun and this includes a rather amazing sequence at the end that's underwater. The performances are also quite good with Charlie Hunnam, Diego Klattenhoff and especially Idris Elba all fitting their roles nicely. Ron Perlman also has a nice supporting bit. As I said, I think there were a couple flaws with one being the running time, which I felt was a bit too long as ten or fifteen-minutes off would have helped things. There were also a few too many shots that were extremely close to the action to the point where you can't get the full view of all the destruction going on. Still, PACIFIC RIM is a great throwback to the early monster films and it's fun from the word go.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

I'm a huge fan of the anime series Gundam Wing & Big O, so the robots versus aliens had me hooked. I really did enjoy this movie.I think people didn't give the story aspect enough credit. I thought the setup in the beginning set the stage for the story, and the main plot, though predictable at points, kept the movie from being more than just a CGI fight fest. Charlie Hunnam did a good job as the lead, but I thought Idris Elba & Rinko Kikucho did fantastic. Charlie Day & Burn Gorman, as scientist working with the main cast, did a good job with the comic relief and Ron Perlman was still good as his role as a black market merchant. Major kudos to child actress Mana Ashida, who played a younger version of Rinko Kikucho's character in a flashback sequence, as she was amazing.The real treat was the action packed battles with the robots (called Jaegers) and the monsters (called Kaijus). This was the kind of movie that needed to be experienced on the big screen and it didn't disappoint. Could I recommend this to anyone....probably not.

I loved almost everything about this movie. The acting was good, the CGI was incredible as was the scale of the Jaegars and Kaiju and the fight scenes were extraordinary, I loved the director's decision to start the movie in the middle of the war rather than the beginning, the script was good. The film does a great way of explaining important things, such as why the Jaegers need two pilots or why the Kaiju attack in the first place. I think my favorite part is the two scientists. However, there were one or two subplots that seemed clichéd such as the relationship between Mako and the lead guy whose name escapes me. It seems almost reminiscent of a buddy cop drama/comedy. That being said, it's executed very well and the chemistry of the two is wonderful. The music was exhilarating but really that's all it does, as far as i can tell it just seems to be generic electronic action music. Entertaining, but not really something that stands out. All in all, an excellent movie from Guillermo Del Toro. Think of it as Transformer's more intelligent brother.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Not only because it is done by Del Toro, but mainly because it is really good. And it seems people like it generally too (see rating here on IMDb, currently ranking at 7.6). So why didn't it perform? Tough to say, but seems like people didn't want to watch it at that time, so maybe the release date was off.You can't tell with those things though, so I'm pretty sure this will do much better once it hits the video stores/markets and sells/rents like crazy. The movie deserves that. And not because it is a great movie, but because it is very entertaining. Predictable and filled with clichés, Idris Elbas performance alone is worth the money!

Largely because of the two main actors Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba and I have to say I was not disappointed at all. Watched it in 3D (I have always strayed away from 3D before because I just didn't think it was worth spending the extra cash) but this time I do not regret my choice at all. It was a visual feast.Action was on point. The story flowed well (this is a blockbuster after all, we aren't going to compare it to an art house film). For me the actors embraced their roles very well and the visuals were magnificent (thank god once again for the 3D). Everything just felt right!Being familiar with Guillermo's past work I would say this is his best yet. His imagination is wicked.

Del Toro regular Ron Perlman plays one of his best characters yet, and the choice of Charlie Day as a scientist was brilliant.

Simple as that. The downside is, you have to suffer all the boring drama bits between the action to get there.I've never understood why it is so many directors feel they have to have some tedious love interest in action flicks, it just totally takes the edge of the tension. Then we have the really nerdy and half crazy scientist types who, while portrayed as seemingly brilliant in their field, come across as almost insane. Has anyone ever seen a scientist behave like this? I mean in the real world? Nope, me neither, but it seems movieland feels that's how we should see them all. It's bloody irritating if you ask me. And Pacific Rim has its very own who really bugged me while on screen. Please can we have some normal scientists in these kind of movies please? Although given the plots are so outrageous maybe that just wouldn't work so well.Anyway, getting to the action. It's good. It's really good, although sometimes it's a little hard to make out what's going on during the close-up fighting. Among horror fans, CGI is hated, as we love the day's of olde with lashings of fake blood and latex, but without the runaway developments of CGI it would be impossible to make a film like this. I reckon Pacific Rim is the ultimate demonstration of the top end of where we are right now in computer based effects. What you see on screen is truly stunning, moreso the big manmade battle machines than the monsters I must say. I enjoyed the movie a lot. It's maybe a little over-long with those slow drama scenes, but the onslaught of the mega battles certainly makes up for that. Good stuff then, for something so big and hollywoodesque.","19 out of 29 found this helpful.

I love action movies but with all the Transformer movies, comic book adaptations, among others things, it gets a bit much after a while. Pacific Rim is typically overlong but I can't deny how enjoyable it is. The middle is a bit slow at times. I thought it got a bit too talky at times, and my interest began to wane. I did love the final 40/50 minutes. The final 40/50 minutes is absolutely packed with non-stop carnage and destruction. It's loaded with CGI; don't get me wrong, it just didn't bother me. The production design is extremely impressive, and it's amazing visually. The destruction on the cities, the robots, the monsters all looked fantastic. My only problem as I explained above is that when you aren't being amazed by all of that stuff, it does tend to be a little mundane at certain points, but it has a lot more good than bad. The performances can be a little bland at times. Charlie Hunnam isn't the most exciting lead. He's OK at best. I never really got into his emotional plight. Since the movie is over two hours long, he didn't have nearly enough charisma to maintain my interest. Thankfully, the fantastic action tends to bail him out a lot of the time, but I wasn't all that impressed by him. Idris Elba is excellent as per usual. He's by far the most interesting character in this movie. His gruff, yet caring character was a blast to watch. Rinko Kikuchi is rather uninteresting as Mako. She has moments where she does good work. I just think she seemed a little uncomfortable during some of the meatier moments. Charlie Day is alternately funny and annoying as a scientist. Final Thoughts: Aside from the mediocre performances, the rather boring middle section, I thought this was well above average for a blockbuster movie. It sets out to entertain the masses. It does that extremely well. Considering I had low expectations going in, I was pleasantly surprised. It's a little overlong but if you kick your brain to the curb, sit back, relax, and enjoy the abundance of destruction7.6/10","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was Guillermo del Toro's previous work that got me over the threshold (Cronos, Pan's Labyrinth). What I got was a feast for the eyes and ears that draws from inspiration from virtually every popular international genre, from Hong Kong martial arts movies to Gothic horror and Japanese Anime and then adds the unique sensibilities of a director with a unique vision who knows how to bring it across in a BIG way. He knows how to stretch our credibility beyond the limits and make it work using a great cast of character actors adding to the strong chemistry between his three leads, Hunnam, Elba and Rinko Kikuchi (in a very strong performance). Remember all those Japanese monster pictures where huge beasts come out of the sea and smash up Tokyo? Remember ""Cloverfield?"" (this movie explains that one) Roll all of these up with today's effects and Guillermo del Toro's weird design sensibility and then tell yourself, ""Let's take this one TOTALLY over the top"" and you've got ""Pacific Rim."" As an action flick, from the first shot it never stops or even slows down. The scenes with the little girl in Hong Kong (i think) are particularly chilling and uniquely part of del Toro's signature - (he understands children and terror). This film makes ""The Avengers"" look sedate.Besides being an extremely entertaining, good old fashioned monster flick, ""Pacific Rim"" is a tribute to the strength of international cinema, involving artists and production teams from every part of the globe. I imagine this will be a HUGE international hit.","148 out of 282 found this helpful.

Why not just build Jaegers that have a crap tonne of missiles and lazer weapons, and blast the Kaiju into another dimension from far away?

Like ""Jurassic Park"", ""Them"", ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"", and other classics of the genre, ""Pacific Rim"" too intersperses the plot and back-story succinctly well as the action unfolds. The characters and their journey are given adequate footage as the monsters v/s robots action. More importantly, as the action unfolds, every single shot, each and every sequence is beautifully captured like a ballet reaching its crescendo.Unlike most gigantic FX laden pseudo sci-fi blockbusters like the ""Transformers"" franchise and ""Iron Man 3"", this films pays immense detail to certain laws of physics and plain simple logic. The action unfolds in a grand spectacle and straps you in for a roller-coaster ride. But it also pays respect to your senses and enables you to minutely follow each aspect of how the fight scenes are choreographed. Wish all gargantuan CGI driven films were like this.The film stays true to classic monster movies and also to its anime roots. Fans of both, anime and monster movies will be able to detect many subtle references to past classics and popular culture. In the end, ""Pacific Rim"" is summer blockbuster entertainment at its best and you'll be craving for a second viewing once the experience soaks in.","17 out of 26 found this helpful.

It is also foreseeable as using the similar technique as Transformer but as awesome fighting scenes as its, the only consequence is paying back in box. The plot is quite simple fighting the monsters which is quite like a Japanese series used to be seen in childhood, in other words, maybe only children like it and only people want to relax without thinking too munch of movies would like pick this one. Obviously it has some plots aiming to touch the audience but it seems the effects are not very impressive.In terms of the good aspects, at least it gives a happy ending. The giant robots maybe satisfy the geeks. Also I like the perform Rinko did in this film it is definitely a Japanese performing which is very cute. She can be very serious very tough but behind that she is fragile needing a shoulder to rely on. That is also the reason why Japanese girls are good wives they are melt LOL.In conclusion it is fit for children but not for the ones too small maybe 10 years old and above. Apparently it is for box but failed. Well nothing to say but good luck to the next one.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

They featured such creatures as Godzilla and a variety of others, del Toro not so much reinventing it but bringing it right back up to date. George Lucas' special effects company, Industrial Light & Magic, has created a world that is in the near-future but feels like tomorrow, the textures of the both the giant ""jaegers"" and monsters so realistic that even without 3D, you can feel that you can even touch them. The effects are simply put, outstanding and so far the best this year.Yet del Toro, who directed the acclaimed Oscar-winning ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and the pair of ""Hellboy"" films, and his scriptwriter Travis Beacham, know that for the film to be more than merely ""mecha vs. monsters"", real characters need to be created and invested with real emotions. In interviews, del Toro said ""We cannot pretend this is Ibsen"", so the characters like Becket, Pentecost and Mori are strongly defined people who, through the equally powerful performances from Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba and Rinko Kikunchi give us a film where we care what happens and mean the final climactic sacrifices are actually poignant, as opposed to manufactured drama with little thought behind it.Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, who play a pair of bantering scientists along with Ron Perlman, who is a black marketer in Hong Kong dealing in kaiju organs, are vividly sketched supporting characters who provide an antidote to the seriousness of the main plot. The humour isn't cynical or used to self-consciously comment on the film, but instead springs naturally from the characters. For a film with such a potentially risible concept and execution, it's a pleasant surprise to discover it to be so well written.The art direction and design of the mechs and monsters is superb, as is the envisioning of Hong Kong, a strangely beautiful world of iridescent lights of all colours, like a pop art version of ""Blade Runner"". The cinematography of the Oscar winning Guillermo Navarro is excellent too, capturing the nuances of the oily, technical world the film lives in while also bringing out the colours for the maximum dramatic effect. The editing by Peter Amundson and John Gilroy in collaboration with del Toro wisely chooses to go for slower cuts, in particular in the many and frequent action scenes, so as to render them intelligible and to allow the audience not only to understand what is going on but also so that they know the geography of the situation.The major flaw, apart from Ramin Djawadi's blandly generic score, is perhaps the action scenes themselves. Taken individually, each one is shot and edited very well, but by the end, there is a slight, creeping sense of audience fatigue. This is compounded by the fact that the film's most memorable scene is Kikuchi's flashback, which deals with the impact and aftermath of the monsters, rather than a long, extensive battle scene.Despite this, taken as a whole, ""Pacific Rim"" is a whole lot of fun and easily the best summer blockbuster of the year. Oh, and stay through the credits: there is a nice little post-credits scene that deals with the fate of a certain character.","23 out of 37 found this helpful.

However it's an entertaining film that hasn't been the disappointment that some of the other blockbusters have been this year. Pacific Rim is essentially a mixture of Transformers, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots and Godzilla movies. The basic plot for the movie is that giant monsters called Kaiju have come from another dimension deep in the earth's core. As a result humans build giant robots called Jaegers to stop the Kaiju attack. As you can see the story is paper thin with very little character development or background to the film. It is also filled with clichéd characters and more action than Transformers or the Avengers had. If you can get past this you will be transported to the mind of a 11 year old excited at the prospect of seeing giant robots and aliens fighting it out. The action and the CGI are the main reasons and the best parts about the movie. There isn't a lot of shaky cam in the fight sequences which is a good thing. The CGI is incredibly detailed with you actually seeing parts of the Jaegar's body flying off its body. The Kaiju also look very realistic. Despite the weak character development the actors do a good job with what they're giving. Charlie Hunnam(from Sons of Anarchy) and Rinko Kikuchi do a fine job as our main hero's. Charlie Day( from It's always Sunny in Philadelphia) and Burn Gorman do good jobs as the comedic relief for the movie. Ron Perlman and Idris Elba are the two stand out performances just because these two guys are the biggest bad asses in the whole of the movie( with the exception of the giant robots. Overall the movie is good despite its weak character development and paper thin story. It makes you feel like an 11 year old again and it will probably be the most entertaining action film of the whole summer.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

Originally set to direct The Hobbit films, he has, instead, switched gears and created a new film populated with mega monsters and super robotic warriors in an exciting, action spectacle, Pacific Rim. What sets this apart from most apocalyptic battles is its well developed characters and relationships. While its subject matter may not be for all tastes, it should satisfy most action and comic fans to the hilt.Set in the not too distant future, a growing threat emerges from an ocean breach in the form of enormous monsters (think Godzilla types) called Kaijus which ravage world cities. To combat these powerful creatures, world leaders construct giant war machines dubbed Jaegers which are controlled from within by a set of mind linked co-pilots. But the threat increases, and the creatures, who have remarkable, adaptive powers, duel with an ever dwindling number of outmatched Jaegers. While mentally linked, the copilots share each other's thoughts and memories. Ace pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) has traumatic memories of loss from an earlier battle and must learn to overcome this while the prospect of a new co-pilot in the form of Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) brings her own horrible past. As relationships are revealed and challenged, the monstrous Kaijus must be met in a last stand not only on land but at its mysterious source beneath the sea.While there is undeniable sexual tension between Becket and Mori, the filmmakers do not settle for clichéd romantic scenes, which a nice change of pace. The film deals primarily with facing and conquering one's own demons. Themes of loyalty, duty and sacrifice crop up. There are super mind melds and a nice dash of samurai mentality in the training and battle scenes, and there are elements of other action films like The Matrix and Top Gun especially towards the end. These Jaegers have some awesome, cool weaponry, and the high tech hardware is detailed and impressive yet well used and realistic. Movies such as The Transformers and the recent super hero films have raised the stakes of massive battle sequences in an urban setting, but Pacific Rim enlarges the playing field even more. And these monsters have tricks up their sleeve that would make even Godzilla envious. Although the scale of the film is breathtaking, del Toro always keeps things grounded in reality and honest emotions. These characters have a camaraderie that evolves throughout the storyline. Just like Peter Jackson in The Lord of the Rings films, del Toro demonstrates an impressive ability to marshal large set pieces while throwing in minute details or intimate moments. These things add to the texture of the story and its players; you begin to care for them. Idris Elba is fast becoming the actor of choice (from his start on TV's The Wire through the recent Prometheus). His role as the leader of the Jaegers, is critical to the storyline, and he even gets to have his own Independence Day/Henry V rallying speech. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman are a riot as rival scientists who bicker while trying to find solutions to the crises. Long time del Toro repertory stalwart Ron Perlman has an amusing supporting role as a black marketeer.Production credits are outstanding on all facets. Special effects are through the roof, and the score by Ramin Djawadi is appropriately heroic and pulsating. Do stay for the initial end credits for an amusing bonus scene.If this is not your cup of tea, it is best avoided. It is true there are perhaps too many climactic battles of these titans (Del Toro even displays a hint of shoe fetish). Yet for those who are game, it is a fun ride and a cut above typical sci-fi fare. For fans and geeks, it is nirvana. If you're going to make a film about giant war machines fighting larger-than-life evil to save the earth and instill the requisite human element, this is a textbook example of how to do it right. Imagine that: a sci-fi blockbuster that moves you! Boy, they are going to sell a lot of toys with this one!","19 out of 30 found this helpful.

Whilst Charlie Hunman's typecast acting style fits SoA, it doesn't make well on the big screen. He overacts in an aggressive manner to compensate for his lack of all other emotions. It's just a bit too boring and reminds me of the kind of acting you get on TV dramas - look hard and sound always annoyed.The action scenes were OK, nothing I hadn't seen before in Transformers, although the city destruction scenes were pretty amazing. If the director hadn't gone down the route of cheese and action cliché, but instead taken his job seriously this could have been a semi decent film.

Actors did a fair job sailing along the script and I disagree with the other reviewer who was telling that actors were bad.

The bottom line is that the movie is visually appealing with nicely written dialogs to match but falls behind any new essence.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's more than an action movie, it has a decent story to keep you entertained while there aren't battles going on.One comparison I've heard is that this is just like Transformers. These people couldn't be more wrong. Transformers is for pure entertainment and the story comes second. I feel like this movie was better at making sure the story was relative to the action that was taking place. I also think that when there was action, it was shot better. And what I mean by that is the camera doesn't seem to shake and you don't only get quick bits and pieces of the fight.What I would compare it too, would be the T.V. show, ""Power Rangers"". All of those episodes would usually end with a battle between an enlarged creature against the Power Rangers who combined their droids, zords, I can't remember. Anyway, think of that but with the action 100 times better! If you enjoy action, some funny one liners, and a decent story that brings it all together, definitely give this a shot!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The movies takes place when Earth is being invaded by gigantic aliens that none any already-existed weapons can sufficiently take down, the human creates the Jaegers which are gigantic piloted robots to counter and end the invasion.   To me, this is what summer movies should be. The movie has stunning visual effects. The robots are beautifully crafted and rendered. Action scenes are breath-taking. If you want an all-out, ass-kicking, robot-smashing, explosive goodness, this is the movie.   However, don't expect complex plots, well-developed characters WITH phenomenal action. Characters are predictable and simple. There are no sub-plots in the movie, just saving the Earth and kicking asses.   In my opinion, this is a great movie to watch but it could be better developed, both the fighting and the human characters. Recommended.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The courage, bravery, and comradery that everyone has to go through to make it together. It displays a lot of inspirational moments and makes you remember who you are as a human being, weak and fragile. We may not be much alone but together we can overcome anything. An inspirational action packed robots and aliens movie in summary. Not a romantic or a movie filled with plots and twists. Movie is obviously geared towards younger audiences.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

No let me guess ...""I've a great idea . Earth gets invaded by giant lizards and people controlling giant robots . A bit like Godzilla meets Transformers but instead of getting our ass sued for plagiarism we call the lizards Kaijus and the robots Jaegers . Please sign your cheques to ..."" ""Don't bother wasting our time sonny . Next please"" ""Six horny teenagers are driving along and their car breaks down in a dark forest and ..."" This isn't what actually happened and the unimaginative studio executives green lit the film which is indeed GODZILLA vs TRANSFORMERS . If you've seen the trailers and clips you'll know what you're getting Summer blockbuster spectacle and possibly like me you gave it a very wide berth . Wait a minute though , perhaps Mexican Guillermo Del Toro is conscious of this and has done something that at first hand seems impossible - he's made a Summer FX driven spectacular blockbuster that is genuinely fun With the opening three minutes that could have been a movie in its own he tells the audience everything they need to know including a well thought out reason as to why humanity needs to build giant human powered robots but it's with the human elements he hits the bulls eye . Again being non American he's probably well aware that international audiences get a bit fed up watching hunky square jawed brave Americans saving mankind so he's brought a multinational twist to the story . The head of the military is black? Fair enough but why's he talking with a London accent worthy of Dick Van Dyke himself ? Who cares and we have American actors playing British characters complete with weird accents and no one in this film is capable of doing an Australian accent and it sums up the rest of the characters and the film itself where everything is camp , colourful and there's a constant wink to the audience that's constantly saying "" Look this is absolute B movie nonsense but come on you're enjoying every single silly minute of this aren't you ?"" I know I enjoyed every single silly minute of this B movie nonsense . Put Del Toro in charge of Hollywood blockbusters now","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

And the answer is, quite a bit...quite....a....bit.I'll start with what del Toro has done well here, he's created some incredible sets, I mean these sets are enormous, and he's used CGI to make these hangers and workshops every bit as jaw dropping as you'd hope if the world had really pooled its resources in such a way. If only your favorite nerd sci fi TV show had this budget. There are some great scenes, great stills. And for the effort here, and for the balls to make such a movie, I'm giving this a pass. 5 out of 10.From about the 2 minute mark, or very early on at least, the movie pretty much tells you what kind of movie you are are about to watch, for the next 2.4 hours of your life. Firstly it's a movie with no real people in it. The authorities in this world must be incredibly stupid for a start, who are wanting to abandon the fighting machine project in favor of building sea walls. After 25 seconds of this movie we know that his insane, and that here we are dealing with a 12 year old world in which the authorities are pretty much no smarter than your stupid parents. The good guys, the warriors, are unfortunately no smarter, despite all the cool things they've surrounded them selves with, and have the emotional intelligence of wookies. These characters are so clichéd and predictable you want to slap them all every time you see them. A movie like Starship Troopers is Hamlet compared to this screenplay.Beyond this, the only remotely interesting thing is watching the fight scenes and the monsters trash the cities. But I venture that despite the huge budget thrown at it, even this does not deliver. To make the monsters continually more scary del Toro relies more and mo on CGI throughout, and so they become less and less real. For all their size and fury, they are far far far less scary than the monster from Cloverrfield, to pick a random monster comparison. And the fight scenes, really start to get boring, and the end is merciful indeed.All in all, the question is ""how can a 170 million dollar budget result in something so unsatisfactory?"". This movie is terribly out of proportion, a movie from the mind of a child, and the budget of Apple, it isn't good, it's not art, it's barely entertainment.","54 out of 98 found this helpful.

In response, humanity created large robots called Jaegars (German for 'hunter') to fight these creatures. Unfortunately, the Kaiju are winning, and it's up to a washed-up former pilot and a rookie to save humanity from being annihilated. Pacific Rim is the brainchild of Guillermo Del Toro, visionary director of such visually striking films as Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth. Pacific Rim isn't a remake or a movie 'based on anything' (aside from Del Toro's love of old-school monster movies), which is refreshing considering Hollywood's nauseating obsession with sequels, remakes, and superhero comic adaptions.First, and foremost, the CGI in Pacific Rim is some of the best you will ever see. The Jaegars and Kaiju look awesome, especially when they are beating the tar out of each other (and destroy cities in the process). It is definitely worth the 3D upcharge. Del Toro's film also features a well-developed and colorful cast that keeps the film from being 'all-style no-substance', like similar big-budget action films like Transformers and Battleship. A noteworthy performance comes from Dr. Newton Geiszler (played by Charlie Day of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia fame), a very enthusiastic and easily-excitable scientist that provides some big laughs and crucial insight into the Kaiju and how to defeat them. Ron Perlman has a memorable, but brief role as the Black Market Kaiju organ dealer Hannibal Chou (whose name comes from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Chinese restaurant). Details like how the robots operate, where the monsters come from and some of their biological facts (often provided animatedly by the aforementioned Doctor) are not only clever, but they give the world a certain degree of plausibility, another feature often absent from similar films. There is also a quick scene mid-credits which is worth sticking around for.Pacific Rim is not without flaws, though. At points, the dialogue was hard to hear, although this may have been the theater's fault. A few moments in the film will cause viewers to think ""Why didn't they just do that before?"" For example: towards the end of the second act, the Jaegar piloted by the two main heroes suddenly unveils a blade attachment that can slice a Kaiju with ease, clearly more effective than punching and throwing said beast for 10 minutes (though admittedly less exciting). The fight scenes in the second act are so thrilling and over-the-top that the third act feels short and weak in comparison. While the cast is strong and there are surprisingly few cliché/cheesy lines, the rookie and the washed-up pilot (the two main heroes) are not as well-developed as some of the other characters. All of the battle scenes are a treat to watch, but they take place either in the pouring rain or underwater. This doesn't deter from the enjoyment of the film, but to watch the two opposing forces duke it out on a sunny day (or even a cloudy one) would've be nice, so we could see them more clearly.The good far outweighs the bad when it comes to Pacific Rim, and you probably won't ever see a more fun or intelligent monster movie. 7 Robots out of 10","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Maybe thats how we should view these summer movies - not as B for Blockbuster but B for the old fashioned, leave brain at the door, turn out the light (inside & out) and let the B-Movies begin - well done Hollywood you have transformed (not pun intended) and created the B-Movie!! The last 2 years of Summer Blockbusters has made me look at the justification of these films - I conclude that we could actual survive without them and instead of using these mega budgets on mega let downs - just give the cash to some charity that needs it - surely that will give us all something to remember unlike 'Pacific Rim'...........","134 out of 267 found this helpful.

It's felt too much like there's not been anything genuine to be excited about with Iron Man 3, Man Of Steel, World War Z and The Lone Ranger to name a few, not satisfying audiences. Although I'm not a fan of Transformers or the other monster movies that are obvious influences, I had hope that Del Toro's art-house sense of cinema would blend well with the Hollywood inevitable attributes, as the latter is the price to pay for a movie of this epic scale. I enjoyed Hellboy back in the day but sometimes it got a little too dark and serious to be fun whereas Pacific Rim looked like a ball from start to finish. And it most certainly is. While too many Summer movies of the last decade find themselves swallowed up by their paint-by- numbers plot with any random thing filling in the gaps, Pacific Rim finds a great balance between the plot and the characters' stories, helped by its talented cast plucked from TV, especially Charlie Hunnam and Charlie Day, my personal favourite.Its script is constantly surprising and intriguing, even if structurally predictable, and it sets up its world in a fascinating way in those first few minutes. Although it can be melodramatic, whenever it dragged it picked itself back up again and set the stakes back in motion. It's an absolute delight to have a movie with actual set-pieces to balance out with the all-CGI world too, I just love the inside the Jaeger set. However, admittedly, there are times when the action is frustratingly cluttered, it has awesome and truly involving moments that completely make up for those moments of confusion. A scale like this hasn't been touched since The Lord Of The Rings and here it's is utterly awe-spiring. But what makes it special is that the action always means something to the characters and the plot and is never there for the sake of banal excitement. It has a great sense of humour too though sometimes it can be a bit too campy but that seems to be the lashings of Del Toro's style. Nevertheless, Pacific Rim is one of the most entertaining blockbusters in a long, long time thanks to its characters, great writing and creative epic special effects. This is how it's done.7/10","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

It seemed just like another one of those ""giant robot movies that are just all noise and nothing else. Fortunately though, it was a good thing that it was the only movie beginning when I got to the mall this morning. This is so much better than the ""Transformers"" clone I was afraid it would be.""Pacific Rim"" takes place in the year 2020 (not really in the very far future, isn't it?) and the world is under attack from gigantic monsters coming from ocean depths called Kaiju. As the tag line tells us, ""to fight the monsters, we created monsters of our own."" These are in the form of so-called giant mechanical fighting soldiers called Jaegers, controlled by the skills of human controllers. The human team dedicated to fighting these destructive creatures are based in Hong Kong. The soldiers were all hot-headed and macho heroic types, led by Stacker (Idris Elba). The scientists were portrayed as nerdy and caricature-ish comic relief, led by Dr. Newton (Charlie Day). The central character is Raleigh Becket, who previously retired from the Jaegers when his brother and partner died in battle. He was portrayed by Charlie Hunnam, who was not too familiar to me, just another generic blonde Hollywood hunk. The face could have been interchangeable with any of the other Caucasian fighters in there. The lead female character is Mako Mori, an aspiring Jaeger fighter, with a painful past. She is portrayed by Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi, who we should remember was nominated for Best Supporting Actress back in 2006 for her role in ""Babel"". Here, she appeared to be confused on how to properly portray her role, so she did not come across too strongly as her character should have beenDespite these casting and characterization flaws though, the movie as a whole still turned out very well. Director Guillermo del Toro faced such a challenge to execute a script that dangerously flirted with disaster, deriving obvious comparisons with, not only ""Transformers,"" but also ""Godzilla"", ""Real Steel"", ""Armageddon"". He succeeded to create within this borrowed material enough heart to make audiences root for the good guys and care if they save the day or not. When I was watching as the movie went along, it did matter too much anymore that the acting was not too good, or that the scenes looked familiar, or that the lines get corny. The movie was actually engrossing and entertaining. The special effects were of epic proportions. The whole thing worked as a whole, and that is what matters in the end.","13 out of 31 found this helpful.

What would be cool was if they visited the Alien world some more.I think Cloverfield could fit into this series though, the monster/alien had similar look about it and would explain where the Cloverfield monster came from lol.I preferred the Godilla movies especially the latest ones where they build giant robot to fight the big monster....sound familiar? lol Overall I was entertained by Pacific Rim and it's worth a watch.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

An awesome film with STUNNING visuals. Seeing those giant robots walking in the sea alone is worth ticket's price. Del Toro's passion and perfection speaks for itself. Not in a single place you find the CGI or visuals lacking. CGI is so damn perfect which isn't a small feat given that it's a film about giant robots fighting giant monsters. And man do these robots look beautiful and awesome? Like a piece of art. And they are done so perfectly, each and every movement, every little detail, has been given attention. These giant robots really put all what we have seen in Transformers to shame. The action scenes are jaw-dropping and are so brilliantly choreographed, without ever going over the top. It's a pity that this film couldn't do well on box office while every other crap coming out every day makes tons and tons of money. I sincerely hope Del Toro gets to make a sequel.","25 out of 42 found this helpful.

The question is: why? The movie is loaded up with special effects, has a lot of cheesy acting, tells a ridiculous story, and in some ways is a rip off of monster movies from the past. Based on that, this movie should qualify as a bomb. Yet it is not a bomb; this movie is good because it is unpretentious. It is what it is and is so without apology. Indeed, this movie glorifies the monster movie genre; it takes it to a higher, more sublime, level. Here the director lets out all the stops and lets the debris settle where it may. The movie conveys a positive message. It is about teamwork and about how humans are able to unite to solve problems. The monsters themselves are not especially surprising. Similar types can be found in many other monster movies. But what is different is how they are treated by the humans and how the humans respond to them. Unlike other monster movies which show humans in mass panic mode, this movie portrays humans as being stalwart and in control. You know they will beat the monsters; it's just a question of how. The monsters are another problem to be solved and the humans do a great job of solving it. This movie is worth watching.","17 out of 27 found this helpful.

I could distinguish that there was one guy who was black (Idris Elba) whose accent fluttered around any and every English speaking country from moment to moment. Then there was a Japanese woman (Rinko Kikuchi) who had some blue bits of hair. But I seriously didn't realize that any of the white guys were different until they happened to be on the screen at the same time.I absolutely love dense screen compositions, but there's a point where frenzied complexity transitions into white noise, and I felt that point was passed almost all of the time in this film.It saddens me that Hollywood is squandering so many hundreds of millions of dollars on glorified video game cut-scenes like Pacific Rim when master auteurs like David Lynch and Paul Schrader can't get the funding to shoot a pack shot.Pathetic!","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Definitely in my top 5 favorite movies of the year. The story as usual was very predictable but it was the awesome action and stunning visual graphics that really made this film work. Mr. Del Toro also does a great job in keeping this movie as family friendlyThe Jaegers however were one of my main concerns. There were not many involved there and it too much was focused on the 'Gipsy Danger' Storywise although simple and straight forward, there might some things in the story that are kind of hard to understand but again this is the kind of movie where action is more important. However, I think people will quickly get bored with this movie after a whileThe acting form Charlie Hunnam, Idris Alba, Rinko Kikiuchi as well as the rest of the cast was pretty solid and it was great to see Ron Perlman in another Del Toro film without his Hellboy costume this time. My 1 and only complain would be there were no Pacific Rim merchandise like popcorn boxes or drinks since it would have been an awesome addition to my current collection. Oh well, can't have it all my way Overall for Pacific Rim was an enjoyable ride and a must see film especially to all of you Mech fans out there","33 out of 58 found this helpful.

When I really enjoy watching Ultraman, Power Rangers, Kamen Rider Series etc. This movie takes it to a whole other level. It's grandiose!!!I get why people don't give this movie high rating. Because the story is quite simple and straight forward. Giant monsters are attacking earth. Now we build giant robots to fight against them. With some drama sprinkled around the mighty action.While the writing is questionable, the action is the best. You wont bother for some medium level acting, plotholes, or underdeveloped character if you saw the fight here. The monsters are truly massive. The way they move and sound are terrifying. The robots (or the Jaeger in the movie) fight impressively. And to be honest, The Cancelling Apocalypse speech is one of the best speech I've ever heard in movie.This movie is something you should see in big screen and good sound system.

They wreak havoc on several coastal cities across the globe laying persons & property to waste in the typical Hollywood style assited with a good dose of CGI. After finding that the conventional weapons are futile against these monsters which appear evolving into ever more dangerous creatures, humans respond by building their own combat force of monstrous robots called Jaegers (German for Hunters). Every Jagger is required to be piloted by two humans since a single human is incapable -mentally & physically - of controlling this colossal machine. The brains of the two pilots are connected through a technology called neutral drift which in turn operates as a singular command unit controlling the Jaeger.What follows is a series of visceral action set pieces in which the Jaegers take on the Kaijus on land, water and even air through traditional combat styles that includes fisticuffs, swords and some heavy duty artillery. The success of these movies depend a lot on the level of visual mastery which could make the viewer go WOW. The story and the characters are at best props that aid in unravelling the carefully planned action set-pieces though Del Toro does try valiantly to build certain emotional depth to each of the characters.While Del Toro is no Cameron or Whedon here, it helps that he is definitely not Michael Bay either. He definitely knows the quality of output that is required to engage the viewer without making a mere noisy mangled mess of the visual effects through stunts where one never knows who is fighting whom to what effect. The action here, while loud (which puts me off personally) is well designed, executed with panache and captured well which engages the viewer (especially in IMAX 3D). A rousing score accentuates the action on screen though, at times, it gets drowned in the melee of the wreckage around.It may not score big on the front of story or characters that touch your heart or a plot that engages your grey matter. It is designed to be and remains a delectable eye-candy for action junkies who prefer some well executed action setpieces on some CGI wizardry and to that extent, is very satisfying and fun watch. Guilty pleasure, if one may prefer to call it so ....","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Says a lot about how poor Bay's crapfest was and still is.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

After losing his twin brother and co-pilot, the narrator and main character must prepare to get back into battle before the war is lost.This is one of the most terribly written screenplays, with absolute pathetic attempts at acting, to ever be put to the big screen. This makes Transformers: Dark Of The Moon seem like an epic masterpiece. This is storytelling at it's laziest. For director Guillermo del Toro, this is embarrassing! This is the guy who directed Cronos, The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth.

It isn't that his movies are any dumber than others. They aren't. It is a reverse prejudice based on two qualities. He has a powerful visual ability, in beings, environments and machines. It irks me to no end that he cannot turn this to visual storytelling. The visuals are engaging. The stories are dull and have no intrinsic connection to what we see.The other expectation is the Hispanic filmmaker's dilemma: so very many use a tradition inaptly called magical realism. Poetry invades physics and we can either have a story where the nature of the story bends the nature of the world, or we have a parallel world interwoven within ours for a while. I am so taken with this style of filmmaking that I would now perish without it. Even Rodreguez has it in his kiddie and troubling exploitation movies. That del Toro seems so oblivious to this richness, while excelling in others that matter.... It is like a master chef's meal that is lovely but made from paper. So all this big slugging machinery?

The best scenes are the voice over ones that introduce everything and a flash back scene. Everything comes together seamlessly, it even brings the feels that the rest of the movie doesn't have. The Jaeger fights in this are alright, aside from the first one they're kind of alright nothing really happens until the end.The characters are pretty bland but interesting enough to keep you entertaining, just not much depth to them. Very similar to those in horror movies, they have their quirks but aside from that a bit flat. The stand out character is Charlie Day's Newt, he steals every scene he's in. He just chews up the scenery, he also bring a lot of rumor to quite a bleak movie.

This goes on for a shade over two hours.Look, I totally get that this is a homage to the monster movies of an earlier era (movies that I enjoy too). And all the right ingredients are here. However, the end result felt to me like a cold paint-by-numbers exercise with a vast visual effects budget.Fortunately, I don't think that del Toro ever fell into the trap of taking any of it seriously: there's a sense of sly fun that permeates the movie all the way through to a short scene embedded in the closing credits. However, this wasn't enough to save the movie for me, where a 25-minute, Saturday-morning-cartoon plot is expected to support a 130-minute feature film. To be honest, despite all the undeniably impressive visuals, I was horribly bored by the end.To some degree, I think the ultra-realistic visuals worked against the movie. The basic premise of choosing to combat giant sea monsters by building giant robots to engage them hand-to-hand is of course ridiculous. That's not something that should matter in this particular genre: plausibility is very definitely not part of the fun. However, for me at least, the realism of the presentation seemed to demand a more realistic premise. It just seemed very weird to have such nonsense presented so highly naturalistically.I mostly enjoyed ""Pacific Rim"" but was very glad when it was over. If you're after something completely brainless but spectacular, this might do the trick.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I don't expect the world or an eye-opening life-changing experience, but I do expect to be entertained. He has a combination of visual flair, and understanding of how you build an effective action scene (and in extension action movie) which makes a potent cocktail.The plot is pure nonsense, and is rushed by mostly through voice-over right from the start. Seemingly just to get it out of the way. ""Bla bla, giant monsters attack and we build robots to meet them in a boxing-match."" Honestly, most of the plot is not explained much further in the film than in the trailer. Acting ranges between bland and pretty lame, some of the actors are competent performers, but it's not like they are especially challenged in this movie.So, with that out of the way, let's talk essentials. I'm not a fan of the monsters, they look clumsy and lack elegance. Generally though, this movie is beautiful. del Toro knows how to get the adrenaline flowing with visuals and a suitably high-octane soundtrack. Everyone talks tough, walks tough and acts tough. It doesn't always work, and parts of the story feel tacked-on and just an interruption to the action. But mostly though, the movie delivers when it comes to action and excitement.I view this as a guilty pleasure. Something that should appeal mostly to 13-year-olds, and not men three times their age. But still, even though I can't say that I feel like seeing it again, it entertained me for most of the duration.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

To do this, the people of the world unite to create equally colossal fighting machines dubbed Jaegers (the German word for ""hunter""). In order to successfully operate a Jaeger, a bond, or ""Drift"", must exist between two pilots, a bond that is mental and spiritual as well as physical. The fate of humanity rests on the shoulders of Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who will go into battle with an eager to please rookie (Rinko Kikuchi) at his side.Here, acclaimed filmmaker Guillermo del Toro attempts to play in the same sort of sandbox popularized by movies like ""Independence Day"". Overall, it's more of a visual effects showcase than it is anything else, with a thin story and an over emphasis on spectacle. It comes off like a video game adaptation much of the time, with not too many human moments along the way. Granted, the movie is pleasing to look at sometimes, with a virtual candy store of futuristic images. The Jaegers are also imaginatively designed (at least, their interiors are), although the Kaiju are not particularly impressive.As could be expected, this is not the thing you want to watch if you're looking for truly great acting. Too many of the characters and performances are annoying, although Idris Elba, as Beckets' sombre commanding officer, has a typically solid presence. Hunnam is an underwhelming hero, with no real charisma at his disposal. Ron Perlman, whose working relationship with del Toro dates back to 1992 and the film ""Cronos"", hams his way through a brief role as a sleazebag who deals in Kaiju body parts on the black market. The true saving grace is the cute and appealing Kikuchi.Del Toro does his able best to keep his audience from being bored, but without the desire to consistently root for the heroes, it's hard to care a great deal for many of the characters here.Still, if you just want a gung ho popcorn flick, and aren't looking for substance, ""Pacific Rim"" is passable entertainment.Seven out of 10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie made me feel like a kid again, I was absorbed and entranced by the stunning, colorful action and visuals. It's the kind of movie that gives you something to daydream about. I loved watching and idea of these giant robot Mechs. Gives you that I-love-science-and-technology feeling.The entire movie has this quality I have never seen before, wherein the feel of it was bleak and gritty, but at the same time it was very colorful and futuristic and fantastic.These days in action movies often the action sequences are hard to follow because the director employs too many cuts and blurs, I assume to make it seem more exciting. But here I never had the thought, as I often do in other action movies, ""When is this action scene going to end... yawn... what is even going on?""I took off one star though because the movie isn't perfect. For instance, the main character is extremely forgettable, I could not even tell him apart from this other more minor character in the movie that looks similar. And then there was Elba's character and performance, there was something off about it. It's hard to put into words, the delivery of his lines was unconvincing at times: flat or the timing was off.I enjoyed the female lead. She's a gentle soft-spoken Japanese woman, and the movie does not apologize or overcompensate for it. Her character isn't the generic female lead who sneers at Mr. reckless rebellious protagonist at first and then gets won over and falls in love with him. Instead the male and female leads develop a hearty platonic friendship based on mutual understanding and shared experience.The movie had a rainbow of colorful characters, like the goofy scientists, the bleach-blonde rockstar-looking russians you see in the background, Ron Perlmen's character, they were all welcome comic relief to whole serious aliens-are-trying-to-wipeout-all-of-humanity situation.The movie is well done, but there is no denying it is completely formulaic. I instantly saw so many parallels between this movies and for example, Independence Day. The film is very much classic Hollywood, three-act, Joseph Campbell's-Hero's Journey stuff.And the whole premise of the movie doesn't make sense. If aliens were attacking earth, why would you build two-legged humanoid mechs to punch them and shoot at them at close range? Makes zero sense from an engineering standpoint. But all that is forgivable because after all... MECHS! But still worth pointing out... there are other things in the movie like that but I won't get into it.The special effects in the movie are amazing, and the director knew what he was doing with them. There were so many points in the movie where I was just in awe of how beautiful and well-put-together the action and special effects were. Moments where I appreciated watching something that felt absolutely PERFECT.If you are in the mood for a colorful action movie, run to the theaters now! I could see someone not liking it though if they need something deep or logical, this movie is a fun formulaic action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.","23 out of 39 found this helpful.

However in some aspects I do regarded it as decently made film, stunning looking at times, with a great use of lighting for monsters and battle sequences making them work perfectly In this world. created by Travis Beacham and Guillermo Del Toro. However I feel most of characters are weakly written and not really that interesting as the film thinks they are. Pacing and exposition are occasionally on rapid fire, going from line the next line to the next without really understanding or setting stone what was just explained seconds ago.

Am I meant to care? Guillermo del Toro's latest project involves humans controlling enormous robots and beating up Godzilla style monsters emerging from the ocean. It's very satisfying that this didn't actually do that well in America, because this is just total formula. We don't need movies like this. We've seen it all before. This action garbage has silver linings here and there. Visually, it's interesting and has plenty of awesome imagery. It's got a strong colour palette. Del Toro's direction is merely acceptable, but there is a sense of wonder in the movie, and the CGI genuinely looks great. In terms of style and visuals, the movie is quite strong and not everything can be deep and meaningful. Many will enjoy this, especially if they see it on a big screen. Pacific Rim frequently feels like a loving tribute to its genre and for some it will be a dream come true. At least it's a bit lighter and less serious than some other blockbusters these days. For some this could be a good antidote to Man Of Steel.I saw this on the small screen so maybe I'm biased. The thing which lets PR down is that it's not just robots hitting monsters. There is an hour between the first and second big robot battles and the film has the cheek to try and emotionally engage us with these pathetic, one dimensional characters. Seriously? The film may look great, but it's so cartoony and flat (While pretending it isn't flat by shoving loads of meaningless backstory down our throats) it's could have been some awful 2 hour cartoon on CBBC. The acting is pretty bad and even Idris Elba isn't that good. The movie just isn't original and since it's actually pretty boring much of the time (I don't care about what happened to the female protagonist when she was a kid!). Del Toro, who also made Pan's Labyrinth, another very overpraised film, is clearly popular because he's a bit different. Difference in modern films is a great things but there's only so long I can look at creatures, dark fantasy and loads of boring weirdness before I give up and watch Godzilla instead.4/10","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

Sitting through a couple of this year's blockbusters like Man of Steele, Fast and Furious amongst others, needless to say I was quite surprised when I came out immediately acknowledging this was the best movie I've seen all year, not just from this guy-genre type of film.Pacific Rim is over the top and a whole lot of fireworks, but what puts it aside from other run-of-the-mill action flicks is that it takes itself seriously. Aside from some cliché comic relief, that at the very least was enjoyable, you were rooting for the heroes in the movie all along. What's so curious about the movie is that it starts on a peak of excitement, and it never lets go. I'm sure many pseudo-intellects would argue, but if you allow yourself to indulge in the world, you're rewarded.. Shallowly. But hey, if you can't enjoy a bunch of giant robots shattering huge creeps you must have dropped your balls too hard, since they clearly left base and rolled away.Spurring you along with an exciting composition of music, you can't help but smile as these huge robots punches it out with impressive monstrosities. Much of the excitement stems from the fact that the overgrown antagonists actually pose a threat to our heroes, unlike so many other similar flicks. I swear, a tendril of drool was running down my lips in glee as we see the Gypsy Danger robot be assembled. The sound is well constructed, the machines well-designed, so you can practically feel the weight of these giant machines.. And that is the accomplishment. You're not perpetually faced with the question of ""Geez, couldn't they have animated this better"", as everything is done well, opposed to lackluster examples such as Transformers.In short, bring a group of guys together, go watch it and frollic. No girls allowed and no dull heads either.","38 out of 69 found this helpful.

It seems like everything he touches no matter the genre is the best of it's kind. Although granted most are in the horror, supernatural, Sci-Fi, fantasy realm. All have full well-drawn characters and fascinating stories told with a delicate touch even if during an action or scary scene.But then he tries to out-Michael Bay a robot movie and the results are very disappointing. Typically for del Toro it was a beautiful movie but the characters and story were so cliched and stupid it was insulting. It was like he took a Transformers script and characters and added big monsters. The result was the same, except prettier.I could even deal with the stupid lines and characters as del Toro just playing with the genre and having fun if at every turn, the plot mechanisms as well the mechanisms in the movie itself weren't so boneheaded. I won't get into the hundreds of glaring examples of silliness except for one, the biggest one - Why, if for all the tech our future holds, did they decide to combat the creatures with oversized robots in an urban cage match? Then while the two 'pilots' are mind melded, why do they have to yell at each other during battle? And with everything drive-by-wire, including our own cars, do they have the pilots 'walking' on these giant mechanical shoe platforms?I can play along with monsters from another dimension coming from the earth's core, but the basic concepts of the robots are so stupid it's hard to get past.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's Jaeger(s) vs Kaiju(s) which means Hunter(s) vs Monster(s). The story is straightforward with some minor plot holes which aren't important in the end. This movie is all about entertainment. The pacing is great. There are rarely dull moments in the movie. The visuals are breathtaking! Keep in mind that I watched it only in 2D. Kudos to the crew who made that possible. The action scenes are amazing. I had to re-watch plenty of scenes just because I didn't see everything the first time. There is also some humor in it which is a nice break from the constant action.Is there something I didn't like? I felt there was a lack of imagination considering the fact that the action happened most of the time in the Ocean. More battle locations would have been great. I also didn't like the love story. It felt awkward and wasn't necessary.To conclude this review, Pacific Rim should not be taken too seriously. It succeeds for what it is; a visually gem and fails at delivering a rock-solid story.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you go into Pacific Rim hoping to view some large scale fight scenes you will certainly get what you want. However the smaller features of this film can drag it down to the level of Marvel films upon rewatch, although I would put this on a higher pedestal than most of those.My first problem is the film's pacing, we open up with an exhilarating fight scene which really sets the tone of what's to come. But then the rest of the first act really drags. We don't see any more fight scenes for a massive chunk of the film and then the last 30 minutes is just action. I wouldn't say I was ever bored watching Pacific Rim, it just had the tendency of straying away from what made the film stand out.Another problem I have is the lighting and colour grading. I think a lot of the fight scenes are way too dark and the character scenes have adopted this murky yellow/brown colouration. This could be intentional to create an industrial feel to these scenes however it doesn't excuse the film from looking ugly.One of the best aspects of this film is it's score/soundtrack which really lifts the action to another level.Overall I do think Pacific Rim is worth a watch but don't expect to be motivated to ever watch it more than once.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's one of the very few movies where the 3D was done with such an art that you can't help but marvel at how amazing and effective it is. You see, the problem with the 3D gimmick is that it normally takes your eyes at least as long as the opening scene to acclimatize to the 3D, which is a waste if you consider that you're watching a film at almost triple what it would normally cost you. Plus, you're wearing awkward plastic goggles on your face which only seem to dim the brightness of the screen.In Pacific Rim there are a number of devices implemented to re-enforce the 3D effect with intelligently placed objects that work to refresh the neutral depth–which basically means you don't have to take your glasses off every 20 minutes or so. Bottom line: the 3D in Pacific Rim is worth its price.If you thought you saw the entire film when you watched the trailer, you are very much mistaken. Apart from two clips, the trailer only covers the events in the first 25-minute opening sequence. Pacific Rim is a lot larger than what I expected! True to del Toro form, Pacific Rim has a lot of depth and isn't simply a film with a narrow backbone to carry a visual and action-filled spectacle. Guillermo del Toro has already voiced his plans for a sequel, and, after watching the first film, it looks like it's going to be on par with the best of them.Pacific Rim is a must-see film! It's more mature and polished than the Transformers franchise and easily the best film I've seen this year.","37 out of 67 found this helpful.

For one, this level of destruction has been done before in all of the Transformers movies, and while it's more competently filmed here you can't escape the feeling that you've seen most of this stuff before. A few quibbles about this: no attention is paid whatsoever to collateral damage, but then again, that's a problem with the violence in most PG-13 movies. Also, the decision to film most of the action at night and around the ocean results in it being a little hard to follow due to the poor lighting and the fact that the robots and kaiju take up most of the screen because of their immense size. Moving on, I thought that the comedic relief in the form of two bickering scientists was well written and played, although it didn't really serve the story too much until the end. In fact, the story as a whole wasn't really spectacular, and was filled with a lot of cliché moments and was very predictable. Despite all of these things, it was fun to watch and I had a good time. An entertaining, but ultimately forgettable, popcorn flick.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Watched it in 3D(I have always strayed away from 3D before because I just didn't think it was worth spending the extra cash) but this time I do not regret my choice at all. It was a visual feast and you cant imagine a movie better than this for visual effects/dialogue delivery.Now the real highlight of the picture, the visuals are overall shiny and snazzy. The designs of the creatures and robots are palpably marvelous. As the special effects move these heavy giants, the action did something better than just blowing up stuff. Although explosions and loud noises are not actually flaws(It's about giant robots, c'mon!), but a real good set piece needs a decent and genuine fortitude. In the midst of the noises, you will always get the sense of danger to the Jaegers, mostly because there are human pilots beneath the ravaging machines. It effectively made those sequences electrifying and the monsters terrifying than you would expect.","37 out of 67 found this helpful.

Kaiju monolith which makes TRANSFORMER franchise pale in comparison. But the feeble storyline and unimaginative character-building drags the film into a scrape of torpor. especially after the seasonal actioners' drumfire (after WHITE HOUSE DOWN 2013, 6/10 and FAST AND FURIOUS 6 2013. 6/10), PACIFIC RIM is the most costly one, and its red-hot accomplishment in the Chinese box office suggests a belated chance to break even its tepid reception in the North American domain, with its Japan opening this coming weekend, an approximate $400,000,000 worldwide turnover may green-light a sequel for its ardent followers. The 3D effect surely doesn't improve at all thanks to the murky palette of the raining night combat and underwater location, under the 3D monopoly (even more absurd there are 4D version available in theaters) at least in China, we have no access to the plain 2D type, which rumor says its rendition is much better in an IMAX screen. Dedicated to Japanese Tokusatsu films, Del Toro and his crew's reconstruction and invention of genre is groundbreaking, an eye- opener with excellent technical scrupulousness, the bombarding sound effects are overwhelming as well as its awe-inspiring and heroic battle scenes. There are some hiccups keep bugging me, an obvious one is that why on earth there is no conventional weaponry assistance engaging in the doomsday battle, not even as the cannon fodder; another one is the last moment sword stunt, saving the best for the last may not work here, it is only for practicability, but an ill-considered one. Hunnam doesn't possess enough charisma to carry on the film on his shoulder and his platonic relation with Kikuchi hasn't been dug deep enough to steal the limelight. Other actors are standard equipments, Elba is the commander whose background story desperately needs a prequel. Day is the comic relief and Perlman is the egomaniac laughing-stock. Del Toro's Hollywood odyssey has been rougher than one had presumed, PACIFIC RIM is a qualified film in the sense of it is an updated product for the genre criterion (let's wait and see how GODZILLA will handle the challenge next year), but it doesn't live up to Del Toro's talent if one familiars with his earlier films, notably his homespun masterpiece PAN'S LABYRINTH (2006, 9/10), where mythology and reality have been miraculously criss-crossed and not only our eyes are being opened, our hearts are also being filled with passion and vibration.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie was a thousand times better than any of the Transformers movies. I'll tell you why: the story was better, the effects were fantastic, and to be honest, the Gypsy Danger and Cherno Alpha truly made me feel small compared to Optimus Prime and Bumblebee.The tagline of the movie sold me: To fight monsters we created monsters. If you don't know anything about the movie, just learning the tagline gives you a general idea.What makes this film truly amazing to me is the fact that it was mesmerizing like other of my favorite visual effect movies like Zack Snyder's Man of Steel and James Cameron's Avatar. The acting was also great. The graced performances of Idris Elba (Golden Globe winner, Luther), Rinko Kikuchi (Oscar Best Supporting Actress, Babel), Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy), and Ron Perlman (Golden Globe winner, Beauty and the Beast) were seen as clever and entertaining.Some before even seeing the film might have said that this movie was all visuals and has no real plot, but they were proved wrong. The story was solid and creative. And yes, the big robotic machines were awesome, but the story was too. Now seeing this movie in IMAX 3D is the only way you can have fun at the theaters. Seeing it regularly at the movies isn't as ""magical"" as IMAX 3D is. Not only did the effects look great, but the sound was too. The heart-pounding stomp of the Jaeger's (German for ""hunter"", the gigantic robots created by the humans) monstrous feet treading through a destroyed city made you feel like you were standing right in front of it. The roar of the colossal Kaiju (Japanese for ""strange creature"", the monsters of the movie)coming out of the water made you tremble in fear. What else is there to say? This was one of the best times I've had at the movie theater since seeing Man of Steel. When this comes out on Blu-ray, I am buying it and putting it in my favorite films collection. Now if this movie isn't nominated for at least ONE Oscar, I will truly be disappointed with the Academy...","15 out of 24 found this helpful.

""Pacific Rim"" is a classic case – great special effects overshadow a poorly developed story line and even weaker characters. One of the core problems in the film is that the main actor, Charlie Hunnam, who does such a great job on the TV series ""Sons of Anarchy"", just doesn't translate well to the big screen. It's not an uncommon problem (think David Caruso). His co-star, Rinko Kikuchi, seems completely lost, and most of the other characters don't have enough screen time for us to care one way or the other. Idris Elba, who usually turns in a good performance, can barely be understood, and Max Martini (""The Unit"", ""Redbelt""), another fine actor, seems to be sleepwalking.The comic relief, provided by Charlie Day, Ron Perlman, and Burn Gorman, are more ludicrous than funny.OTOH, the film does have some really impressive special effects, except for the ending, which appears to be shot in the pool of Director Guillermo del Toro. Del Toro directed the ""Hell boy"" (2004, 2008) films, which probably accounts for Ron Perlman's brief cameo. His best work has been ""Pam's Labyrinth"" (2006) which wasn't exactly an action adventure film, and his penchant for sci-fi and insect-like creatures can be seen as far back as ""Mimic"" (1997) which isn't remembered as a classic. Nonetheless he does a good job with the special effect sequences and they will keep you on the edge of the seat.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

I just seen it in IMAX and I have to say that half of the time I couldn't tell what's going on during the fight sequences. I'm not the only one here complaining about this. It is clearly an editing defect and also a color grading defect since everything is too dark during the fights. I do not understand this new trend by splitting the movie in very long and stale sequences and then cut to endless fighting scenes which strain the eye and over-saturates the senses. Just intertwine them up into a more coherent story driven film. It is not rocket science. It's editing 101.The acting was exactly what you would expect from a robots vs monsters film. Nothing more nothing less; cardboard cutouts, stereotypical, without any arcs. There is only one female role (except few others extras) in the whole film which is totally out of balance with the social dynamic created within the narrative. The music is good and it works. It is funny that ""works"" today turned into a compliment though. It does a good job of embracing brutal fighting sequences and it also works on squeezing out that much needed gram of emotion. It feels really nice to hear thematic and fleshed out melodic material making a comeback in a world where soundtracks have become mostly sound design.CGI is well... CGI. The monsters sometimes look silly, not menacing enough and the giant robots seem very fragile and clunky. I know this is a form of a tribute to the golden age of cinematography where giant monsters were some guys dressed up in rubber suits walking around a set made out of cardboard, but a tribute should be a short and clear statement, not an entire two hours film. In my opinion, CGI should complement and augment good acting, good story telling, good character development, not to be the sole reason for the existence of a film. Yes, this is a robots vs monsters movie, but that doesn't justify disregarding the very foundation that makes up a cinematic experience. Popcorn and all, i saw at least three opportunities for the story to take an alternate route to a more complex and fulfilling end scenario.Like any other of my fellow sci-fi enthusiast, I can suspend my disbelief. I can even stretch it pretty far. But I cannot in good faith support the stupidity needed for a story to exist. Darwin winning prize minds thought it was better to build giant robots that work via an incredibly complicated and unexplainable mind meld of two people instead of arming strategic nuclear devices on the bottom of the Pacific and detonating them whenever one of the monsters emerge. I have games where I can operate giant robots using my keyboard and mouse only. There are surgeons who in extremely difficult operations are using robots that are capable of performing incredible and accurate tasks. There are guns today that can inflict unimaginable chaos and destruction on almost any kind of earthly scale. Yet in this film, we need giant clunky robots that perform ninja-like actions to wrestle and beat the monsters to a pulp, piloted by some people that are somehow compatible to mind meld in a black magic driven process. And let's put them right in the middle of the action, because you know, remote control is too futuristic. We see steel penetrating the monster's skin while F22 rockets are barely effective against it, because again, there's nothing better than a knife at a gunfight. This is Occam's razor violation at its finest. You want to justify giant robots fighting giant beasts? Then please make it so in a way not to sound so abysmal when the whole script is laid out on the table. Comic relief is a poor attempt to say the least. The only two ""bright minds"" available in the whole world act like Laurel and Hardy all throughout the film, reaching idiotic and blatantly obvious conclusions. They are nothing more than embarrassments for the scientific community and they are the perfect portrayal for how this movie treats its science. The film has its few moments to shine, but that's about it. They do not add up to something more. The story is too simple and it's told in an amateur way. Acting is bad not because actors fail to deliver a good performance, but because there is no performance for them to give. Directing is not good; fighting scenes are too pampered becoming over-saturated, and in other scenes it is almost absent. Music is the only redeemable quality of this title that I quite enjoyed. This is a high-budget triple A popcorn flick, but for me personally this film was a let-down. After all that hype and attention it received in media, I hoped at least that at the end of it I will get that smile, that u-mph that says ""Ok, this was a decent summer flick"", but alas, it did not happen. Even if you have low expectations like I had, you still might not enjoy this title, therefore I would recommend you not to go and see it, because you would only feed the hungry money making Hollywood machine and right now they need to realize that spewing out half baked films like this will not help them for the future. But that again what do I know? I'm just another random ticket-payer movie-goer, who wrote another review in a sea of endless reviews that are disregarded completely by the film industry.","24 out of 47 found this helpful.

Next you have Idris Elba who played Stacker Pentecost,and to me he carried this film, just the way he acted in every scene was brilliant! And the final main character is Mako Mori who is played by Rinko Kikuchi, I don't know her too well be she did a pretty good job in her role, and once again she was believable.Story: The story is going to be something you seen before minus the giant monsters and robots, A guy worked in a program bent on saving the world, he gets discontinued and then gets put back on the job years later. We've all seen something like that before, but what I thought was cool was the way the monsters come out of a portal in the Pacific Ocean, I've never seen anything like it. Overall the story is good.Action/Special Effects: So this is probably the main reason you've come to see this movie and man, does it deliver! Every action scene I was on the edge of my seat, with my jaw dropped in amazement! Watching these awesome CGI robots beating the crap out of giant monsters was a joy to watch! The destruction of this film is crazy, robots are punching through buildings, monsters are rushing through cities, destroying bridges and freeways. Every fight scene is awesome, and I like how each of the Jaegers had different weapons. For instance, one had a chainsaw sword, another had, like 4 arms with saw blades on each hand, another had rockets that came out of it's chest and shot missiles. Not to mention the special effects were top notch, everything looked so real! Del Toro really know how to make a good film, if you love his work or just love action films in general, this is definitely a must see!","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Jackson, like seriously); and a fairly predictable plot where gaps of logic abound; however, the movie is astounding when it's being what it's meant to be: an homage to Japanese Kaiju(think Godzilla) and giant mech films. While obviously a loving tribute to these genres by director Guillermo del Toro, it manages to be incredibly original with none of the monsters or mechs being clearly derived from any creations I've seen in the genres before(and each one having incredible and distinct designs, particularly on the part of the of the Jaegers). The action scenes are, as you can expect from a summer blockbuster, the main draw and are absolutely spectacular. Michael Bay, take notes, this is how you handle giant robot fights; not meaningless heaps of metal flying confusingly throughout the scene, but crisp, clear shots of brilliantly designed badass robots doing badass robot things. The monsters get plenty of credit here too, as they were absolutely spectacularly done. If you're looking for awe-inspiring, get-your-blood-pumping, edge-of-your-seat, hyphen-hyphen-hyphen, action, this is the movie for you. I will say, the few interesting characters got far too little screen time. Both Charlie Day and Ron Perlman had fantastic performances and I wish the two had more interactions, but it is what it is. Worst character award goes to Burn Gorman's character, but his portrayal his decent enough. Beyond the basic premise of ""Monsters attack earth, we build giant robots to fight them,"" the plot is fairly lacking. Some good character back story, and, again, Perlman and Day's subplot is absolutely lovely, but overall its predictable, uninspired, and has too many holes for my taste. But, again, the plot is second to the homage and action in this film, which is where the film truly does shine. Overall, I would strongly advise seeing this film.","16 out of 26 found this helpful.

It's hard to believe the story which was so simplistic and childlike at best was incorporated into a Guillermo Del Toro movie. A man whose imagination and direction are his genius clearly dried up for this release. Basically monsters from another dimension come through to earth and the world creates giant robots called Jaegers to fight them, yes folks that's it! The gaps in between the awesome fight scenes are filled by the most tedious dialogue and acting you could imagine. Charlie Hunnam who is English clearly has only one American Accent and OTT swagger and each scene he is involved in looks straight from Sons of Anarchy. Idris Elba got real plaudits from critics for this despite showing no screen presence or emotion throughout the movie. The most annoying character is Dr Newton (Charlie Day) whose high pitched screech of a voice provides constant ""nails on a chalkboard"" irritation in every scene he appears. It's clear Del Toro and team aimed this character as a crazy/funny genius but this fails miserably and he ruins every scene with his overacting screaming.Del Toro also had a brainwave that instead of having the English spoken Hansen duo (father and son) talk in their normal English accent for the movie he would have them speaking like Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Having saw both actors in other roles they don't speak like that in real life so much so as a Brit i could barely make out what they were saying. All of these problems wrapped around a poor script with no big name actor to carry the movie gave it a limited release 'B' movie feel. Had it not been for the truly awesome CGI, cityscapes and fight scenes popping up now and again this movie would have been a blot on Del Toro's resume. God only knows how they spent $180m on this.In a sentence, no superstar actor, 'C' class bit part actors managing to overact a poor script/story with the CGI saving it from total embarrassment.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

That's how bad it is.Visually, it's on a huge scale and is nothing you've seen before. It deserves some plaudits for that. Rinko Kikuchi put in a decent performance (at least when compared to her fellow cast members)But the poor acting, cringe-worthy dialogue, lazy characterisation, sad attempts at ""comic relief"", incoherent storyline and gaping plot holes do not make up for the cool effects. And to be honest, after the first 20 minutes or so, you kind of know what you're going to get for the rest of the movie.I know it's a big blockbusting summer popcorn movie, and I usually LOVE that stuff.

And he most certainly succeeded at that! This movie not only gives you some of the best action sequences any movie has offered up this year, it also delivers spectacularly in both the narrative structure, and characterization. The characterization is done primarily through ""the drift"" and it's inclusion is just a stroke of genius.In short, to pilot a Jaeger you need two pilots, since it is far to much neural interface for one brain to handle. These pilots need to be in ""synch"" so that their movements are matched. To get synced they literally have to meld their minds and then gain access to both the thoughts and memories of each other, and through great visual effects you learn a lot about your heroes simply by the movie showing it to you.Another thing that surprised me about this movie is just how well thought out most of it is. Kaiju priesthoods? Kaiju body parts marked? Science departments dedicated to the study of Kaiju? This movie has it all.With Pacific Rim, Guillermo del Toro not only gives you the best robot monster mash-up since, well, ever. He also shows just how much thought there has been put into this. Del Toro has made a concept that sounds stupid, into a clever movie. And in a well made universe, and with a believable structure. He also shows that a movie can still be simple, and clever at the same time.

It's true.Predictable beyond belief, Pacific Rim was a mindless mess that held absolutely no surprises, whatsoever. The most damaging aspect of this film's story was that it clearly took itself way too seriously for its own good.As far as I'm concerned this film's story was just another variation on that old, stale theme of little boys who want bigger toys.Pacific Rim may have been a colossal $190 million production, but, to me, the overall return on its dollar value amounted to no more than one percent of that sum as far as its entertainment-factor stood.When it came to all of the cookie-cutter characters who prevailed in Pacific Rim, I really resented the emphasis that was placed on a bunch of cocky, self-centered jocks who were the ones intended to save the day. And the quirky repulsiveness of research scientists, Gottlieb & Newt, actually made me cringe every time these 2 despicable twits made an appearance on screen.At an overlong 2 hours and 10 minutes, Pacific Rim could've easily been edited down to 90 minutes and, believe me, in the long run, it wouldn't have made even the slightest difference to the final outcome of its truly nonsensical story.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Great special effects movie with a totally ridiculous story","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2910039/?ref_=tt_urv","p-jonsson","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23949705/?ref_=tt_urv","22 November 2013","I have to say that I enjoyed this pure special effects movie quite a lot even though the plot is totally ridiculous. Clumsy giant robots beating at alien beasts with their fists should be better than modern tanks and airplanes with modern explosive and armor penetrating weapons? As I said, a ridiculous story. Well it does not really matter does it because the story gives an excuse for some real cool special effects loaded action. Giant robots and alien Godzillas in the same movie. Cool, simply cool.Once you have gotten past the silliness of the story it is a very entertaining roller-coaster ride of action. The scenes where the robots and aliens go head to head is visually very entertaining. Sometimes they make you laugh as well. For instance the scene where Gypsy Danger (the robot) drags a cargo ship after it to use as a club.Unfortunately a somewhat somber mood is set right from the start by the fact that the Jaeger program is discontinued. Not because they are really defenseless as the movie blurb states but because dumbass politicians wants to save money as usual.As much as the robot and alien action is tremendously enjoyable I think some of my favorite scenes are the ones with Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau. I have always liked Ron Perlman and he is simply outrageously (as in funny) wacky as Hannibal Chau.The one thing I did not like with the movie is the ludicrous nonsense statements about the dinosaurs being the first attempt at an invasion. Whoever wrote that must be an idiot. Worse, the fact that it made it into the movie means that someone believes that the audience are idiots. When it then was followed by some green-religious crap that the atmosphere was not right but that we have now ""terraformed"" earth for them by our pollution it was at least a star off just for that. I hate it when they put crap like that in the movies. It is an insult to the audience.Anyway, despite the dinosaur nonsense I found it a very enjoyable movie. Without that it would have received a near top rating but as I said, it is at least a star off due to that crap.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movement of the giant robots feels very real thanks to the excellent visualization and sound mixing. The main music theme *is* present every-time when it's needed to build that feeling of justification and awesomeness and it's epic presence is appreciated by the little boy in me watching the monumental scenes with eyes glued to the cinema canvas. It's *maybe* not taking itself very seriously, and characterization is quite flat, but the ""threat"" still feels more serious than in movies with similar themes.

Yes there are no famous characters in this flick, but it had a good story, good timing, awesome special effects and a great ending. BOOM!!!

This film will always be the defining example of what happens when a production crew have a ton of money and technical skill, but no creativity or vision.Ten minutes into this movie, there are already enough plot holes and ridiculous and cheesy moments. The first issue arose when the narrator explained that to stop a threat which was previously dealt with by bomber planes, humans developed crazy technology, spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and trained thousands of people, in as a result, have a really big metal thing that they can hit the aliens in the face with. That's all.The biggest insult to my intelligence was when they insisted that because the robots are big, humans aren't capable of controlling them alone. It clearly did not occur to the writers of this film that this is simply ridiculous. These robots have the same number of controls and joints as real, modern day robots. The film continues with a never-ending list of nonsensical and dumb plot points with more holes than you can imagine.Previously, films of such low calibre have been underbudget too, but this atrocious waste of money that is Pacific Rim actually upsets me: those millions of dollars could have gone towards a programme to increase poverty in third world countries, and would still have been better spent.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie is another ""Skyline""; all spectacular CGI visual effects and a shallow mockery of a storyline. Everything here just screams textbook step-by-step heroic story.The world is threatened by an extraterrestrial superior life form that comes to Earth through a rift in the depths of the Pacific Ocean. The nations of Earth put aside their differences and feeble politics to unite against this outer-wordly threat. And they build massive war machines that are driven by people to fight these gargantuan reptilian invaders.That was basically the entire storyline, and for some reason director Guillermo del Toro needed 131 minutes to tell a story that could have been told in one-third of the spent time.Right from the very beginning, you know the exact outcome of the movie, and there isn't a single surprise throughout the entire movie, which was sort of too much in a singular easy to be one step in front of the movie at all times. This was what the movie suffered from. Well, that and the appalling fact that the movie was a very weak excuse of a storyline.Which leads me on to the characters. The characters in the movie were actually more like caricatures than actual characters. They were wooden and had really awkward and often bad dialogue to work with. And the people behind these caricatures were doing alright jobs given the nature of the movie, but I can't really say that there was any one performance that stood out as being overly memorable compared to the others in the movie.That being said, then I will say that the CGI special effects in ""Pacific Rim"" is off the charts, and it looks nothing short of spectacular. The creatures were very realistic and moved about in a very believable way. Although they were a bit on the simplistic side in terms of creativity in the creature design. The war machines were nice as well, although I think the whole part about them needing two pilots to work in symbiosis was a little bit stupid.If you are looking for a Sci-Fi movie that requires absolutely nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, from your brain, then ""Pacific Rim"" is a great way to spend 131 minutes in dazzling special effects, CGI galore and fluorescent neon lighting.I am rating ""Pacific Rim"" a 6 out of 10 stars, purely because of the CGI effects that is dazzling and a real treat for the eyes. This is indeed a movie suitable for a day where you are nurturing a hangover, feeling sick, or just need to lay on the couch with your brain sent away on holiday. ""Pacific Rim"" is a guy's movie all the way through...","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Aliens (who resemble the ones from Alien and Howard the Duck) emerge from beneath the ocean surface to attack coastal cities, and humans develop giant robots manned by two pilots to bring them down. After a defeat early on by our hero, played by Charlie Hunnam, this robot program faces elimination. And a rogue captain tracks down Hunnam (who's taken a civilian job) and attempts to save Hong Kong using the last of the robots. Hunnam wishes to team with a young Japanese woman, whom the captain cares for, but she has difficulty overcoming the emotions left over from the killing of her family during an alien attack.I saw this from the front row, and the 3D was excellent. I really felt as though I were going to get wet or hit with debris. The visual effects and look of the movie were excellent. Some of the charterization and script are problematic. The two scientists at the base are pencil necked, squeaky voiced comic relief characters and it's hard to tell if they're giving bad performances or the script just demanded that they act like cartoons. The soldiers, especially Hunnam, try so hard to be macho it's almost funny. He's concentrating so hard on looking butch, he forgets to act and his accent fades in and out. Nonetheless, I think if he becomes less self conscious about his acting, he could be a big star. He has a bit of a Brad Pitt look about him. The Japanese woman is a bit of a weak character. The audience is supposed to giggle as she coos around Charlie, and I suppose some people might think it's sexist that the only major woman in the movie is portrayed most of the time as being too emotional to be a pilot. Obviously, most people aren't going to a movie like this for the script and compelling characters. I compared it to Transformers above, but only because of the robots. One great thing is that I can always tell who's who, where the action is happening, and what the stakes are. In Transformers, action scenes go on for forty minutes and we aren't clear who's attacking who. There are some clichés during attack scenes, with bits of obvious humor thrown in. But generally I think this movie will win over most people. Definitely don't wait to see it on video. See it 3D in the theater if this title interests you at all.","10 out of 41 found this helpful.

Due to the passing of legendary special effects artist Ray Harryhausen earlier this year (the film is dedicated to his memory and that of famous Japanese movie director Ishiro Honda - who passed away 20 years ago in 1993), the failure of ""Godzilla"" in 1998, and the reasonable successes of the American found footage/monster flick ""Cloverfield"" in 2008 and South Korea's ""The Host"" in 2006, the monster-on-the-rampage genre has seen some increased relevancy, and legitimacy, in the last decade.As someone who grew up with, and idolized, Godzilla and other famed Japanese movie monsters - Ishiro Honda's ""Gojira"" (1954), Godzilla's dark, gloomy black & white debut, remains the greatest monster movie ever - ""Pacific Rim"" was the first movie I've seen in the movie theater this year, and it was a choice that was well-worth my hard-earned $7.50. I also belong to a Godzilla fan-boy group on Facebook. Upon the release of ""Pacific Rim"" on July 12, 2013, the page ignited with impassioned fan-boy discussions of what could easily be considered the greatest giant monster movie so far this millennium (if ever, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here - ""Gojira"" is still the best this genre has to offer). I'm inclined to agree.I greatly admired J. J. Abrams's take on the monster movie genre with ""Cloverfield,"" and I thought that ""The Host"" was a welcome surprise from one of the last places to pop up on the world cinema market. Now with ""Pacific Rim,"" famed Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's big-budget take on the genre (as well as serving as a delightful homage to his childhood fan-boy obsessions in comic books, Godzilla, Japanese Anime', pop culture, and fantasy) has arrived.Equal parts ""Avatar"" (2009), ""District 9"" (2009), 1998 ""Godzilla,"" Iron Man, ""Top Gun"" (1986), ""Transformers,"" and del Toro's own fervent imagination (together with co-screenwriter Travis Beacham), and featuring an epic score by Ramin Djawadi (which comes close to rivaling the best of the famous Japanese film composer Akira Ifukube), ""Pacific Rim"" begins sometime in the near-future, when mankind is at war with giant, other-worldly sea monsters called ""Kaiju"" (the Japanese word for ""monster"") bent on our destruction. To combat them, we have the Jaegers (the German word for ""hunter""), 250-foot-tall heavily armed, heavily armored giant robots that are piloted by two people who mind-meld to form a single unified consciousness - the better to operate them and fight the Kaiju, we're told.The film's strongest visual appeal comes from the giant monster-robot battles that dominate the film's loudest moments (and pretty much the entire second half of the picture). In today's times, special effects no longer serve to simply enhance movie scenery - as they did in time's past - but essentially to create them. There are some movies in recent years where special effects - namely CGI - are used to create an entire movie and actors seem almost like an after-thought. In recalling the movie, I found it to be a relief that there seems to be a more intricate balance between the battle sequences and the scenes with the flesh & blood human characters.And we get some truly likable, flesh & blood human characters in the form of a jaded former ace Jaeger pilot named Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who is called back into the line of duty to once again combat the Kaiju threat; also on-board is his former chief, the hard-nosed Stacker Pentecoast (Idris Elba), who lends the movie sex appeal and scenery-chewing military command presence; and lastly, there's the beautiful, ambitious Jaeger pilot-trainee Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi).Backing them up, is their loyal, wise-cracking systems administrator Tendo Choi (Clifton Collins, Jr.), and a pair of goofy, bumbling Jaeger research scientists - Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) - who make several fundamental discoveries about the Kaiju that may just turn the tide of the war in favor of humanity. And, it'll be impossible to miss him, but del Toro's regular go-to guy Ron Perlman (best known from del Toro's earlier ""Hellboy"" superhero movies and ""Blade II"") also shows up as a leather-skinned, back-alley Hong Kong black marketer named Hannibal Chau.As a director and screenwriter, del Toro has always given his films rich character and thematic depth, and philosophical complexity (and not to mention a fine sense of humor, which many big-budget blockbusters these days often tend to lack); ""Pacific Rim"" does not rank up there with his most famous picture to date, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (2006), but it's actually much closer to his aforementioned ""Hellboy"" films and ""Blade II"" (2002). It's a blockbuster movie, but one that is not without some degree of humanistic depth and merit. The film's core theme revolves around the benefits of working together - ""two heads are better than one,"" as they say - and this is taken to a somewhat literal degree here, in which empathy (the ability to understand another person's feelings) is seen as a bona-fide superpower in and of itself that is capable of allowing just two people to power towering robots to effectively battle an unspeakable threat to humanity.It is this purely humanistic touch that takes the spectacle away from the many dazzling special effects-driven action sequences that ""Pacific Rim"" has to offer and instead places it on the human characters at the center of it all. This is something that is purely at the center of much of Guillermo del Toro's best work.10/10.","21 out of 36 found this helpful.

I wanted to watch the movie for Del Toro whose Pan's Labyrinth was the one I watched recently which was brilliant. of course, this movie is at different scale altogether but still Del Toro manages to pull it of nicely considering how these mega movies can go easily wrong and lost in plot. The prologue is short and crisp which gives background and also more then the glimpse of these monster Kaijus and Jaegars. But you may think it plays spoiler if you expected dramatic entry of these creatures but it does not happen. Its definitely not the first of its kind movie, we have seen them before I wont say this is better scripted but yes, better visualized for sure as technology continues to make progress. As of performances, probably not too much was expected as it was not the focus but Edris Alba keeps it all together and kind of drives the entire movie. The two scientist characters though seem cheesy. The real heroes are the Kaijus and Jaegars which hog the limelight and the fights between them are well crafted and CGI is brilliant to go with the rather nice plot. At the end, as it happens in most of the sci-fi stuff, America saves the world and prove themselves as the guardians of the humanity!! Contradictory to the real world one would assume, anyways a nice watch for Mega sci-fi fans and choosy watchers too.

Well DAMN!!!!!!! Pacific Rim has a well balanced story and Effects combo that carries you with it.The story takes it's time to build up but the movies starts straight in with action and grabs your attention straight away and you can't help keeping on watching to find out what the hell is going on. The comedy geeks were a good addition in my opinion deviating slightly from action and sad background stories.And the action sequences!!! Well they were pretty damn good to say the least. Picture a transformers fight where you can see every single move perfectly, a combination of wrestling and martial arts. If anyone remembers the power rangers zord mode, well the sync inside between the pilots looks the same but cooler and less cheesy. The acting was AMAZING!!!!! Idris Elba was perfectly cast to deliver those lines with a punch (couldn't help but think of him in Luther in some scenes!!) The other actors carried their roles with panache and depth which made it more believable.All in all a good action story which I would easily watch again!!!","21 out of 36 found this helpful.

I have to admit, I find del Toro's films a little undercooked most of the time - I kind of wish he'd return to his earlier, simpler stuff like Cronos and The Devil's Backbone. Even Pan's Labyrinth, in my opinion, lacks personality. The big problem here is with the characters. The lead, Charlie Hunnam (the star of Sons of Anarchy), is about the dullest protagonist in recent memory. Idris Elba, who gave an all-time great television performance in The Wire, is quite boring. About the only two actors who register are Rinko Kikuchi - mostly because she's an adorable Japanese girl - and Charlie Day (of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, a show on which Guillermo del Toro once appeared as an actor), who brings the same manic energy he usually has, and perhaps comes off as a bit too much. Ron Perlman also has a nice little role, little more than a cameo. When there aren't giant monsters on screen, the film can drag. It mostly makes up for that, though, when the action starts. The good, old fashioned monster smashdown does not disappoint. I'd give it a slight recommendation.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The character which the black actor, Ilba plays, commander or the flight squadron, comes across as a handicapped idiot. The main 2 characters,Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori, appear to be in high school the way they relate to each other. I wouldn't even think this movie would be good for a fourth grader to watch.

Therefore I highly recommend to see it at the cinema in 3D as long as it's still possible. The robots (Jaeger) are so big and heavy that, while walking, I had the impression that the floor, beneath my feet, was trembling with every step they made which of course came from the powerful stereo sound. The monsters (Kaiju) are simply huge and terrifying, you cannot tell where their bodies actually start like endless mountains of flesh. These two gigantic forces colliding with each other subsequently leads to (slightly overlong) battle scenes that are to be described as state-of the-art in terms of CGI effects and destructive frenzy being dirty, brute and swept with rain and pacific water; in its magnitude only surpassed by ""Transformers"" and ""The Avengers"" - a real ""Materialschlacht"" as we would say in Germany.With such a premise it's not surprising that the actual actors are more or less pushed into the background. Idris Elba has great charisma in front of the camera, but his role as the commanding officer is noticeably not very challenging due to a lack of diversity in character development which is maybe why he appears a bit stiff in his uniform. The same goes for the other actors who all appear somewhat pale with Charlie Day as a refreshing exception in his role as Dr. Newt adding much to the humor of the movie. The script itself seemingly paying homage to the Asian monster movies nevertheless missing their susceptibility to intransigence and craziness instead orientates itself too much on the usual Hollywood Blockbuster ingredients for success leaving you with the aftertaste that you have seen it all before one way or another (i.e. ""Cloverfield"", ""Godzilla"") thus being rather predictable. Guillermo Del Toro surely did better movies, however, with ""Pacific Rim"" he proved that he is able to maintain a certain standard which perfectly met my expectations albeit not surpassing them so that I cannot but give it a good 6 points out of ten.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The robots are controlled by two pilots who must merge their minds together through a neural link in order to control them. Del Toro uses this theme as a metaphor for how we all must come together in life (accepting each other's flaws and differences and utilizing each other's strengths and empathy) in order to survive and live in peace and happiness. The movie is corny for sure but it's an awesome kids movie with a lot of heart and fanboys should be more than pleased. The story is set in the near future when a portal is opened, in a crevasse beneath the Pacific Ocean, which leads to another dimension. It unleashes giant monsters into our world, called 'Kaiju', which quickly wipe out millions of lives and destroy much of our resources. All the countries of the world unite together to fight the monsters and develop a technology they call 'Jaegers', which are giant humanoid robots controlled by two pilots. The pilots must link to the robots, through a neural bridge, in order to control them. This proved to be too much for a single pilot so two pilots are required to control the robots and must neurally link together, through a process called 'Drifting', in order to do so. 'Drifting' allows the pilots to see into each others minds, and learn the other's deepest and darkest fears, in order to better cooperate and control the giant machinery. The film focuses on one pilot, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who loses his brother (Diego Klattenhoff) while 'drifting' (during a 'Jaeger' battle with an extremely powerful 'Kaiju'). The trauma of the event forces him to retire and the world continues to decay as the 'Jaegers' become less and less effective in battling the 'Kaiju'. The worlds governments eventually give up on the 'Jaeger' program and terminate it. The 'Jaeger' program's commanding officer, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), isn't ready to quit just yet. He comes up with a plan to end the war with the monsters once and for all but he needs Becket to help him carry it out. Becket reluctantly agrees and teams up with a test pilot, named Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), to pilot his old 'Jaeger' (which is named 'Gipsy Danger' and one of only four remaining 'Jaegers'). Mako is very close to Pentecost and has a tragic past involving the 'Kaiju', which causes complications when 'drifting' with Becket. The two must overcome these problems and work together as the 'Kaiju' become an increasingly greater threat. A geek scientist, named Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day, of 'IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA' fame) also becomes intricate in Becket's plan to stop the apocalypse.Del Toro directed and co-wrote the film (with Travis Beacham, who conceived the story idea). Together they really have created an amazing world. I love all the detail and passion that went into creating it and think it really paid off well. Their $180 million budget really went to good use as the film looks spectacular. It's like a beautiful live action cartoon and you really can't go wrong with giant robots vs. monsters (the action scenes are unreal)! It's everything I loved about the movies when I was a kid (this movie would have blown me away). The acting is great (Elba is always too cool, Kikuchi gives a passionate and very strong performance and I could watch Day for hours in a role like this) but the star of this movie really is Guillermo del Toro. He's really outdone himself here. I love movies but I especially like the nostalgic ones that really bring out the kid in me. This is one of those movies and I can't give it high enough praise.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P84p-Ba6JbY","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Unlike movies like ""Fast and Furious 6"", ""Pacific Rim"" gives nothing to talk about, no big action sequence or anything we haven't seen before. The movie is just scenes from other movies put together starting with the definition of Kaijus, kind of like the opening to ""Pulp Fiction"".Kaijus: Colossal alien beasts who rise from an interdimensional portal on the Pacific floor to devastate human cities.Thats all you need to know, there's not much to it apart from that, the movie is what you would expect. Transformers + Godzilla = Power Rangers... or in this case, Pacific Rim.I liked the cast, too bad they've wasted their efforts on making such a poor action film. Well, its actually not bad, but there's not much to it, it gave me the same feeling I got when watching Power Rangers as a little kid. I would watch it, then go run and play and forget I even saw it.Its also safe to say its definitely the loudest movie of the year, its just an average action movie that feels like a failed cash grab by Guillermo del Toro. It does have a few good moments though, like one unexpected death scene I don't want to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, but apart from that its just a wannabe Michael Bay movie.I'd recommend it to anyone who liked ""Top Gun"", ""Independence Day"", ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Transformers"", or ""Armageddon"".","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I went expecting a cut above the usual action movie, but I was amazed at how terrific this was. The screen play seems to be a collection of virtually every war movie and monster movie cliché imaginable--all of which is obviously intended. It's like an intelligent and witty Transformers film, if you can imagine. The film does not try to be trendy and it avoids witty dialog, TG. The stock characters are given stock lines to say, and they do it perfectly. For example, the eve-of-battle speech.At first I was wondering if the director knew that the film was just one cliché, in-joke or film reference after another. There was no doubt that he knew, after I saw the ""Coolant Low"" warning.The 3-D and IMAX were distracting. When (not if) I see it again, it will be in 2-D, which is at least one dimension more than most summer action films lately.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

Shortly into the movie, thanks to Dr. Newton Geiszler (the Kaiju expert/groupie who had a ""neuro handshake"" with one of the monsters) discovers that all Kaiju have the exact same DNA; that the Kaiju are in fact all clones of each other, being created by other alien beings.If the Kaiju were clones with matching DNA, they would look exactly alike; however, no two Kaiju in the movie look alike. Secondly, if the Kaiju are essentially lab-created clones, a Kaiju pregnancy would not arise; however, this occurs in the movie as well.My last point: the Kaiju are amphibious ocean-dwellers, adapted with bioluminescence and crustaceous shells...so why would there be an overtly gorilla-esque Kaiju? If the Kaiju are so great at ""evolving,"" (which also contradicts the clone theory) how and why would there be an obese gorilla-crab? Even with my limited knowledge of biology and zoology, I know gorillas are not renowned for their swimming ability (and by that, I mean they don't swim...at all).","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

On the view of technical performances, nothing but big, huge, and robotics. I can't imagine how genius is Guillermo del Torro to manage his art team. But that's great job! Viewers can feel the feel of being a monster itself, being a big creature. That's why I can't recommend this film on DVD. My last review touches the story and actors.

An updating of Japanese giant monster movies that first were all the rage in the 1950s, Pacific Rim tells a similar story with the benefit of much higher-end visual effects than was possible on the lower budgeted events of eras past. However, Pacific Rim, unlike many Hollywood summer blockbusters, doesn't really skimp on other elements that make for a good film, with attention to character and story along the way. No one will mistake Pacific Rim as a masterpiece, but no one ever said being a blockbuster meant you had to be a bad film.Set in the near future, the Earth has been under constant attack by giant monsters, named Kaiju, that are emerging from a dimensional rift on the floor of the Pacific ocean. To combat the Kaiju, the governments of the world have built the Jaegers, giant, multi-story robots, controlled by two pilots who have melded their minds to prevent the mental strain of manning the Jaegers from turning their brains to mush. One Jaeger pilot, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) gave up the program years earlier when his brother, who was his Jaeger co-pilot, had been killed in a confrontation with a Kaiju. However, since then, the Kaiju have become more dangerous, and the various world leaders have decided to put all their energy into building a giant wall to surround the coastlines of the Pacific from the Kaiju. Marshall Pentecost (Idris Elba) does not believe that will prevent the Kaiju from destroying the planet, so he and the four remaining Jaegers are assembled at Hong Kong to lead a final charge against the Kaiju to stop them once and for all. To man one of the Jaegers, Pentecost has brought Raleigh back into the fold, teaming him up with Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) to help lead the battle, but Raleigh's troubled past, and emotional scars of Mako's own, make the success of the mission seem dubious.Pacific Rim's screenplay written by Travis Beacham and the film's director, Guillermo del Toro, assembles elements that have been well worn in countless other movies. The earth under attack from menacing alien forces, the reluctant hero, the final desperate charge of a rag tag band of survivors, there isn't hardly any aspect that hasn't been lifted from somewhere else. So, while Pacific Rim won't get an A for originality, del Toro and Beacham do an impressive job of assembling the pieces into an entertaining, engaging whole. One key thing del Toro does right is to not transform Pacific Rim into an action orgy, like the recent Transformers films. While you can't accuse Pacific Rim of being without action, the film isn't a constant slog through an endless cycle of action sequences. There is attention given to setting up the plot, and also to establishing the characters and their relationships to one another. Pacific Rim's strongest example of this is the development of Raleigh and Mako's partnership, with more than a hint of romance lurking beneath. The two actors have a distinct chemistry, and that comes across in their scenes together. Like most good movies, Pacific Rim knows that without strong characters, everything else is just a lot of empty sound and images.When the film does provide its action sequences, Pacific Rim largely delivers. It's prime set piece is a large scene about half-way through set in Hong Kong and the surrounding bay. The action is exciting, well staged, and full of energy. del Toro crafts this sequence to maximum effect, getting the adrenaline pumping. Filmmakers that want to see how to stage large scale action should look no further than this major scene. Pacific Rim isn't exactly perfect, though. Two scientist characters, portrayed by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, are intended to be comic relief, but their performances are so shrill and over the top, they quickly become annoying and off putting. del Toro also gives a small role to one of his regulars, Ron Perlman, as a Kaiju organ black marketeer, and while I always enjoy seeing Perlman pop up in anything, here he is largely filer, his character producing a smile at first, but, in the long run, not a very interesting role. Pacific Rim's ending is a bit underwhelming also, as the obvious parallels to other films robs the end of some of its energy. It doesn't ruin the movie, but a fresher conclusion would have been beneficial.Pacific Rim is the blockbuster Summer popcorn film that you generally wish more summer blockbusters would emulate rather than brain dead junk such as Transformers. By working in some nice character material, and allowing the film to breathe between action sequences, Pacific Rim manages to deliver a generally entertaining two hours at the movies. Its not groundbreaking or particularly deep, but for what it is, it delivers the goods.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's a throwback to all those monster movies that played mainly in drive-ins in the 1950s - only here the budget is huge and the stop-motion and claymation techniques used back then have been replaced by the latest in CGI technology.In this 21st Century edition, giant creatures have broken through the earth's crust and are stomping all over many of the planet's largest coastal cities (see ""Godzilla,"" ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms,"" ""The Giant Gila Monster,"" etc. for the roots of these types of films). Humanity's response has been to create an army of giant metallic robots replete with two mind-melded human pilots at the controls (think of it as a WII version of a tank with arms and legs). Charles Hunnam, of ""Sons of Anarchy"" fame, is the hotshot pilot called out of self-imposed retirement - his co-pilot/brother was lost while on a previous mission - to help rescue the world. Rinko Kikuchi is his new partner with some unresolved issues of her own to deal with. Idris Elba, Charlie Day, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini and Ron Perlman (I guess we know what the ""Anarchy"" boys were doing on their time off that year) round out the cast.The plotting is nothing to write home about, and there is way more jabbering, soul-searching and speechifying than is probably called for in a movie such as this - but the intense action scenes, bits of comic relief, and rally-round-the-flag-boys heroics help the popcorn go down smoothly.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

And I was thrilled. What's he up to now? A film about giant robots and monsters fighting each other? That's cool! But wait a minute. This doesn't even sounds like Guillermo. Let's check it out. The movie itself, is actually a mixture of anime inspired robots and monsters, Godzilla, ""Robot Jocks"" and ""Independence Day"". You put all that in one big oven, and you get this noisy thing. I think that film was mostly inspired by anime films just like Robotech, or Macross Saga, that kind of stuff. And really, action scenes, were high voltage, over the top and I was really impressed. The story is set in 2020, where, in the deepest parts of the Pacific ocean, a breach is opened and from it, a massive, extremely large aliens, called Kaiju merges out to take over a planet ( the part about taking over is very much like in the Independence Day). So, humankind develops a 'Jeager' program. The program consists of a piloting a colossal robots to defeat monsters. It really sounds cool from the first moment, but when you see the film that's everything you ever saw before in Japanese, or US monster film, only this have far more outstanding special effects.OK, let's start with the basic stuff CGI is excellent, no complaints here. Music score is good but, it's overused in the scenes, where the music is not even required and it's too dramatic at some points. Writing is a cliché the same story over and over, about a skilled pilot who lost his brother and he asked by the general to go back and help him the usual stuff. Good editing, good camera work, very well in fighting scenes. Well, this movie offers only good fight scenes. The props were good, the robot and monster design was badass, the interior design of robots and their robot base was good. The suits were very much like the one from ""Dead Space"" Isaac Clarke, anyone?Now, the actors. Charlie Hunnam well, this role was easy, so he didn't do much with his character. He is a typical hero that needs to face with his demons. Don't get me wrong, he is a solid actor but, he didn't do much here. Idris Elba is one of the best actors in the film, and he was good, but sometimes, he was from flat to explosive performance. And his character was pretty predictable. Rinko Kikuchi was new to me here, and she did a pretty good job. We got Clifton Collins Jr. he was OK, and we have Robert Kazinsky (best known as Warlow from True Blood), who plays an a-hole pilot with the cutest bulldog ever. And those two scientist my God, the worst characters in the film, they were just yelling at you and the camera, they were so annoying. And we have Ron Perlman, who obviously got stuck in his Hellboy performance, and his character was an a-hole not far from Hellboy Del Toro maybe wanted Perlman here to look like Hellboy, because he was wearing a red pimp-like suit and well, only the golden shoes were an exception. So, I do recommend this film, it's pretty enjoyable and it takes away those two and a half hours pretty fast, but don't have to much expectations because it's a déjà vu film and that makes it crappy.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

A unique blend of Japanese mecha and kaiju that pays homage to those films, Pacific Rim is a film that not only dazzles the senses, but it's also a human story at heart and that's the most important part of any film that has the fate of the world hanging in the balance with epic battles at the forefront. I found this film MUCH BETTER than the Transformers films. Though those films had epic action scenes, the big difference is that you can ACTUALLY see the action; no quick-style-MTV-ADD-riddled editing. The action flows organically along with the story, which is both exciting, fresh, and well-acted. Some of the characters were underdeveloped, but the leads are impressive with great performances throughout.Pacific Rim is one of those films that simply make you say, WOW!!! A really fun time at the movies and a nice change of pace from the gritty blockbusters in theaters now. I hope they get a sequel going because I'm really excited to see what their gonna come up with next.","12 out of 19 found this helpful.

The problem with this film is that the characters just aren't believable and you need some credibility to pull off an action yarn like this. For all its faults, 'Cloverfield' held my attention much more than this tired effort. I watched it with my 17 year old son, who gave up on it about 1/3 of the way through. I must confess that I almost followed him as the first half has very little going for it as it tries desperately to make us care about the characters (and little else). The two scientists are the least believable of all and I got seriously annoyed with the both of them! It picks up a little in the second half but not enough to pull you back in. All in all, a tired, boring, noisy mess. I'm amazed that the film is so highly rated by others here. Oh, I almost forgot; the CGI is passable but only just. It's destined to be forgotten!","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

That basically sums up what I have to say about Pacific Rim. In all honesty when I first heard about this movie I had no intention of seeing it. I immediately thought of a Michael Bay wannabe try to do what he does with a million explosions and no story. I thought giant robots mindlessly fighting Godzilla Cloverfield monsters were stupid. After actually seeing it I can gladly say I was wrong. Was Pacific Rim a mindless violent movie perfect for summer? Kind of, the action in this movie was state of the art. Let me get that out of the way. Seeing a giant robot punching a monster in the ocean was fun. The destruction wasn't over the top either. I was also concerned about the frequency of the action and surprisingly it mixed in well with the story. There was a very good balance between the fighting and the story with the humans and understanding the monsters. There were three of four real fight scenes with monsters and robots and the four scenes were so worth it. They were also really well placed and spread out. There wasn't action scene after action scene. There is one in the beginning, another smaller one or two in the middle, and then the incredible ending.The major concern was the story for me. The acting didn't have to be superb and it wasn't but it was better than I expected. Jax form Sons of Anarchy is the main character and he does a good job but I can't help but think he plays the same guy in everything. There was a scene or two where I saw Jax on screen and not the actual guy. The story itself if basic and is explained in a prologue in the first few minutes and that was probably the best part of the movie. I was glad the movie started in the middle of the war. It was a smart movie in my opinion because the beginning if the war wasn't as important. There was still enough time do dive into the characters and fall in love with them.Charlie Day is in this movie and although I don't think he fit the movie he was a strong addition. He plays an entertaining scientist who studies the monsters and trues to understand them. This was another interesting part of the story I found interesting. This was strength and the biggest weakness. The story was a lot better than I expected but it was rushed. His character and his story were really rushed. He does a few things and meets Ron Pearlman, and he is also awesome in this movie, then he does something else, and then he figures out the big question, thin the movie ends. I wish there was more time spent on the story but then again that would have taken away from the action that drew the audience in. The most interesting part of the story was the robots themselves. In the beginning we learn they were created solely to fight the monsters. The fact that all the world leaders came together and with the technology built these robots quickly. I didn't really buy that 100% but it was something I had to look past but these things are operated by two humans and their better the relationship between the two people, the better the robot it and the better it fights. Wow, awesome, did not see that coming and I loved that. If somebody tried to pilot the robot by themselves their mind basically explodes. It is too much to handle so touché to the movie, I enjoyed it. It adds complexity to these robots and it was awesome. This brought in the aspect of character relationships which is super important in any movie.The relationship between Jax and the Asian girl is strong and necessary. I wrote this review long after I saw the movie so I can't remember names. Anyway, their backstory is really cool something I enjoyed. The flashback with her as a little girl with the monsters attacking was emotional and impactful. The main relationship was between the girl and the general. The general is the best actor in this movie and he does the best job out of anybody. Every leader has a memorable speech before the final battle. I loved Bill Pullman's in Independence Day and in this movie it was good in the moment but by now I can't even remember what he said to make everybody cheer. Overall, Pacific Rim is a good movie with a fair balance of action and story. I saw this movie because people raved and were so excited for it so I had to give it a shot. I went in wanting anything but Transformers and I left with a big smile on my face. It is a great summer blockbuster and is a popcorn movie. It is a good way to spend the day. When it comes out on blu ray I will buy it and watch it with my friends and enjoy it. Other than that it will sit in my cabinet and be watched every now and then. The movie did its job so I give it the WillyT Honorable Mention.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's nice to see a movie with clear fight scenes these days. The movie delivers entirely on the action front.On about everything else, it stumbles.The movie consistently fights with itself whether it is a serious action drama or a comic-booky cheese-fest. There are moments where it is obvious that Del Toro is winking at you but the very next scene contains attempts dramatic dialogue from a dreadfully written one of two main characters. One of the most regrettable pieces of dialog occurs when the main character says ""But Gypsy Danger is analog!"".Although I must admit that I am very partial to Charlie Day and the It's Always Sunny camp, the attempted comic relief relied entirely on the body movements of Charlie Day and Burn Gorman because of the weak script.Pacific Rim would have been much more successful and enjoyable if it solely stuck to being a cheesy comic-book film rather than become a predictable and weak attempt at drama.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

In a way Pacific Rim does what the remake of Godzilla pretty much failed to do, and that was to pay tribute to the original Japenese monster movies where huge creates come out of the ocean and begin wrecking havoc on major metropolitan regions (and Tokyo simply seemed to be a magnet for that). In a way if one could say that this movie was a remake then it would probably be a remake of Godzilla vs Mechatron (if such a movie exists).Basically huge monsters had been appearing out of the Pacific Ocean, and after wrecking havoc on a number of cities, humanity built giant mecha to do battle with them. However due to the fact that the human brain can not control a mecha by itself, they ended up designing them to have two pilots. At the beginning of the movie though one of the mecha messes us and they decided that they will scrap the program and instead build a massive wall around the Pacific Ocean.The problem is that the wall simply does not work, so they decide to go back to fighting the monsters with the mecha, and also looking for a way to block the hole in the Pacific Ocean from where these monsters come. Basically other than this there is really not that much deep to write about the film. Okay, there are the standard themes of the value of team work, and also the idea that somehow we can belay the apocalypse through some rather ingenious plans, or through good old fashioned self-sacrifice, but then one shouldn't really think too deeply about a film that is about mecha beating up monsters.Oh, yes, the film is set in Hong Kong, which is always a winner for me (as long as the film is a good film because there are plenty of films set in Hong Kong that are pretty ordinary, but this film isn't one of them) and it is pretty cool watching the mecha and the monster having a massive fight on Connaught Road in Central District (I love show off how I know the intricacies of Hong Kong). Oh, yes, I should mention that it is pretty slow going for the first half, but then when the monsters come out of Hong Kong harbour and the fight begins then, well, the gloves are off.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

While a cool concept and story, I thought the script was incredibly derivative and saw everything and every cliché coming a mile away. To me, the films biggest sins though are: THE MONSTERS – I thought the designs were bland, unimaginative, uninteresting and unmemorable. Can't remember what they looked like after I left the theater. THE ACTION – Every piece of action in this movie was shot and edited horribly! Horrendous stuffUnforgivable! More weasel on acid cam, more editing by a meth addict on speed, everything I have come to expect, hate and dread in the movies of the last 10 years. To spend most of your budget on special effects and not let your audience get a good look at things is wasteful and frustrating! You could have shot robot puppets on strings, whip panned all over the place and cut it like a coke fiend and saved 99 million bucks! I think that ""Robot Jox"" (Which was made for around 140 million less), was a much better and enjoyable giant robot flick, where you actually get to see what is going on!.

I started to walk out as I thought to myself, here comes the girl/love interest, and poof there she was.1: The script felt like it was written for some action cartoon on the Cartoon Network. Cheesy, annoyingly simple and utterly uninvolved. 2:2: Yet it fit the characters who were, cheesy, annoyingly simple minded and utterly void of any concern for any of them. 3: In this world where every nation bonded together to use some seriously advanced tech to build these huge highly sophisticated jaeger (pronounced jagoff)fighting machines and the incredible tech needed to support,power, and operate them...everything else, and I do mean everything, is circa 1995. If you had an iPhone, people would bow to you as a tech god. 4: Did I mention how annoying and cliché the characters are? Very, and I was thinking throughout the movie, ""why aren't they dying faster"". 5: The various cause and effect used in this movie to ""move it along"" was some of the most dumbest I have ever witnessed on the big screen. The Government's conclusion and decision on the jaeger program, to set the stage of the movie, was beyond full retard, borderline obscene. I can't express how poorly the script, acting, directing and performance was. It was on the level of some action cartoon like pokemon or thundercats. GI Joe was a far better in every aspect. 6: Instead of the world treating this as the apocalypse, just guessing since ""monsters from the sea"" are destroying cities and killing thousands and thousands...and it is just getting worse. The world treats it more of a WWE/MMA road to world championship. No, really...they do. Just ask the fishing industry.7: And seriously when you get down to it. Really big nasty monsters coming from the ocean to destroy mankind, and all we have is big bipedal robots that can't even swim or move, maneuver in the water?? Really? Not even an aquatic version to...you know...go out there in the deep ocean...where the monsters are coming from?","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

"","","Pacific Rim lacks intelligence, but makes up for it with eye candy and loud noises.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2891763/?ref_=tt_urv","movieboy2001","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5668724/?ref_=tt_urv","21 October 2013","Be sure to check out my other reviews and entertainment posts on themovieboy77.comPacific Rim takes place in the not-so-distant future. Where Monsters (referred to as kaiju- Japanese for Monster) are mysteriously coming out of a portal in the ocean. The humans counter attack with huge robots (referred to as jaeger-German for hunter), run by two humans, by connecting their minds through deep secrets and memories so they could synchronize their attacks.The plot is pretty generic and the movie plays out like eye candy. It's easy on the eyes and very low on plot and emotion. You tend to not feel bad for the world because it just seems so easy for the monsters and the robots to destroy it. Obviously, millions are dying but who cares. We are basically watch huge robots and monsters fighting each other to the death ! What else is there that we should care about?I will not take away points from a mindless summer action movie just because it's all action and no depth but I just felt like I couldn't care for anything or anyone who was having bad things happen to them. There was no emotional involvement or enough of a back story for me to get involved emotionally.The actors seemed to be overacting at part and, at times, seemed to be very wooden. I'd feel worse for your character if you just showed me that you actually cared about what's going on. Charlie Day was fantastic as the comic relief. He plays a scientist who is an expert on the Kaiju. I believe Charlie Day is great in every movie he's in and his future is a bright one. You also have a very funny cameo from Ron Perlman, who you may know from Hellboy, who plays a black market Kaiju parts dealer. Rinko Kikuchi, the female lead, was also pretty bad ass. Although, through her intense emotional back story, you found it hard to care about what she went through. The characters don't react to it very well, which is disappointing because her story is the reason why she's involved in the project. Same goes for the lead, Charlie hunnam, who plays Raleigh Becket, who's emotional back story is the beginning to our story. After the beginning, you tend to forget what happens, as you are taken away through the epic battle scenes that take place.I must say, the action scenes were breathtaking and the CGI was just spectacular. I had chills every time a battle scene between the robots and the monsters was happening. Although, at times, it seemed very hard to follow as everything was happening so fast. I did see it in IMAX 3D, which made the experience enjoyable in terms of sounds and feeling, but didn't help the movie as the darker scenes were the scenes that were harder to follow, and more of the fighting scenes happened in the dark and in water. Rain and splashes from water seemed to have gotten in the way of the blows between enemies which made it hard for me to be completely blown away.Pacific Rim was your typical summer popcorn action flick. Lacking intelligence but making it up with visual eye candy and loud noises. Sometimes, that isn't always a bad thing. We expect this sometimes in summer movies. It's what we look forward to. For all of you thinking this is a Transformers rip-off, no need to worry. This is a smarter, darker take on mindless action. Not a lot of explosions or hot girls. Just something to have a little bit of fun with.Grade: B-","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Pacific Rim: The Giant Monster Movie of 2013","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2835994/?ref_=tt_urv","norrisj15","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45250932/?ref_=tt_urv","21 July 2013","Preface: I will not spoil the movie for anyone interested in seeing it. I will provide my opinion on the overarching plot line and general scenario as well as the acting before giving the movie a rating and a recommendation.INTRO:Set in a slightly futuristic world, Pacific Rim in a ode to many of the giant monster movies of the past. For those that remember watching Godzilla versus Mothra, or any of the other hilariously metamorphosed creatures from the creative Japanese minds of the late 1950's and 60's, will feel drawn into the sci-fi world of Pacific Rim. The setting changes from various locations on the Pacific coastline during the film until a final stop at a base in Hong Kong where most of the film's action takes place. ACTING:Animation aside, the acting was surprising good for a film that was less plot and more fight scene. The cast was full of unknown names to me. The sole recognizable face was Charlie Day or Charlie from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. He plays a PhD biologist who isn't afraid to remind people he's a doctor and is interested in learning all he can about the Kaiju. His character is very spastic and full of energy, which reminds me very much of Charlie from Always Sunny. This obviously shows the role wasn't too much of a stretch for Day's acting chops.The lead male role is played by Charlie Hunnam (who upon further investigation stars in Sons of Anarchy, never seen it) who is one of the Jaegar pilots. Charlie's character Raleigh (yep like the city) is a gifted pilot, one of only two pilots to ever be able to operate a Jaegar by himself for any extended period. Charlie plays the role well, interjecting his positive attitude wherever possible (most of the time in the middle of a fight). Raleigh loves to fight and often acts without any idea of self worth when in battle. He is your typical hot shot, selfless hero.The female lead is played by Rinko Kikuchi (never heard of anything she's been in). Her character Mako Mori is also a Jaegar pilot. She goes through an internal, emotional struggle related to the Kaiju and her childhood throughout the film. Overall, her acting is good and she gives enough to have you buy into her character even though much of the plot and motivation of actions by and towards her are questionable. I'd give more about her character, but it would be revealing too much of the plot and ending of the movie.TAKEAWAYS:Overall, if you're walking into the movie to see a visually appealing, monster flick you're in for a treat. If you're looking for any logical plot line or strong character development go see none of the movies currently in theaters and pop in the Se7en DVD sitting in the stack next to the TV. This is a movie that if seen at all should be viewed in the theater. The visual experience of a home TV diminishes the major redeeming factor that Pacific Rim has: the ability to captivate and immerse an audience in a visually stimulating environment.The rating that follows take into consideration the entirety of the movie experience. I would recommend anyone moderately interested to go see Pacific Rim, but the rating reflect the movie in comparison to movies as a whole.RATING:The film gets 3/5 Chuck Norris thumbs ups.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Why do I say this? Because Pacific Rim isn't a direct adaption of any one particle anime series, but rather, a homage to the entire genre as a whole. And all of this from the man who brought Hellboy to the big screen, no less! That said, the Human element in this was a little weak, the romance felt a little forced, and some characters felt too large for life. Case in point, in a movie that features 300ft robots and monsters duking it out and wrecking entire cities in their wake, the only element that felt really too excessive was Charlie Day's performance as the science fellow. The whole effect, ultimately, was the feeling of a comic book, but then again, this is exactly what the director intended, and exactly what we, the viewer, should expect. As you may have guessed by now, I'm a huge geek for anime, manga, kaiju films, and Japanese culture in general, so this movie was everything I could have wanted, and then some! That is why I encourage you all to check it out! In the mean time, I'll be biding my time until another Japanese monster star makes a well-earned and highly anticipated return to the big screen next year. Until then, this is ugyenpeljor signing out.","21 out of 37 found this helpful.

I have seen hundreds of films and this movie is only the 6th that I have awarded a 10/10 to. All this year, I had been anticipating the release of Snyder's Man of Steel, with Pacific Rim coming in at a distant 2nd for my ""Most Anticipated of 2013"" list. Not only was this movie better than Man of Steel, but I am now prepared to say it is one of my favourite movies of all time! Not being impressed by Del Toro's Hellboy, I was a bit anxious when he was directing a movie about giant robots fighting aliens, but my fears were aside with an impressive first trailer. Ever since its release, I have always considered Transformers: Dark of the Moon to contain the best action in any movie (say what you will about Michael Bay), but that has now been figuratively shat on by Del Toro proving that there is a healthy middle- ground between heart-pumping ""mindless"" action and the making of a great movie. Giant robots fighting enormous aliens - it's not just for meth-heads anymore... Incredible film!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It wasn't a let down! It's absolutely stunning, even the monsters are beautiful(in their own gruesome way). The director Guillermo del Toro did a fantastic job! The acting and the effects are amazing. I loved the details that were put into the film(rust on the Jaegers;chipped paint on their Jaeger suits,so on). My favourite Jaeger is Gypsy Danger(a bit too obvious,eh?). Another thing I love about the film is the unique way of showing aliens. The aliens are obviously from another planet but they come trough a portal that is deep into the ocean,they are intelligent despite how they look and above all they clone themselves and send clones to do the ""dirty"" work. They are truly unique. I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves robots and monsters and the everlasting battle between good and evil.","32 out of 60 found this helpful.

But, as ""Pacific Rim"" which is subliminally forced to put in an unexpected competition for reviving childhood memories of those who grew up watching Godzilla or Transformer, when it is merely made to give us an entire new perspective about ""How to defeat Monsters if they really happen to attack earth."" So here it goes, it rocks harder than all the present monstrous movies because 1. There are detailed and logical explanations for the origin of the monsters that let you not only experience immersive and inconceivable scenes but comprehend the story without being perplexed by sloppy settings.2. Massive details on robots aka Jaegers unleashes the magnificence of their luster, mechanical textures, and operational systems that were created by stunning Visual effects and efforts of stunts.3. Again, there are tremendous details on monsters aka Kaiju that not only it looks realistic but possesses jagged skin with frightening body structure that can easily threatens even a giant 250-feet tall robot.4. The movements and actions during the battles are wonderfully depicted without shifting too fast which often results us in confusion for ""Who hits who? or How does it that happen?"" You can vividly enjoy spectacular motions that occur in both city and ocean environments along with dynamic camera angles. 5. Every character play the role with vehement passions. I agree with some of the lines and expressions being quite shallow and cheesy. However, if compared to emotional relationships and conflicts between characters that this film offers, the acting part can be forgiven as no other counterparts have as much scientific explanations and a compelling story as this one. It is so mega from the intro to the end.","19 out of 33 found this helpful.

It's like watching Power Rangers. As good as the CGI was at one point I was convinced I was watching actors in rubber/metal suite fight over a miniature city. In fact it's like watching those old Japanese Godzilla movies, but nowhere near as good (and they were bad).It was painful watching this. The acting is horrendous. And just when you think it can't get any worse, it gets worse. I honestly can't even remember what any of the characters names were and I only watched it 1 hour ago.Honestly I feel sorry for kids if this is the future of Hollywood blockbusters.

So there isn't a dull moment in the film. There isn't a weak link on the acting front either, Idris Elba stands out though. The background score by Ramin Djawadi deserves a special mention.

"6","/10","Entertaining, but like most summer blockbusters, it rings hollow","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2836004/?ref_=tt_urv","Staffenburgen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur35191595/?ref_=tt_urv","21 July 2013","Let me start this review by saying that I am in no way familiar with this genre of film. That being said, I am quite familiar with Guillermo del Toro, and I have always admired his ability to emotionally attach the audience to his characters. In his previous films, like Hellboy and Pan's Labrynth, the audience was equal parts captivated by the human elements of his characters and by his visionary approach to CGI. Walking in to Pacific Rim, I was expecting something along those lines; a movie with beautifully crafted special effects with delicate attention to story and character. Unfortunately, this film is much more traditional in its approach to being a summer blockbuster. As per the usual, it doesn't waste any time building suspense or developing characters. By the end of the first minute, we've already seen a massive Kaiju destroy a city. How this Kaiju came to be there is glossed over in a 30 second monologue. To me, I would've preferred a more detailed explanation of such things; already it seemed apparent that the story would take a backseat to the CGI. And that's pretty much how this movie went. The story and the characters within it are all flat and boring, and are portrayed by clearly uninspired actors. Not enough time is given to the story; all of the time (and budget) has clearly been allocated to the special effects. Now, I see several people fiercely defending this movie, and they are all saying that people shouldn't see movies about robots fighting aliens if they expect a top-notch story and some inspired acting. This defence just doesn't work for me.It might sound so far like I hated this movie, but I really didn't. It is an average summer blockbuster, nothing more, and the only reason I am disappointed is because arguably one of modern cinema's better directors is at the helm. That being said, this film does do one thing right. When the Jaegers and the Kaiju clash, the results are nothing less than spectacular. The scope of these fights is quite unlike anything I have seen in rival blockbusters, and was a real treat in 3D. The key to enjoying this film is to expect a simple blockbuster movie with some serious eye-candy. Don't make the mistake I did and expect anything more. RATING: 6/10","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The result is mega sized robots controlled by a two man team.The storyline is so thin it is almost impossible to comprehend. Since I Watch loads of Movies I wouldn't say that story lines like this is super rare but Close enough.The acting is, well, not Oscar material if you get my drift and neither is the dialog. However, Idris Elba (Prometheus) is good as Always and it is nice to see Charlie Hunnam in something different from Sons of Anarchy.I had absolutely no expectations on this Movie and I thought it was just going to be pure Entertainment. And I was right too. But as Entertainment for the moment it works and the Entertainment is high class all the way, surprisingly so. I Thought the fighting scenes were pretty good and cool and it was what saved the Movie for me.What I would like to see more of in a separate Movie or wanted to have seen more of in the Movie is the theme of connecting to minds into one, I Think there is a good story for a Movie there.See this one if you like Transformers and Godzilla.

Special effects were good, both the robots (a.k.a Jaegers) and the monsters (a.k.a Kaiju) were well polished and looked realistic. The action went on and on leaving me squeezing the chair waiting to see how it's going to end. So - special effects: check; action: check. These are most important things that an action movie must have for the viewers to have a good time. However, the biggest problem for me was the whole 3D thing. It just doesn't work for me as well as the old 2D. Just like in the Avengers it was ruining the movie for me to enjoy it at it's fullest. You simply can't notice little details that make the movie so wonderful. I must mention that the acting wasn't so remarkable either. The dialogs were short, but at some parts completely unnecessary. It wasn't very noticeable since it's an action movie so people came to see giant robots fighting giant monsters and how delightful it was for everyone to get what they wanted.I don't know what's wrong with adventure and/or action movie creators, but it seems like they can't leave out cheesy jokes out. And what a big deal they make out of it - the joke scene must be emphasized even if it's very short it can't be a minor. Of course one joke isn't enough, when I saw the first one, I smiled a little thinking - yeah, it was OK, after a while, the second joke was forced in the movie and... I don't know, I just facepalmed. Perhaps I'm just making this too much of a deal, but such little things sting me like a bee.Another small thing that made me frown was that a little bit more thought in underwater sound effects could have been put. I mean come on, creatures that can walk the surface and roar, can't just scream underwater. Also the plot is kind of predictable, but not all of it! At some point I decided to take sip of my drink, apparently it was very bad timing, because at the same moment an unexpected jump scare-like scene started and I spat the drink on my knees. My point is that you know what the characters must do, who lives and who dies, how the movie is going to end, but you don't know how they are going to do it. I hope that sentence made sense. So, Pacific Rim is worth watching in a movie theater simply because it's so beautiful and full of action with no secret puns - just robots vs monsters. Some moments are indeed annoying, but they were nothing compared to the excitement that I felt afterwards.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Giant behemoths dealing punches, superimposed over general population, produces a feeling of wonder and awe that, I'm sure, del Toro captured unerringly. Adrenaline powered speeches and last minute heroics really made me feel like child again. I had the whole cinema cheer and boo at the screen on various occasions, and the demographic was from 3 to 93 years of age. Feeling is similar to Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" through out.

I really liked some of his films, especially ""Pan's Labyrinth"", but this film, despite its merits, has nothing to do with that and doesn't even seem to be from the same director.The best thing about this film is the extremely high production values. Visually, the film is amazing and it's really nice to watch. We've got great visuals, stunning cinematography, and an absolutely immersive dose of high-quality CGI. In addition, the film has very well-made sets and costumes, thought out in detail and indisputably expensive. The special effects department, despite all the computer graphics used, also had a series of good opportunities to show its value, and it never failed to do so. The editing is good, the cuts are barely felt and the pace of the film is extremely pleasant. All good reasons to see the film, which was a great blockbuster.Director Del Toro, I have no doubt, had the courage to take a risk on a film that looks like nothing I've seen of him. However, and as I said, he is good, he is creative, and he is a perfectionist in his work, assuring us of an impeccable job in this film. The cast has great actors, and all of them were at the best level. Idris Elba is, for me, the most notable and the best of them all, but I also appreciated the efforts of Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Day. The worst performance came from Ron Perlman, but this is largely due to the poor conception of the character, who is a crude caricature of a common drug dealer with no taste. Charlie Hunnam, honestly, was an actor that I completely missed. I felt that not only did he lack the charisma and ability to hold the audience and be the protagonist, but he also lacked the skills for the task.I deliberately left the script for the end because, for me, this is where all (or almost) of the film's problems lie. The script is based on an alien invasion of Earth: coming from the bottom of the sea, aliens take the form of gigantic monsters, forcing the entire planet to unite and create metal monsters capable of breaking their faces. The first problem is the illogicality of these premises: how and when did aliens arrive in our world, and how could they penetrate the Earth's crust? This is not explained, nor how countries funded the construction and maintenance of such metallic machines, nor how they manage to walk and fight in an ocean as deep as the Pacific. How did they withstand the heat of the planet? How did they withstand the pressures on the ocean floor? The battles against the monsters almost always take place in the coastal area next to the big cities, threatened, in a clear allusion to films like ""Godzilla"" or ""Transformer's"". The dialogues also lack any kind of authenticity. The movie simply makes up for it all with tons of action.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It doesn't get more childhood fun than this. The designs are beautiful and original with both the robots and monsters. There is nothing more youth affirming than playing with these toys.

I find it hard to believe that anyone could not enjoy this spectacular movie, and find it disheartening to see that it's beaten in the office box. I didn't know what to expect when I walked into the theater today. I hadn't really watched the trailers with any particular interest, and the only reason I came to see it was because I'd heard that GLaDOS would be voicing the computers in this. I'd been slumped in my seat, expected to be bored (because of the title), but I was blown away the moment the movie began. I definitely did not expect to see what would carry on throughout the movie, a spectacular sight to behold.There's such a variety of aliens in terms of design, and it really brought me to the edge of my seat, squealing like a fangirl at all of it. The robots were great as well, bringing with it the fiery love I have for the Transformers movies. The human characters themselves, I came to like as well, despite my resilience for liking any human character in a live action film. I felt for them during scenes, and adored the portrayal that many of the actors/actresses nailed on the spot. They came off to me as people that I could see in real life (namely the two scientists). I didn't see any lull in the movie whatsoever. I was constantly drawn to the screen with things that I love. I saw/thought of many references throughout the film, which made it more pleasing to watch as I could relate back to those things. It's like a giant conglomeration/fanfiction crossover. Aliens, Transformers, Real Steel (though I haven't actually watched it yet), Evangelion, Godzilla, Hellboy, Portal (this is the most prominent one, and the one that drew me to the movie in the first place), 2012, and much more. I don't see why anyone would give this movie less than an A unless they were asking to be the bad cop in this reviewing scene. And I'm not stopping at one viewing. I can't wait to see it multiple times, both in normal and 3D, over the next two weeks. It's not a movie that you can see just once. There are so many things to see, and this glorious movie deserves all the attention it can get. Best live action/CGI movie I've seen since Transformers (I'm talking about the CGI on this one, because I don't care as much for the script). I'd say this is my new favorite movie, and I don't play favorites easily.","18 out of 32 found this helpful.

It's Godzilla monsters causing mayhem in an updated way.Less cheesy than the Transformers films, in fact maybe a little bit too po-faced here and there. Del Toro delivers enough action, mayhem and destruction in Pacific Rim.The plot is generic. The film is set in the 2020s, when Earth is at war with the Kaijus, colossal monsters from a dimensional portal on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.To combat the monsters, humanity created the Jaegers; gigantic humanoid mecha's each controlled by at least two pilots who have initial success but the monster keep on returning stronger than ever.Piloting the Jaegers we have standard characters such as a cocky operator, a plucky rookie and a burnt out maverick with bad memories of the past. They put the their differences behind them and learn to work together as the threat the planet face intensifies. Idris Elba is the one who is in charge of them all.There is comic relief from two bickering scientists and more zaniness when Ron Perlman turns up as a gangster.Del Toro provides some added cheese to go with the action and a little depth as well. A few plot holes but the film is still enjoyable fun.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The enduring fights between them are flat and listless and become very tiring during the movie.In my opinion many of the actors could do a lot better. Best examples are Ron Perlman or Idris Elba who we know for better acting. Their roles are not deep enough for high performance acting anyway.The Story is weak and very predictable. There are too few surprises and no suspense at all. Good example is the story of Mako Mori. Viewers easily know what is going to happen and what her part in the movie will be.From my point of view they just stringed many special effects together to distract from the simpleminded storyboard.

They story made the action scenes mainly concerning the Kaiju & Jaeger, in between scenes we learn that it takes at least 2 human souls in order to pilot a Jaeger so in between the immense action we get very well written characters each having a story I was interested in finding more details about. Well worth the trip to see this in IMax + 3D. The action sequences were shot in native 3d while the interactions and backstory scenes were all done in 2d so this also fits perfectly. Easily and seemingly effortlessly stands tall and above any and all action movies especially in the last 5 years. The effects implementation is characteristically above current top notch as del Toro is known for doing. The story and characters had me wanting more and thinking of how this could set up so many possibilities. The fact that the massive expansive environments which energized the all out action scenes are equally as interesting due to the handling of the characters expansive back stories and emotional facets elevates this wonderful result from the entire film crew involved really testifies to what a well crafted cinematic experience can be and the magic such a passionate creation may invoke.An adroitly conceived and executed work of cinematic artistic innovation.

With the lackluster performances from Martini and Kazinsky (a Brit and an American), you could have hired pretty much any Australian guy off the street to do better. And why are Aussie characters so often mean and have bull-dogs? Being stupid and having bull mastiffs would make more sense - or being stoners with an old collie or a cattle dog.

I mean, what else does a film obsessed kid do when he's bored in the Summer? Well, he makes a movie of course. However, what type of movies? There were no other kids around in my neighborhood to use as actors, so I made monster movies. Some of the times these movies starred our cat, but seeing as how living creatures were more difficult to work with, most of my monster movies starred a marionette creature or stuffed animals, with action figures playing the human roles. There were no scripts, just my imagination literally making everything up as I went along with our Hi-8 video camera in tow. All of this to say, I've always loved monster movies, and Pacific Rim may just be one of the best, if not the most original monster movies ever made.What makes Pacific Rim so original is that it mashes up two Japanese film genres, those of the giant monster and the giant robot, and creates a movie that is unlike anything that Western audiences have ever seen before. Pitting giant robots versus giant monsters was a genius idea that I wish I had come up with, and screenwriter Travis Beacham deserves huge kudos for coming up with the idea. The thing is though, this film wouldn't be worth watching if it didn't manage to have more going for it than just giant robots and giant monsters. Beacham and director Guillermo Del Toro go beyond that simple idea and actually have created likable characters and an involving story to go along with the awesome spectacle, and that's why Pacific Rim should be considered one of the best monster movies ever made.If you've ever seen any Godzilla movie or episode of Japanese animation (i.e. anime) featuring giant robots, then you will recognize all of the character types that exist in this movie. Pacific Rim is really like anime brought to life in live action, and if this movie can achieve such believable results, then can a live action Mobile Suit Gundam movie be far behind? One can only hope, but for right now, as a fan of anime and Japanese entertainment, Pacific Rim manages to introduce American audiences to all of the Japanese film and anime tropes that many of the kids in my generation have been in love with for our entire lives. However, I don't want anyone reading this who has never seen any anime or previous monster movies to think that this movie is not for them.Pacific Rim is really a movie for anyone who just loves a good time at the movies. It's fun, action packed, and is emotionally involving. Unlike so many Summer blockbusters that take themselves too seriously, Pacific Rim manages to balance the humor with the seriousness to create a lighthearted adventure film that still carries weight and consequence through the character's actions, but you're having a blast while the world is literally on the brink of destruction. Guillermo Del Toro treats this film as if it's like a propaganda film from the WWII days, where he's idolizing the pilots of these giant robots, trying to inspire humanity with hope and optimism to actually rise up and meet the monsters rather than getting crushed under their feet. Of course, I'll reiterate this point, had the characters not have worked, neither would have this movie. The characters and their relationships with one another are what gives this movie dramatic heft when it most matters, to where when we reach the action, it's not just mayhem for the sake of mayhem, it actually means something.In case you haven't noticed, I loved Pacific Rim. Few movies are this imaginative and this much fun, and that's the main thing to take away from this movie. From a design standpoint, this is one of the more meticulously crafted made up worlds I've seen in recent years, and that is a testament to Del Toro's gifted cinematic eye. The action is stand up and cheer awesome, thanks to amazing FX work from Industrial Light and Magic. As for the characters, none of them would work if the actors playing them weren't so likable, from Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, and Charlie Day, to the emotionally vulnerable performance from Rinko Kikuchi, they're the ones that actually make us care about the story. Bottom line, this isn't another Summer blockbuster trying to play off of post-9/11 fears and anxieties, it's literally a movie about the goodness of humanity and the power of the human spirit to work together when it's most needed, and who doesn't want to see that?I give Pacific Rim a 9 out of 10!","16 out of 28 found this helpful.

This is absolute drivel. Had so many Hollywood movie clichés I was cringing through out the whole film. I would love to go into depth about what I mean but it gives away pretty much everything that happens in the film but if you have seen top gun its pretty much that. Also it has one of the biggest movie plot flaws right at the end of the film that I just cant get out of my mind. Hollywood also tends to either make a brit in the film a villain or a complete cretin. Point and case in the form of Burn Goman. He was great in Torchwood but in this he was a dithering fool that I can only assume was put in there as comic relief that never worked.Idris Elba though was the stand out performance for me with an outstanding scene were he put down the hero so it wasn't all bad. The fight scenes were also pretty good and not as much as a mess as the transformer films were you cant tell whats going on as one robot melds into another. There was none of that here. It was good old mech on Japanese creature porn. So if they release it on DVD just edited down to the fight scenes id buy it. but leave in the story which is just top gun sci fied up a bit and the terrible acting I wont be sad if every copy is burnt in a fiery blaze by Godzilla's cousin.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Gundams, Evangelions, Laganns all relied on the pilots mind as well as skill which is fully represented in Pacific Rim.I can agree with people questioning the methods used to fight giant aliens and most people would assume large caliber weapons from distance rather than close combat but remember this is a world that invested trillions into a robot fighting force lets all pretend its a great idea...also remember it worked wonders for humanity until larger monsters started to break through. Character progression was rather dull the pilots generally don't all agree with one another. In a Hollywood film you're stuck on rails anyways so the love interest, father figure, jerk, and clueless scientist are all present and overall done well considering they are designed to be those characters not reinventing the wheel. The combat, Devastation and unique art style all gave this film an incredible environment. In full 1080 on a big screen surround sound you can start to think this is what a Gundam movie might look like if Americans embraced it.Sadly most people who watch this film will be turned off by the worlds technical settings and obvious attempts to recreate Japanese anime. Fact is North Americans are not exposed to that media and are not familiar personally I found this movie to be excellent. Forget about how a robot could stay submerged with hull breaches, forget the fact that the machine can get tossed around and the nuclear core doesn't blow, hell forget about the fact that the aliens didn't just open more rifts and send the whole army.Its an excellent experience if you want giant robots fighting giant aliens with huge explosions and flashing lights.","16 out of 28 found this helpful.

This movie was, at the very least, a helluva good time. It did have it's issues; the biggest of which was some dialog that was less the amazing. The delivery and the writing prevented it from being something truly spectacular. That being said, this movie provides endless amounts of visual stimulation. The fight scenes were well choreographed and well shot. Guillermo Navarro outdid himself with this visual gem; it's easy to understand why Guillermo Del Toro has used him on most of his films. The story allows for a lot of imagination and doesn't feel the need to address all of the points of the world it created. I appreciate that in a film. The other portion of this film that I love is the ending. It lets the climax taper of naturally, a rare thing in modern cinema. Too many movies have to answer so many questions at the end that it gets drug out far too long. Not Pacific Rim, it wraps everything up in a neat package and sends us on our way. Will this movie be a historical masterpiece? Hell no, but what it will do is remind you of how to have fun at the movies.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, this film is no sell-out; it is clearly a Guillermo Del Toro movie, maybe not as much as 'Pan's Labyrinth' or 'Hellboy' were, but a Guillermo Del Toro movie nonetheless. It is possibly his most personal – he said one of the reasons he made was ""to reconnect with his inner eleven year old"", being inspired by all the Kaiju movies he marvelled as a child.The film opens with a narration by the protagonist, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) chronicling how giant monsters (Kaijus) emerged from a portal in the Pacific Ocean and began to destroy cities. In response, mankind developed giant robots (called Jaegers) piloted by two people to destroy them. Now, with the threat worse then ever, Jaeger commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) calls Raleigh back into action so that they can ""cancel the apocalypse"".'Pacific Rim' might not be as deep or nuanced as some of Del Toro's previous work, but as a giant monster movie it's faultless. You want giant robots hitting giant monsters? You got it. The action sequences here are some of, if not the best, the Mexican filmmaker has directed, they're easy to follow, beautifully staged, exciting and most importantly, great fun to watch. When hero Jaeger, Gypsy Danger, pummelled a Kaiju with a large ship, I couldn't help but smile. And that's one of the best things about the movie – it is pure fun from start to finish, making a nice change from the dark, brooding blockbusters that are around today. It has a light tone with some silly humour (courtesy of the zany scientist duo) and a lovely cameo from Del Toro regular Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau (continuing the film's line of brilliantly-named characters).Sure, you could criticise the film for having one-dimensional characters, clunky dialogue and a thin plot, but when said film is so exuberantly fun, these things don't matter one bit. I was always engaged with the characters, rooting for them as they battled the Kaiju, despite the fact that they weren't exactly original creations. This is undoubtedly helped by the fact that performances are solid all-around, particularly Idris Elba who makes the often cheesy 'call-to-arms-speech' rousing. As pure entertainment, this is one of the best films of the year so far, it's a Kaiju movie that also looks and feels like a live- action anime film. Robots vs. monsters? 'Pacific Rim' does what it says on the tin and frankly, that's enough.","16 out of 28 found this helpful.

And that's pretty much it. In the first minutes of the movie the whole story is so quickly summed up that it makes you wonder if it was something the editor felt he should throw in a couple of hours before the first screening. And then there's little left of a story to tell after that, so the easy solution is, of course, a lengthy bombardment of intense monster-mash- robot-high-tech extravaganza. In addition to this, it doesn't really have much potential to be a movie that you remember for being very distinct (giant monsters trying to destroy the world, mankind desperately defending itself, etc). And as for what the characters goes, You hardly remember them by the time the credits are done. There's no time to bond with them in any way between all the fighting scenes. If you can't really bring yourself to care about whether the monsters or the humans win in the end, you know something has gone wrong. Pacific Rim has fallen into the CG-trap, emphasizing visuals and forgetting about the story. Someone are sure to be blown away by all this, if they are into that sort of movies. I for one, was not.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

The performances are spot on and the actors really do make you care for the characters even with very little development or exposition. I liked the fact that the movie is its own sequel. Meaning, they cut through all the origin and set up of this world in the first 15 minutes. It's like a built in fast forward button. As it was unfolding, I kept thinking to myself that they are skipping over some pretty big and important stuff. Stuff we'd like to see and maybe should have seen. Yet, that wasn't really the case because what was left perfectly fit the story and certainly delivered the monster VS giant robot action everyone paid to see. The monsters are truly frightening and the CGI very well done. This film's budget has made news but at least it felt like they spent everything on screen.Overall, this was a very fun trip to the cinema.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

There are very few exceptions and I decided to give Pacific Rim a chance since it was made by an apparently desperate for work Guillermo del Toro playing well outside his comfort zone. His familiar insectoid imagery is briefly present, but for the most part this is new, and unsuitable, ground for him. I understand that he just had to get a big movie done after leaving the Hobbit and so many false starts for his adaptation of At the Mountains of Madness (a film that doesn't really need to exist as John Carpenter's The Thing is about as close as you can get to it) though Pacific Rim was the wrong script to choose.Set in the near future a portal between our universe and a universe filled with giant monsters opens up beneath the ocean and said monsters barge through and cause mass destruction. Yup, it's yet more 9/11 porn, a sub-genre that was already tiresome and overdone before this movie even came out.In order to fight the monsters the world government builds giant mechs to dish out a good old clobbering, sometimes with the help of a handy container ship just sitting nearby. The mechs are piloted mainly by twins or by close siblings who can symbiotically fight back using opposite hemispheres of the brain. As expected there is conflict between the pilots and disrespect for authority in between smash-ups.The actors are mainly cursory as without them the movie would be entirely CGI. The Japanese chick is hot, but Charlie Hunnam is neither good nor terrible, and I really don't understand the hype built around Idris Elba. The only ones I liked were Ron Perlman's black market dealer and Charlie Day as the excitable scientist.At 131 minutes the movie is overlong and there are a few small scenes that could have snipped. With a careless $190 million dollar budget Pacific Rim was lucky to not bomb as bad a predicted. This really, really is not intelligent sci-fi. It's braindead, candy-colored mayhem for angry teens with ADHD. I am so surprised that del Toro would make a movie like this, the material is beneath him.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

To face the threat, the world unites to build giant robots that, controlled by pairs of soldiers mentally linked to each other, try to contain the growing threat. Commanded by Marshal Stacker (Idris Elba), these warriors include the valiant Raleigh (Charlie Hunnan), traumatized by his brother's death in combat, and the determined Mako (Rinko Kikuchi), who fights to earn the chance to guide one of the robots and avenge the death of his family.Guillermo Del Toro, who also worked on the script, doesn't waste much time detailing the origin of the monsters. Using a somewhat dull but necessary off-screen narrative, we hear Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam, from Sons of Anarchy) talking about the near-apocalypse and how the Jaeger saved the world. And with that, we're immediately thrown into the action, with Raleigh and his brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) piloting Gipsy Danger against a monster. Arrogant and self-assured, the brothers are beaten like a thief and, along with the announced tragedy, comes the downfall of the Jaegers. The Mexican director pilots the film with the certainty of the Becket brothers, but completely without arrogance. He knows that the material is basically a collage of clichés, but he also knows that not every cliché needs to be worked on carelessly. Your exquisite attention to detail.It is, as is easy to see, a fanciful idea, but one that - thanks to Del Toro's intelligent and ambitious approach - even gains a certain dramatic weight by evoking the threat to the future of humanity represented by the invasion of monsters. Thus, while Michael Bay's Transformers sound like confusing and boring nonsense, ""Pacific Rim"" keeps the viewer always involved by creating long action sequences that, in addition to being understandable in their mise-en-scene (something that Bay seems incapable of create), differ from one another even through the setting of conflicts, which can occur at sea, in cities, in the air or at the bottom of the ocean, also involving different and growing strategies and risks. Benefiting from a spectacular production design (trademark of the director's productions), the feature already succeeds in portraying the robots as machines clearly worn out by use and time, showing stains, scratches and defects in their bodywork, which immediately gives them a surprising verisimilitude. Furthermore, while the Transformers (sorry, but the comparison is unavoidable) move excessively fast, denouncing their digital nature, the Jaeger (as the robots are called here) move heavy and slowly, which - even though created by computers - suggests mechanical and, consequently, more realistic effects. Meanwhile, the monsters surprise with their diverse appearances, which range from sharks to dinosaurs, often hinting at their alien natures through subtle details like fluorescent lines that run through their bodies or multiple eyes that exhibit an inexplicable glow.In the same way, ""Pair of Fire"" devotes immense attention to detail to the rest of its universe, from the gigantic complex that houses the troops and robots commanded by Marshal Stacker to the overpopulated, neon-laden Hong Kong that serves as the setting for much of the second act of the projection. Of course, here and there, the visual effects become more obvious - and the first time Raleigh enters the complex, for example, it's easy to tell from actor Charlie Hunnam's movements as he walks on a moving walkway in front of a green. Screen -, but these moments are relatively rare, since most of the time the film impresses with its scale and the competence of the effects. Meanwhile, Kate Hawley's costumes are adept at suggesting the characters' personalities subtly (Clifton Collins Jr.'s controller's conservative suspenders) or more cartoonishly (Ron Perlman's gold shoes and velvet suits), while whereas the photography by Guillermo Navarro, Del Toro's regular partner, well explores the dark mood of the night sequences, leaving to bring a bright and cloudless day only when it serves a clear narrative purpose.Incidentally, the drawings of gigantic beings and machines lend personality to elements of the cinematographic composition. What Del Toro does is what Shawn Levy did in ""Giant Steel"" in a way. We care as much about inanimate beings as we do about the huge monsters that populate our screens. We know their names; we twist and vibrate as if they were human characters. And the same goes for the soldiers, scientists and smugglers we see on the scene. They are all basically one-dimensional, with unique and specific functions within the plot, but even so, Del Toro works angles and cameras focused on their faces so that we live what they live. In a rough analysis, Raleigh would be just another bully who thinks he's invincible, but Del Toro, when casting Hunnam for the role, had one goal: to humanize the stereotype. The same goes for casting Idris Elba in the role of Marshal Stacker Pentecost. He poses, gestures and speeches straight out of cardboard characters, but the framing, emotion, intensity and shred of backstory and speeches (""Today, we will cancel the apocalypse!"") that Del Toro and Elba imprint on the character, end up taking it from the basics and turning it into something truly memorable.The pair of scientists, Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman), are comic reliefs that Del Toro uses to the limit of reason, perhaps going a little further. The two actors work well in their antagonistic roles, almost like two of the three Stooges, but in a film that no longer takes itself seriously, their presence could have been cut here and there, especially since the tip of the always great Ron Perlman, as the smuggler Hannibal Chau (another sensational name, isn't it?) is already worth all the comic relief the tape needs. Deserving credit for being a rare action film that does not hesitate to bring a strong female character - and whose gender is never pointed out by the companions, making her strength something even more natural -, the feature is populated by creatures that, although not exactly complex, are embodied with such commitment by the great cast that they become engaging and memorable figures. Rinko Kikuchi, introduced to international audiences in ""Babel"", lends strength and intensity to the brave Mako.An instant familiarity is established between the narrative and the spectator, like knowing that the Jiraiya ninja on TV will almost always defeat his opponents with a frontal or lateral sword, director Guillermo Del Toro knows what I need (because he remakes scene by scene this game of promise and delivery) and has the courtesy to respond to that desire with a festival of colors and sounds. If this game works, in good measure, it's because everything in the film encourages our suspension of disbelief. Although the plot takes place in real places in the Pacific, the world there is obviously saturated, like an R-rated rave, a cross between Evangelion and 2046 where the characters have fantasy names like those used in the chat room (Hannibal Chau? Stacker Pentecost?).""Pacific Rim"" advocates caricatured, painless destruction, at a time when documentary aesthetics strip disaster cinema of its level of escapism. Unlike blockbusters that end up hostage to the cause-and-effect relationships imposed in their ultra-detailed premises, ""Pacific Rim"" invents two or three far-fetched terms at the beginning - neural handshake! - but in the end, what matters is that there is a button in the robot's cockpit with a sword design, where it says ""sword"", and that activates an incredible sword.Exciting and fun in its sheer surrender to the playful fantasy of gigantic creatures clashing in our world, Pacific Rim still brings unexpected, almost nonsensical moments of humor (such as the one involving Newton's pendulum), although it also fails to often indulge in the obvious. - and any viewer who has already seen half a dozen works of this genre will easily anticipate the main events of the plot. To make matters worse, the fact that the initial voice-over narration ends up being discarded after fulfilling the function of facilitating the exposition ends up presenting itself as a primary and easily avoidable narrative incongruity. As if that were not enough, the project is still victimized by the need to reach a low-ranking indication, which forces it to ignore the consequences of the colossal destruction caused by the battles, which, although causing hundreds of thousands of deaths, do not leave any trace of blood. Or corpses, lessening the impact of events.With that, the film fails to forge any emotional connection with the spectator: we vibrate with the battles, we are carried away by the vitality and energy of the narrative, but we do not experience any feeling in relation to the fate of the characters, whether they were happy or tragic. Still, it's impossible for us to leave the screening room without a clear feeling of a warm return to childhood. Shallow dialogues praising the need for union, overcoming and heroism, contaminated by some voluntary humor, help to flatten the characters even more. Not even cheap sentimentality can make up for the lack of depth. In fact, it just undermines any consistent development. With all that, better relax in your chair and enjoy the action scenes - if you can.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There was no humor in this movie, lots and lots of padding with dogs, pathetic small talk love story, ego filled scenes, etc etc.. There was no rapport with the characters, and I just did not care if they died or not, it was a stale experience.I'm just glad the pain is over and I can purge this very bad movie from memory, one of the worst movies of all time.","20 out of 40 found this helpful.

"","","Acosmic bash","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2884857/?ref_=tt_urv","chaos-rampant","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17699578/?ref_=tt_urv","11 October 2013","This has a bit more personality and atmosphere than Bay's corporate burger joint next door, but in the kitchen it prepares basically the same greasy food. Taking a vague look, from afar, it repeats all the same clichés: hope is lost, regained, a rousing speech wires us for a last fight, scientists come up with a last-minute solution, then the noble sacrifice, the false death. However, if you can ignore the smell coming from the kitchen, you may appreciate a few nice things on the walls. There is a definitive style at work: colors, lights, movements. Some nice translucent environments. We also have a subjective eye in the fights, ordinary at this point but done well. Half the gamble here is to create visual comprehension: in order to visually grasp the fights we need to be placed, need something that creates human scale. It's why in the first fight there is the fishing boat, so that looking up from the deck we can acquire apparent size and distance. The other half is gravity in the eye. We have it here, some breathtaking occasions. Del Toro employed people who really understand their physics, how things ought to move and impact so that we inherit the blow. My favorite bits are during the flight to space, inside the cockpit the camera moves up as the fall begins as if our eye has actual gravity. That someone thought this the appropriate motion and not just any wobbling I think matters. So when all these things work in concert, in the best spots it achieves an operatic feel. But we still have a gravity of perception geared to simple physics. This is where the poor story reappears in another light. We do indeed need human scale in more ways than one: a human relationship as our anchor so that looking up from it we'll grasp a scale of meaning that creates emotional metaphysics, projecting a sense of world round the physical moment. (great filmmakers, like Malick, can bring more of that inner sense in the visual flow) Here they had a promising idea of this sort. In order to pilot the robots, two pilots are required in neural connection to each other, merging to one mind. They call the effect 'drifting', which is similar to terms I use to describe the same thing. The plot function is that a scientist 'drifts' with a monster brain, 'seeing' what they're planning to do which helps to save the day. Okay. Deeper, the metaphor stands for love at its purest, for shared drifting between souls as the world is torn. Bringing to the drift no memory or self, not holding onto anything, flowing in the river and you are neither the river nor separate as the Chinese muse. Beautiful and apt metaphor. Someone here obviously knows about meditation, which is exactly this drifting in the present moment, skiing on mind. Doesn't work when you also have to worry about giant toys. It's like wanting to understand quantum sense by looking at tectonic plates, different dynamics.I think the broader mistake here was that they assumed we'd need to know as much as possible about the film's world otherwise we'd be lost. So we have a bunch of stuff thrown together in the prologue and then nothing is expanded, we just segue from one fight to the next. They didn't let us 'drift' with the narrative, discovering as we go. It has no world as a result. (I think this is also why it didn't do well in the US, but did abroad. American audiences are being rewired to expect an ongoing world to inhabit for a few years, we all are but Americans are in the front of it —Nolan's Batman, the Marvel universe, Twilight, Potter and the recent crop of quality TV exemplify this in the most simple way. There may be nothing else noteworthy about this trend beyond setting up a viewing habit that I expect intelligent filmmakers to make much of. In Russia and China they are 20 years behind in cinematic terms, the sheer bulk of the thing still seems to work. Just a very rough guess.)","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I suppose the best comparison I could make is the same expectations that I had with Battleship, except more depth (because it was directed by Del Toros).I found the characters clichéd and wafer thin. I found a lot of dialogue equally clichéd and corny. The special effects were superb, but a lot of the fight scenes were in the dark and (particularly in the sea) I found it hard to follow fights.I also found the humour a little bit thrown together (as opposed to being part of the story). In the original transformers movie, I think it had a charming humour that made it more fun then this movie.I didn't care for the characters (in fact, by far the best character only had a few mins on screen time) and the actor I really looked forward to didn't really have a character I enjoyed or cared about (and his speech about the apocalypse wasn't really that inspiring).I gave it 6/10 because despite these flaws it passed the time away and I didn't come out hating it. I just felt it could of been so much more. Its unfair to compare a directors previous movies that are completely different, but Del Toros can tell good stories, create brilliant worlds and have lovable characters. I felt this movie was really lacking in story and character.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

It is a classic ""leave your brain at the door"" type of flick, but it is immensely fun. Being a fan of Anime, especially Anime centered around Mechas, I had a feeling that I would like this film, and I did, very much. Pluses: The special effects were phenomenal. The Mechas and monsters had real ""weight"" to them and moved naturally and fluidly. The camera-work in the action scenes was easily followable, and fluid as well, unlike the Transformers movies, which kind of give me a headache. The Story, although pretty basic and 'over the top' science, was right off the pages of a Manga, and the Japanese female character had great short hair with blue streaks and big 'ol Anime eyes. (pretty obvious that she was picked for her looks more so than her acting abilities) and all-in-all real cool. This movie also, because of the fast pace and good action (there are a few scenes that drug a little, but I'll be forgiving) makes for a lot of rewatchability, which, for me at least, A lot of movies like this, don't have. I do have a couple of negatives however; one being the acting wasn't too great, not painfully bad though, and honestly didn't detract from the fun of the film. The musical score by The RZA was pretty lame. It really didn't seem to fit with the movie, and in most scenes, kind of took the life out of the fight scenes a bit with it's funky groove. Dialogue, although had some amusing homages to many o' Sci-Fi flicks, was kind of listless and just seemed lacking, no real memorable lines from the whole film. And lastly, although they were pretty cool, I think they could have done better with the look of the Kaiju, they all just kind of looked like the 1999 ""Godzilla"" and the aliens from ""Independence Day"" had a love child, and it was a bit difficult to discern between them. 'THIS ONE IS A LEVEL FIVE!!!' ... And it looks pretty much just like all the others, so I can't really feel how bad ass it is. *shrug* That all being said, very fun, very enjoyable movie to waste a couple of hours, down right *must see* for Japanese Anime/Manga and monster flicks fans out there. A solid 7, above par, will watch again, but not anything mind blowing. Thanks for reading my review.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

And boy did the movie deliver. I was grinning like an idiot for most of the movie. The movie is just so much damn fun and it had some of the most terrific fight sequences that I've ever seen. It also had great pacing, I wasn't bored at any point in the movie. The set up in the beginning is pretty much perfect as del Toro presents the Kaijus and how the world reacted to them. After that it's just almost non-stop action. Guillermo del Toro has really crafted a believable and expansive world that is full of detail. The visual look of the film was beautiful and full of color. You can just feel the joy and passion that del Toro had for the film through the screen. The art direction and the CGI effects in this movie are really impeccable. Guillermo Navarro also did a great job with the cinematography. The camera was always right where it should've been.The practical sets inside the robots were absolutely fantastic. If they'd done those in CGI, the movie would've definitely lost something substantial. I loved how it looked and how you got a great perspective into what it would be like to be inside of that robot. The practical sets that were used throughout the movie with the CGI really grounded the experience. The CGI Jaegers and Kaijus were done terrifically and they had a tremendous sense of weight to them. There was also enough differences between the Kaijus to keep the action interesting and the battles different. Every Jaeger also had a distinct theme to it and they were really well conceived. The sound design in this movie was also great and it really added to the intensity of the film. The great epic score by Ramin Djawadi really pumped me up during the fights. Despite the movie being a big spectacle it actually had good enough characters that I actually cared and rooted for them. I didn't like the scientists though, they were a bit too eccentric and over the top for my taste. Ron Perlman was funny though because he's just awesome as a person. I thought Charlie Hunnam made for a likable hero and Rinko Kikuchi does a great job as Mako. Idris Elba really nails his role as the tough commander with a heart. The drifting sequences were visually interesting and they were used well in conveying the backgrounds of the characters. The plot is what it is but it fits a spectacle movie like this pretty much perfectly. Approach this film with the right expectations and you'll have an enjoyable time. You have to see this in the cinema while it's still there, it really adds to the experience. It's an extremely enjoyable and fun pop corn flick, my favorite of the summer blockbusters so far.","13 out of 22 found this helpful.

I'll tell you why, original poster, because it is one way to get alien invaders, giant cloned creatures, and giant robots all into the same movie. This - and all big budget action pictures made today - are not about American audiences. They are about overseas audiences, where 75% of the money is made. Specifically, China and Russia. Thus you have minimal dialogue, big explosions, buxom scantily clad females, and muscular macho men who look like they came straight out of a porn movie with break-away clothing.How minimal is the dialogue? Well my husband watched this with one earphone on so he could hear the film, and one off so he could listen to me parodying the dialogue MST3K style by what I thought was going on just by the muted overacting. He stopped the film and took off the other headphone after awhile and said - ""to not be hearing anything that's being said you are remarkably spot on"". And this is exactly what the filmmakers are going for - something that you do not need to be an English speaker to follow.I did watch it later with dialogue or else I would not be able to write this review in good faith.

I do like the fact that the this being one of the hits for summer blockbuster that instead of the aliens coming from in the middle of the space they come from the pacific rim (hence the title) because this gives an alternate and more pressing need for the world to unite against a common enemy than other movies. I think this element gives the movie some credibility into how the world would actually revolve when something this disastrous would happen. All in all, if you liked power rangers back in the day, then you will like this movie!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Which sounds a little worrying especially when the trailers make it look like a longer mighty morphing power rangers episode. It had so much potential to be awful. Guillermo Del Toro (science fiction/fantasy/horror storyteller extraordinaire) of course was not going to let that happen. It turns out to be very entertaining and fun. One important thing to mention to anyone not in the know is that this film is heavily indebted to the many Japanese films and TV series which tackle a similar giant robot/mecha suited subject. I think perhaps (not that I'm an expert) most notably the TV and film series Neon Genesis Evangelion. I imagine this is the sort of thing that inspired and influenced this film. Which of course is a great thing given how flipping good the first two film recaps have been. If you haven't seen any of this please go seek it out. Therefore it is a nice touch that one of the main characters in Pacific Rim is a Japanese women. Most of the action is set in Hong Kong but unfortunately, while there is a Chinese Jaeger team and also a Russian team, both have very little screen time or speaking parts. Apart from the main team in the story - Mako and Raleigh, the team with the 2nd most focus is given to the rather bland father and son (Australian? - the accents were hard to define) team. I found myself not caring too much about them to be honest. Felt more for the Chinese and Russians who had much less characterisation. Perhaps the film producers felt that they needed to have a larger white male presence in the film to reflect the films probable viewing demographic. Which I'm sorry to say is just dull, lazy and boring. I'm sure this sort of consideration is necessary for any big expensive film to be given the green light but its sort of disappointing all the same. The first few minutes of this film manage to do something quite impressive. In this very short time they manage to give a very accurate and believable summary of the first 7 years of the kaiju/human/jaegar war. 7 whole years told exceptionally skillfully in a couple of few minutes. This sets up the film beautifully. Yes i said believable! How did they manage to make it seem realistic that huge monsters could rampage around major cities a la Godzilla? Plus the fact that said monsters originate from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the pacfic ocean? I don't know either but they did. The human interest stories are of course what make any film and the relationship between Mako and Stacker (Idris Elba's stern military leader) is quite compelling. A scene involving Mako's initial encounter with a Kaiju and then Stacker as a child is really quite poignant. The child actor plays the part so realistically (all strained breathing and crys) that you wonder if she thought it was actually happening. Of course there's a whole lot of fun stuff too. Did i mention the giant robots fighting giant alien monsters? Well, its done well, you can actually follow what's happening and the there is invention and creativity in the fights. The special effects are of course top notch. Charlie Day's scientist character is a good laugh throughout the film. The 'drifting' concept (2 humans must share the 'neural load' of piloting a Jaegar and drifting is kind of like a mind meld where they share each other's minds and therefore memories) is used to good effect. All in all this is as fun and intelligent a film can be considering its plot :) So go see!","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

Pacific Rim is overall a fun/good time movie that will bring out the inner 9 year in ya. If you're going into Pacific Rim expecting an Oscar worthy performance & plot, well sorry...

This movie is basically just like the 1989 movie ""robotjox"", but instead of the robots fighting each other, they fight giant aliens. The acting is just as cheesy and the overall feel to the movie feels just as unprofessional as Robotjox as well.The plot and the characters are a little cliché, but I have to admit, the special effects and action were very, very good. The movie wasn't a total bust. But this is coming from someone who even liked Robotjox just because it was so painfully bad, it somehow made it seem good to me, as if it was a parody of itself. Pacific rims doesn't quite do that for me, but it wasn't a TOTAL waste of time.

The answer is very simple: You make the movie for you, and not for the audience.

"7","/10","A colossal summer blockbuster that can rightfully be called ""epic""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2834401/?ref_=tt_urv","FilmMuscle","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18123905/?ref_=tt_urv","19 July 2013","After the masterpiece that was Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy installments, Guillermo Del Toro (who's one of the most capable filmmakers in the industry today) has launched his first mega- blockbuster that rivals the grandness and intensity of Michael Bay's Transformers franchise itself. Now, from hearing about it and viewing the trailers left and right, Pacific Rim seemed frighteningly similar to the Transformers films, and I began to doubt the quality that'd shape the movie. Thus, my expectations weren't particularly as high as they could be. On that note, I'm here judging Pacific Rim as a full-fledged action blockbuster and nothing else. I won't be comparing it to thought-provoking dramas or hilarity-ensuing comedies. No, I'll be comparing it to action flicks, especially the Transformers series and how it actually far excels the quality of those movies. First of all, Pacific Rim is epic in every sense of the word (though I've used that word far too excessively at this point). Its scale is colossal- beyond that of almost any summer blockbuster that has preceded it. The film promises intense and grandiose battles between gargantuan monsters and mechs/robots, and it absolutely delivers on that. Once you're engaged in one of these fights, you're able to witness the spectacular audio that erupts from the speakers as every hit taken booms in your ear as if the whole event is real. This is also meshed with the terrific soundtrack that complements the grandeur and ""larger-than-life"" feel of the movie. With that being said, above all the other ""pros"" of this movie, there's the breathtaking visuals that few summer blockbusters can actually compare to. Seeing the colorful streets of Hong Kong and then eyeing the water splashing as a lizard fights a gigantic mech nearby delivers such a visual spectacle that anyone would feel highly satisfied with. Of course, this experience is even more wonderful if you're watching it in IMAX 3D (the way I wisely chose to see it). At moments, it actually feels like you're underwater in the deep bowels of the ocean and whatnot. There is no doubt that the production value of Pacific Rim is incredible, and that'd just be an understatement. On top of that, there's the human aspect of the film (similar to that of the Transfomers films), which is filled with great acting, especially from Idris Elba who I must say steals the show. Everyone who's seen him on The Wire already knows what this exceptional actor is capable of. Anyways, there's a fair amount of comedy provided as well from the likes of Charlie Day and Ron Pearlman, and this time, it's actually funny. Ron Pearlman plays an arrogant tough guy by the name of Hannibal Chau, and he's just one of the other high points of the film. But then, there's the main character of the film, Travis Beckett (played by Charlie Hunnam), who's just kind of a bland individual with little personality, which is why it's easy to see how great the supporting characters are around him. As you can see, this is where I have a little bit of complaints to state about the film. Since this is another Hollywood blockbuster, you can't be too surprised when you witness the fair share of clichés that fill the movie with the generic bully fights and rescues, etc. This is what diminished the satisfaction received from the ending- it's that it ended the way you would expect it to end; yet another predictable Hollywood action flick. And as we all well know, the ending is one of the most important elements of a film, and when a film ends typically, it just doesn't leave a good taste in my mouth. Then, there's the pacing, which seems to suffer midway through the movie as you begin to notice that the film is dragging out a little, and some are probably checking the time at that point. Also, ignoring the special-effects audio, due to so many characters with accents in the film, it's often difficult to hear what those characters are even talking about, which messes up the story for me; at times, I felt confused as to what exactly is supposed to transpire. Furthermore, as an action movie and nothing more, Pacific Rim, without a doubt, delivers, but its not-too-memorable ending and abundant Hollywood clichés doesn't make it as decent as it could've been. Nonetheless, I highly advise anyone interested in action flicks (especially since the past year's blockbusters like Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel have been mediocre) to see the film in IMAX 3D, and only then will you appreciate it and understand what a proper action movie should truly be like.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I mean, the idiot-level concept that the gigantic monsters would not be stopped by torpedoes, missiles or guns at sea or a submarine net rigged with explosives or electricity just seemed to stupid to endure. However, two things made me change my mind: 1) my wife wanted to see it and 2) the movie had a really beautiful ""look"" (thanks to topnotch production values and use of a RED camera (the same camera used for ""Step-up Revolution). Minutes into the movie, my other suspicions were confirmed: 1) this movie is marketed to an international cast, as the the three main characters are all of different races and nationalities; and 2) the storyline would be one cliché after another.Nonetheless, I rate ""Pacific Rim"" highly for the acting, direction, music and those aforementioned production values. Even the cliché plot lines seem fresh and original due to the fine acting; especially Idris Elba, who could impress reading a soup can. Also, always welcome, is Ron Perlman, who somehow always manages to class up the most ridiculous projects.With a cast of real actors, not stars, the most modest of romances and lots of violent action, this movie screams ""International (particularly Asian) project"". I certainly expected to see more Asian names among the technical credits. However, when one figures three-fourths of this movies grosses came from outside the US, it is clear Guillermo del Toro intended to make an international film, and he certainly made a handsome one. I give ""Pacific Rim"" a ""7"".","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

He's a big fan of Del Torro and we're both monster-movie fans. So for us, watching this movie was a no-brainer. I'm no expert on CGI but at least to my untrained eye the special effects looked great. It was fun watching the mechanicals of the robots and the various weapons of the robots and the monsters. The fight scenes were exciting and the set designs were realistic. Movie-dom has come a long since the late fifties where men wearing Godzilla suits destroyed paper-mache' cities.Yes, the acting is far from first-rate and the dialogue is clichéd. But I didn't watch this movie to see Lawrence Olivier quality acting or Shakespearean dialogue, that would almost be out of place for an action movie like this. It would be like going to Ruby Tuesdays for a meal served on one-thousand dollar a plate china.As a side note, I'm surprised this movie isn't a bigger money-maker. At a 180 mil.+ budget they have to sell a lot of tickets. Maybe the rental and foreign markets can take up the slack. A movie like this should be a bonanza for marketing with toys, video games, t-shirts, lunch boxes, etc. I don't have TV but if the makers didn't have a tie-in to a fast-food restaurant chain with small action figures included with ""Happy-Meals"" then they missed a good opportunity to lure the kids and their parents to the local multi-plex. So I would be surprised if this movie doesn't turn a profit, at least eventually. Speaking of kids, this sixty-year old was a ten year old again bringing back fond memories of monster movies I watched back in the fifties and sixties.","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

This film is a whirlpool that has sucked so many ideas from its obvious precursors (Godzilla, Transformers) and related works (Hellboy, Matrix, Aliens, Starship Trooper, Iron Man, Inception, District 9, the list is endless) that one expects it to be drowned in writs.This film has a script that is as poor as you'd come to expect. It isn't horrendous, but it often arrests the cast.The plot problems are few but marked. Some would not escape a child. So why can I still remember the film after the popcorn is finished?There is enough humour to cover the dialogue shortcomings, enough detail to keep you appreciative and seen in IMAX the carnage is sumptuous. The cinematic and visual symbolism from Del Torro is a cut above the usual fare.There are a few political ideas that creep to the surface. The film effectively excludes Europe from the plot - a definite message about the future. One solution to the problem of monster terrorism is to build a large wall and tell people they will be safe behind it. But what makes this movie more than the sum of its parts is the focus on the robots. This film is a clean homage to so many of the ideas that came before it, but they are fully supported by the characters who are purely there to do battle with monsters in large robots. Very little screen time is given over to any concept that isn't related to FIGHTING MONSTERS IN VERY LARGE ROBOTS. And ultimately this enlarges the film, because the action sequences are the heart and sole, not sections of a script written just for the video game. There is no message to discern beyond FIGHTING MONSTERS IN VERY LARGE ROBOTS is a thing.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

You basically have giant monster-beasts coming out through a dimensional breach in the Pacific Ocean (hence the title), trying to destroy a world that fights back by uniting and creating giant robots (or mecha) piloted by humans. The war seems to be mostly won because of these until new, more dangerous monsters start coming out years later at a faster frequency. At that time, only a few giant robots remain in fighting shape, the rest being destroyed or decommissioned, with less than a dozen pilots remaining. The end is near unless something drastic happens.So, most people will want to watch this because of the spectacular giant robots versus giant monsters fights, and it certainly delivers, but with some caveats. The monsters look great, even real, and not corny at all as in most Godzilla-type movies (no rubber suit here). However, near the end, they become harder to differentiate and I didn't always know who was who. They changed the red blood to some blue glow-in-the-dark blood. The monsters being alien, it makes sense and avoids making things too bloody. The monsters lack personality and are just portrayed as destructive beasts, but I won't hold that against the creators. The robots look cool and have an imposing physical presence despite the near-constant avoidance of showing them next to humans for scale. They didn't look that much computer-generated to me although I knew they were. The robots and monsters looked their size (massive) because of their ponderous, slower than real-life movements, as well as the sound effects that were excellent. The fights themselves were enjoyable and didn't overstay their welcome. I didn't suffer from action fatigue as when fights last too long without real stakes. However, because of close-ups, fast editing and lots of rain, it wasn't always clear what was going on, so the action could have been better. I did love it though.Story-wise, the creators do provide an explanation that makes some sense for this monster invasion. I would even quality the story as interesting although a bit predictable although the accents were sometimes difficult to understand. It's a shame most of the secondary characters were not really developed because they looked interesting. One of my most memorable moments involved a ""flashback"" involving a little girl running away from a giant monster (she acted so well). Acting was acceptable with the highlight being Idris Elba as the Marshall. Most emotional dramatic moments unfortunately did not really connect with me except for the stuff involving the Marshall and the Japanese woman. The b-story involving 2 eccentric scientists wasn't really great, nor was it particularly funny although it tried to. It was good for a change of pace though.For some realistic, amazing-looking ""live-action"" giant robot versus giant monsters that don't look fake, this is great stuff. It doesn't look cartoony, it's not corny and you don't need to be a total geek to enjoy it. Don't watch if you're allergic to the subject matter though. I'm a geek and I probably liked the movie more because it reminded me of some great mecha anime (such as Neon Genesis Evangelion) without really looking like it.Rating: 7.5 out of 10 (very good)","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

But honestly, what did you expect going into the theatre? I sat down next to people who were discussing Gundam, Godzilla, anime etc. I myself had very few requirements of this movie for it to be good. I wanted to see giant robots fight giant monsters in a very large city. You know what I got? I got giant robots fighting giant monsters in a very large city. Surprise, surpriseIn the meantime I enjoyed seeing an homage to the classic genre of, what, giant things fighting each other, which I wanted. I grew up watching black and white VHS tapes of Godzilla vs fill in the blank so maybe I enjoyed it a little more than the average person and it had been quite some time since I'd seen something like that. Cloverfield was a unique take on it but it lacked the epicness of two titans facing off. This is quite possibly the most epic of the giant monster genre since it has them in abundance. What it boils down to is just that, expectation. I did NOT expect the acting to be quality and it wasn't. I did NOT expect the storyline to be interesting and maybe I had a little too low of expectation for that because it reached a point where even that became a little interesting as the movie drew me further and further in. My single regret is that I didn't see it on a bigger screen and didn't see it in 3D. I would pay to see it again just for that experience. I've always had an appreciation for epicness and it doesn't get much more epic than trying to protect the last of the human race from immeasurably large monsters with equally immeasurably large robots and all the contextual issues that come along with it.I give this a 9/10 because this movie is exactly what it was meant to be and nothing more. I would have given it a 10/10 only if the acting was better and the story was legitimately good but my opinion of what a good story is is pretty high.Thank you Guileermo Del Toro for giving me a nostalgic experience on the big screen.","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

Seeing that it was directed by the brilliant Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) this really could be a rare quality entertaining movie. Del Toro wanted to make a tribute to classic monster movies like the original Godzilla and the feel is all there, even with his neo-psychedelic signature we all subtly enjoy. But essentially the question is if these movies were even good to begin with. Unfortunately, the result is just average. The plot and its presentation are not original at all, feeling that we are watching an average 90's movie. The characters are stereotypes, etc, etc, so there really isn't much to see here. And Rinko Kikuchi is probably the worst and most annoying actress ever. What's good in here is that, although this is a traditional commercial movie, the fight scenes are really awesome and very fun to watch, plus the special effects are incredible. It's a pity we have such a long and sometimes boring build up before all the action. You will have a good time, but Pacific Rim is what it is: a standard summer blockbuster with some glimpses of quality that really can't stand out.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Best movie of 2013. Guilermo Del Toro wrote a poem to our childhood awe at monsters and heroes. I'm sorry for anyone who didn't get it.Plot: It's the story of a world being threatened by powerful external forces and the human resilience rising to fight against it. Instead of the brain dead grim pessimism of the dark, gritty movies of today we finally get a story where we can see some hope humanity can rise above its own pettiness and become better.Characters: Its easy for characters to be engulfed and forgotten when larger than life events occur but in Pacific Rim their personalities rise against the tide and do not let themselves disappear. Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) and Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi/Mana Ashida) are great and powerful characters. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) steals the show, he's just amazing. Even the piloted robots have personality here.Effects: Just perfect. The Robots and monsters are completely convincing and visceral. They are beautiful and creative. The Robots' control room are very creative as is the concept of drifting.Overall this a work of love that deserves to be appreciated by anyone that still have a beating heart and a creative mind. It'll awe you.","19 out of 35 found this helpful.

Everyone I watched this movie with thought the same.This movie was a complete borefest and consisted of nothing but CGI?? Seriously - there was nothing else. The acting was wooden and mediocre and every moment was full of cheese. The script was non existent. Where was the story?? The whole movie was as if the entire CGI department was just vomiting everything they possibly could on screen. It is CGI overload. Don't get me wrong - The CGI is good - no problems there, however, there is literally no film or story here to watch. You didn't care about any of the characters and everything was totally predictable from start to finish. Everything was repetitive. As if all the above wasn't bad enough, the soundtrack for the film was abysmal - the tune was repetitive, amateur and majorly annoying. It was like a kid messing with his keyboard playing the same few keys - seriously, whoever did the music in this film should be out of a job. This film is for a seriously dumb audience without any intelligence - I'm amazed at how much money and CGI was thrown at this movie given the total lack of story and script. This is without doubt Guillermo's worst movie in history. He has messed up big time with this movie. He seems to have forgot the absolute basics in movie making. Have a story to tell at the very least. There is no story, no script, no decent acting or anything. The movie is full of brainless stereotyping too - it's embarrassing and like a child made this movie. There is nothing to keep you interested. CGI does not make a movie good - when will Hollywood learn this?? You will not see a better example of this fact than watching this movie.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

The story is very simple but the actors, especially the supporting cast, are giving everything they got to the point I can actually remembera lot of them after months without watching the movie. The fight scenes are the highlights of the film, it has only a few, like 3 I think, but these fights are some of the best out there, making you feel excited at all time. The CGI hasn't aged a bit and even stands strong despite being almost a decade old and even looks better than a lot of movies today. This movie is really a banger from minute 1 to the end and I really wish, Guillermo had directed the sequel.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

This film reminded me of the old Godzilla monster movies akin to the likes of Godzilla versus Megalon. Those films always had the populous running for their lives while Tokyo was perpetually being destroyed, but the update to the tale is that the origin of the monster attacks does not come from nuclear fallout. This film was not as campy as the early Godzilla films, but there was a healthy level of cheesiness, although played very straight with Charlie Day (Dr. Newton Geiszler) as the only comic relief, which is somewhat odd since he plays a scientist. He actually looks the part, but if he ever wants to be taken seriously in a role he has to change his voice inflections and tone, which is very comedic. If all the English and Australian actors can do it I'm sure he can. This film was primarily driven by the special effects, since going in there was little doubt as to how the story would end. The last film that I saw that had a truly surprising end was Cabin in the Woods, I digress. The special effects were most noteworthy because the scale of the jaegers and the kaijus was strikingly convincing. With their movements, when the fights broke out and when buildings were destroyed, I simply marveled at the fact that these creations looked remarkably real. I'm not sure why the notion that a tall wall will keep anything out but it was yet again tested in this film, but again the scale was amazing. The kaiju unfortunately were never shown much clearer in the film than what was seen in the trailer, when they appeared it was either dark, raining, shown as a television broadcast or they were underwater all of which were distorting factors. We did get a nice variety though, with similarities to a turtle, gorilla, and a pterodactyl. This was a testosterone filled ride, there were only two females with any dialogue in the entire film and one of them was quite masculine. It seemed that the target audience was tween and teenaged young men who would get a kick out of the fight scenes, there was a miniscule love story but not enough to make this film a female fan favorite. It was entertaining so I give it an amber light.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I had no desire to see it as the trailers had failed to impress me. The very first scene however, took my breathe away. It had been so long since a film totally immersed me in its world. I felt a chill down my spine as the jeager and kaijus first took screen. The CGI is outstanding and undoubtedly deserves the Oscar for it.The action? My God, the action. Transformers, take notes. If you want to make a tense, exciting battle scene, actually show what's going on and make the enemy actually dangerous. These Kaiju meant business so every skirmish was a heart pounding experience for me. The fact that the CGI was so convincing only enhanced this.Let me get this out of the way. I do not think this film is as stupid or badly acted as many other people do. In fact, I quite liked the leads, especially Mako. I felt this film did a good job developing their characters and building their friendship. The story is of course not spectacular. I'm not saying the acting is stellar either, but it's by no means bad. But this movie has heart. It has heart in its characters, it has heart in its theme about teamwork, and it has heart in its battles. There are few films I can give such praise to.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

There is enough plot to move the story along, the characters are likable and, while there is certainly campiness, it does not take the movie to stupidity. (I'm thinking Transformers 2) I will watch a movie simply for atmosphere and FX. That being said, Battleship was completely awful. Del Toro does not take us to absurd, certainly suspension of belief is required, but not to a point of eye-rolling, more like a huge grin because of the enormity of the monsters, robots, and positive energy in this film.

First, the film is dark all the time, with grayish tint throughout. I got so tired of the monochromatic stimulation. More colour could easily be provided, such as changing the colour of the wall in the base camp. Second, the plot is just not engaging or exciting. There were several occasions when I thought the film was ending, but it continued. And dragged on. The film just did not know when to stop. The plot does not build up to an effective climax either. That motivational speech by Idris Elba ended up being laughable.Another thing that really killed my enjoyment was the bunker scene in Hong Kong. Despite the film being set in the 2020's, people in the bunker wore clothes in the 1920s. And they even spoke in Mandarin, which is not spoken in Hong Kong. The director sacrificed such important factual errors for cinematic clichés. And while I am on clichés, the first scene with Chinese people in the Hong Kong base shows the people from China playing basketball. My eyes rolled so much when I saw that scene! I wish I did not waste time on this film. The neural connection certainly did not work for me.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

In the first part of the movie I was pleasantly surprised. The scenes were visually beautiful and the plot was interesting. It will still require lot of suspension of disbelief because the basic premise, that the most efficient method of killing giant animals is constructing giant robots to punch them, is ridiculous. If you can accept this, the movie will be very enjoyable......at least until the Hong Kong base part. We'll meet a lot of characters there who are best described as caricatures. They are single-dimensional and their interactions are forced and annoying. I hold two hysterical scientists and all the Jaeger pilots in this group. The altercations between the main character and another pilot, and between the main character and the general are grating. They can only appeal to 10-year olds in the audience and their idea of how Real Tough Men act like.Fortunately the female lead makes up for this by being an original and interesting character (unlike her male counterpart), and a knife-wielding Ron Perlman would be beneficial to any movie. They will help the transition to the final fight.In conclusion, not a masterpiece but a decent monster-robot blockbuster.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I felt happy and alive coming out of the theatre, and for once I felt as though not a cent had been wasted on my ridiculously expensive movie ticket. This is one you should all go and check out. Need more reasons to do so? Okay, here we go...So should you see this one? Yes. Definitely yes. Especially if you've come out of more than one big blockbuster film this year feeling like you haven't really enjoyed yourself. Pacific Rim is explosive, silly, and completely over-the-top, but the film-makers were aware of this, and as a result just had fun with the whole thing; you find yourself laughing with the film rather than at the film. It's a gleeful, somewhat tongue-in-cheek film that just wants to entertain its audience.According to the ever reliable Wikipedia, Del Toro envisioned Pacific Rim as an earnest, colourful adventure story, with an ""incredibly airy and light feel"", in contrast to the ""super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie"". If this was indeed the case, he couldn't have succeeded more.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

I thought nothing of it. Only recently with the word of mouth hype did I decide to go and see it. Special Effects were out of this world. The slow moving giants were perfect for 3D. The sound...amazing. The story...was a little better then alright. I didn't think there would be much of a story. Because without a story. Special Effects just become eye candy. I couldn't help but think of Independence Day meets Godzilla with a little bit of Starship Troopers. Except less actors...a lot less actors. Dated...but I enjoyed ID4 a lot more. No one even clapped at the end on opening night. The director still has it. But not like he use to. I enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed Hellboy 2. Just alright...better then most movies. Maybe I expected more because of the Hype. So I won't add to it. But just say what I feel in my opinion. The young kids will probably like it more. Say 6-7 and up. But not the BLOCKBUSTER movie I was looking forward to. My fun of the Summer is still with Star Trek Into The Darkness for many, many reasons.Want to see what I thought was a masterpiece of Guillermo del Toro's work. Treat yourself to the Spanish (Subtitles in English) film 'THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE...that should have gotten him an Oscar instead of PAN'S LABYRINTH.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

A big, loud, monster movie. PR borrows heavily from the Godzilla movies. Monsters and giant robots duke it out. The plot is simple enough to work: An underwater 'tunnel' has created a link from the bottom of the ocean to another dimension, that dimension is full of monsters who want to conquer earth because why not? the monsters have apparently done this before throughout the Galaxy so to them it's like riding a bike. The world however, decides to fight back, so they build these giant iron man robots (i mean seriously, they look just like Iron Man)anyway, so these giant robots now have to kill these monsters and destroy the tunnel. In between these events you have some impressive battle scenes. Some battle/fights scene take place off the coast of China, Three-mile island, another one takes place in downtown Tokyo (which is so amazing, i rewound that part of the film to watch again) in the middle of the film is a 20-30 min fight sequence that is just action cgi porn. It was amazing. The special effects are spot on and very realistic. Pacific Rim is now one of my all time favorite movies right up there with Jurassic Park, Cloverfield and War of The Worlds.","16 out of 30 found this helpful.

It began to drag on and the Character development was lacking and the plot was laughable. The beginning of the movie was where all the meat was contained as far as having a rich story, but Del Toro choose instead to skip over the most important part of the money as if it was just a side note. My Son became bored and dosed off in the middle of the movie as it became hard to follow. Hard to believe they would drop 185K and not have more to the movie. The best scenes were in the previews.

I mean this movie is a visual treat from well detailed robot and monster designs to high over the top, but well choreographed action sequences and massive collateral damage. The world that Guillermo del Toro creates is imaginative and his character designs are mesmerizing and complex. The sound design and the sheer force of the films score captivates you into a ride of sight and sound that pleases all your senses. From the metal grinding noise of the robots to the fleshy and almost beast like cry the monsters make, this film has you feeling like you are right there in the middle of the action.While the movie is mostly is a visual treat, it doesn't forget about its characters and there humanity. The film isn't all bells and whistles, it really does have some really nice character moments in its script, which are about overcoming fear, moving on and trust. These moments make us care for the events that are unfolding. However, the script isn't all serious business, it knows when to have fun. Some of these moments can be a bit too campy though and some of the emotional moments feel forced. The film sometimes even becomes contrived, mainly towards the end. However, director Guillermo del Toro balances things pretty well.The actors in this film do a pretty good job, but the only real standout is Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost.This character is sort of the leader of the resistance and Elba commands attention every second on screen. Charlie Hunnam is pretty good as Raleigh Becket, a Jaeger pilot, who left the resistance after a traumatic incident. I wish they showed more of his inner battle, it would have invested us into the story more. Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori is really hit or miss. The scenes where she is more reserved are good, but when she tries to emote, it can be awkward at times. The rest of the cast is pretty solid and the supporting cast is pretty good, especially Charlie Day, who brings some of the lighter moments to the film.Overall ""Pacific Rim"" as a giant robot versus giant monster movie is pretty awesome. The visuals, sound, and well directed action are all top-notch. They provide a treat for the eyes like never before. Even the 3D is spectacular, the best I've seen since ""Avatar,"" it really absorbs you into del Toro's imaginative world. The story, mainly the human element, is a bit weaker as it can feel contrived at times. It keeps us involved, but never takes us to the next level of emotional satisfaction. I give it 4/5, a blockbuster with some of the coolest and most imaginative action that I have seen this year.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

Now that is probably fine for many movie goers and if that's what you like, fine! I like substance, a well scripted movie that gets you completely involved. That is not this film. Another issue is why do these type of films have to be so long? They are always well over two hours which can seem much longer if you are uninvolved.I don't understand the mostly high scores and positive critical reviews.

The result is unfortunately closer in spirit to those old Godzilla movies than to the anime take on the genre. That is, there is little psychology or philosophy, even though the concept of two people working as one would seem to suit such things, and it takes itself quite seriously, with only a tiny bit of humor from some minor characters.The thing that makes this movie worth watching is the action, with some really cool monsters having big, fairly entertaining battles with giant robots. Unfortunately, the movie drags whenever it gets back to the human beings who control those robots. The square-jawed hero, the eager newbie, the cocky jerk, the tough commander, all feel like characters you create when you're too lazy to think. Two weird scientists bring a little humor to their scenes, but only Ron Perlman manages to really stand out in a small but entertaining role.Perhaps Del Toro should stick to Hellboy movies and leave the robot/monster fights to the Japanese","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's not complicated and unfortunately predictable. Enormous reptilian monsters have risen from the deep and are threatening the world's major seaboard cities. Only colossal Transformers-style robots can save humanity and they have to be operated by pairs of warriors attuned to each other's mental processes.This is not Del Toro's best work. His best work relies on creepy, almost weird story telling. It lacks the subtle magic of Pan's Labyrinth, the creepiness of Cronos or the humour of Hellboy. What it is though is an absolutely loud and entertaining fighting robotical alien invasion apocalyptical type movie. It sells itself as nothing more and delivers just that.In short the castings a bit ropey, the accents are a bit off and it's a little too long for what's on offer. There's too much human story when we really don't need it and the films humour scenes were wide of the mark. We need robots. We need aliens and we need them to fight. A lot. When what we want is delivered its fantastic – its everything that Transformers isn't.The film also sets a back story that is briefly explained and allows serious prequel consideration, as should the thought of a sequel. It could have been so much better than it is, but it missed its mark by a whisker. Its good fun, good entertainment but the very high hopes I had for it failed to materialise.You can read more reviews like this at fortressofsolitude.co.uk","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

From Mimic to Hellboy II and Pan's Labyrinth, he's been scaring the Bejeezus out of us for over a decade. And we keep coming back for more.He even had a small hand in the creation of Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" - And in a way I am glad that Guillermo did not direct that, as he said that making Pan's Labyrinth almost killed him, I think The Hobbit would have been too much for him.But Pacific Rim was not - And he did it, Del Toro did a GOOD JOB on Pacific Rim.I think what people do not realize is how much of himself Guillermo Del Toro puts into his movies. A Lot of work, and a Lot of Love.So when I first heard of this movie a few years ago, I was not sure I understood what it was to be about - And I was correct, you cannot easily quantify what kind of Movie Pacific Rim is. Is it a Monster Movie? Yes. Is it a movie about Giant Monsters? Yes. Is it like Robot Jox? YES.So what we get is a cross between Robot Jox and Robotech - Men Piloting Huge Mechanical Robots, which are Man's Only Tools to fight an enemy which puts man on the scale of an Insect under these enemies' Boots- Er, Claws, Er, Appendages.And so we get to see the level of destruction from the first frame of this film, and not only the use of Huge Robots, but we are told about ""The Drift"" - Two Minds merged together through the Machine, two men working as one, Is this a Love Story? In all ways, this is a Love story between Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) and Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam). But it is also a love story between Raleigh and his late brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) - And also between Mako and her Surrogate Father Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba). And between the Father/Son Team of Herc Hansen (Max Martini) and Chuck Hansen (Robert Kazinsky) - And finally even love between the oddest of odd couples ever: Doctors Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and ""Gottleib"" (Burn Gorman).Why? Because all of these people have shared ""The Drift"" in some form or another.""The Drift"" is not only a technical solution which allows two Pilots to Merge into basically a single Brain, Left and Right hemispheres, for Piloting a Jaeger - It's also a Gimmick created by Guillermo Del Toro to help us understand the relationships between these people.And this gimmick works better for that than strictly as a means for two Pilots to drive a Jaeger.Through this Gimmick, we understand Raleigh's loss of Yancy. We understand the antagonism of the two ""Scientists"" Gottlieb and Geiszler, antagonism peppered with healthy respect. We understand Pentecost's protectiveness over Mako, as we see through her eyes how she perceived her Savior Pentecost when she sees him for the first time as a little girl holding one red shoe.It is Pentecost's Final Words to Mako which has a bittersweet ring to it: ""You can Always Find me, In the drift"".And when he says this, we KNOW, that he is not going to be dead, that he will always be there in Mako's Mind each time she relives that moment where she sees her Knight in Shining Armor arise from the Cockpit of a Jaeger.It is not just the digital imagery used to portray men fighting huge monsters, Digital Imagery which succeeds rather than fails on all kinds of levels - But it is the Imagery Guillermo has created- This WORLD he created and has given to us, to either live in, and enjoy with him, or to not bother- This fantastic Future Landscape which holds enough Future Shock to kill 1,000 Alvin Toffler's - THIS is what has been given to us with these images- And the way the Digital Images are blended with the practical Film effects, so we do not know where one ends and the other begins.In fact, one documentary I had read from, describes that the Kaijus were designed as if they were to be like the suits worn by Men in old Godzilla Movies- And in fact the way the Kaijus Move are very much like ""Men in Suits"" - Only that I have heard Guillermo talking about creating large monsters in other films, particularly in Hellboy - that he animated the ""Sammael"" daemons so that the movements were more like Animal Movements- He did MUCH the same here with the Kaiju Movements. But I am glad I bothered to watch this film - It has taken me a whole month to think about how I would write this review. It is because of the deep Humanity which this story shows us, love and respect, that I choose to respect it's director for.Because on top of all of these deep Human and Spiritual aspects of this story, Guillermo has given us a nonstop event filled with action, and when the Pilots get into their Jaegers, we get into the cockpit alongside them. And when Raleigh falls into the Rift with the carcass of the first Category-Five Kaiju, we fall down that rabbit hole with them, and when we see the Leader of the Invading Aliens, and the FEAR in his three or four Eyes, we can REALLY see that fear, and this makes that moment much more satisfying for us as viewers and participators in the story.Guillermo Del Toro is much different than other directors of today. Even here we can see his earlier efforts as influences - And one thing I know that Guillermo always carries around is his Notebook.Thank you Guillermo, and I'm still waiting for Hellboy Three!","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

I said that if I like this film I'd write my first ever IMDb review. What can I say? I lost.Going in skeptical that this was going to be a CGI monstrosity with little plot, lots of explosions, and bad acting, I was beyond surprised when I found myself lost in the film. Charlie Hunnam's performance wasn't top notch acting but he pulled off his character well without overacting. The responses by other characters in the film seemed genuine and almost realistic. Idris Elba was perfectly chosen for his role. The Jaeger battles were shot, from what I perceived, as if someone were nearby watching the battle unfold. Another point I liked was the love story between Hunnam's character and Rinko Kikuchi's character, Mako. Well, I should say ""implied love story"". Only in one line of dialogue was it even referenced. Their relationship was merely implied to the audience and then left to simmer as to not take away from the rest of the story.The rest of the supporting cast did well, but I thought their roles were rather short. The Russian and Chinese pilots had very little screen time but once again it seemed the film was made to be more realistic with more real-world emotional responses. In that respect it was well done.Overall, I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. 3D is the only way to see this film. I'm not a big fan of 3D but this is one film that really uses it well.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

You either go along with that premise or not, there's no two ways about it. In reality, it's probably more resourceful to bomb these giant monsters or shoot them with a very big cannon, instead of making giant robots to punch them to death. But where's the fun in that? Suffice to say, the fights are a tense visceral experience and the scale of everything delivers an epic sense of awe. They do everything to up the ante and surprise the audience. Special moves are only used in climatic moments and there's just something about a giant robot using a boat as a bat that's just hilarious and jaw-dropping. These fights run very dangerously to the cinematic equivalent of watching somebody play a video game. That's why I like the drifting mind meld concept, because it solves that problem by it properly adding both physical and emotional conflict to the pilots controlling the Jaegers as well. It focuses to how well these pilots are controlling the Jaegers as opposed to how the Jaegers are fighting the Kaijus.The fights are shot somewhat tightly but for a very good reason. Shooting the fights close holds the tension and injects the sense of jeopardy and stake into every exchange in the fight choreography. I imagine if the fights were covered entirely in long wide shots, it would lose that sense of scale and the fights would look silly. That said, I had no problem following what's going on because emotionally it felt right to be watching them that way. And personally, it was doubly fun that the film was set in Hong Kong.There's been a common complaint that the characters lacked development, I disagree. Basically these people all have baggage and they have to band together as a team or fall apart. The film spends time building arcs for its ensemble cast, and it's sufficient to justify the epic robot monster fights. That's it, so I don't understand that complaint. Adding neat little quirks or oddball idiosyncrasies to these characters would have been overkill.The dialogue is one of the film's weaker portions. However, depending on how well each actor was able to milk the lines, I was still able to have fun with it. I couldn't stop cackling at Charlie Day's fast-paced high-pitched deliveries, who rises above being ""Dr. Exposition"" and balances the film with comic relief. Day's exchange with the rival math-based scientist played by Burn Gorman is essentially a cartoon-level quarrel equivalent to Daffy Duck arguing with Bugs Bunny. The math Gorman's scientist applies is is grade-school at best. Ron Perlman facetiously entertains in flying colors as the Kaiju body parts black marketer Hannibal Chau, the most asshole character name ever created. Idris Elba also adds significant weight as the team leader. So for me, the side characters take the cake from the Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi storyline, which was played very straight for story purposes.Guillermo del Toro is aware of current big-budget blockbuster tropes and differentiates himself from those trends in Pacific Rim. There are no homage or geek references to distract or alienate the audience. Rinko Kikuchi's Mako character is not sexualized or filmed through a salivating male gaze; she is a real human character with a story and treated as such. The film doesn't play like a military recruitment advertisement nor has any blatant nationalistic or jingoistic intentions. Perhaps one of my favorite things about Pacific Rim is it tonally divorces itself from post-9/11 sentimentality. The world has its own distinct fictional reality, where destruction is not linked by evoking imagery, memories or emotions from September 11th. Civilians evacuate from buildings, hide in shelters and the streets are clear for the Jaegers to bash the Kaijus. Most importantly, del Toro never dwells heavily on despair or hopelessness and the audience can enjoy the city-wide destruction guilt-free. All those things counted together, Pacific Rim is truly a breath of fresh air amidst current blockbuster aesthetics and a film made with the most earnest intentions.Without an A-list star, a love story or a recognizable established franchise (i.e. Godzilla or Transformers) , it's not hard to see why Pacific Rim didn't score at the box office. As Snakes On A Plane proved at its theatrical release, the geek fan base doesn't represent much of the core population. The geeks merely are just the most vocal. Perhaps other parts of the demographic are alienated just by the material itself, despite that del Toro is aiming to entertain everybody. If there's one underdog movie people should give a chance to this summer, let it be Pacific Rim. It's a passionate earnest film made by a director that loves the material and wants to deliver good clean fun with a positive message for everybody. His attention to every little detail exudes his excitement for the material; that passion rubbed off on me and elevated my enjoyment. It's the most fun I've had watching a movie this summer.

Wait... it's directed by Guillermo Del Toro? I should consider to watch this because this could be AWESOME. And my decision was right to watch this, money and time well spent, this movie is a lot of fun. The characters were good, the acting was also quite well done, and don't even ask about the action? It's Spectacular! Well actually to be honest some of the actors were kind of over the top, but that's actually quite make sense. The action was not like transformers, it's very much better. This comes from a director can actually frame the action up, unlike Michael Bay that just puts action and action and explosions and we don't even know what's happening in the movie because it's not well done. Don't even dare to compare this to Transformers, because comparing Pacific Rim to Transformers is like comparing Jurassic Park to Theodore Rex. One of the best things about the movie is it's not just action, the characters are also important and interesting in this movie. We do care about the characters. Only very few directors that can pull this kind of movie off, this just proves how good Guillermo Del Toro is, as a director.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

In fact, director Guillermo del Toro brought new life to the monster movie genre with the epic and undeniably entertaining Pacific Rim right here on land.Pacific Rim delivers just about what one might expect from seeing its trailers or even just hearing about it. Guillermo del Toro's vision is complex in its ambition and scale, but simple enough in its high-concept premise. When the Pacific Ocean receives an unwelcome portal between dimensions, alien life invites itself into our world and certainly doesn't wish to remain unnoticed as mass destruction of Earth's infrastructure ensues. In response, the Jaeger Project is born, creating monsters of our own to combat the deadly, in a sense, subterranean species. Del Toro immediately invites us into his multidimensional universe, with the cinema screen acting as the portal where for 131 minutes you are transported on a journey of majestic imagery.The initial 30 minutes in this new universe, (a universe which is only further enhanced by the third dimension and IMAX experience) is unfortunately spent telling us what we probably already know. There are certain films where you wish you had known less going in as surprises are spoiled by your anticipation and natural assumptions. Pacific Rim differs in no way and in fact could have benefited from more constructive and ambiguous pre-released material as its opening half- hour is more or less an extended version of the trailers. As with most stories however, judgment should really be reserved until its middle and end have executed their purpose.Pacific Rim is effortlessly enjoyable, tie-in toyable, with monsters and robots readily deployable into battle sequences so convincing and grand, that you look up to the screen as you would these monsters in real life and this makes Del Toro rightly employable.While the action has you synchronised unbreakably with Del Toro's vision due to the prowess of the CGI, which just feels like I alone, you cannot help but wish for the camera to take a giant step backwards. Although obviously done intentionally, Del Toro leaves the camera awkwardly in between the action at times, and the result is perplexing. With films such as Jaws (1975) and Cloverfield (2008), the devastating creatures are purposefully obscure visually and shown infrequently to heighten the sense of danger and fear of the unknown. Meanwhile, with Jurassic Park (1993) and other similar creature features, we are monstrously engaged and aesthetically informed by being able to see the action and nonhuman characters clearly afar when necessary. Pacific Rim is uncomfortably framed in between this spectrum at times and this unfortunately lessens the visual value and experience of the film overall.While the battle sequences are the most anticipated, decorated and appropriately stated highlights of Pacific Rim, they are only setpieces to the much bigger war. The primary point of interest away and even importantly within the action is the film's central theme of unification. Seeing the abandonment of international conflicts, petty feuds and meaningless separation between Earth's people holds a great deal of truth to it when faced with a common enemy. Del Toro maintains this theme consistently throughout the feature, with the giant Jaeger robots even requiring a coalition between two pilots emotionally and cerebrally to function capably.While puny individual Earthlings are thrown in for purposes of making the film grounded and recognisable, it's really the robots and aliens you came to see. Nonetheless, Idris Elba and the brief yet excellent performance of child actress Mana Ashida stand out chiefly even when facing the immeasurable monsters at their doors.Pacific Rim is quite literally a groundbreaking feat in cinematic excellence because Guillermo del Toro immerses his audience into his world, his galaxy, his universe with relative ease, and the goal to please, which he achieves. While it has its flaws and calculates its fair share of question marks for itself, Pacific Rim is difficult to deny as anything but entertainment. It's simple, it's smashing, its scale is felt with incredible zealous. It's Pacific Rim.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ah, that and the recent Transformer movies. Rather than just A lot of explosions and teenagers running like chicken ......, you get more of the idea that these are manmade military megazords.First, I think I can speak for most people when I say that the fight scenes are ""booking dot"" great. The amount of detail in the movements and in the scenery is a sight to see. I mean honestly, there isn't a clear use of military guns and tanks that we've all seen before; its all replaced with giant robot fighting that is pretty much new to us.The story? Like all in your face, big bang movies, I do feel it is a little lacking. But...I didn't really need much of a story because I was so glued to the screen.The idea of the whole movie is where I must applaud. Parts of this movie are so well thought out and original its not seen very often. The idea of using 2 pilots to command a robot, now that I think isn't that original...But the idea of neurology, the design of the whole movie, using weaponry different than some grenades and just some bullets....and the way everything looks in the end.I can say that this is going to be a movie I will be eagerly looking for online and on HBO, as this is literally the best giant robot, giant monster, military, fighting movie EVER MADE","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Pacific Rim is a very good film with a powerful performance from Idris Elba at it's heart. It is an original story with original characters, which is refreshing in this age of comic book franchises and ""re- imaginings"". The fact the film has no big ""bankable"" star makes the film a risk in the eyes of the studio, but they overcome this with great performances all round, especially behind the camera. My problem is not with the filmmaking or the acting, it's the story. I think the story has some big leaps, some serious plot holes and a predictability that is unsatisfactory. Having said that, go see it, it's a refreshing change to all the other summer blockbuster action films.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Watched in 2d so cant comment on 3d version. Excellent story, simple and not too overcomplicated, with obvious major nods to manga/anime influence. Basically its all about monsters vs giant robots fighting and you get plenty of that! No slow build up, straight into the action. Characters typical clichéd bunch with tragic back stories, but reasonably well done so matches the story. And a few eccentric characters very typical of Del Toro. Very much like typical Michael Bay OTT film but Del Toro influence raises it above this. Only niggles is that some of the action shown very close up and dark so maybe not getting the best out of the fights, but that is the style of the film. And as with many blockbusters, the sound effects sometimes seem to swamp the dialogue. Also film feels bit rushed could actually do with another 20 mins. But all that is very minor. After a good year for sf films with iron Man 3, Star Trek and Man of Steel, and Elysium still to come, this is even better. See it in the cinema, this is the place to watch it! Simply perfect entertainment.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Kaiju are bad, very bad, Godzilla on super steroids with added attitude, they will ruin everyone's day unless they can be stopped.Earth is not doing so well, Kaiju are winning more often than not and the Jaeger program is losing favour and political backing, with crews being killed and robots destroyed.Humanity decides that building walls to keep the invaders out is better option, which seems odd bearing in mind the ease with which walls seem to get breached.No matter, we get to meet Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Haufman), a washed up ex-pilot who lost his older brother in battle, despite their celebrity status during the good old days, when the war was going humanity's way.Of course, following the requisite ""Earth needs you"" speech from the commanding officer (Idris Elba), we are back in business. This time with rookie pilot Mako Mori (Kikuchi), whose only qualification appears to be appealing to particular demographic and loyal Asian fan base. Local dialogue, with English subtitles indicates the contribution overseas box office now represents. We also have a nod to China, Russia and Australia to cover all the bases, no pun intended.Various obstacles are thrown in the new teams path, before they are allowed to go into battle and there are very few surprises worked into the formulaic screenplay. Throw in a couple of scientists attempting to mind meld with the Kaiju and a barely bothering to act Ron Perlman as a bizarre collector of Kaiju parts and you realise the train marked reality left some time ago.So with only Elba troubling the ""A-List"" star wattage meter and with a story cobbled together from a thousand fevered Manga and Anime dreams, the special effects needed to be top notch.Here the film does not disappoint, making ""Transformers"" look like the toys they really are and with a scale that is simply breathtaking. Building size robots dragging cargo ships to use as clubs to beat the oversized lizards into submission.Subtle, the film is not.Is it fun, to a point yes. If the subject matter interests you, then there is plenty of spectacle here and the CGI is state of the art. Dialogue is risible, apart from one line which is likely to bring more giggles than any patriotic response.Add an extra star if you are under 30, have enjoyed alcohol and are watching with friends.SummaryProvided you are looking for a movie where giant robots and sea monsters engage in WWF smackdown bouts, there is much to enjoy.If you are looking for depth, story and believable human interaction, then move swiftly along.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You didn't know that's what they were back then, or that the odd plot contrivance was just that and could mean the world (internet trolling didn't exist yet...). It was imperfect, but honest, immersive fun.This is the virtue of the nostalgic underdog film. A film that smells an untapped niche and goes on a joyful rampage through it. I think it's fair to say the original Indiana Jones did just that, revive childhood memories to create a roller-coaster devoid of cynicism. Gremlins did it. More recently, District 9 did it too.The Summer of 2013 gave us many examples of modern cinema at its worst: the cynical exploitation of childhood memories, evident in one sub-par reboot/remake after another. Action cinema as a whole has been aching from an emphasis on noise and scale rather than emotion and choreography (not just of action, but design and movement, both within and before the camera). It helps to have the new film of an earnest, geeky master to look forward to.Enter Guillermo Del Toro. Enter Pacific Rim. And here, hidden under a confused marketing campaign, is what we've been waiting for. A film that balances respectful nostalgia with irreverence (something Transformers and Man of Steel did all wrong in their respective extremes), a film that makes you remember what it was like to be a kid again. Rather than washed-out, fast-cut chaos, we get a neon-colored ballet of destruction through locations and between creatures and robots that scream the love of their creators in every frame.It's a silly film brilliantly made, and just when you wonder whether it isn't throwing certain tropes of its genre at you too literally - whether it be certain sub-stellar performances, mainly from leading man Charlie Hunman, a often predictable plot, etc. - it surprises you with a moment of sheer beauty. It makes you remember what it was like to be amazed, and it makes you hope. That the Kaiju genre is back for good. That people continue shoveling money at Guillermo Del Toro. That his Hellboy III and Mountains of Madness get made. That we see more of the great Idris Elba and Rinko Kikuchi, not to mention Mana Ashida (showcased here in a phenomenal flashback scene).A solid 9, no question about it.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Sadly, I haven't (which also probably explains why I'm single).If you're looking at Pacific Rim (a film where big, over the top monsters come out from a portal at the bottom of the ocean and start laying waste to our cities, therefore meaning Earth creates an army of big, over the top robots to stop them) on an action-only basis, then it's a sure fire winner. Yes, I loved the action - it was truly amazing special effects wise and I was instantly a twelve-year-old boy again.Sadly, I'm also a thirty-six year old adult, which means that my logical brain does demand some sort of cohesive plot to tie a two-hour film together. This is where Pacific Rim fell down. It seemed to take every action cliché from the last two decades and put them in here. A fair part of the story is told in a 'Lord of the Rings-style' monologue at the very beginning of the film, eliminating the need for any complex plots - it just tells us what's been going down. Then we have the need to recruit the burned-out ex robot pilot who's quit the service, but is the only hope we have now (a cliché so old it was lampooned in Hot Shots Part Deux), plus, when our hero does step up to the challenge, he's met with suspicion and downright hostility from the other pilots (think Team America of all films!). Then throw in the obligatory 'love interest' and dialogue that seems as if it's been completely lifted from Independence Day and you have a weird mish-mash of action films.However, all this may be cliché, but you still have the epic battles to fall back on. I forgave all this and just let my inner child enjoy itself. The only real downside were the (yes, clichéd) scientists. Seriously... they're 'uber-geeky' to such an extreme they wouldn't look out of place in a cartoon. In my opinion, if you're looking for a silly, over the top, all action film then you'll enjoy what's on offer here (I just fast-forwarded the scientists in the end - they could well be related to Jar Jar Binks - they're that bad!).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A hundred million dollars buys a lot of computer generated imagery, but that seems to be all it bought. The dialogue is just plain dire, a string of clichés, including the required ""noooooo!"".

It's especially noteworthy since there has never really been any major blockbuster films that portray giant robots and giant monsters on screen together; we've always had one or the other, but it's pretty common fare for mecha anime to slam them together and make them fight. A film like this seems long overdue.As expected, the action in Pacific Rim is very big and incredible. There are three major battles that pit towering machines against rampaging sea monsters from another world. Entire cities crumble within the film's prologue; in the fights that ensue, buildings get crushed, cars and trucks are thrown all over the place, and it truly seems like the world could get trampled at any moment. In between the battles, the film breathes pretty evenly, with the same playful energy that made the Hellboy movies so fun. Humor doesn't really play into it that much, but with the acting and colorful production design, this film is never all that serious or brooding; it's rather cheesy, lighthearted, over-the-top, and cartoonish. And it's fun that way.It's not all about the big fights and silliness though; the film has a solid focus on storytelling. It does take some effort though. The film introduces a plethora of clever concepts behind the premise of giant robots and monsters: terms like ""drifting"" and ""neural handshake"" become integral to the plot, and if you're not digging the concept, you might get lost (having already been familiar with even deeper concepts in the Evangelion saga, I couldn't help but to draw comparisons; in spite of that, I found Pacific Rim easy to follow). Aside from that, the plot is well-structured, and it's especially refreshing to see that every battle presents new problems and situations that make things unpredictable and more intense. Characters are given diligent attention; they are colorful, but they also show some decent depth and emotion.This film utilizes decent photography and editing. Acting has been criticized for being really silly, but it matches up really well with the film's overall tone and style; it even goes so far as to reinforcing the film as a live-action anime. This production uses some very big-scale and highly imaginative sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is really cool too.Pacific Rim, finally, an epic movie that shows giant machines and giant beasts brawling and wreaking havoc. It's got the elements of classic kaiju monster films, robot anime, and maybe even a little hint of HP Lovecraft in the mix. It is exceptional for its worldbuilding, and I found it very immersive and impressive. However, if you're not captivated by this world, then you might just shrug it off as something silly. If you're taken by this film's concepts, then it comes heartily recommended.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Whether that sounded good or not to you, it's still worth watching. Don't be put off by the lack of big name actors in this movie as this proves that the reputation of an actor does not men they will make the film good, also proved by The Lone Ranger.Pacific Rim's premise is that giant dinosaur like creatures called Kaijus are attacking the countries which surround the Pacific Rim, which contains a portal which leads to the Kaijus dimension. To combat this, the UN pooled their resources together to create giant robots known as Jaegers to fight them. The Kaijus begin to evolve and with the UN losing faith in the Jaegers, they make one last stitch attempt to permanently deal with the Kaijus.Starting as always with the positive points, everyone in the film provides an A plus performance. Maybe it's because we expect the acting to be mediocre due to the emphasis on CGI and the lack of big name actors. Maybe this would make us look at this and think it's much better than I thought it would be. But no it's just plain good. The CGI is marvellous, as are the fight scenes and both combined is just as colossally gorgeous as the monsters. Whilst the story isn't as engaging or stimulating we would expect, especially from Mr del Toro, the ending is still satisfying and leaves room for a possible sequel. As an added point i'd like to ask how the hell did Grown Ups 2 beat this movie at the box office? because basically that film is bloody awful.Overall, it's like this concept was purposely drawn up for Michael Bay just so that he can have a CGI vacation with this. However, the story is still engrossing ad the action and acting keeps the viewer in the moment and excited. If you're action fans, you will love it and if you are fans of a deep, twist filled storyline you will learn to appreciate it. Basically, if you are reading this, Go see this movie. Like now.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

Everything feels like a long video game sequence; colorful and full of excitement, giving you just enough story to get you to the next epic battle scene. Don't get me wrong, the cinematography and color grading is fantastic, but after a while it became tiresome to look at. From CGI fight sequence to CGI fight sequence, there was no tension because there was little to no fear from the lack of humanist perspective. Sure the Jaeger pilots were in danger but somehow the cities were evacuated within minutes of Kaiju coming to shore, allowing for massive destruction to take place with no loss of life.Compared to Kong: Skull Island and Godzilla 2014, Pacific Rim fails to deliver any consequential action if humanity fails to subdue the beast. At worst, insurance premiums around port cities would go up to cover the loss of property. It would have been nice to see people interacting with the Kaiju, either running in terror, being stepped on, or smashed by objects thrown around. There was one moment when someone was eaten whole, but even that was short-lived. The attack of the Kaiju is a rallying cry for all of humanity to come together to end the threat. It's a wrestling match between humanity and the destructive powers of the natural world, and it plays out on the largest scale possible.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With a great director like Guillermo Del Toro, a fun cast with Idris Elba and Charlie Day, and monsters vs kaiju; hyped was an understatement. The movie almost lived up to its hype but unfortunately had its flaws.The movie is all about the human's war with the Kaiju (monsters from the ocean). To combat these monsters, society creates monsters of their own. The movie doesn't try and be anything more than that, a vehicle for monster vs monster combat.As expected, Del Toro delivers when it comes to one of the most stunning fight scenes I have ever seen. You could have put the middle fight scene from Pacific Rim into the middle of Batman and Robin and I'm still giving it a good score. I also enjoyed the performances by Idris Elba and Ron Perlman.Unfortunately, there were a few negatives. Firstly, the acting was just OK. Aside from Elba and Perlman, there weren't really any great performances. The scientists definitely overacted and the rest were just pedestrian. This wasn't a huge issue as I didn't come for the human interaction, I came for mecha carnage.The most disappointing thing with the movie was the ending. It's not that the final fight scene wasn't great in itself; it's just that it couldn't live up to the fight scene in the middle of the movie in the streets of Tokyo. The ending was a bit anti-climactic.If you are a fan of great action you can't go wrong with this movie. If you're a fan of mecha anime you can't go wrong with this movie. If you're a fan of Del Toro's you can't go wrong with this movie. Do yourself a favor and see it on the big screen, you won't regret it.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

Even with this puerile premise you'd think with the millions of dollars at Del Toro's disposal, he could've come up with something better than this mental diarrhea. With every cliché in the book, combined with every Del Toro cliché in the book, it's not only a crap-fest plot-wise, it's also visually awful. In one frame everyone's bathed in blue light. Next it's yellow, then it's red. As if it was not only written by an 8-year old, but filmed by one too. There's inappropriate steampunk sets, all of Del Toro's favourite 'actors' doing their best wood impressions and so many bad computer graphics you can virtually see the mouse pointer hovering over the screen. There is nothing in this film to recommend it. How it's garnered a score above 7 is beyond me.

There are times when the Asian chick Mako has some screen time, and honestly, it's very, very cringe worthy. Idris Alba does his best to be a good actor too, but the situation that he's placed in makes him especially impossible to make his acting shine competently (esp. the elevator scene. I'll say nothing more.). With that being sad, what really saves this film are the visuals. I mean wawaweewa. The movements of the jaegers. The way they move are so realistic that you feel their enormity, their crushing gravity within you as you watch this film. It's as if you're actually there, which is what makes this film so awesome (visually)! And then there's this one scene where... I won't say anything more because I won't give it away, but trust me. When you see the film, you'll never forget it. The image will stick with you to the grave. I'll just give you one clue: sunlight. Boom. That's it. Anyhow, there are times, however, when the film makes you feel that cheap props and super fake-as-hell stuff are being used. Maybe Hollywood was cutting corners OR Guillermo needs to find himself other artists who decorate his scenes, fabricate the non-cgi equipments, and so forth. Those annoying knick knacks really killed the film. But other than that, the visuals. For those alone, the film is worth 7 stars.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Performances are, for the most part pretty good, with a highlight being del Toro regular and fan favourite Ron Pearlman, his introduction clearly indicating how aware they are of how popular a casting choice he is. To the negative, most notable are, strangely, the male leads, who seem, at best going through motions, or at worst unbelievable. All that said, however, del Toro knows precisely the film he is making here and awards courting performances did not weigh too heavily on his mind, unlike the fantastic score, which actually should go up for an Oscar next year, being one of the best elements of the movie. It should also go without saying that it is visually spectacular, grand in scope and precise in detail. Despite its lightness in tone and the fact that it is ultimately little more than a huge summer blockbuster, del Toro directs with an assured hand, the likes of which Michael Bay can only dream he had. This is big, dumb fun, but really good, well designed big, dumb fun. Definitely whets the appetite for what he may have in store if he can ever get Lovecraft's 'At The Mountains of Madness' on to the screen.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

""Oblivion"" was worthy of a fantasy, but without claiming to be religious. I can not believe that the script for the ""turn of the Pacific"" was written by Travis Beacham, who also labored over the ""Battle of the Titans"", where the actual battle of the titans I never saw. I saw a real battle today, where huge robots fighting with monstrous monsters from a parallel universe. That's really the scale!From the first frame of the movie is steeped in history which began the extermination of humanity. There are no mysteries with a spectacular appearance in ""Godzilla."" All at once simple and clear. Elaborate figures as monsters and robots are staggering. Contractions are varied and unpredictable. The brain is not overloaded due to blurred shots when the huge devastation. Highly developed and detailed interiors, detailed drawing of the robot-rangers. From the point of view of all the pictures are just perfect.Also, the story does not disappoint. In principle, most of the predictable, but Guillermo del Toro tried to make the audience does not get bored while watching. That was it. Really looks the same breath. The acting for the sci-fi movie with a plot very worthy.Music sets the mood for epic. You feel the imminent end of humanity. In general, an adequate response to the recent zombie apocalypse.8 out of 10P.S.

Be it Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy or Hellboy 2 his level of visual flair is unsurpassed. More than that as evident from Pan's Labyrinth, he's also equally skillful in storytelling. Believe me Pan's Labyrinth is as twisted a simple fairytale can get. But he's had his fair share of hit and misses as well *cough* Don't be Afraid of the Dark *cough*. You know he's a good director when Peter Jackson himself chose Guilermo for directing The Hobbit trilogy. Unfortunately The Hobbit landed back in the hands of its own foster father than a step-dad. Its been 5 years since Guilermo's directed a movie. People thought he'd make a comeback with Hellboy but what came a surprise was Pacific Rim. First Look at its previews made me think ""oh yea, another Transformers clone"" but I was direly wrong. Pacific Rim is more than Michael Bay's Transformers, more than just an homage to Robots Vs Monsters movies as well.Pacific Rim is a nothing but glorified Power Rangers for adults movie, but it nevertheless entertain you. Basically its human-built giant robots, Jaegars, against giant alien monsters, Kaiju. What ensures is a huge huge robot on monster action with some drama sprinkled over the top. Pacific Rim, as soon as it starts puts you in the thick of action and clocking in at 132 minutes there was never a boring sequence. The writing was exactly what you'd expect in this genre. The lines were forced and at times very very clichéd but admit it you were neither in for performances or a plotyou were in for giant monsters vs giant robots and u get served pretty damn well and hot. The Drift was an interesting mechanic that serves as the backbone for the movie. Was a bit let down when other Jaegars didn't get enough screen-time as Gypsy Danger. Would have died to see the Russian one go a bit more. Most of the Kaiju encounters takes place at night and watching the movie in 3D felt a bit tedious as it was super dark I would have loved it if there was at least one head to head Kaiju fight in broad daylight. Then again the fight sequences were insanely detailed much much more than Transformers where we could only see blurs and metal scraps. Here in Pacific Rim each punch, each blow the Kaiju and Jaegers delivered was felt with equal force.Pacific Rim doesn't have a star-studded cast and it doesn't need one when the the plot is focused on Jaegars and Kaijus. Idris Elba had always stood out be it whatever roles he was in. He plays Stacker Pentecost and his sheer flamboyance does an amazing job here as well. I was particularly impressed with his ""Do not let my calm demeanour fool you, ranger!"" line. Rinko Kikuchi, as Mako Mari was good. I'd loved her in The Brothers Bloom where she delivered a solid performance without uttering a word. Her backstory here was touching, have to give kudos to the kid who played little Mako as well. It struck to me as vaguely similar to the Kim Phuc photo during the Viatnamese War. Comic relief by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman were good, it sometimes felt as cheesy but it was integral in this genre of movies. Guilermo's favorite Ron Perlman does a short role by name Hannibal Chau serving some chuckles. I was disappointed with the inadequate performance from the lead, Charlie Hunnam. Of course I've heard people saying his resemblance with Tron Legacy's Sam Flynn but thats just where the resemblances end. I just couldn't buy into his performance.Of course the real stars of Pacific Rim were the Jaegars and Kaiju and both were exquisitely detailed. Guillermo was never a stranger to monster designs, evident from some of the Hellboy and Pan Labyrinth monsters designed by himself.The Kaiju felt like intimidating hulking beasts of pure destruction and chaos and most of them modeled on monsterized versions of a shark, a gorilla etc. Loved them.Ramin Djawadi's score is pure spellbinding. I need not give an example more than Game of Throne's booming score. He does his magic again here with Pacific Rim. His score with the awesome visuals is enough to induce goosebumps. It leaves us in awe and beckons to be heard again and again. Tracks like 'Pacific Rim' and 'Gipsy Danger' is pure awesomeness.Pacific Rim is undoubtedly flawed in writing, performances and plot but it what it lacks there, it makes up with style, action and thrills. Pacific Rim isn't even close to Guillermo's Pan's Labyrinth or Hellboy in terms of storytelling but it excites you and it does give you an adrenaline rush watching the action packed fights and its more than any fanboy could ask for. Summer movies cant get any BIGGER than this. Go watch it at the movies now!","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

As the movie started to near release my excitement grew, seeing the robots and hints at the chaos in the Kaiju's wake were enough to make me feel like a little kid again watching my Godzilla movies. Even reviews were stellar for the movie and I thought it was to good to be true......and it was This movie is a good ride but it is NOT the great and awesome movie everyone is making it out to be. I understand supporting a film because it has a new fresh idea for Hollywood but that does not give a movie a free pass because this movie could have been allot better. Now if you liked the movie thats fine but I really wanted to love this movie and I only found my self just liking it.Sure the plot is as thin as nails but thats to be expected and I am not holding that against this movie. Many Kaiju films have horrible plots and the reason you watch those movies is to see giant monsters destroying cities. Now this movie has great visual effects and it looks amazing. The 3-D is the best I've seen since Avatar but the action scenes were missing something, in fact the whole movie seemed to be almost reaching the peak of amazement but never reached it, so for the whole movie I felt unfulfilled and the movie felt like it was missing something crucial.Now I did enjoy the movie it started out strong with an amazing opening sequence but as the movie reached the middle point it started to bog down. The action sequences didn't excite me or pump me up like when I saw Man of Steel or the Avengers. I wanted to leave the theatre wanting to run right back in to see it again. I found myself not really caring if I did see it again This has been a very strange summer, each big blockbuster has divided audiences and fans alike. Go see the movie for your self and see if you like it because allot of people were blown away. I just think the movie could have used allot more something in it because it was just a bland film in my eyes.I didn't hate Pacific Rim I did enjoy myself I just expected so much more I'll see it again when it comes out on bluray and I'll probably buy it when the price drops.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Sure enough it's (a) completely stereotypical for big smash-'em-up SF action films with giant monsters and robots, and (b) somehow (and I'm still not sure how exactly) vastly more fun than the dreary Transformers movies that it invites comparison with. Some pro reviewers say it's because there's a good, well developed dose of human interest that the Transformers lack. I think that's part of it -- the three principals played by Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, and (stunningly beautiful) Rinko Kikuchi are engaging and worth rooting for -- but somehow that's not all. Director Guillermo del Toro just knows his way around a scene and how to stich them together into a sweeping narrative. Of course there are gaping holes in the logic. Nothing much stands to reason if you look at it closely. As one example, every one of the Kaiju (alien monster) vs. Jaeger ( human-piloted giant warrior bot) battles happens in or near large cities where massive destruction and carnage can and does ensue. If this has been going on for years now as the plot says, why in h*** is anyone at all still living in coastal cities like Hong Kong or San Francisco? But without that, the fight scenes just wouldn't be as photogenic. Never mind. The bottom line is that this is B-movie material in the hands of an A-list director who has made it rise above its limitations, at least for the time you're watching. One wonders what the filmmakers of the original 1950's monster movies (Godzilla, Rodan, and the rest) would have made of this. At very least they'd have envied all the CGI tools that can be mobilized today.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What more could a geek ask for? Pacific Rim looked exciting right from the first trailer, aiming to unleash the action nerd in all of us. While there are some fumbles along the way, Pacific Rim succeeds in bringing larger-than-life action to the big screen.One of the first things you notice about Pacific Rim is the outstanding CGI. The visuals are at a top tier quality, some of the best I've ever seen in film. The fictional Kaiju race of aliens are brought to life along with their formidable foes, the human built Jaegers, through eye- popping CGI that really helps set the tone for what this movie is all about: gigantic action. Pacific Rim does not falter in delivering some of the biggest action scenes in recent time. The battles between the Jaegers and Kaiju just keep getting bigger, badder, and more epic as the movie goes on. The sheer scale of these monster battles is large enough to put even a movie like Transformers to shame. Mastermind Guillermo del Torro is in the directors chair for this film, and his vision to create a large-scale, CGI glorified action film is executed very well. The action sequences are gargantuan, and are highly entertaining to say the least.Where Pacific Rim thrives most is on the battlefield, focusing all of its attention on the clashes between the Jaegers and Kaiju. Where the movie falters is during the non-action scenes where it tries to tell an engaging story with characters you care about. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of action in this film, but too often does the movie stray away from the epic battles and tries to tell a smaller story inside this massive conflict, and it at times slows the movie down, nearly to a screeching halt. The plot is pretty straightforward, and while it has its short comings and clichés, it's good enough to be entertaining and at the same time not complete non-sense. Again, this is an action heavy movie, and when Pacific Rim gets too far away from that, it starts to show some of its weaknesses.The cast does an OK job, with the better performances coming from Idris Elba and Charlie Hunnam as Stacker Pentecost and Raleigh Becket respectively. Charlie Day, one of my personal favorite actors, and best known for his work on It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, provides comedic relief but doesn't quite fit the bill for this movie and his character seemed almost annoying at times. Rinko Kikuchi plays Mako Mori, and her performance was far and away the worst of any of the cast members, showing almost no emotion in her acting. Overall the cast was mediocre only adding a more human element to the sort of monster vs. monster theme.It won't keep you emotionally attached, it won't get you deep into its story, and it won't make you care for the small stories outside of the action. But what Pacific Rim will do, is provide exhilarating action sequences supplemented by stunning CGI and keep you largely entertained by the super-sized battles that only get bigger and better as the movie progresses. 8/10","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I do not know how could anybody rate this movie higher than 3. 3 is a good rating for this movie. So lets start: characters are pathetic, story is lame and full of inconsistencies, combat scenes is ridiculous. I will not mention CGI because nowadays anybody could do that. OK, if you are a 5 years old kid move could be great, but for all others (5+) is a insult for intelligence. Any episode of children series Power Rangers is better than this. I like SF so that is only reason i rated this movie so high as 3. There is many games, comics, cartoons with big robots and it is sad that no one could write good screenplay and make a decent movie. In a last decade only thing that matters is CGI, so make bad screenplay with a lot of CGI, make a good trailer and here you go. It is too bad that no one really cares about a story.

What Del Toro established was loosely based off of a lot of Japanese's comics and cartoons, but executed in an ultra realistic way. Everything from the water the Jaegers waded through to the epic fight scenes. Ramin Djwadi did an absolutely fantastic job with the ost. You may recognize him from iron man and game of thrones. The actors also did a great job. The lead actor was the weakest in my opinion. All of the supporting actors did a spectacular, though.

Why in the world would the military spend trillions of dollars on a mega bot to destroy something it could easily destroy with a nuke??Furthermore, some people are impressed with the CGI in this movie? The movie basically looks like a cartoon. The monsters aren't scary or even remotely believable. For effective, believable use of CGI, refer to Lord of the Rings, Star Trek or King Kong. Perhaps my nine year old would like this movie, which i may comprehend.

The aliens, aka Kaiju, have come from the ocean instead of the sky; There is a breach that leads to another dimension. And for some reason, the Kaiju only come 1 by 1 and months apart instead of sending in a whole bunch at one time. How does that make sense? You attack with numbers. And ways as you can see this movie requires the viewer to suspend a lot of common sense in order to enjoy.Humans have built giant ""Transformers"", aka Jaeger, to battle the aliens. It takes 2 people to operate the Jaeger. So our hero, Becket, has lost his brother in battle and gets recruited again for one last attempt to stop the Kaiju. He goes to Hong Kong where there are only 4 Jaeger left. Some Kaiju show up and we get another big battle. The general has a plan to end it all by blowing up the breach.Overall, it was a good action flick if you overlook the loop holes in the story and all reality. The special effects were really good, which is what made the film.FINAL VERDICT: a good choice for a popcorn flick","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yeah, there was a lot of hype surrounding it, but you can't really expect an epic, revolutionary storyline from a high budget Power Rangers movie. And as such, it does a good job, where Godzilla 1998 and the Transformers franchise failed. The Host and Cloverfield came closer, but weren't grandiose enough. King Kong did a great job, but that was almost a decade ago. Pacific Rim puts its enormous budget to good use, with some great special effects and vicious fights.The characters are pretty flat, though. Most can be described in one word, and some barely have lines. Charlie Day is liked by some, by I found him to be annoying, leeching time from the screen with his subplot. The two leads were likable, and Idris Elba is as boss as ever. But there should be more, considering the length of time you spend with them.Its made up by the action, IMHO. Titanic robots vs gigantic monsters has never been done better. The CGI is very good, the robots have cool designs, and each individual monster has a unique body type. Both sides are evenly matched, and you do get a sense of increasing danger as the Kaiju become larger, more intelligent, and specialized. There's hardly an easy battle, as Jaegers get smashed, Kaiju sliced and incinerated. The sheer scale is rarely matched in blockbusters, and the camera is calm enough to let it sink in.Oh yeah - the main theme is one of the most heroic themes of all time, despite the Inception horn.Its not exactly intelligent, but as a fan of mecha and monsters, Pacific Rim does so well what so few are doing that I couldn't help but enjoy myself. If you like the idea and hold your expectations right, its a perfectly good popcorn film. Its shallow, but its not like they could do much more with the concept. Let's just hope the series and sequel take things up a few notches!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm not a big fan of him, but this movie was cool.Don't expect too much - it's a summer blockbuster. Robots vs. Monsters, nothing more. But it's well done, intense, with good CGI and score, good production design (Carol Spier, Cronenberg's regular) and decent acting.I liked the goofy/clichéd/eccentric characters played by Burn Gorman (Gottlieb), Charlie Day (Dr. Geiszler) and Ron Perlman (Hannibal Chau). Actually, I recognized Clifton Collins Jr. as Choi and was certain he also plays the role of Gottlieb - they look absolutely like the same actor!My main criticism is about Del Toro getting into the territory of George Lucas' ""It's so dense"" and Michael Bay's extreme close ups of action scenes. There's simply too much movement on the screen all the time: Rain, fog, robots and monsters in extreme close ups. It's too much for the eyes and I'm very pleased not watching the 3D version, which is probably a torture.Also, the movie is slightly too long and should have ended a bit earlier - The ending is simply too much of an action/mess.Overall it's a very enjoyable popcorn movie and I recommend seeing the 2D version.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

His films always feel so imaginative, his world building and designs so impressive. He knows how to build everything to create his own vision. Pacific Rim sounds like a stupid concept at first, and while the movie is dumb, it knows how seriously to take itself. Unlike the transformers movies which need to convince the audience that the movie is dark and gritty, this movie has fun, with vibrant colours and fun characters. These characters are not original or very unique but their fun tropes, like Star Wars characters. In fact, I am surprised so many dislike these characters but then love Star Wars. It's probably due to the development of these characters, but I think everyone is fleshed out as much as they need to be. People consider this a modern Star Wars, and I would have to agree with it. It uses other sources and cliches mixed together to create its unique universe like Star Wars does. This universe doesn't sound so unique, I mean tecchnically theres just giant robots and kaijus now, but all the details Del Toro puts into the universe elevates this world. Guillermo Del Toro of course knows how to deal with special effects, but I was anticipating ths movie due to budget, as Del Toro doesn't typically get a big blockbuster budget, even in the Hellboy movies. This movie looks beautiful, with a wide variety of locations. Again, this is so colourful compared to most blockbusters. This colour makes the film interesting to look at. The inside of the Jaegers, the different Kaijus and the look of the Shatterdome, Hong Kong and the rift are beautiful, I haven't talked about the action, mostly because surpisingly there isn't a lot in the film, which is what I love. In fact, there are only 3 fights in the movie, the first one not really even counting as a fight, more as an introduction. The 2nd set piece, which I will not spoil to anyone, is by far the highlight of the film. One thing that sets this movie apart from others is the action itself. The Jaegers aren't fast Michael Bay robots, they are slow, and so are they Kaijus. This, combined with the water that is always in these action scenes as rain or waves, gives this feeling of impact by seeing the robots slowly smash water particles rather than zoom across the screen just to look cool. This feeling of scale is just awesome, established in each shot, always making sure the Jaegers feel huge.Pacific Rim is a movie unlike so many blockbusters these days which try to give off this fake seriousness that the movie doesn't need. I wish more movies were like this, and more directors were as talented as Guillermo Del Toro.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie drops you in the middle of it, in which it's been happening for awhile so we've created huge badass robots to fight the monsters. It's a decent enough premise to make the awesome concepts of battles between giant monsters & giant robots plausible. It's reason enough for us to get locked into this movie. The character development was alright, as was the acting. Charlie Hunnam plays the protagonist; and while I absolutely love him in Sons of Anarchy, he's not spectacular in the movie. He gets the job done and you root for him but you're gonna buy his action figure. Then there's Idris Elba. We already know he's awesome, because with every role he takes on, the film could be terrible but you know Elba is gonna perform greatly. However, not everyone comes to this movie for the characters. We came to watch giant robots battle giant monsters. And I'll tell you it's so awesome. The battles are so epic. The scale of these battles are humongous and it allows you to actually see the entire fight occur, as opposed to the Transformers movies where it's all in you face and you can't tell what's going most of the time other than the sound of clanking metal. No, with this movie you see it all, and it is absolutely awesome.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The plot is one of the weakly I ever saw in a film. The special effects are definitely the high point of the 131 minutes you are going to lose in your life if you decide to watch it. In some parts of the movie it looks like the viewer went back in time and is watching ""Power Rangers"" again. And not to mention the pointless dialog that go along all the scenes. If you are looking for more than special effects I strongly recommend to do not watch this crap, but if you really like this in a film, just watch Transformers or Battleship. At least these other two will not make you sorry to have waste time and money.","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

Nearly defeated by years of escalating assaults, the humans launch one last, desperate assault on the breach itself, to end this war once and for all.Entertaining film with lots of action and impressive F/X, and clever touches and nods to other films, is still pretty far-fetched stuff, but handled with reasonable intelligence and care.

Practically Shakespearean in their world-views and intricate family dynamics, both movies will keep you on the edge of your seat as plot twists have you guessing right up until the end on the big ""who done it"" question. Oh certainly, first-rate special effects added to well-crafted acting with so many layers of emotional depth you'd think its respective sea creatures were pipe-lined straight from Citizen Kane, or perhaps The Godfather, or maybe a bit of both. Really, who's to say which picture will garner the most Golden Globes or Academy Awards this year. My bet's on ILM's splendorous work in Pacific Rim although I've got to say Sharknado's sharks really projected tremendous amounts of fear-inducing horror that weren't quite the equal of the more anime-inflected denizens of Pacific Rim. I suggest you see both films in a double feature and decide for yourself.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

This movie is just great at what it's trying to do, I watched it years ago in cinema on release but it was pretty memorable. One of the stupid things about this movie is that the robots have this bad*ss chain sword that can literally cut a monster in half with one slice but they could have used it more often, right? It makes the huge guns on the robots look like peashooters compared to it and it has perfect close-quarters capability against a similar monster.

The storyline unfolds in a futuristic world invaded by Kaiju monsters, sparking a destructive rampage. Humanity responds with colossal machines piloted by two drivers. While the initial program succeeds, the Kaiju's growing strength challenges conventional combat methods, hinting at evolving strategies for the future.Directed by Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) and featuring Idris Elba (The Losers), Charles Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy), Rinko Kikuchi (Babel), Charlie Day (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia), and Ron Perlman (Hellboy).This film captivates with its blend of Godzilla versus Transformers vibes. The vibrant use of color, especially neon, enhances the visual experience. The CGI and special effects stand out, contributing to the movie's overall awesomeness. The acting and storyline, while not groundbreaking, feel authentic, and this picture has a satisfying and enjoyable conclusion.In summary, Pacific Rim is a delightful addition to the science fiction genre. I would give it a solid 7/10 and strongly recommend it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After seeing so many positive reviews of Pacific Rim form around the web and close friends it was clear I would have to see it, having known that Del Toro has directed Pacific Rim my expectations were already much higher due to his previous amazing movies(e.g. Pan's Labyrinth, the Devils Backbone, Hellboy). The general concept isn't in anyway bad that has to be stated straight off, but the same repetitive ideas that can be seen in Pacific Rim have previously appeared in the movie industry over and over again. I would still highly recommend this movie. It is a great movie to own and a brilliant movie to watch and add to your collection although perhaps it's not something I would watch consistently once in a while its a great movie to re-watch. Just a shame such a great director didn't see the repetitive features in this movie compared to others, yet still. Its a must see.

Cities were leveled, I shrugged. It's a dazzling film, but I never once laughed or teared up. It never made the hair on the back of my neck stand up or quicken my pulse. In short; I wasn't moved.

And unlike some movies *cough* Transformers 2 *cough*, the action scenes are actually immersing and thrilling, rather than confusing. They are also regularly interspersed with some storyline, so they don't get too drawn out.The story is your basic alien invasion science fiction with some small differences. I'm not going to give away anything more, though to be honest there isn't all that much I could tell you that you would really regret hearing. The movie isn't about story, even if it's interesting enough that it could have been.There will be some plot devices that you will see coming from miles away. But the movie also occasionally and refreshingly differentiates from the norm. For example: not everyone you expect will get eaten by the monsters.As for the acting, this seems to be criticized mostly. And although the characters are shallow, I can't say that the acting was so bad that I actually noticed. In fact I kinda thought the little Asian girl did an exceptional job, and I rarely notice good acting. I also rarely notice bad acting, so maybe I'm not the best compass in this area.Humor is also important for a blockbuster. Since the story is about an apocalyptic event, the amount of humor is sparse, but it's placed in the right moments where you can use a bit of laugh. Without it the whole thing would just be a bit too depressing.Pacific Rim not a masterpiece by any means, which seems to be why some critics give it terrible ratings. But like all movies, you should watch it in the spirit it was intended, in this case: a mindless thrill. This is where it succeeds well, and even above expectations. I'd put it on par with the classic 'Independence Day'. With a bit of luck this movie will reach that same status.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The relationships between the main characters were not developed well, and apart from the jaegar/kaiju fight scenes and the adventures of the mad scientist in Hong Kong, there wasn't much else that made the film stand out.However, the fight scenes were great, and it's worthy of being a summer blockbuster when compared to some of the other disasters that I've seen recently in theatres. The IMAX 3D experience complimented this aspect of the film.Overall, it deserves an 8/10 for the cinematography alone, but drops to a 7/10 because of the less-than-impressive dialogue and acting.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

In some ways, this movie just seemed like Transformers mixed with Starship Troopers, but the director did try to give it some depth with the whole 2 people controlling the robot thing. I did enjoy the film, but Idris Elba wasn't the best choice as the head of the team. I think that he should have played one of the guys in the robots and that Ron Perlman should have played Sergeant because of his mixture of wit and seriousness. Anyway, the CGI was great and the fight scenes looked amazing and very believable. You really do have to watch the film in HD, Blu-Ray or the cinema to get the best out of the film because there is a lot of attention to detail on the robots. As for the storyline, I was a bit disappointed with the whole save the world theme because it got corny towards the big showdowns to the end. You can't fault it for the action which was why I personally enjoyed the film. Epic!Round-Up: Idris Elba seems to be all over the place at the moment. I'm surprised that he's actually got time to do Luther, which seems to be loved by everyone around the world at the moment. Anyway, the main character, Charlie Hunnam, who was the skinny guy in Green Street and the main character in Deadfall, seems to lack emotion in the film and I had difficulty relating to his character. His acting style reminds me a lot like Sam Worthington, who I also find difficult to watch. With the amount of work that went into this project, they really did need someone with screen charisma, like Hugh Jackman who played the same type of role in Real Steel, and done a good job of it. Anyway, for the amount of money that they must of spent on graphics, they had to get who they could afford, which was why there wasn't any really massive names in the movie and they concentrated on the look more than the feel, which was what needed the most work.Budget: $190million Worldwide Gross: $408millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there human vs. robots type of movies with loads of action. 6/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Kaiju: even more enormous scaly monsters that rise from the ocean floor and do battle with Jaegers. What more do you need to know? That Guillermo del Toro is the director? That seeing 50 story robots using boats as weapons is pure adrenaline?The soundtrack is an amazing mix of old and new, lending it's self to classic Japanese monster movies and to modern action classics at the same time. Guillermo is an artist and a painting is what he has made with this movie. Just like a painting you bring to it your own set of interpretations and prejudices. For me this movie represented all the things I watched growing up and more, It was the summation of every giant Robo/monster flick ever made.Plot? Plenty to go around and if it was a bit cliché? As I said, this painting allows you to bring your own set of preconceptions to it. I saw it for what it was, an homage to those that went before and those that will be able to take the torch and carry it on. This is not your Power Rangers or Voltron and it sets the bar so high I doubt even Godzilla can survive without taking some points away from this piece of art.Art? Yeah it's art, it's just not pretentious enough or some.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

Once again, del Toro doesn't disappoint in visual effects at all, I think his sound department also has done a great job. The action scenes, they look awesome, you get engaged in them quickly and get excited for them, it's actually how the movie starts and then the title comes after 17 minutes (which I really liked that, because it set up the tone of the movie before anything officially gets started). However, series of denial decisions happen by different characters that none of them makes sense at all; in fact it creates some frustration. Besides that, the two scientists are just too cartoonish, which I guess they're meant to be there to create some humor, but in my opinion it makes the movie cheesy. About being cheesy, the ending should have been better (maybe I should blame it on the studio?), however what I like about the story is, it's not a commercial movie for national guard, army, navy, air force or anything like that, it's not USA saving the world, and I really dig that. The performances are decent, Idris Elba absolutely owned this movie, he definitely doesn't seem to be a supporting role, Charlie Hunnam whom I had seen for the first in Green Street Hooligans is great as well, but Charlie Day to is a little annoying here, I can't really blame it on his performance, again his role is just too cartoonish. Also regarding the soundtrack, it's decent and good enough for the movie, however my expectations from Ramin Djawadi has been raised since Game of Throne's latest season soundtrack was just amazing.Overall, if you're going to this movie for the battle scenes, you'll enjoy the feck out of it, in that case the movie would get slow at some points, and if you expect some amazing story here, you'd be disappointed. Even that, the movie is still entertaining; I give it 7.5/10.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

Pacific Rim seems to be a very promising try, as it starts where Godzilla or even Independence Day have stopped. With better funds, greater video effects, bigger sound, decent actors, huge soundtrack, excellent funny parts of two zany professors, this movie could have achieved a real great point. In some ways, it did. In many, it failed. With all the efforts, there are still may open questions dangling in the air. I will not ask them to create Spoilers, so still, some plot holes remain. The formulaic performance of several actors add to a weaker impression, and rather predictable twists of plot make it duller thing to peruse. There is much of a clichéd pathetic speaking, much of predictable development, and still, some questions were never answered. One can watch this movie once, just to get to know this one, but then luckily forget and never come back to this at all.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is what we all wanted. Colossal mechs punching the blue blood out of enormous beasts. Del Toro presented the sprawling action how he knows best, visual splendour and cinematic showmanship. Now, this is no means perfect in fact I would only say it's good, but I would be lying if I said I don't enjoy it. In the near future, Earth is rapidly becoming ravaged by Kaijus who are spawning from a mysterious teleporter in the depths of the Pacific Ocean. Humans retaliate by building and piloting gargantuan mechanised weapons known as Jaegers. And so we watch the enthralling action gripped to our seats as we shout ""Yeahhhh, punch it, slice it, rip its head off!!"". Del Toro has always been a visual director, and Pacific Rim is another great addition to his filmography. The neon lighting backdrop of Hong Kong where the ensuing battle rages on in the consistent downpour within the city's bay. The glowing venomous blue eyes of the Kaijus as they catastrophically cause chaos through animalistic means. Numerous characters sacrificing themselves and destructively being ripped apart as they attempt to save their world. The stakes are high, and so is the production value. Full marks for visuals, direction and sound editing. Charlie Hunnam may have the physicality as he boisterously waltzes around the Shatterdome as if he owns it, but his acting is as monotonous as a broken metronome. Rinko Kikuchi is just a total babe, and certainly underrated in everything she's in. Idris Elba gives the best speech since 'Independence Day' as he motivates his pilots in ""cancelling the apocalypse"". Everyone else? Functional. Charlie Day plays one of two irritating scientists and consistently annoys the heck out of me with his high pitch squealing. The story is fairly basic with limited surprises, but I'm sure you expected this. The first half is unquestionably slower than the second. However, you wanted titanic combat sequences, and you certainly got them! Monstrous popcorn entertainment, just lacks that extra punch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film is action packed and what makes this movie even more awesome is that a majority of the fight scenes are between giant robots and giant aliens. While the acting wasn't the greatest in Pacific Rim, the special effects and originality of the story overcome the bad acting to make an awesome film that is fun for all ages.Before getting into these intense action scenes, the film first develops a backstory that explains to the audience what is happening. There are these gigantic monsters that are known as Kaiju (Japanese for ""monster"") and they are invading Earth via a portal that is located deep in the Pacific Ocean (hence the name of the film). In order to combat these the nations of the world work together to build giant robots known as Jaegers (German for ""hunter"") and these are piloted by two people (three in one robot) whose minds are melded in ""the Drift"". With the Jaegers the Kaiju are becoming less of a threat, so much so that they are turned into toys. It isn't until the Kaiju become stronger and appear more frequently that the real story begins.The film suffered a bit from the acting. While the performances from Idris Elba, Ron Perlman, Charlie Day, and to some extent Burn Gorman, were phenomenal, many others were not. Idris Elba's acting really stands out in the film. Many of the other performances, especially Charlie Hunnam, were pretty bad and almost cringe-worthy. Many of the lines that come out of Charlie Hunnam's mouth are just terrible, not only in terms of the actual lines, but also the way that he says them. Two of his lines that come up immediately in the film, ""Tendo. What's happening my man?"" and ""You're gonna get your ass kicked"" are not only lame lines, but the way that he says them is very monotonous and it's impossible to infer any emotion from them. He's about to go out and fight a Kaiju and it's impossible to tell how the character is feeling. Even his facial expressions are bland, I couldn't tell whether what he was feeling at any point during the movie. Fortunately, not all of the acting is as bad as Hunnam's. Idris Elba is probably the film's best actor and it really shows in his character Stacker Pentecost. Right before the major battle in the film, when Elba gives his ""canceling the Apocalypse"" speech not only does he sound inspiring, but you can even see the emotion in his facial expressions. During that speech I couldn't help but get pumped to kick some alien butt.The entire film relies on the look of the Kaiju and Jaegers; fortunately, Del Toro spared no expense on the special effects and this is where the film really shines. It becomes evident in the first 10 minutes of the film that the special effects are outstanding. Unlike other movies that rely heavily on special effects (see Transformers) the special effects in ""Pacific Rim"" are perfect. Even in the dark rainy fight sequences it is still possible to understand what is going on and who is fighting who. While the fight sequences in ""ransformers were confusing and overfilled with explosions, the fight scenes in Pacific Rim are intense, but easy to comprehend.Pacific Rim, although it isn't going to win any Oscars, it still is an extremely enjoyable movie. The acting and script aren't extraordinary by any means, but that wasn't to be expected seeing what the movie is about. What really makes the movie are the special effects. By going into it expecting to see intense fight scenes between giant robots and aliens one can't but be impressed by the film.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

First off, let me say that this movie has some of the best graphics and visuals of any film in history to date. The fight scenes in this, during 2013, are like when you watched Jurassic Park in the mid 90s. It's just so good, so amazing, on a godlike scale, that it gets at least an 8/10 fresh out the gate.The story is pretty cool, but the family angle is played at a little bit, so some cheesy stuff is in the mix (girl like boy, boy has a bully rival, boy fight rival for girl, boy get girl). But it actually is badass how the overall story is made somehow acceptable. It is like Avatar - super far fetched, but everything is logical and in order, so you completely buy it.Everything was amazing, you have to see it if you like any movies at all. Only reason I didn't give it a 10, was because the writing could perhaps have been a little better. There was a scene with a 5-10 minute hand to hand battle between a giant alien monster, and one of the human guided Voltrons. Blow for blow, it is like a Mike Tyson fight. And then literally, when Voltron is about to lose the fight, one of the Voltron pilots says something like ""Oh yea, we have this giant sword that can pop out of the arm"".... and it does, and they kill the alien with one swing... Things like that, are not necessary evils that blockbusters with simple plot lines must lug around - that's what they want us to think. Good writing can always tie a fictional story together.But you can get past that - and you will, because it still is so far beyond 99% of all movies ever made, that you will permanently see life differently after watching it.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

This is many years later and the agency, who are still recruiting are seeking for new recruitment's and attempt to get Raleigh Beckett back where he was found doing construction. Yet, to run one those huge machines requires two people. He can't find a partner but wanted Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) instead but the person in charge Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) doesn't really want to see that happen for personal reasons which is later revealed in the movie. I liked the movie but wish their were memorable moments between Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Attacking from within a Time-energy portal, a series of Gigantic and colossal monsters set about to destroy the world's populations and absorb it's natural resources. To stop them, the world's humans do what they have never ever done before, they unite. Crafting colossal Robots the humans enclose two mentally linked pilots (Charlie Hunnam and Diego Klattenhoff) to combat their adversaries in the deep oceanic trenches of the Pacific Ocean. Idris Elba plays the General in charge of Operations and Ron Perlman plays the scavenger parts dealer. The movie is one gigantic world wide conflict with titanic battles and super powerful beings and there is no shortage of super struggles. The Humans are hard pressed to fight the incredible monsters, while the creatures are Ratcheting up their plan of world conquest. If one were to select a slight criticism of the movie I would ask why 90% of the movie is filmed in the dark. It is difficult to study all the fantastic art work which went into the filming and the story itself is hobbled by inconclusive ends which remain unresolved. Still what there is of it has the audience mesmerized with gigantic battles which absorbed every bit of interest in the theater. This movie is one for the Classics and one would not be surprised if it generates a sequel. Easily recommended. ****","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

Pacific Rim reminds me a lot of Robotech, a cartoon I used to watch a bit as a kid. At its core, Pacific Rim is an alien invasion movie not too unlike Independence Day. Earth is being serially attacked by these humongous creatures from another dimension coined Kaiju (which is Japanese for Monster). The world forces pooled their resources to create machinery to combat these Kaiju and they coined these mega machines Jaegers (German for giant). The Jaegers, operated by human pilots, dutifully protect the planet until the Kaiju become too much to handle. That's when they need real heroes.If it weren't for the action this movie would be a total waste because the story and the dialog is extremely unimaginative. The script and the acting even is sophomoric and has no real depth. Fortunately they had extra cool robots to take our attention away from the story. But even the action got to be overdone. It became destruction porn. Large cities being easily ripped apart by giant aliens and their pursuers--that gets old. How many movies with mega-beings or super-beings are going to lay waste to cities? I can only stand to see so many buildings destroyed before it all looks the same.The robots were nice, the creatures were nice but everything else was mediocre at best; the characters, the drama, the acting. This could've been a short film and been more effective.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yes, small. Small in terms of scope, ideas, characterization, script rewrites, concise editing, cliché- avoidance you name it. Those moved to tears by maverick director Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth – the polar opposite on all aforementioned fronts – may find this perplexing at best, and infuriating at worst. How could a writer-director capable of such depth make a film so (contrary to its title, to use up the supply of droll turns-of-phrase) shallow? The trick is to treat Pacific Rim as the world's most expensive B-movie, and all its shortcomings as intentional camp. This almost works. Indeed, there comes a gleeful sense of triumph at one of the most acclaimed working directors finally gifted with the kind of budget that has always eluded him and using it to expensively homage the tacky, under-budgeted monster movies that wowed him as a youth. However, as is common with big-budget pastiche, the tension between low-budget sensibility and big-budget expectations is never fully resolved, and the film losing its nerve in owning up to and overplaying its purposeful stupidity makes for an often-unsettling watch. Sequences of lengthy, drawn-out, predictable clichés treated as gasp-worthy plot twists occupy the dreaded purgatory between ""good"" and ""so-bad-its-good"", satisfying neither.The film opens with a smirking, concise and electric guitar-fuelled montage, which establishes not only the mythology and cursory science behind 'alien attackers vs. giant robot suit defenders', but the consequences behind it – the sociocultural ramifications behind Earth being invaded, logistics of humans relocating, jaeger pilots becoming ""rock stars"", even toys and other merchandise created in tandem with the conflict. Here, with a World War Z (the book, not the film) approach to the monster genre, spectacle and smarts are effortlessly blended – Godzilla circa Jurassic Park – and hopes are immediately set high, with no reason to expect the film to falter from this point on. But, inevitably, it does, and such momentary intelligence is quickly jettisoned for a succession of Hollywood clichés hammered loudly by stale acting. Again, it is hard not to see this approach as intentional, and the film is loud and often unexpectedly funny enough to make the ride worthwhile. It is simply no longer as fun. But, as with many del Toro projects, the beauty lies in the images. Or, in this case, the violence. On these fronts, Pacific Rim does not disappoint. The special effects, wedding del Toro's rubbery, stone-hewn aesthetics with CGI, are flawless. The alien kaiju are the most visually innovative monstrosities to rampage across screens in years – staggeringly large, covered in sharp edges, and throbbing with an intriguing blue light. The defenders – giant robotic exoskeleton jaegers (though subtext of German ""attackers"" versus Japanese ""monsters"" is best avoided), are equally fun, equally winking at clunky, diving-bell robots of vintage Japanese science-fiction. The film's best (and, effectively, only) plot twists lie in finding steadily more imaginative ways for the two titanic combatants to fight. The destruction is appealingly vast (it is no coincidence that I heard no fewer than three separate audience members leaving the theatre griping ""But where were the Avengers already?!""). However, unlike many of the plethora of other apocalyptic releases this year, del Toro keeps the focus immediately on the seismic fisticuffs of the monster fights, rather than extending his focus out to fetishize the wanton destruction. This lends Pacific Rim a curious intimacy, and one which, in a strange way, is far more effective than any of the script's fumbling attempts at humanizing its carbon-copy humans. Indeed, it is no surprise that, in the fiendish mind of del Toro, the most imaginative aspect of any character is their names. It isn't every movie in which characters named Stacker Pentecost, Hercules Hansen, Hannibal Chau, Newton Geizler, and Raleigh Becket exchange dialogue, and this in itself almost excuses the largely flat (but not flat enough) or cartoonish (but not uniformly cartoonish enough) performances. In many cases, del Toro simply supplants eccentric costuming as a shorthand to interesting character development (poor Clifton Collins Jr., being out-acted by an unfortunate bow-tie/suspenders/sideburns ensemble). And, inevitably, critiquing acting here is almost as redundant as stopping to reflect on the script's scientific liberties and purposeful misdirections (dinosaurs have how many brains?). Nonetheless, Charlie Hunnam is earnest, but snooze-worthy and instantly forgettable as the latest entry in ""generic white American male sci-fi leads 101"". Idris Elba stealing the show as Marshall Stacker Pentecost (a name worth repeating twice) is a given, as Elba mines unexpected reserves of gravitas, pathos, heart, and often humour out of his steely military stereotype. His ""Do not mistake my calm exterior!"" reprimand is just as likely to be belted out triumphantly in quoting wars as his already clumsily iconic ""Tonight we are CANCELING THE APOCALYPSE!"" pump-up speech. Rinko Kikuchi, while a pleasantly unexpected piece of casting, is still too underwritten to have much to do, and the script's frequent infantilization of her reads as too tiredly patriarchal to even be played for laughs or genre convention. On the cartoonish side, Charlie Day and Ron Pearlman have oodles of fun, though Burn Gorman, who sounds like a del Toro name himself, as the requisite twitchy German(?) scientist is less welcomely so. A curiosity in its ambiguous simplicity, del Toro's Pacific Rim, while always trashily fun, could easily have been 40 minutes shorter (and at least 40% better), had it bothered less with plot and characterization, which it only does begrudgingly anyway. A true triumph would be to see an alternate cut which wilfully embraces its campy stupidity and cheerful pastiche, milking the true enjoyment of its sublime creature effects. Still, for all your ""monsters vs. robots"" needs (and, let's face it, who doesn't have them?), del Toro proves a cheerfully triumphant dealer. And this is enough. -6/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

In a state of overwhelmed apathy against the massive sea creatures, the Jaeger program of gigantic warfare robots is restarted as a final effort against the imminent apocalypse in Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim.There is a little something for everyone in Pacific Rim, but the film will especially resonate with video game junkies. Comedy, romance, action, and sci-fi combine together in this mega-movie. What differentiates Pacific Rim from other less action-adventure films is its cohesive but novel plot that unites the film for a complete cinematic experience.So often science fiction films are worn out versions of the same skeletal story – while this is true of Pacific Rim as well, there are are multitude of fresh additions to set it apart. Imagine a film with robots and aliens and monster creatures and the apocalypse – it would be a muddled mess. Not so with the writing of Guillermo del Toro and Travis Beacham. Beacham and del Toro do not allow the film to get away from them by having a clearly formed and grounding vision for this futuristic universe.Do not let these rave accolades fool you, Pacific Rim is still a blockbuster at its core. The sound is deafening and will cause your heart to vibrate and there is no greater philosophical message from the film – just a fun free for all battlefest.Please check out our website for complete reviews of all the recent releases.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was skeptical at first, following my disappointment with Transformers (all of them). The machines look amazing! The camera angles are on point and the combat scenes could not have been shot any better. Maybe a little less light could have improved some scenes but overall the movie delivered what it promised to deliver. Stunning graphics. I liked the music and sounds too.The low points for me were the overused hero clichés and speeches in every movie you see. Additionally I believe Charlie Day's character could have been better.

The visual effects are really amazing, even for me - i watched this movie in 2D. The cast was just OK. I like the scientist and his loud and weird voice. Actually, the one who caught my eye was that little hong-Kong girl trying to hide from the monster.

When I first heard about Del Toro doing a NGE styled movie I was hooked. After the movie hit the theaters, opinions where mixed. A lot of people (me included) expected more from him, maybe something deeper and more refined.Had I watched the movie right after the release, I had given it a score of 4-5. But as time went by, I still liked the concept and a lot of friends said the usual stuff like ""you have to turn off your brain and enjoy the ride"" and I responded with ""Oh, is it that bad?"". I watched to many bad movies to waste my time with another one. But then a friend got hold of the Blue-ray and I watched it. I knew what I could and could not expect and the most important part, I accepted this for myself.I have to admit I enjoyed watching this movie! Nothing brilliant, no surprises, but in the end more then I hoped for and over two hours of visual stunning action. This movie certainly isn't boring! Why did it work for me this time around? Because the movie never tried to be more than it was. It doesn't take itself seriously and feels more like a comic with its share of humorous moments.The more important part for me was the revelation, that you can't rate a movie once and for all. Your life changes, your behavior changes and also your thinking. How many things do you like, just because you where there when they got created? How many of those things would you experience in a completely different way, if you would encounter them now, for the first time?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The 1st 5 min of the flick is so far the best movie opening of this summer. I would give this movie give this movie a ten, but that's where the Anime fanboy side comes out. I can name at least 6 animes that this takes big bites from. Although the movie makes up for it with a head 1st action approach. Yet I found myself acting like a kid during the fight scenes. Can't wait for this to come out the Blu-ray and will looking out for the video game soon. This will serve as a good blueprint for bringing anime to Hollywood.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

By the end of the movie, I ACTUALLY cared about what happens to the characters and how the story was going to resolve itself (despite the fairly standard-predictable-ending).When I first saw the trailer for Pacific Rim, I was sure it was going to be another brainless-CGI-bonanza that has NO character development, NO coherent plot, NO good actors and NO chemistry between those actors. You know what I'm talking about. I was expecting another ""Transformers 2"", ""Battleship"" or ""Total Recall"". I was wrong.I am by no means saying that Pacific Rim is Oscar material; but at least the director - together with the script writers and the actors - were able to produce some witty and compelling scenes that got me emotionally involved with the characters. That's very rare today.But there is something else that I want to compliment the director on:1) This movie had no political agenda that I could detect. There were no unnecessary snipes at Christianity, there was no promotion of ""alternative lifestyles"", and there was no criticism of capitalism or the military (aka the typical Hollywood targets). Well done.2) There was no nudity and no gratuitous sex scenes, even though there was a strong romantic relationship between the two main characters. In other words, there was no sexual propaganda in this movie. Well Done.3)There was very little use (if any) of the F-word in this movie. The characters were able to express their ""toughness"" and determination without resorting to childish profanity. Well Done.8/10","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

When someone tells you that and you're honest with yourself, you've got to see it, right.When I'd watched it, I thought it was a fun movie. I didn't get bored. It had a classic story with lots of the classic ingredients: traumatized main character, wicked scientists, etc. I really enjoyed it but it didn't really touch me and it didn't really 'stick' with me afterwards. But that's kind of what I was expecting. I don't see any deep and meaningful themes in it and I won't say it's artistic just because it's Guillermo del Toro's. I don't really think he had that intention anyway. I think he just wanted to make something cool this time. No more, no less. If his fans want to turn this movie into something like a far-fetched political statement disguised as an action movie, that's fine. But I won't. (Remember: he made Hellboy to.o) This was no more than a fun movie, temporary enjoyment. I would probably watch it again on TV but I wouldn't stay home for it, record it or buy it on blue-ray or something. I wouldn't call it awful and I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. I just thought it was a lot of fun.Never mind that lots of things in the movie were not really credible. And I don't mean 'realistic' by that. I'm a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan. It doesn't really bother me in this movie because I don't feel like they were trying to make a 100% credible masterpiece, more like a fun ride. And it sure was.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This isn't a movie for every alien movie lover, but it should suit most of you guys. If this movie was to be compared to let's say Battle L.A.and Battleship, pacific Rim will not fit those standards.

Cant not commend the effort made by the art and graphics department in this movie. Scenes spanning a few minutes on the screen have very painfully and artfully been translated which needs a shout out.And now for what went wrong: Theres too much happening.. This could have been packaged better. Maybe as a mini tv series or a two part movie or since Hollywood seems to love trilogies, they could have gone for a whole bonanza. But at 2 hours and 11 minutes long, you really feel the length of the movie in the second half. The acting and dialogue in certain scenes is just too painful to watch. Certain aspects of the story could have been handled better but now I am just nitpicking.Overall a pure popcorn flick.

I could hear it from 2 rooms away as if I was in the same room. My ears were ringing from the bass. The floor was vibrating, even the radiators were vibrating and buzzing, but as soon as the intense part was over it was too quiet to hear anything again.

Though other than that, don't expect to actually take anything away from the plot, we're just here to watch giant things punch each other. However, none of the chars were un-like able to the point where they were annoying, and even though there was close to no development, it sort of felt like there was something to lose if some of the pilots died. My final point is the soundtrack, which just makes everything feel more massive, from the guitar to the sirens of the jaeger.

My concern with the film and story, is that there wasn't much detail spent in the early days of the Jaegers, or better yet the full stages of the kaiju. I believe that if Pacific Rim had been made into a television show (perhaps even better if it happened now!) showcasing each kaiju battle and follow around the crews of each Jaeger, that a lot more people could enjoy the wonderful idea behind the film and story itself.

As great visuals demand more than a 51"" screen with built-in speakers to carry through on it's own, though, uninvolving acting and predictable plot just dragged overall viewing experience all down. My recommendation is therefore to watch ""Pacific Rim"" in the movie theater where the audio-visuals comes to their rights, and leaves you with the final impression. In any case: Leave your brains in the wardrobe... Del Toro had full control on both writing and directing ""El laberinto del fauno""(Pans Labyrinth), and made a masterpiece. Hopefully upcoming ""Pinocchio"" will pay tribute to his ability to make art when both writing and directing.

The film is directed by Guillermo Del Toro, who is one of the most consistent directors working today, and has cast full of perfectly capable actors/actresses. It is obvious that Del Toro was making this film for fun, and not for the awards season, since Pacific Rim does not have the overall tightness and quality that some of his other films have. Some of the acting is a bit questionable, and the script is far from special, which is especially apparent when Idris Elba gets some screen time. He is meant to be an military leader type character, and is the most generic one sided version of that character.

The trailers never once hinted at anything that resembled a plot. But it was a cheap day, and I had nothing better to do. I'll start with the cast. It contains basically no ""big-names"", which isn't always a bad thing. Problem is, it also doesn't contain any good acting. At all. There was not a single watchable performance in the movie. I do feel a little bad for the actors, though, as the writing was so terrible Daniel-Day Lewis would have struggled to say any of it convincingly. Two actors in particular, Burn Gorman and Charlie Day who play the two scientist, give maybe the worst performances I've ever seen. They are not even good enough to put into a kid's film. I don't know if that's what the director wanted, if it is, that's one more knock against him.Now the effects. I didn't really like Avatar, but I could at least appreciate the immense accomplishment of the visual effects. It was an unoriginal story, but it at least tried to develop it's characters. This film tried, barely, and failed terribly. It was impossible to care about anyone on screen. Back to the effects though. With nearly $200 million going straight to the CGI, they had to look good. It was nearly all you look at for 2 hours, after all. And that's all they look, good. Not ""blow me away"", or ""coolest thing I've ever seen in a movie"". Just good enough. Think Transformers meets Avatar. I heard Guillermo del Toro describe the movie as a ""visual feast"". It was closer to an assault on the eyes and ears for 2 hours. I looked away often because I knew I wasn't going to miss anything, and I didn't want to see it because I knew what would happen. The plot. Unoriginal is an understatement. It's disappointingly simple and uncreative. The dialogue is laughable. That's not just a saying. Me and my friends laughed in the theatre at multiple lines. Again, bad writing and bad acting.This was not an enjoyable movie to see, unless you truly don't care at all about intelligence in a film. You may say I just don't know how to ""have fun"" while watching a movie. That's like a little kid showing me Power Rangers episode and then wondering why I didn't love it. Do yourself a favour and skip this movie.","13 out of 28 found this helpful.

Robots beating the crap out of monsters and vice versa is something you don't see a lot in movies these days. Guillermo Del Toro really did bring the best of both worlds from Japanese monsters and from the robots. Visual effects here are awesome and I recommend seeing it in 3D cause it really shows more depth to the visualization. The only thing that bothered me in the movie is the two scientists. They're pretty annoying and when they need to tell something important and I couldn't really understand what they're saying.

Formulaic from beginning to end ""Pacific Rim"" is a tour-de-force visual extravaganza backgrounding a predictable, cliché'd story. Much of the imagery moves so quickly that it is difficult to tell what is happening (other than yet another big fight is underway). The ""kaiju"" were sufficiently similar looking and hard to scale that you had to be constantly told that the next one was bigger and badder (and they all looked like they had recently gargled with glowstick liquid). The big mechas were more interesting, with imagery reflecting the pop-culture that popularised the term 'kaiju' (I had 'Voltron' flashbacks), but the constant glare made them difficult to appreciate. The film contains lots of filler (training fights, a side trip to find a kaiju brain, etc) buttressing a minimal story and the script is mostly tough guy posturing, especially at the end, when every character seems to heroically say 'goodbye' several times. As is not uncommon in the genre, the story seemed to be written around the imagery rather than vice-versa, but generally, the state-of-the-art CGI was sufficiently impressive to keep me watching (and rewatching).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The very notion of giant robots trading blows with monsters across the world is likely to induce as many groans as it is cheers. Those cynical of the premise, though, may find themselves somewhat interested that director Guillermo del Toro is bringing his signature flourish to ""Pacific Rim,"" an ode to Japanese monster cinema. Kaiju originates as a Japanese word roughly translating as ""strange monster,"" but more pertinently here, Kaiju is the name for this entire genre of sci-fi, where massive creatures step on buildings and threaten to destroy civilization.The future of the world is threatened by an alien force, which unexpectedly, comes not from outer space, but from the center of the earth. In an attempt to stave off the seemingly inevitable domination of these creatures and the destruction of mankind as we know it, an army of giant robots manned by elite commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), and his crack team including renegade officer Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), and rookie soldier Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), head to the edge of the Pacific Ocean for the mother of all showdowns.""Pacific Rim"" will fully satisfy the summer blockbuster demographic and sell lots of popcorn, but the repetitive visual fireworks eventually runs thin over the course of 131 minutes. The films set pieces, in particular the destruction of Tokyo, and the climatic battle at the earth's core between the man-made monsters and their non- human adversaries, are undeniably impressive. The action is gigantic, with elaborate CG-animation staging showdowns in pouring rain or at the bottom of the ocean, delivering on sophisticated movement that's utterly convincing. However, it stumbles in its attempts to inject spirit into the proceedings, and interactions and dialogue between the central cast of humans provides nothing to the experience. That being said, if you're a fan of big, loud popcorn movies, ""Pacific Rim"" is unquestionably a cut above the gnarled heaps of metal that was ""Transformers"" (2007).","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Some teams try to beat the monster by jet and tank but it takes many days to defeat it. To level the combat, special forces from around the world build robots named ""Jaegers"". ""Jaegers"" is operated by 2 pilots whom minds are locked into one so they could move the robot based on their movement.""Spectacular"" is the best word to describe 'Pacific Rim'. All of the action scene is captured really detail from the fight in the water, land or even on sky although it seems length of the movie is too short for massive problems like that. They tells first Kaiju's attack in fast way and just skip through the existing of ""Jaegers"". Also there's a little bit let down in storyline about human. It feels too boring and standard in storyline which is unusual for a high class director like Guilermo del Toro. And one of the most fatal mistake is there are no well-known actor here who could support this movie and make it more commercial. The actors don't act bad though, but in a summer big-budget movie, they should hire at least one popular actor as main role. Overall 'Pacific Rim' is one of the most satisfying movie at this summer season, it's big, fantastic and fun. Most credit should be given to the special effects members who create the combat between robot and monster look real. Also the IMAX 3D is incredible and worth to see. Unfortunately 'Pacific Rim' suffers with weak storyline that makes it flaw.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Sometimes it amazes me what they can do in movies you should definitely watch this If you like amazing action sequences watch this I wish they would've done something else to make the plot a little better but still a good movie A lot better than I expected","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have no interest in CGI. I think the kind of people who do are those who are distracted by shiny objects.Its sad to see Del Toro ( whom I do admire) turning out a complete dud like this.

Everything about it is really cool. Badass robot designs. Scary monsters. Cool fighting scenes. Beautiful visuals. The 3D effect wasn't an after thought. It was actually really noticeable and added to the movie's beautiful visual design. Pacific Rim is an homage to the monster movie genre and to many anime series such Evangelion. If you are a fan you will love this movie. The plot is fairly simple and the characters are not that deep but despite this there are still a few emotionally gripping scenes. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the film. It struck a balance between seriousness and lightheartedness. The movie is serious enough to make you care enough for the characters and believe that the world is plausible. Yet it is light enough for you to have fun and a good laugh at times.Overall, a really good time at the theatre. 8 Jagers out of 10","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Story goes with aliens rising beneath our ocean floor and invading the entire earth for some reason (watch the movie). Because the aliens are huge (pre historic days and behave like a drunk King Kong), governments from across the globe united to create an elite team to combat these aliens in the form of engineered robots (Jaegers) with distinct fighting gears. The catch is its mostly a two man vessel connected to a neural bridge. Huh? Since its a large robot one person serves as the right brain while the other the left. Their memories are merged and their brains (not literally) as well to serve as one main CPU for their android. To cut the story short, they need to kill the monsters (Kaiju) to save human race. To make it long, to top that we have a melodramatic lead actor and his sidekick, a drama queen as well. Too many characters playing certain roles to extend the movie more than two hours. It has too much testosterone that it felt like watching 300. Their plot may fall short but Ill give them two thumbs up for technicalities and attention to detail. When the movie ended, I wanted to be a Jaeger because I got moves like jagger (now laugh). Overall, it's a visual effects feast and what's interesting is our annoying seatmate whose queries are due to his disconnection from the movie. If only he was not sleeping. 3 out of 5 popcorns","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","'Pacific Rim' is awesome in both the literal meaning of the word and it's more adolescent expression, but it lacks the characters and plot required to elevate the spectacle.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2894995/?ref_=tt_urv","hughesreviews-co-uk","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47635830/?ref_=tt_urv","27 October 2013","In between all his Spanish art-house films, Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro loves to do a good sized blockbuster. 'Pacific Rim', Del Toro's follow up to 2008′s hugely enjoyable comic book adventure 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army', is as sized as it gets.Whether he is tearing up cities in 3D, or directing independent projects in foreign languages, Del Toro always does his work with a strong dose of passion, love and integrity that makes him a true auteur. Unbelievably, in all this monster mayhem, you can see that this is the same man who directed the small fantasy/war/drama masterpiece 'Pans Labyrinth'. Every film he develops appears to be a passion project for this genius, and he does not discriminate when it comes to budget; injecting beautiful fantasy design, considerate storytelling and overall good taste. This is the difference between something like 'Pacific Rim' and 'Transformers'. Love of an unappreciated genre pours of the screen, as does the visionary's artistry and lack of cynicism. Del Toro ensures he evacuates his cities before the mass destruction ensues (unlike a certain Superman film) and he does his best to ensure there is no glamorization of the military, or the violence. This is a strongly anti-fascist human being, and I have no doubt he is someone who is sensitive to the political implications of his images. Despite his best attempts, he can't escape an inevitable ooh-rah, gung-ho mentality, but because it is such an unpretentious experience, that embraces it's B movie charm, you don't tend to think too politically about a film in which a guy orders ""Elbow rocket!"" and then proceeds to wallop a glowing gorilla monster in the face. Really hard.But there is more to Guillermo than rocket punching. If anything, the film is a call to unity. ""The bigger the bond, the stronger you fight"" sums up a film about international community and humanities need to work together. Jaegers need two pilots to operate them; we literally cannot fight the threat without co-existence. The two pilots need to mentally transfuse with each other, share minds and control the robot in a process called the drift. The heroes are not heroes unless they are together. I find this message to be more ideologically agreeable, and easier to embrace, than the jingoistic, pro-military; sexist inclinations of a certain Michael Bay. It's true that I have a bit of a man crush on Guillermo Del Toro – being such the great human being he is – but 'Pacific Rim' is an original concept in a time full of sequels, prequels and reboots. Most of all, it captures the awe of what action spectacle can and should be.Visually, the movie is majestic. Kaiju, inspired by a vast array of animals, are biologically fascinating and rather beautiful. The Jaegers, inspired by everything from buildings to John Wayne, are impressive in it's mechanical detail. These robot Jaegers have personalities and reflect their nation of origin; they are characters in themselves. The CGI which brings Del Toro's vision to life is wonderful. A scene in which a half broken, defeated Jaeger collapses unto it's knees before two bystanders, on a winter beach, feels more like the stuff of fine art. It is an image that has every right to be painted, framed and placed in a gallery. As with any Del Toro movie, there is a staggering attention to detail that you will most likely notice more on a second viewing. Not just visually; there are all to brief moments when we witness – 'Starship Trooper' style – life of humanity at war. Jaeger pilots become media heroes to the population; in the style of WW1 fighter pilots like the Red Baron, and there are propaganda war posters covering the planet. Not to forget the Kaiju poop. Also, the crew of a Jaeger feel more like a WW2 bomber team; showing the many historical influences the filmmakers drew from. This subtle world building enriches the overall experience and may come in quite useful for any sequels/prequels.The 12 year old boy inside me was loving it. The apex of boyish joy is the beautifully luminescent battle of Hong Kong. The scale is huge; and regular appearances from helicopters circling the monster vs. metal clash emphasizes this fact and the ridiculous size of the movie in general. You literally cannot get away from the low angle shot; Del Toro is continuously reminding us that these things are gargantuan. Unfortunately, the movie can never quite top that enthralling sequence and the resulting third act is a bit of an unimaginative disappointment that is far too similar to fellow alien invasion spectacle 'Independence Day'.Performances are fine, but almost all the characters lacked any real personality. This is by far the biggest drawback, and unfortunately, from a narrative and thematic point, it is a problem as big as a giant Kaiju. Idris Elba, however, is great; as he cancels apocalypses and walks around with the awesome name of Stacker Pentecost. Not only is he a charismatic bad-ass, but his character is the most interesting by a long stretch.This is a love letter to the Japanese Mecha and Kaiju genre and the works of fantasy visual effects artist Ray Harryhausen. Beyond that, it is a statement to western audiences that the 'Godzilla' remake was not the best introduction to giant monsters. 'Pacific Rim' is a beautiful cross cultural blend and the affection the film evidently has for it's influences is infectious. I want to delve into my collection and re-watch 'Godzilla', or 'It Came From Beneath the Sea' and then explore the many films and anime I have not seen yet. After the disappointing collapse of Del Toro adapting either The Hobbit or At The Mountains of Madness, it is good to see a project with his name finally on it.Go to hughesreviews.co.uk for the full article, more film reviews and more features!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's heavily influenced by Japanise monster anime, where huge robots beat the sense out of equally huge monsters. That is not a genre I am a huge fan of, as the ones I've seen tend to be a bit overly melodramatic and in that Pacific Rim also does dwell its own share. When all is said and done though, Pacific Rim does manage to be an entertaining, albeit very predictable movie about how underdogs finally manage to beat the odds and save the humanity.The plot of the movie isn't anything spectacular, it's merely an excuse to show as many robot/monster battles possible. The characters are equally uninteresting archetypes with nothing interesting to offer and the only thing the movie works is, that the battles do look pretty damn good. Guillermo Del Toro directs with a steady hand and has made the action sequences both entertaining and easy to the eye.Del Toro's direction saves quite a bit in the movie. If he'd be a poorer director, the movie would be borderline unwatchable, but he manages to keep the strings nicely in his hands. PR isn't a masterpiece of cinema by any means, but it works reasonably well for what it is: a movie about huge robots pummeling monsters.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was not very interested in it after watching trailer. I thought it just looks like another action packed CGI movie on big creatures like Transformers and I am happy I proved myself wrong by giving it a try. Yes it's like Transformers where everything is too big to fit in even IMAX screen but treatment is where it scores. It doesn't take too much time to make a plot for its big action sequences. The threat is there from the very first scene, where Kaijus (An Asian legend on the lines of Godzila) can vanish the whole human race. So humans created big robots Jaegars operated by two pilots at a time to fight them and the whole movie is about how it all ends. The whole movie is so much fun to watch that you feel like a kid enjoying WWF fight on big screen. The whole movie is another excellent example of CGI visuals and creatures and it gets even better with immersive 3D experience. Characters and twists are predictable but they are never overdone. Dialogues are funny at times. Performances are average. All in all, you won't like to blink throughout the movie because you don't want to miss the punches Jaegars make to Kaijus. I hope there will be a sequel to it because this effort needs to be rewarded.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Pacific Rim looked promising, but turns out a major disappointment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2831341/?ref_=tt_urv","Michael Kenmore","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0089164/?ref_=tt_urv","13 July 2013","This review should be prefaced by the fact that I never saw the preview before coming to see the movie, so I was not needlessly spoiled to know the details and visuals of the movie, except a few publicity photos that piqued my interest.Much have been said about the movie by some noteworthy reviewers who reacted negatively. Suffice to say I found the movie to be an overambitious yet tepid attempt, which led to my struggle to sit through the movie, partly bored and mostly offended, for the reasons to be outlined by me.First, the visual effects and colorfully vibrant cinematography, in conjunction with 3-D, are spectacular, but occasionally bombastic and redundant. What matters is the story and proper characterization with plausible and non-cringeworthy dialogue, which is difficult to pull off in a big concept movie like Pacific Rim.I found the characterization of German-descent roles offensive in perpetuating the stereotype, such as the ""dorky"" mathematician, on top of ethnic stereotyping. In my mind, the most offensive stereotype in the movie is the irritatingly patronizing military leader played by Idris Elba, who might be familiar as having starred as the Norse God Heimdallr in the revisionist adaptation of ""Thor"".Despite the backstory established in the first ten minutes, the movie never felt right, only frequently dull due to the feeling of ""deja vu"" (having seen some big monster and mecha movies) and redundant monster versus mecha fight scenes.I came to see the movie, expecting a fun ride. But this movie is certainly not fun, at least pertaining to the questionable story arcs, occasional cringeworthy corny dialogue, stilted acting, excessively bombastic visual effects and production design (""eye candy""), disturbing scenes of violence that pushes PG-13 rating boundary, and, of course, stereotype and cliché galore.I noted the general audience's mood was not quite receptive to Pacific Rim after the conclusion. Muted and perplexed reaction. I knew what I'm getting into, being familiar with mecha (the glacial but riveting Patlabor anime movies), but this movie just feels flat-out mediocre, which lends to disappointed feeling in deflated expectation.Pacific Rim is certainly an overambitious movie, with the co-writer and director Guillermo del Toro being aggravatingly self-indulgent as usual like in his preceding movies (I remember Pan's Labyrinth being obnoxiously didactic with gory violence when it came out in theatres to the audience's disgusted reaction).The movie is in essence childish in its reverence for self-serving moralistic approach, smirk-evoking cheese (in particular stilted acting & overacting with some eye-rolling dialogue), visual spectacle and PG-13-stretching violence.Guillermo del Toro is almost a good movie director, but he self-sabotages by focusing on the repetition and clichés, which not even film editing could save by excising some lame and extraneous scenes. (It is said the movie has an hour of extra footage.) Del Toro is one of the ultimate ""geek"" movie directors, the other his best friend James Cameron, but somehow Del Toro falls back on the standard clichés and stereotypes with the ""more is more"" bloated spectacle, which leads to the frustration of watching the movie as it repeatedly sabotages itself that lends to dull and exasperated feeling, which may explain the audience's near-universal negative impression.Pacific Rim has some merits, such as the astoundingly high production values, but the factors described above basically killed the movie in terms of mere enjoyment. The movie seems to mock the audience by patronizing attitude with stereotypical characterization, redundant monster versus mecha fight sequences that feel padded out and ineptly manipulative emotional scenes that feel dishonest.This is Guillermo del Toro's ""toy movie,"" not unlike Michael Bay who fundamentally destroyed The Transformers with the regressively worse sequels to seek the box office fortune.Pacific Rim would have been a fun movie, but, unfortunately, it is not. Perhaps Del Toro needs the lesson how James Cameron succeeds in producing the consistently and thoroughly entertaining movies, which do not directly or indirectly insult the audience, that result in box office records.The movie is consigned to mediocrity by the reason of self-sabotage that belie Guillermo del Toro's impressively ambitious & creative energy yet might be tempered by the patronizingly smug attitude. Pacific Rim just feels dull and forgettable by the time the show is over, which makes it a truly ""half-assed"" movie.** out of 4","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

Idris Elba did what he could with the script. Some other characters, like the scientists and the black market guy, are similarly well acted as the cold, predictable script allows. The female character was so horribly developed, so weak, such a drag, such a liability to all the good guys, that no matter what the actress did, I don't think I would have liked her.All in all, a good time waster, but there are better, more fun time wasters out there.

Ass.It is obviously inspired by the classic Japanese animated series ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", which was itself influenced by earlier ""kaiju movies"" like Godzilla. It's about a portal to another dimension that opens up deep in the ocean. Big monsters (appropriately called ""kaiju"") come out of it and trash coastal cities. The world bands together and makes giant human-controlled robots to go fight them.And that's really the whole plot.But that's not the whole movie. There is also a real heart to the story. Several characters have survived trauma and use each other to work through the issues. The movie is genuinely multi-cultural without bothering to point that out. And in the end, it's a lesson about teamwork, also without directly pointing it out.The monster fights redefine the word ""epic"". Director Guillermo del Toro has taken to heart the phrase ""go big or go home"". He doesn't go home. He has no problem destroying entire cities (but he does take care to evacuate them first. This is not a violent bloodbath movie).Del Toro knows that these stories can get corny, so he preempts it by steering directly into cheesy humor. There's a super geeky subplot about two scientists competing to come up with the best solution, and Ron Perlman gives a great over-the-top performance of a black market trafficker in monster body parts. Everybody knows they're being ridiculous, so it works.This is not a deep, socially relevant film about existential problems. It's not even all that original. I mean, it's a giant robot fight movie. But by zeroing in on what makes those movies work, Guillermo del Toro has managed to achieve something really rare - to make me feel like a kid again. It made me remember the old Godzilla movies; watching the larger-than-life battles between things that would make me feel so small... but knowing that with the right people around me, I could slay monsters.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Well i have to say first of all, the movie is extremely predictable. You know whats going to happened about 5 minutes before it does. Don't WORRY NO SPOILERS: There's a scene where someone gets mad at someone and wont let them go in combat, but due to lack of soldiers/offenders (whatever they are called) the person has to go with another soldier. I can go on like this for a distinctive amount of time, but i will be spoiling and that's what i don't want. But overall, other then that, the movie was great.

You know it's going to be a mindless action movie. But with Guillermo del Toro directing and co-writing, I expected more.It was awful. At least most kid's movies put in something for adults, but this one was painful. Sure, the visuals and grandeur were very impressive, and I didn't go in with high hopes of a complex story or a terribly memorable script, but I was certainly not expecting such painful doses of cheese and heavy-handed Lessons about Friendship and Family that turned it into a cartoon for young kids. Some acting might have been nice, too; the writing and performances were mostly cringe-worthy.There were a couple of nice scenes concerning the hazards of interfacing the pilots' minds with the robot controls, but otherwise, it was a predictable, insulting exercise in ridiculous, physics-defying scenario-building and advertising for a range of action figure toys.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

How can you possibly say no to a team like that?It was probably names like these, combined with the gritty, neon- mecha aesthetic, that made you decide to watch this movie. That being said, the movies writers, producers, and even lead actors were almost completely useless. The characters are forced, the plot is stupid, and none of it will inspire a single interesting thought. If I could, I would have literally cut every scene without Godzilla, Kaiju, or Jaegers. But the fight scenes... Sweet Zombie Jesus, those beautiful fight scenes. If anything, this movie is a testament to what a visionary director can do with a ton of good CGI.As del Toro admits in behind-the-scenes footage, almost all of the film's basic concepts are ripped off of mecha anime. That being said, the details of the fight scenes are breath-takingly original. Every light reflecting off Godzilla's reptilian body, every nuclear- powered Jaeger footstep, every building that explodes into millions of virtual pieces, every volcanic glow behind leathery Kaiju wings. It is all meticulously designed to maximize visual pleasure. This is eye-candy that hasn't been seen by cinema thus far.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But it falls short on characters, not because there is too little plot but because there is too much cramped into the whole thing. And considering they are planning a sequel, I question why they didn't go for a trilogy in the first place. The story arc is compelling and the character development could be intriguing if it got some room to play out. But like it is, everything feels rushed and half baked. It's pretty much like Ender's Game. For me a great movie has time to show action, tell a good story and let characters engage the viewers thru the relationships between them - if they can't do it in 1 movie than go ahead and make it 2 or 3 movies. But when you go for such a first part and then try to sell me a sequel, I feel short changed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As this movie about REAL-BIG-THINGS (i mean, things are really big when you see these on a screen first time), Del Toro focusing exactly on them, unlike other directors of such films. No unnecessary dialogues, only clear and simple plot. In contrast to the similar sci-fi action films, where there is tedious break between a beginning and final scene,Del Toro doesn't allow himself such. You will no doubt have fun and don't notice how time flew. So, if you don't wanna miss the great battle between human beings and most vile creatures who ever attacked our planet, you definitely should see this film.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The look of the movie is great as has been noted by just about everyone. However at the same time it feels derivative. Like a great master craftsman making the same artifact over and over, each one better than the last but ultimately all being the same thing. We've seen this movie before, just not as polished. Idris Elba and Ron Perlman steal the show, their characters define the extremes of the human world better than any of the others and they chew scenery with the best of them. Elba especially managed to perfectly embody the anime archetype of the pained father figure general without making it ridiculous, I don't really know how he managed to do it even though I watched it happen. Perlman was just fun in every scene but his scenes worked best when his insecurity was on display rather than the Hellboy persona he channeled for other parts. The two scientist dweeb types while fun and entertaining still feel shoehorned in for stereotype. The main leads are frankly forgettable cookie cutter jock types that seem better suited to TV sitcoms or police procedural. The ""wacky"" secondary characters such as the other crew or mission ops guy we never really see enough of to care about.Plot? Well, not much of that going on here. Pretty standard alien invasion/giant monster fare with the we've-seen-it-a-million-times lone wolf character coming back for redemption. This is basically a good Godzilla movie wrapped in a live action Anime design.Still, as popcorn munching fun it was pretty good. If it were any other director/writer I'd give it a higher rating purely for glitzy cartoon style entertainment but I expected a little something deeper and cerebral, if only in passing, since Guillermo Del Toro was the creative driver. The theme of merging neural pathways of 2 or more people to drive a giant robot has rich possibilities but the movie never mines this idea beyond the surface. If they managed to make a sequel I'd go watch it but I'd temper my expectations. One good thing after watching this movie, I'm not as bummed as I was before that Del Toro doesn't get to make Lovecraft's Mountains of Madness. In the credits James Cameron is thanked (among others) and I think that can clue you into what this movie is, grand spectacle extremely well crafted but very linear predictable story. The movie is dedicated to Ray Harryhausen and Ishirō Honda which is another clue what this film is, a love letter to giant monster movies, and frankly that works for me. Recommended with some flaws.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Surrounded by my friends and their popcorn, I sat and smiled contently for almost three hours. Just because I loved it does not mean I am going to waste your time with a 10 out of 10 review. It was certainly entertaining, but I'm afraid that they were afraid of taking this film to its maximum potential.Let's start with the action: It was amazing... half the time! The crunching blows delivered from giant robots, and the cheezy attacks that all giant robots are made to have provided some heart-pounding, action-packed fights. But then a different shot. The camera was thrown all over the place and the flashy lights made for a continuation of havoc, but the fight was gone. There were no monsters or robots, just shaky lights and loud noises, or blurred shots of convoluted combat. It's cheaper to film this way, but it was done far too much. The plot: cliché, but did keep continuity. The plot had flow, and the story was well-paced and kept a good feeling of urgency, but there were some aspects of the film that could have easily been replaced with more cleverly written lines and action. Some of the plot's predictable quirks were enjoyable and the film would suffer without them, simply, because they were fun. The rest of the story, however, was far too predictable and it wouldn't have taken much effort (or funds) to mix it up a bit. The acting: great, that's it. It was great. Some of the acting avoided being wonderful because of the predictable story. Knowing what would happen next and then finally seeing the shot where they react was uneventful, but the whole time everyone was believable and did well. There were two very enjoyable actors. They provided jokes, like-able characters, and good development. I think they will be a deciding factor for this movie. They were funny and without them this movie would lack any comedy. You'll know who I mean.The production values were high, the majority of the time, and the film was just flat out fun to watch. It's worth seeing, even just for the epic shots of monster smashing. If you avoid violence, then don't see the film. It's violent - a little gory with the monster beating. That's mostly the point of the film, and they did a really good job with it. My favorite part of the film was the sound effects and music. The sound clenching my ears was always thrilling. The monsters were fierce and the soundtrack took the fights from cool to brutal (the good kind).If you hate clichés or violence you'll be disappointed. If you don't hate cliché's or violence, or can at least tolerate them... well, then you'll probably enjoy this film, at least for some giant pugilism.ByKy","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

It seems that an era has begun were special effects get better rating then acting or plots. Pacific Rim is similar to Battleship, lots of action and more action but absolutely no BRAINS at all.It is very hard to believe that the man behind ""El laberinto del fauno"" has made such an imbecile movie.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

With many films taking the overly engineered aliens with ultra advanced tech, this one worked backwards, looking at something virtually no one looks at (basically sea monsters). With the classic 'pin 2 cool creatures to fight with each other' trope known all too well, this was a promising film. But alas, my expectations were too high. Though good, this show was not a standout by any means. And though its tolerable, the plot holes in the film (where suddenly the issues talked about in the first half of the films were suddenly solved without explanation? Just seems ludicrous to me. Either way, if you were to look at this at the shallow surface level as a film that would do nothing more than to just entertain, it has done its job.

The underlying story may not come out as effectively as some people may expect but that does not distract from the overall fun factor. This movie has a good level of comic relief especially from Ron Perlmans' character. There are some pretty strong characters too, Idis Elba for example is his usual brilliant self as stacker and Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chow is genuinely funny.

I liked the characters but they weren't in depth or anything but they had enough detail to elevate them over other. Idris Elba's character was awesome though. The plot does the job it isn't groundbreaking but it is fine. But that isn't the point, we are here to see the battles and they are fantastic. I give it 9 out of 10 and I think that is fair.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

When it is good it is great, and when it is bad it is abysmal, yet the balance is still positive.So, what were the hits and misses? Let's start with the bad:1) Actors: Granted, the dialogs are as camp as they come and this is not exactly a psychological thriller, yet none of them went above the ""completely forgettable"" level. Except for Rob Perlman, of course and even him seemed to struggle.2) Plot: this is CGI porn, and as in porn, the plot is merely an excuse to tie up some great CGI scenes. I love mindless action movies, and I usually do not have much trouble suspending my disbelief, but this time I found myself making too many efforts to dismiss some blatant plot holes. 3) Pacing: for a movie with no plot, even as great looking as this one, 131 minutes is just too much. With characters lacking any depth, and speeches a la Independence Day, one ends up feeling that it would have been a great 90-100 minutes movie. Not looking forward to the extended cut.Now, the good:1) CGI: CGI is nowadays ubiquitous so when I read some review saying ""amazing digital effects!"" I take that with a pinch of salt. To be honest, not even the new Star Wars trilogy impressed me much. But this one is great. Not a matter of budget, but of taste.2) Great References: Godzilla? Mazinger Z? Anime? Sci Fi B movies of the 50s? Everything is there, but it's done with class, not a mere copy paste of random bits, but organically fused in a single piece. Many of the objections are more limitations of those genres than issues with this movie only. A wonderful homage to our childhood.3) Love: Guillermo del Toro loved what he was doing and it shows. It is not the perfect film, but is still enjoyable, despite it's bad spots. Hey, it's about having some mindless fun and that he achieves!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The game, despite lacking intelligence, was extremely fun and enjoyable. When I heard Guillermo del Toro was making a blockbuster movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters, I instantly thought of War of the Monsters, and I must admit, I was skeptical. But, at the same time I knew that the only person that could pull off a movie like this was del Toro – the genius behind great movies like Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 2. The final result certainly wasn't awful, but it wasn't amazing either.Pacific Rim's plot is set in a not so distant future in which giant monsters named Kaijus start coming out of the Pacific and attacking major cities world wide. Humanity, as a response, creates giant robots named Jaegers, which need to be piloted by two people, to fight off the creatures. This method seems efficient at first, but eventually more menacing monsters emerge and slowly start destroying the Jaegers. In such a defeat, our main character Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) loses his co-pilot and brother Yanci (Diego Klattenhoff). This tragic loss forces him to retire from piloting Jaegers. But obviously, in a not so unpredictable turn of events, he starts piloting Jaegers again, aided by a new copilot – a young Asian woman named Mako Mori who seeks revenge against the Kaijus.In a big blockbuster 'robots vs monsters' movie like this one, many people were afraid of how del Toro would deal with the human aspect of the movie, so let's get that out of the way first. The human aspect of the movie is satisfying. Of course, it's not spectacular but it's developed just enough not to make you bored during the pauses between the action scenes. The main character Raleigh Becket is somewhat bland and one-dimensional and the actor who plays him, the anonymous Charlie Hunnam, does have clingy acting abilities, but all of that is overshadowed by other characters and actors in the movie. Idris Elba is great as the marshal Stacker Pentecost, Rinko Kikuchi gives a convincing portrayal of Mako Mori and Guilermo del Toro's favorite, Ron Perlman, is terrific in his semi-cameo role. There are also two scientists in the movie – Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) – who were rather interesting and likable. So I'd say the movie tackled the human aspect just fine.Now that we got the human aspect out of the way, let's talk about the real reason why everyone wanted/wants to see this movie – monsters and robots. Both the Kaijus and Jaegers look absolutely amazing. There are several different designs of both these groups of giants, and each one looks amazing and special in its own way. So props to the effect designers/visual designers or whoever actually created and realised the Jeager/Kaiju designs. The action scenes are brilliantly shot and edited. The majority of the action (as you can see in the trailers) takes place in the night time, but it's very effectively actualised so you can properly see everything that's going on. So, regarding the robot/monster aspect of the movie, Pacific Rim is one fun, entertaining and amusing summer blockbuster.Of course, not all in Pacific Rim is milk and honey. The main problem with the movie is that it's too loud and that does get tedious after 2 hours. Buildings being destroyed, metal screeching, monsters shrieking, explosions and other irritating noises are constantly present in Pacific Rim. Because of this, after the movie was over my ears were aching. So, in spite of how fun the movie may seem, I surely won't see it again, at least not on the big screen. The other problem with the movie was the ending, which was underwhelming. The final fight is quite disappointing, considering how other fights in the movie were more engaging. However, I think I would recommend Pacific Rim, especially since it's not like there's something much better currently playing in theaters. But if you want to enjoy your viewing experience even more, I'd advise to bring a pair of earplugs along.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

But honestly, a robot that walks & looks like human with a technology that enables the two pilots to see their minds but still fights with a sword? Its like aliens visit earth on a donkey. The characters in the movie also remind me on 90' sci-fi movies where they were patriotic screaming and synchronized walking.

Pacific Rim is a homage to that forgotten child and ultimately the mecha genre. I didn't expect Japanese inspired Godzilla-esque scenes, where it was made from cardboard miniature and people in suit back in the old days, will be realized into hyper stylish modern day action movie. Granted, it's still marred by a few typical disaster movie clichés, but it will make your eyes open wide and mouth agape just seeing the colorful metal knight versus relentless organic behemoth as your childhood is relived once again.There hasn't been anything quiet like it visually. Color palette is glossy and bright, the motion of the gigantic being, either it's steel or flesh, is appropriately smooth. The scale of the encounters is immense, often showcasing stormy sea and dystopian night life to emphasis the clash. Use of 3D effect highlights it even more, its camera angle shows the threat of Kaiju, the monsters, in a daunting perspective. These walking antagonists deliver thrill light years ahead compared to usual monster type on their television counterparts. It makes the appearance of Jaegar, the robots, even more exciting and the battle that much better. There's just no shortage of colossal mayhem in Pacific Rim.Story takes a bleak contemporary setting where Kaiju attack gradually increases, however this is unlike gritty nuance of apocalypse, it still has some fun and humor. Humanity's answer for the Kaiju infestation is Jaegars. tall stoic robotic entities which take two persons to pilot by synchronizing their thoughts. With incredibly fast paced screenplay, the movie pulls audience to invest in the story. Charlie Hunnam from Sons of Anarchy fame takes the role of the troubled protagonist Raleigh Becket. He's clean cut with emotional baggage of losing his brother. In a way it makes him a compatible with Mako Mori, played by Rinko Kikuchi, the teen girl from Babel.The dynamic between them is the majority of the story, which arguable takes a bit longer than expected. They do relatively fine, although there's not much chemistry to be had. Charlie Day and Ron Perlman are present, mostly for comedy relief. It appears that the movie would like to introduce larger-than-life characters, much like those in anime. Some scenes don't really work since it's trapped in predictable cycle, such as some ridiculous death scenes or the speech before final battle.Credit must go to Guillermo Del Toro for creating a movie he's truly passionate about. Mecha genre is far from mainstream, especially in blockbuster, but it now has a decent representation in the form of Pacific Rim. Some silliness or occasional slow scenes aside, it's a fresh entertaining rendition of boys mecha fantasy and an especially irresistibly captivating action movie as a whole.Rate 8/10","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

If you're looking for your giant robot fill this summer, this will do the trick. Is there cheesy dialogue? Over the top bravura? Paper thin characters? Absolutely! But you expect this going in and the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. Unlike Olympus Has Fallen, it knows it's a big, dumb action movie and doesn't pretend otherwise (which I found kind of refreshing). You don't really care that much about the characters and the story is straight forward, but there are *fantastic* special effects and some really epic, entertaining action scenes. This is one of the most purely fun movies I've ever seen. Check your brain at the door, crank up the volume and get ready to be entertained!Enjoyed my review? Keep in touch!

It was definitely worth the 3D extra charge, and should definitely be seen in a theater - without a first-class sound system and on a smaller screen, there's not much point in watching this.Since PR is Hollywood's first deep dive into the mecha (fighting robot) world, those of you who are not too fascinated by things Japanese may not know where much of the inspiration for this came from. So here's a few anime tips in case you got curious. In a way, the B.O. indicates that this kind of thing may work better with audiences in the animated form.Everybody in the world should be familiar with Evangelion. Then again, the original is from 1995-96, so some younger folks may not be. The 'Eva' mecha are the obvious inspiration for the Jaeger's design. Three visually updated relaunch movies have been released: 'Evangelion 1.0. You are not alone' (2007), www.imdb.com/title/tt0923811, 'Evangelion 2.0. You can (not) advance' (2009), www.imdb.com/title/tt0860906, and 'Evangelion 3.0: You can (not) redo' (2012), www.imdb.com/title/tt0860907. The films are less philosophical than the original 26 episode series. For that reason, however, it's the perfect introduction to mecha anime for anyone who's enjoyed PR, but found the story too flat/silly.Similar mecha anime with better stories would be 'Aquarion' (2005, 26 episodes, same 'fusion of mecha pilots' angle), 'Broken Blade' (2010-11, 6 OVAs, fantasy mecha battle epic with the same melodrama), the highly recommended 'Code Geass' (2008/2012, 50 episodes, alternative evil empire history with super powers), 'Gargantia' (2013, 13 episodes, similar monsters), and 'Macross Frontier' (2008-09, 26 episodes, similar monsters with space opera and singing).If you're looking for an anime currently airing which best defines the difference between this entertainment form and film, has an interesting story and is recklessly cool, try 'Attack on Titan' (www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140). Be warned, you may be hooked and become a J-nerd yourself. But don't resist the fun, go with the zeitgeist.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

But the movie can make it up with an impressive and innovative alien live form. One of the best alien life form since Alien (1979) and Predator in 1987. But what makes this movie really enjoyable are the special effects (2D Version). The animations are perfectly detailed and not too dominant. In my opinion, is the cutting perfect and much better then most other modern Sci-Fi movies. This makes it the best Sci-Fi Human Vs. Aliens Movie in the past few years. This movie is a blend between: Alien, Matrix and Transformers.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Robots fighting sea monsters may seem like a stupid concept but if you keep an open mind and use your imagination then you might just enjoy it too. I wouldn't personally classify it as a blockbuster as it needs more than just a big budget to grant that title but it's a good sci-fi action movie.The character development seems a little weak though. And some of the characters are just plain annoying. Also what's the point of the two pilots. It seems like an odd plot point. But that's probably my biggest issue with the movie.Don't go in with high expectations and you won't be disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is clear that Del Toro both knows and loves both of the movie traditions he is drawing on but also suffuses the movie with a Hollywood sensibility, all without an obvious clash or discord.The plot is not deep, in fact as anime it would be on the markedly shallow side. There is none of the philosophical musings or mythological literacy that underlies good anime. It is, in the end, about as deep as a Godzilla film. The characters are shallowly drawn with obvious motivations. The plot is pretty minimal with most of the movie being spent on action sequences.In the end, my review is much like my review of Avatar. Its a B action movie. But what a B action movie!I saw it in IMAX 3D and, if you can, its definitely worth the extra few bucks. The movie is visually stunning, exciting in its action sequences, and in the end just a whole lot of fun for anyone else who loves the source genres.Which certainly includes me.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Here, we have monstrous creatures rising from the sea and begins a war that threatens to destroy all the world's resources. To defend humanity, massive robots called Jaegers, controlled by two pilots, were created to battle the kaiju. Thus, former pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and trainee Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) team up to defeat the apocalypse.Hunnam and Robert Kazinsky, who plays Chuck Hansen, were the two actors who basically saved the film. They had substance in their acting performances and gave the film some heroism and sensitivity, counterbalancing the overly corny and trying-to-be-funny acts by Burn Gorman and Charlie Day. Idris Elba's performance as Stacker Pentecost was as stiff as a sore neck and Mori's character looked like a deer-in-the-headlights in numerous scenes. Her role did not suit her well. Ron Perlman's awkward Hannibal Chau character was pathetically thrown in for marquee value, serving no purpose in the movie.Aside from the mostly lame acting, this movie did have some very sophisticated special effects and the monster battles were well executed - very fun to watch. The action kept the plot's pace going and kept the audience engaged. Add in some doses of heroism and drama and it makes this a watchable film.Grade C+","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There's no story, and the robot vs monster stuff gets old after the first 10 minutes. One time when I looked up from my laptop, there was a scene that reminded me so much of a Godzilla movie I saw as a kid, I knew I had to turn it off. I thought this type of drivel was a waste of my time even when I was 12. This is the kind of movie that gave science fiction a bad name in the 60's. Please don't bring that garbage back!

Actually quite the opposite it is an epic exercise in post-modernist Tarantinesque mash-ups, where Mexican director Guillermo del Toro takes Japanese kaiju inspirations and their love for big mechabots, molds it with some quasi-Lovecraft mythology to create a bombastic blockbuster feature with little other intent that to entertain. And del Toro clearly has absolutely no other higher pretence. Popcorn at its finest (at the same time setting a high bar for Gareth Edwards ""Godzilla"").When a mysterious rupture appears somewhere on the Pacific rim, giant monsters start emerging from the ocean, creating havoc and destruction on coastline areas. Confronted with this deadly gargantuan opponent a new method of defence must be formed, thus initiating the Jaeger programme of giant human-controlled robots. Due to the mental burden of controlling a monstrous Jaeger two pilots are necessary, both having to share their minds through a neural bridge. After a temporary turning of the tide in favour of humanity, the kaiju threat increases and soon all but four towering Jaegers are left to defend our planet. Amongst the remaining pilot is previously retired ace Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and an untrained cadet Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). Led by the legendary pilot Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) they are all that stands between the inevitable apocalypse.Focusing on the spectacle, del Toro does his best to distract attention from human casualties, so instead of single humans being treaded upon we see a visual treat of epic proportions. Forced on by cardboard cutouts the story can never be held as anything other than generic fodder, even if the masterful presence of Idris Elba spurting out gibberish, as if he was delivering Shakespearesque brilliance, does its best to hide the thinly plotted story. That said del Toro has enough sensibility and rationality to deliver a story without gaping plot holes and illogical contrivances, thus making it a thankful respite from cascades of movies spurting out nonsense with almost religious zeal.Within this behemoth of a movie lurk the age-old trusted interior mechanisms of blockbuster action movies, introduced however with a certain finesse of which directors like Michael Bay are incapable of. Pure enjoyment is what is on offer - expect anything else and you will be sorely disappointed. Lay back mind-meld to the blockbuster of the season.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Therefore the fact that I liked it has to mean something. First thing you have to do in order to enjoy the film, though, is leave out logic, critical thinking or any knowledge of physics and/or biology. This is not a movie about real life, so deal with it. Once you do that (bring nothing to the drift, so to speak) you will probably enjoy the film because it is really well done and lots of fun.The plot is simple: on the bottom of the Pacific ocean there is a dimensional rift through which giant Godzilla like monsters are coming through. The human solution is to build giant humanoid robots and punch the monsters to death. Yeah, I know. In a way, it is a sort of Top Gun with interdimensional alien monsters rather than Russians. Also the main character is impossible not to like: he is heroic, but also thoughtful and calculated, so completely different from Maverick.As usual, Idris Elba is a supporting character who by his selfless actions saves the world, then dies and the beautiful Caucasian lead gets all the credit. A tip of the hat to the Japanese origins of the mecha mythos, the female lead is Japanese, although she doesn't do much. Other known actors have small roles, to my chagrin. Ron Perlman plays as well (stay until the credits to see a final scene with him). The scientists are great, although perhaps their geekiness is a bit over the top and unnecessarily so.The special effects are almost flawless and, combined with heroic music and bar fight action scenes enlarged times a million, makes it almost impossible not to have fun. Heed my advice and do not think of solutions to the problems presented in the film, or you'll feel like the guy in the Shark Pool trailer. Just go with the flow. I find it ironic that in order to enjoy the film most you must follow the instructions given to the Jaeger pilots. I do hope that was intentional, if a bit cynical.Bottom line: I was sure I was not going to enjoy it and I was very wrong. My head still buzzes with alternative scenarios in the same conceptual world, but the path that Guillermo del Toro took was both crowd pleasing and respectful to the feel of Japanese mecha, thus I have no quarrel with it at all. So go watch the film.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

In the middle of the movie it gets so boring that you wish you were not watching this film. Only one part in the movie does it get interesting in the middle battle scenes where aliens come up from under the water to fight the robots and you feel the the robots are in danger for the first and only time in the movie. Then the movie continues in the rest of it's boring routine.I blame the story and the directing and the actors. The actors are so bad in the movie.Seems like the producers just wanted to make this movie in a rush to make money and not care about the quality of a film.If you want an edge of your seat movie from beginning to end and then the movie has an effect on you after the movie, then go and see The Conjuring, probably the best Horror movie that has been made so far.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

No its not the most original story, no the acting isn't the best, but the fight scenes are epic the monsters (kaiju) look fantastic, the jaegers are amazing and the actors appear to be having a cracking time of it (Charlie Hunnman has the biggest school boy grin in the beginning scene when first in the jaeger syncing up with his brother).Overall as long as you go in to this and can level with the fact that the dialogue isn't going to be hugely important and yes the acting is a bit wooden, basically turn off your brain and you should thoroughly enjoy yourself.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Years after, Kaijus become more powerful and a scientist discovers that they are part of an alien plan to destroy mankind first and exhaust the planet after. The former pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who lost his older brother Yancy Becket (Diego Klattenhoff) in a battle against a Kaiju, is summoned by Marshall Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) to fight again together with the rookie Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) in the last hope of mankind.""Pacific Rim"" is an action sci-fi with lame story and acting and top- notch CGI. The plot is entirely predictable but there is a poor development of characters and even the introduction is too rushed for a 131 minutes running time movie. I was absolutely disappointed with Guillermo del Toro, a man that directed masterpieces like ""El espinazo del diablo"" or ""El laberinto del fauno"" making a detour in his brilliant career to Michael Bay's style with a shallow blockbuster like this. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Círculo de Fogo"" (""Circle of Fire"")","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

I mean when you virtually imagine a Robot in your mind it should be something extra ordinary, Massive, Raw and ready for a Combat and not a computer chip helping all the time and guiding the next move before it even happens, if thats the case than why was Robert Downie required when Jarvis could have done things alone.

I don't think i even need a story normally to appreciate movies like this, i mean did Transformers have a story? If so i certainly cant remember it. But Pacific Rim has a script that is so bad that it actually aggravates me, making it hard to actually relax and enjoy the fireworks.Human kind has the technology to transfer memories between people, to build massive robots controlled by brainwaves but hasn't the intelligence to give these robots weapons except for wrestling, punching and a lame plasma gun that only seems to work up close. Neither are the robots remote controlled but a couple of humans has to physically maneuver them around. This is just the start of the stupidity that governs this movie.

Although the movie was quite serious throughout, Guillermo del Toro does an excellent job of adding bits of humor where appropriate to relieve viewers from the 2 hours of non-stop intense action. I was thinking of giving this movie a 9/10 originally as I originally felt lost in the history of the protagonists, but then thought to myself what was the original purpose of watching this movie.... the action sequences, and they were brilliantly presented. It might take some time to figure things out but you can do that during the calm dialog sequences presented throughout the film. Watched the movie in Imax 3D. There are some films one must watch in theater, and this is one. The love theme is explored in a unique way between the two main protagonists, not in the repetitive sexual way you see in every single damn movie. There is one scene which I don't want to spoil which especially explores the relationship between the two protagonists very well. I recommend this movie to people of all ages, well done Guillermo del Toro, good comeback, I'm looking forward to a sequel, and am quite disappointed the movie did not do that well in the box office.

I'm very particular with the storyline and initially i don't want to watch it due to the some of the few bad word of mouth from my friends that it is very cliché,which honestly speaking its not compared to some of the ""fine "" movies which did well in the box office which is honestly clichéd,though Gravity is out of the list due to its originality.Its one of the best and underrated movies of all time and of 2013 and is sort of like The Avengers with a dash of Evangelion in it.It also brought me back a lot of my teen hood memories of watching anime and of being an otaku and slightly my inner child was being awaken.I've actually watched this movie due to my college project and initially I was reluctant to watch it,but I was very surprised that it does not turn out to be like what other people has said about this movie.Overall,its a great movie and if you do manage to buy it on Blu Ray or DVD or better still 3D Blu Ray,it was worth the money and it was worth the experience,as you can see the true grazing effects of the robots and the monsters which luckily the monsters did not creep me out like the clichéd Transformers movie series.So if you are considering watching a science fiction movie which is a good one,I'll highly recommend this movie as one of the best Science Fiction movie ever made.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The Citizen Kane of Power Rangers, perhaps?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8578640/?ref_=tt_urv","walkingwithprimeval","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur107545045/?ref_=tt_urv","30 September 2022","I think for most English-speaking daikaiju fans in the early 2010s, our first exposure and introduction to the genre was with Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim (2013) - the most underrated and unappreciated movie in his entire filmography. Many of del Toro's doting critics who fell in love with his earlier directorial works, like Hellboy (2004) and Pan's Labyrinth (2006), might've felt that this visionary's involvement in doing a big dumb monster spectacle such as this really held his career down as they only see it as being one of his ""lesser movies"". But let's be fair now, western critics have never truly understood the kaiju genre or even grasped its appeal anyway (they often tend to look down on this type of thing, as if to say it's something shameful for a high-profile filmmaker to do).To put things plainly and simply in a sort of ""short/sweet/to-the-point"" perspective, this movie's premise is just an adrenaline-fuelled joyride rush for those who wanna see a great quantity of rockin' robo action along with some pretty sick creature carnage (plenty of fun stuff!). Just sprinkle in a little bit of story & character development, and you're all set to go! But if you're looking for a more meaningful (potentially ""eye-opening & life-changing"") viewing experience set in the reality of our own world, then instead you should try finding one of those deeply-profound introspective dramas where it's presented as a real in-depth think-piece for a complex character study concerning mental psychosis (some pretty artsy and experimental stuff, yet somewhat dare I say occasionally ""pretentious"" depending on subject matter). Before I forget to mention, there's also this underlying theme of entire nations around the globe having finally put aside their centuries worth of argumentative differences for a chance at achieving a victory over their alien opponents, and to further benefit the greater good in the long run (may sound kinda preachy with its subliminal message surrounding politics, but it's not shoved in your face at all).Obviously, this whole entire movie acts as one great big tribute to not just kaiju films, but all manner of creature features in general (not to mention, the mecha genre as well). There's some pretty nice neon colour-palettes with the cinematography having many great set-ups throughout the establishing shots of each scene, all with that distinctively vibrant visual flair which only a director of del Toro's calibre could pull off. That being said, its story is pretty standard monster-action fare and its plot isn't anything too spectacularly insightful. The overarching narrative has to do with the thematic bridging between survivor's guilt and learning how to live with that guilt after inadvertently losing someone you were so close to. Charlie Hunnam as a mentally-scarred Jaeger pilot gets a lot of flack for not being all that much of a well-developed character but to be honest, I don't get the complaints. He's clearly doing the best he could've done in the main archetypal role of the ""tragic hero protagonist"" with the semi-serious tone the movie was idealistically going for, despite how inherently goofy in nature the inspirational source material is, which was pretty much a given (we always strive to do our best in these trying situations by forcefully putting on a brave ""tough guy"" sort of face and hiding our true anguish behind it).The rest of the supporting cast and side characters do good jobs bringing their respective personas to life, as I'm sure they were translated adequately from the working script to the big-screen. Idris Elba was just as great as he always is, this time in a more somber role portraying a tired war-torn marshal who's at the end of his tether with this seemingly never-ending kaiju conundrum to sustain humanity's chances for survival in a bleak and grim world (putting it mildly, he doesn't strike you as the type of person who's got a positive outlook at this stage of the game). Charlie Day and Burn Gorman made for a quite entertaining ""comedic relief duo"", playing off each other surprisingly well in the scenes they shared together. But of course, the standout performance would have to be Rinko Kikuchi (no question about it). Her story-arc of harbouring strong feelings of deep-seated revenge against the behemoth beasties for wiping-out her loved ones in a rampaging assault when she was just a little girl was conveyed excellently, setting up her understandable character motivations in a concisive yet coherent way via a traumatic memory flashback triggered by intensive emotional stress during her first neural linkup testing (powering up the gargantuan robot). Heck, even Ron Perlman's awesome cameo as a kaiju black market dealer was an amusing incorporation of del Toro's favourite actor buddy (yep, he's sure come along way since his Quest for Fire days).As to be expected, the individual giant robots and monsters are all outstandingly designed with a shockingly impressive amount of painstakingly detailed work being put into making them as fully-realised things as the talented production team could've done (their aesthetic efforts greatly paid-off). All the high-tech Jaegers were given their complex structural designs with practicality in mind, NOT strictly for the coolness factor of ""we're just showing off an ace looking robotic giant"". When you see them on a big crystal-clear screen in the best high-definition quality possible, you'll quickly be able to pickup on the fact that each and every single piece of these massive moving machines felt like it served a purpose and had an important reason for being there in terms of robotic functionality (noticing fairly soon it's not all just flaps of metal for the sake of having it there). The giant monster segments provided the satisfactory visual stimulation of catastrophic creature chaos, along with a good dose of magnificently monstrous mayhem. And these sea-dwelling Kaiju designs are honestly exceptional when it comes to originality in recent years, bearing strong amphibious features and way more biological advantages than in any other past movie before their appearance (unless you take into account the utter weirdness of the Gamera franchise).Ramin Djawadi's unique soundtrack is the icing on the cake, for me personally (love this man's discography). His epic-sounding score is the absolute perfect example of what happens when awe-inspiring and butt-kicking action music is played during various scenes of intense buildup and somber drama, and somehow still manages to fit in really well, sometimes by having the tracks precisely synced up to the earthshaking fights of what's going on between and around the larger-than-life robot/monster stuff (a good enough setting goes a long way). Although, that's not to say the film is without some of its more tender, emotional moments (all of which feels organic to the different situations and helps the story's natural progression flow along at a much better pace). Without spoiling anything, one of my favourite moments is actually something that happens earlier on during the course of the movie, wherein a helicopter descends down onto a landing platform as Rinko Kikuchi's character walks to it upon its arrival in the pouring rain and you can quite clearly hear this gentle, very Japanese-inspired track playing in the background of this well-put-together visually-stunning scene (a brilliant touch that compliments the scenery, I thought!).So yeah, I think that pretty much about sums up my feelings as a whole. Once again, if this really isn't the right type of genre movie for you or if it's something you genuinely can't see yourself enjoying, then just don't watch it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is an action film of ""Robots vs. Godzilla"" that utilizes every cliché just for the fun of being able to. To me, it seems like del Toro wanted to have a bit of fun, but still managed to pull off a little bit of camp without a healthy helping of cheese.Yes, some of the characters are cliché. There are stoic kung fu triplets, harsh blonde Russians, hopelessly clueless governments, and an over-the-top black market dealer. While some characters are far too heavy handed as to be annoying (looking at you, nerdy neurotic science duo), most are cliché enough to be fun, but the viewer still cares about their deaths and/or is drawn into the tension of their near death experiences. I was surprised that I felt a little bummed when the first character died, about 10 minutes into the film, which I find rare in most modern action films. And in an age when so many action movies care more about how much their monsters can destroy, (looking at you, Man of Steel) rather than a little character development, I can live with a little unoriginality in favor of a good old fashioned, if totally predictable, cinematic arc.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Maybe not a treatise on the human condition or anything, but I had expected better than a crappy mash-up of Godzilla having a boxing match with a rusty Transformer, via Top Gun, Casshern and The Nutty Professor. Seriously, why the hell where those two 'scientists' even in the film? They added nothing but a mildly annoying distraction to what could have been a much, much better film.And what was the bit about how our would be invaders trying millions of years previously with dinosaurs supposed to be? The function of the Kaiju was to rid earth of human life, but in the time of dinosaurs the only life on the planet was bloody dinosaurs, so they sent them to kill themselves. It made no sense. I can only assume it was there to show us that it was never ending, like in Predator 2.What should have been an epic and heroic tale of man-kinds last stand against an enemy bent on destroying us, turned into just another lantern-jawed-hero-saves-the-day pile of crap. Not camp enough to be funny, too funny to be taken seriously, but taking itself to seriously to be fun, this fails on so many levels. It's either an hour too long or an hour too short, but in its present form its nothing more than eye candy with absolutely no substance. A huge disappointment.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

It was a thoroughly entertaining movie.In (slight) detail: Firstly, what were they thinking when they made the trailer? It makes the movie look thoughtless, stupid and worse than transformers (which i hate). It didn't appear to be the type of movie i would enjoy, i would sit there laughing at the cliché acting and unoriginal story. HOWEVER, after borrowing the bluray from a friend, i decided to watch it (mainly to please my girlfriend, who likes these kinda things). I usually prefer pretentious thought provoking films (i know). I put this movie on with low expectations, and somehow from start to finish it kept me highly entertained. Although it was in parts very chiche, it didn't matter. The acting was decent (Idris Elba stole the show). The special effects were mind blowing and i was never bored.

Grab some popcorn, buy a red flavored Icee, lay back and enjoy this movie brother. And that was all I did.This movie tells the story about people who pilot giant robots that are up to stop the obliteration of our species when giant monsters, straight out of every ones childhood fantasy, burst out of a portal in the Pacific Ocean. It may sound cliché, and I can proudly say it is full of clichés and it doesn't shy away from the fact. It knows what it was sent to this good earth for and that is entertain the hell out of us. And it does that oh so good. And looks astonishing while doing so! From the plot it is implied you expect some ginormous robot vs big monster battles, and holy crap are they going to blow your skin of. Beautifully filmed for you to see the scale of the situations and for these brawls to look just badass. The Hong Kong battle in particular is going to stand out as a perfect set piece for me. And responsible for all of this are the special effects. In my opinion what helps to scale out things is are the water effects. How it cascades off these giants is as realistic as it gets. After all this focus on its looks and battles you may be wondering about the human element of the movie. While not perfect the arcs these characters go through with each other are fun to watch. Especially Idris Elba who transmits authority like a boss. Charlie Hunamm while not as good manages to hold as a main character. Rinko Kikuchi, the female lead is the one who should win the ""Underrated hot chick of the year"" award. And finally we have the two crazy scientists played by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman who while incredibly cliché and hyped up on something unknown tend to be funny and energetic. A curious fact in the movie is that it shows the social reaction to these monsters and robots and realistically it isn't always fear but propaganda and adapting to the situation. The second one involves Ron Perlman in it. After all this praise there is one stand out sequence that involves Mako's (Rinko Kikuchi's) past that you should really look out for. It changes the tone to a more serious and dark one and is made with excellence.And of course there has to be a negative or two in this flick and the one negative I can pick is that while the movie builds itself on clichés sometimes these go over the legal limit and strive into predictability and unoriginality. But in general this is an amazing achievement in entertainment and special effects that you should really look for if you are having a grey day and want to jack release your worries by watching robots beat the living crap out of some monsters. I'm giving this jacked up child dream a 9/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I rented this without realizing it was his work. Like his other movies, this one assumes the viewers have no brain. Very insulting to watch.The whole concept is incredibly juvenile. Typical of shonen (aimed at young boys) anime. Some bad guy shows up and missiles from jets, tanks, and other military weapons just can't affect it. Instead we need a giant humanoid robot driven by spunky and/or damaged young people. Every monster I saw in this movie would be annihilated by a normal jet with a few rockets, max. Humanoid robots that fight mostly by punching or maybe wielding a sword are not better weapons than jets with rockets. Also typical of anime: both parties begin their fight with weak attacks, then they power up and use better weapons, then power up again. So stupid.There doesn't seem to be a single character in this movie. Only stereotypes, from the two nerds bumbling around to the world leaders that make earth-critical decisions without listening to all the facts/evidence. Every single person is one-dimensional and stylized. Every cliché you can imagine is present. Except for the first 5 minutes there is not a single time when you can't predict the next 30 minutes at least.I think this movie did well overseas because subtlety and realism are completely lost in translation. What you need are extreme characters that leave no question in anyone's mind about what their role in the movie is.For many years movies have become more and more realistic and gritty. This one has the detailed and beautiful special effects but the whole plot and every human relationship just doesn't make sense. In short, I hated this movie. It's far worse than other giant-but-not-thought-out movies.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I love all types of movies--on the one hand I like movies that really make me think, but on the other hand, I find enjoyment in movies where I can shut my brain off and just enjoy some good action (Transformers, Battleship, Fast and Furious, etc.) I never go into movies like that expecting some masterpiece of a story and acting, but at least it's enough to keep me entertained.That being said, I thought Pacific Rim was awful, the only redeeming quality of which was the CG. The acting and story was so poor, in my opinion, that it really set some new lows for me in my book, and failed to keep me entertained. If you're looking for some mind-numbing sci-fi action, I really would advise AGAINST watching this movie. I was able to enjoy stuff like Independence Day, Cloverfield, Battleship, and Transformers. Pacific Rim on the other hand, really just failed to excite me in any way what-so-ever. I'm a little upset that it received a 7.1/10 on IMDb, because I think that is FAR too generous for what it delivers.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Not so with ""Pacific Rim"".
Yes, there are what you could call ""giant robots"" in play, but here they are piloted by people. And the premise of a neural interface between two people and a machine is definitely new.

There is some storyline to this film, which makes things even more difficult for viewers to relate to the characters because it tries too hard to bring out empathy.

Giant monsters called ""Kaiju"" start randomly coming out of the Pacific Ocean to wreak havoc on the most densely populated cities on the planet so Earth comes up with this idea of building these giant mech-warriors called ""Jaggers"" that are about the same size as the monsters in order to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the monsters: Awesome!To me the battles are really high end CGI, but at the same time sort of lack creativity in some ways and are a little slow. I grew up on 90s style action-cartoons with fight scenes that were right on par with my imagination so I thought there could have been more creativity with how to beat these monsters and look better, and faster doing it.For the most part I was pretty impressed by the acting. Hunnam and Elba lead the story really well playing off of each others grittiness and remaining calm despite the fact that they know mankind may not be able to survive the next attack from the Kaiju since the relentless assault of the past 10 years has really taken its toll. The only character that seemed out of sorts and unbelievable was Rinko Kikuchi. I don't know what B-level soap opera they found her in, but everything she did seemed unauthentic for the situation of the movie. Charlie Day somehow seemed less annoying than he usually is and dare I say his comic relief was much appreciated? Ron Pearlman's cameo was a great bonus as well!I give this one an 8/10 and if you liked Godzilla I think you'll like this movie even better!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There was almost no plot in this entire movie, and the plot it did have was corny and highly predictable. Several touchy scenes designed to provoke emotion were incredibly obvious before they happened, as virtually everything was. There wasn't a single twist or anything that caught me off-guard.That aside, it was visually appealing and the action was good, which is why i generously give it a 4.

Surely the film would focus too much on the political machinations of the evil government, or too much on the romance between our protagonists. Or the action would be too blurry, or there would be too little of it. Surely this kind of movie wouldn't be allowed to be ""just"" about giant mechas fighting giant godzilla-monsters.And sure, there is some talk about governments, the protagonists are a man and a woman. But it's a movie about giant mechas fighting godzilla-monsters. There's nothing impure about that. It's what the movie is, simple as that. And it is fantastic! The action scenes are phenomenal. Vibrant with colours, beautifully executed, each unique and exciting to follow, with no shaky-cam, or needless bleakness, or annoying side characters butting in with one-liners.And it's more than that. There is an actual story in this film. Granted, it's a simple story about humanity rising against a common threat, with no big surprises or twists on the horizon. But, quite frankly, that's more than enough. The characters and their actors are of excellent quality, which breathes life into the story, giving it the depth it needs to elevate this film above a simple actionfest. And it does avoid or sidestep some obvious clichés quite beautifully, earning it some extra brownie points.Do you like robots? Do you like monsters? Does the idea of them fighting one another excite you? Then see this film. It's all you'd ever want, and more.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Example: The acid spitting monster does a take down on the 3 armed samurai robot but wait the samurai robot gets up and does a arm chop to the neck!!

Whatever subtle critiques del Toro may make about the modern action blockbuster, he understands the simple principle that truly makes the genre work. It has to do with the above phrase: ""just because."" As I mentioned, studios today seem to need their blockbusters to mean something (or at least, pretend to mean something, which is usually as far as they get), but a fundamental part of the appeal of the film medium has always been its ability to show us sights or feats that are impossible in the real world, for no other reason than to provoke in us that wonderful reaction of gleeful amazement. Practically as soon as film was invented, a French stage magician named Georges Méliès was using rudimentary special effects and editing tricks to wow his viewers. His films had plots, but as in a magic show, the primary goal was to astound. Similarly, the great silent-era comedian Buster Keaton became famous for his remarkable stunts, many of which would have killed him had he screwed them up. His film The General was already hilarious; was that death-defying stunt with the railroad ties really necessary? No, it wasn't, but he did it anyway, because it's awesome.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I thought the trailers looked stupid, so I was surprised with all the good reviews. Even still, I wasn't sure if I would like it, because I thought it would be an ""all flash, no substance"" kind of movie. So I watched it and enjoyed it much more than I expected. The story actually works really well. I thought it would be one of those movies that was missing story, but it worked. It simple and sweet. This movie also has lots of really cheesy, really dorky moments. I like these because it really showcases what a monster movie is supposed to be. It's not all just intensity, there's also some dorkiness there. And it's displayed perfectly by a schizophrenic, easily excited, glasses wearing nerd, and his grumpy, British, cane wielding partner. They made the movie for me. The acting was all around pretty good, but those two are the story sellers. The action is really cool and flashy. It's not necessarily adrenaline pumping, considering all the robots and aliens are big and kind of slow, but they are exciting. Everything just looks awesome. The robots and aliens just look and sound cool. Oh, and I like the gore. It's not bloody or anything, but there are some alien body parts ripping off and out, showing blue goo. It's awesome! Overall, this movie is a lot of fun, from the action to the dorky scientists. I realize this movie is not going to be for everybody, but if you like action movies, monster movies, or intentionally cheesy dialogue, then watch it. You'll enjoy yourself.

The characters and plot play second fiddle to the action. You really don't care who lives and who dies because you have no insight or feeling towards any of the characters. This film is very much for the adrenalin junkies and if that's you you'll love it.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

This movie was repugnant in every way. First let's start with the symbolic imagery of the black man's bleeding nose. Does this represent the pale horse with the pale rider. When the Asian girl gets hit with the stick is that nor reminiscent of Helen of troy's battle with pancreatic cancer? Forgive me if I was the only one shouting in the theater, but this really sparked some religious feelings deep in my belly. Why do they keep trying to push ""janitor"" on me as a profession every time I drink guava and captain Morgan's in the movie theater? To hell with Guam del torso if he cant keep making movies about goat men stalking children.OK, so now on to the film itself. This movies starts out with a giant robot man punching a giant crab alien in the face. It also ends with this scene. Why would they make a movie on this kind of budget and re-use the same scene over and over again? That's like if Robert denier shot himself in the head at the end of every scene of bugs life. COME ON PEOPLE! Seriously, If I see one more poopy movie about robots fighting crab tampons I'll go ballistic. Cinema has turned to dog shyte since 2007! I hated every movie that's come out since batman returns.

I find it depends a lot of your expectations, and maybe even the viewer's age, to a certain extent.The folks that hate this movie seemed to have gone in expecting a Transformers-like experience; a special effects extravaganza where every fight becomes a whirling dervish of quick attacks and lethal weaponry. This is not that movie. If you're hoping to see monsters and robots fight it out MMA-style; you're going to be disappointed. If you're going in expecting to experience a story rooted in science and logic; you'll also be disappointed.This is not that movie.The best way I've found to describe this movie is a live action anime flick from the 1980s; think Battle of the Planets meets Power Rangers.There is no logical reason for giant robots with plasma cannons and missile launchers to jeopardize themselves and the world by insisting on fighting the monsters hand-to-hand; only resorting to weaponry when their defeat seems imminent. The reason they fight hand-to-hand is because it's just so much cooler on-screen than watching a weapon platform launch projectiles from a safe distance.There is also no logical reason why the worlds' governments would waste all their resources building giant walking robots when those exact same plasma and missile weapons could easily be mounted on ships and tanks instead. Again, the only reason to do so is because it looks cool to have them mounted on giant, anthropomorphic robots. And no-one can argue that the fights in this movie aren't extremely cool to watch.If you're the type of viewer who can check their brain at the door and accept a few gaps in logic in favour of awesome visuals, then I can't recommend this movie enough. The action is intense and continuous, the sound design and soundtrack are amazing, and the visual effects are incredibly effective. If you can afford the additional cost of a 3D blu-ray player and the appropriate disc, you have the ingredients to a fun movie night. Just be sure to watch it with like-minded individuals.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Most Surprisingly Good Film of 2013","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2955114/?ref_=tt_urv","motezart","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45824581/?ref_=tt_urv","4 February 2014","2013's most surprisingly awesome film was Pacific Rim. How did I miss this? WellEven though it was directed by Guillermo del Toro, who has to date made only excellent films, the trailers and the marketing for Pacific Rim did not do the film justice. There was only a bare- bones connection linking del Toro's star power to this film. For the average person who may know del Toro's other films, Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 1 & 2, but not his name, the little ""directed by"" box at the bottom of the promotional poster would not have rung any bells, at least not in the same way a giant ""From the Director of"" promotion would have. Still, I know del Toro by name and I still didn't realize this was his film. Wayyy after it was already out of theatres I watched it on a plane. It was great.Not only did the marketing not exploit any of the film's star power, it didn't even really give us any idea what it was about. The trailer just showed huge metal warriors battling Godzilla-like creatures, much in the fashion of recent mindless action movies such as Battleship (I did actually enjoy Battleship) or anything from the recent Transformers franchise. I hypothesis that this complete disconnect must have been intentional. In this way Pacific Rim attracted the same audience as the previously mentioned movies. A huge audience base that is easily swayed and turned on by special effects, battle scenes, and stuff blowing up, but they are potentially turned off by something that could be considered ""cinema,"" or too arty. This audience needed to be brought in from the beginning.As for the more savvy movie-goers, although turned off by the meat head marketing, they are generally more inquisitive than the average Transformers fan, and so it seems the producers relied on these movie-goer's inquisitive nature. Since it's an actual good film, the savvy will find their way to it eventually. This film's crappy marketing was actually a ploy to lure multiple demographics in subliminal ways, and thus mucho bank was made. Just a hypothesis.FYI: According to Slashfilm.com, Transformers2 was the highest grossing, most negatively rated film in history, so getting the Transformers audience was just good business. The fact that the movie is also good is just a rare and wonderful freak, but not accidental, occurrence for the Transformers audience.What makes Pacific Rim so great? Using a montage sequence and voice-over, in the first five minutes of the film we learn all about the world that Earth has become. Monster Kaijus have invaded from a dimension shifting portal in the ocean, humans have built fighting machines called Jaegers to combat the Kaijus, and this on-going threat, the conflict between the two entities has eventually just becomes a routine part of common culture. Then suddenly things change.The set designs are spectacular. Hong Kong is specially tailored here to fit a Kaiju bashing society. The encampments where the machinery and pilots are based is a gloomy complex that looks like the inside of a submarine. Being a big budget action film, Pacific Rim relies heavily on computer-generated graphics and spectacular special effects for its visual telling. Truthfully I have no idea how any of these action scenes would have been shot as almost every one is an epic between giant monsters, earthy and not. But it is not the visuals alone that make this a great movie. Transformers has great visuals.It is the script that is so awesome. Co-written by Travis Beachman and del Toro, it is a sci-fi monster movie, but it is the nuances that make the film so much fun to watch. All the intricacies of the world. For instance, two people whose brain functions combine in a process called ""the drift"" pilot Jaegers. Pilots' ability to drift effectively in unison is what creates great pilots. The drift is probably the single coolest thing about this film, and the idea is used later for purposes even crazier.The Kaijus become so powerful that mankind is forced into a final standoff using all the remaining Jaegers against multiple super strong Kaijus. The prospects for humanity's survival look grim. In final act of the film a spectacular twist takes place thanks to some unlikely scientists, and the fate of all humanity hangs on their wild hunch, the functioning of the aging military machinery, and the drift between the last two standing Jaeger pilots. I wish I had seen this film in theatres. Let's see if Pacific Rim 2 ever makes it from the hard-drive on Travis Beachman's desk to the screen. This time, I'd give it a chance.More reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Pacific Rim. In all honesty, how much you like the movie depends almost entirely on what you're expecting and what you like in movies.If you're watching the movie for mecha vs. monster action, then you will not be disappointed. The kaiju designs are wonderful, and at times wonderfully creepy, and the special effects make everything shine. There are plenty of battles and action, and mecha fans will be amused by homages to various mechas in media, even if non-mecha fans find those homages over- the-top. The movie takes a fair amount of time for world-building, which will appease action- seekers who are new to mechas. The action sequences will definitely have everyone on the edges of their seats; it's hard to dislike the movie on the basis of its action.However, it's very easy to dislike the movie in other ways. The characters are almost all painfully two-dimensional, and there's not much development to speak of. (Some characters are lucky enough to have some, but most go without, or with very weak development.) In fact, basically nothing here is character-driven. Characters interact, but you only glean the most basic of facts about them from their conversations. By the end of the movie, you know a bare handful of facts about each character, and with one or two exceptions, it's hard to see the characters as real, complex people. I don't remember most of the characters' names, and I'll only remember the characters themselves because of the actors playing them. The writing isn't much more impressive. Much of the dialogue is clunky and repetitive, and the movie itself is extremely predictable at times. (Arguably, the predictability is due to homages to mecha and kaiju films/series.) Also, there is an astounding lack of diversity in the cast. Of the named characters, only two are women, and of the named characters with substantial speaking parts, all are white except for Elba and Kikuchi, even though most of the movie is set in Hong Kong. Personally, I prefer my movies to be character-driven, so I was unimpressed with this film— and thus the rating. But, as I said, whether you love or hate the movie has to do with your personal tastes. Are you a mecha fan who loves action scenes? Then you'll probably adore this movie. But if you, like me, prefer complex characters who interact with each other in ways that aren't driven by plot, you'll probably want to pass on this one.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

Del Toro goes way beyond the expected in creating unique, lived-in, awesome locations that could only exist in Pacific Rim's goofy universe. Entire blocks of city were build on hydrolics, within hangers, to give thundering kaiju monsters the heft and vibrational implact they deserve. It makes all the difference to see puddles of water rippling with each stomp, and see buildings shaking.Beyond the sheer craftsman, I adore how fully this movie embraces its macho bravado. The music is all guitar riffs and swelling fist pumping anthems, the fights scenes are chalk-full of pilots barking orders and fun one-lines. the mechs are these delightfully ugly hunks-a-junks, all pistons and metal plates and dangling wires. It absolutely rules. The cockpits are another thing Del Toro had build in real life, on hydralic pistons, so that the actors could get tossed around and doused with water. Again, it makes all the difference. This movie invites you to enjoy some big dumb apes wail on space dinosaurs with rocket fists. It embraces the absurdity of their universe and goes whole hogg with it.I also particularly love how, at no point in this movie, does it celebrate what you'd expect from a macho flick - this isn't all about the nobility of men sacrificing themselves to protect women, or about mocking men for emoting or showing weakness. The cast is littered with strong people in desperate situations, trying help each other out and tap into inner motivation, rather than ""toughen each other up"" with repressive garbage. Characters are shown being weak, being scared, and ultimately, overcoming it all to become who they want. It's a simple message, but lordy am I glad to see it dodge all the pitfalls you'd normally see in a flick like this.All actors give frankly wonderful performances. I could go into that more, but Perlman, Kikuchi, Eldba, and Day stick out to me as being particularly great. Everyone treats this ridiculous universe with absolute conviction, and it really sells it.Only negatives I can really point out are the fact that a lot of the battles are in pouring rain, which eh, is not my favorite thing. Also, Cherno Alpha and Crimson Typhoon don't get nearly as much screen time as we all desperately wanted. Maybe they hit that budget wall.So yeah, absolutely, whole-hearted recommended. This movie is a joy.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The blueprint of the Kaijus appears to be the source of inspiration for the Monsterverse. It was battle after battle between colossal sized opponents that destroy cities while doing so. Every Kaiju was worse than the last, but it brought the same level of shock, awe, and fear, especially the class 5. Pacific Rim was close to non stop action and suspense, and even the down time was interesting to watch. I highly recommend you watch this movie, mainly because of its scale and grandeur of its fights. Even if, somehow, you don't like Pacific Rim, saying it was ""cool"" would be a massive understatement.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

What the sequel missed was the action; the slow movement of the Jaegers grounds the fights and makes them realistic.

NONE of these turkeys, which are invariably thrown out in discussion of worst movie ever, is nearly so brain-numbingly ad as Pacific Rim.The cast covers all the bases: Strong black male leader? Check. A super-bright woman? An Asian? Check and check. Someone characters with ""foreign"" accent? Check. Hey, it even has a tough guy with a bulldog. (That shows he's sooo masculine!)It's a shame that nobody in the cast put on a performance which was in any way compelling.To say the acting was flat and unconvincing is a gross understatement.With all the mechanical and electronic innovations in the big robot thingies, why was it necessary to have two people inside them? It would appear that some remote control could have been worked in with all the other tech. I could go on in detail, by why bother? In short, I have been watching movies for more than 40 years, both old and new flicks.

One of the staples of anime is the ""giant robot"" subgenre, of which Neon Genesis Evangelion and Gurren Lagann are certainly the classics. And while Pacific Rim (2013) wasn't an adaptation of an anime, it got my hopes up that it could be done well enough that we could see live action versions of these aforementioned anime. After all, adaptations to live-action from anything animated tend to be very difficult, so this would be a step in the right direction.I do have to say that this movie delivered what it promised. Something like a mix between Godzilla (1999) and Real Steel (2011), the premise was a little bit closer to Independence Day (1996) than I initially thought it would be. The visuals were stunning and the fight sequences were both immense and intense, never letting up with the action as the world's options for survival quickly dwindled down to practically nothing. So, the question of whether or not this could lead the way to other ""giant robot"" films still stands, but I think it did a good job of introduction. After all, the Mechanical Engineer in me really wants to see more ""giant robot"" films.Always the master of his visual craft, Guillermo del Toro delivered the same type of spectacle that we've come to expect from such films as Hellboy (2004) and Pan's Labyrinth (2006). Of course, the perk of Pacific Rim was a few of the ""lighter"" characters, like Ron Perlman's Hannibal Chau (which, given that this is a del Toro film, I practically expected Perlman to be in it) and Charlie Day's Dr. Newton Geiszler. I also felt that the multi-cultural element of this film was really well presented, along with its strong female sub-protagonist.A first giant step into potential future anime adaptations, I give Pacific Rim 4.0 stars out of 5.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is one of those movies I wish would be re-released in IMAX since I didn't have an IMAX theater at the time this came out. I want to cheer with my friends as these giant monsters and robots fight. Everything about this movie just makes you want to stand up and cheer out of pure epicness. The story is as simple as it gets. Big unexplained portal in the ocean opens up and giant monsters come out, we make robots to fight them. Boom, movie. The characters aren't the most interesting but I didn't expect them to be at all, they had more character than I thought they would so I'll give them that. The effects, holy crap they're intense.

The cinematography is so confusing, and the film builds no anticipation, none. Very predictable.

Guillermo Del Toro, a modern cinematic visionary, does just that and creates an homage to Japanese giant monster films with PACIFIC RIM and the nation responds with a near universal shrug of disinterest and barely half of it's budget in box office returns. Thankfully, the movie found some massive love overseas and made a nice profit so as to not discourage Del Toro from any future endeavors (or any studios from hiring him again). While my daughter has become a fan of the early Godzilla films, I was never a fan of the Japanese kaiju genre and the closest I ever came was watching the Power Rangers as a child. But I know a good time when I see one and I knew a modern movie about giant robots battling giant monsters from the man who did BLADE II and the HELLBOY movies was worth checking out. The premise is simple enough: giant monsters dubbed Kaiju begin emerging from an interdimensional fissure on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. In an effort to combat these beasts, the human race has united in a program of constructing giant robots known as Jaegers, mentally controlled by two pilots. The movie is set more than a decade into the Kaiju war and we're on the losing end as the Kaiju attacks become more and more persistent. The Jaeger program is being shut down to reallocate the funds into creating giant coastal walls, but Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), the man in charge of the Jaeger program, isn't ready give in. He recruits Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), a former Jaeger pilot with a tragic past, for one last mission in hopes of ending the war once and for all.I know there's a load of people out there shouting about how this movie isn't original and it ripped it this anime and that anime, and I don't care. I don't watch anime. I'm know Del Toro was heavily inspired by anime (he's a huge fan) and I'm more than happy to just revel in the love letter he's written to these Japanese genres in the form of PACIFIC RIM. It's not a great movie, but it's a pretty good one regardless. It's fun, visually gorgeous, and it's got some fantastic battle sequences, even if its story and characters are all pretty basic and shallow. This movie is eye candy, but it's epic level eye candy. The visual effects are spectacular and the movie's focal points, the Kaiju and Jaegers, are fantastically designed. Each of the robots and creatures has a unique design to stand out from the others though I only wish we'd had an opportunity to see them battle in broad daylight where we could truly appreciate all of the detail that went into them. Every battle happens at night, in rainstorms, etc. It's a missed opportunity and the closest we get is a nice series of shots of a Kaiju rampaging in Sydney, Australia. The entire movie is filled with vibrant colors and it's all beautifully shot. The film was shot by cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and, if you're familiar with any of his previous work, you know to expect good things. PACIFIC RIM is, if nothing else, a visual feast with some brutal robot-on-monster battle action.The rest of the film's elements are where it stumbles a bit. The cast is filled with an eclectic mix of talent. You've got Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi are the film's heroes who suffer from a lack of decent chemistry. As the pilots of our hero Jaeger, Gypsy Danger, they're our main focus. They've got a bit of depth to them with a little backstory behind them to explain why Raleigh (Hunnam) wants to avoid the Jaeger program and Mako (Kikuchi) wants so desperately to be a part of it. Unfortunately, I never felt much of a real spark between them. Idris Elba is the grizzled commander in charge of the Jaeger initiative. Elba is a talented man and provides one of the stronger performances as he riles up a passion in the men under his command to fight. We get comic relief in the form of the Jaeger program's science team, Newt (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman), and Del Toro regular Ron Perlman has a sweet supporting role as a black market peddler of Kaiju remains. None of the characters are mind-blowingly developed but there's enough behind each of them to give them some motivation. The plot is paper thin: beat the monsters and destroy the source. There wasn't much effort put into plot elements, as this movie is all about the action. This means the section in the middle of the film while Raleigh and the rest of the Jaeger program ready for their final mission tends to drag. It's all about character development at that point and the characters were totally outshined by the robots/monsters so that's what we're aching to see by that point. Once the action kicks into gear in Hong Kong, it's all up hill from there.PACIFIC RIM is spectacle cinema and it's a blast to watch, especially on the big screen. It's not an overly intelligent film and you're probably best off shutting down your mind, munching on some popcorn, and taking in the killer visuals. It's a fun experience I'm happy Del Toro got his love letter to Japanese giant monsters out of his system because he's still got a dozen other projects on his agenda that I'm excited about.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

They want to stomp, devour, destroy and all that, but they are quite marvelous. At first they become kind of Apollo Creeds to the Earth's Rockies. I wouldn't be surprised if they had bets on them in Vegas. Anyway, the bad boys start to evolve and send bigger and nastier folk, until we ""good guys"" are watching our world be taken from us. The main weapons are gigantic robotic things sort of like Transformers, and they are manipulated by fighters inside them. The human element is missing here. The people are boring and one dimensional.

A beautiful, leading woman, Rinko Kikuchi, that's never exposed as a sexed-up dumb, kitten(you know, like Star Trek's obvious bra & panties scene or Transformer's Megan Fox bending over a car) Some represented countries working together: China, Russia, USA, Australia, & Japan. The 3D is actually good. Good clichés, not bad ones. Great use of color saturation. Whether you love or hate Guillermo del Toro, you have to admire his flexibility: Horror, Superhero-action, Drama, & Fantasy. This is him at his nerdiest best with Sci-Fi Action/Adventure.Cool during-credits sequence. Best sequence of setting off a Newton's Balls (or Newton's Cradle) accessory in a movie put to film. A live action Japanese Mech-warrior anime? YES PLEASE.Over 2 hours long for maximum entertainment. Expect over an hour of deleted scenes edited out of the movie for the DVD/Blu-ray release with alternate endings. Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters doing incredible & probably impossible tricks with Jaegers.ELBOW ROCKET PUNCH!!! Done for less budget than Transformers: Dark of the Moon and still winds up looking better. Funny scenes are funny.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Great Krypton, the fights! The audience I was with was *cheering* in places, and that just never happens. There is awesome piled on top of awesome until you just sit there with a grin plastered to your face and your smile muscles hurt. This movie has bumped Buckaroo Banzai out of the top spot on my list of greatest movies ever made. This will definitely be a blu-ray purchase in four or five months when it comes out.

Pacific Rim is a tribute to those old films. The effects are incredible, they don't look fake or phony CGI like your always seeing. But it does not only depend on the action and the effects, but the cast really bring a presence to this. It's over two hours but does not feel like it is, unlike The Lone Ranger.

If the first trailer didn't give you goose bumps and have you so excited you had to see it as soon as it was released, then it probably isn't for you.Now that said, I wanted to try and clear some things up, since most of the negative reviews are pretty bogus and misleading. I find the negative reviews fall into 2 categories. People the movie wasn't meant for, or just plan haters.""It's to hard to see the action"" maybe in 3d, I sat in the 5th row of the non 3d, non Imax showing, running off 2 hours of sleep and ZERO problem making out what was happening. I'm also the only member of my family that doesn't wear glasses.""There's not enough character development"" Their right, there's not enough character development of the actual stars of the film, the Kaiju and the Jaegers. Oh, they mean humans, well there I'd have to disagree, in my opinion there was just enough... maybe even a little too much. Because I don't care about the people who drive the robots, I care about the robots and the Kaiju. That's why I'm there. It's also important to point out that there's almost an hour was left on the cutting room floor and I'm willing to bet it's all that boring ""character development"" these people must be talking about. Some people mistake ""character development"" and ""love story"" and if that case, they are correct, there is no love story. Thank God! ""It's Too Cliché"" There's a big difference between ""Cliche'"" and ""Homage"", much like ""Literal""and ""Ironic"" cliché is more often then not, misused.""It's a ripoff of Evangelion"" This comparison really get's me hot under collar, because I'm a long time fan of Evangelion and it shows how little people hating on Rim know about ether. To sum it up, the only way that would be true is if Jaegers were built over top of captured Kaiju. That's not the case, so we'll move along.""It's Rock'um Sock'um Robots"" Wrong again, that would imply robots fighting robots. This is Robots fighting Monsters. It would also imply that it's only Robots fighting each other and no people, which this movie has way to much of in my opinion, people that is. It could use some more robots socking monsters tho.""Charlie Day is grading"" I 100% agree, can't stand him! If you like Sunny in Philly, then you'll probably enjoy his contribution.""It doesn't have big name actors"" Yes it doesn't have mega star actors and that's a good thing IMO. I like the fact that Bruce Willis isn't in it, because every time I see Bruce Willis he's Bruce Willis. If Sam Jackson played the character Stacker Pentecost instead of Idris Elba we would be waiting for him to say ""I'm sick of these MuthaFn' kaiju on my MuthaFn' planet"" or waiting for a kaiju to reach down and eat him while delivering the ""Canceling the Apocalypse"" speech. See where I'm going with this, big name stars would have been a huge detriment both in performance and cost. I had no issue with the casting except Charlie day. Charlie Hunnam was solid and being familiar with his work on Sons of Anarchy I thought he fit the role perfectly.""It's Racist"" This one makes me scratch my head. Having a very popular or recognizable Japanese actress in a movie about giant monsters that will be opening on screen through out Asia is not racist. Having actors form other countries in a movie that is about the world coming together to fight off an extinction level threat is not racist, it's refreshing and maybe even realistic. I'm an American and American's ain't smart enough to go see Pacific Rim rather then grown-ups 2, so why should I believe for one second they could fight off this threat by themselves? The answer is, they couldn't and why should they, this is for the species folks, the whole world has a steak in this.I could go on and on and on, but I'll stop. I think if you've read this far, you get the idea. If you like giant monsters fighting giant robots, it's worth the regular ticket price just to see those scenes on the big screen, personally I wouldn't pay extra for IMAX or 3D tho. If your looking for a love story, this movie isn't for you. If you want to watch a male and female character sitting in a coffee shop for 2 hours talking about life, this movie isn't for you. If your over the age of 15 and think Transformers is great, then this movie defiantly isn't for you. So if this doesn't seem like your cup of tea, then go see something else, don't see it bad mouth it, it's not like there isn't plenty of other options to check out at theaters.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Del Toro doesn't waste a lot of time trying to infuse PACIFIC RIM with the kind of boring, pointless melodrama that most such movies engage in: he gets down to business early on and rarely strays from the program. (The jab at Modern Man's world-destroying efforts is appreciated.) Moviegoers who've waited for a true Summer Blockbuster will walk away satisfied, though the hype surrounding this movie has been a tad on the RESERVED side, if you ask me: considering what we have here- the overall scale of EVERYTHING-, the trailers should've been Longer and even Louder. The fx actually ENHANCE the drama, the way fx always should (but rarely do).

As much as I, you, and everyone want to like this film and think of it as a 'classy' action flick due to Del Toro being at the helm, we have all been deceived.Here we go: Acting: awful; no character development, no emoting from any of the characters. The best performance was by the little Chinese girl. Elba, as much as it pains me to say this, was either terrible or terribly miscast.So many inconsistencies/unbelievable moments, e.g. waiting JUST until it looks like the Jaegers are defeated before whipping out their game-changing weapons. Smart. ""Gypsy's analogue...erm...nuclear...?"" Yes, just say random things, and you still won't convince anyone that what you're saying is even correct in the context of the movie. The decisions the pilots make will leave you scratching your head - maybe everyone's just stupider in the future.Terrible action sequences. ""Who on earth wants to actually KNOW what is going on in the fight scenes?"" I'm sure Del Toro asked his numerous yes-men. Cluttered CGI + dodgy direction = action-packed sequences that will leave you guessing as to whether or not you're witnessing a giant mech fighting a oversized dino, or just cars crashing into porridge.Script & pacing are dire. The whole of the second act was pointless and was (just) worse than the action sequences. The dialogue is cringe-worthy.Uugh. As per usual, I ask the question ""would I have preferred spending 2 hours doing something else?"", and the answer is a resounding YES for this turd of a movie. Hold up, I've just had a scary thought...Transformers 3 was better than this. Yes, it's true.

Someone else mentioned in another review about some stuff I'd noticed myself (the pilots would operate remotely - like people do now controlling weaponry, the workings wouldn't be as clunky and mechanical etc etc)...I know that might sound picky, but once holes are shown in films, it ruins the movie experience. Good scifi should always be plausible. If you're not too bothered about that, there is a chance you might like the film.It's a shame. I like Del Torro's other stuff as well.

It's all a Godzilla/Gundam fan would want to see while at the same time delivering a mainstream appeal to ease the publishers mind that spent a ton of money on making it. The criticism I've read on this movie is understandable and mostly true. Yet if you get thrown such a tasty bone among so many heaps of tasteless treats that Hollywood is known for, it's arrogant to put down something so long overdue and so well done simply because it is prone to Hollywood's usual machinations. If your heart can beat for the genre that this movie stands for, you will love it wholeheartedly. If you're simply intrigued and/or not necessarily a fan of the genre, you might get distracted by some of the, in my opinion minor, faults, which mostly damper a serious tone of the story line that is nevertheless achieved most of the time. It's too good not to enjoy and that's precisely the reason some people will actively look for faults they can trip over.

This is what your big summer popcorn blockbusters should be all about!From the trailers you get the simple premise about this film, ""as a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and a trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse."" Yes, it uses the familiar tropes from various movies ('Independence Day' immediately popped into my head when watching this), and, essentially, what you see is what you get, but don't let that diminish the feeling of fun when watching this film.I'm sure the so-called 'critics' that have shot down this film, have done so more on the basis of how could a director, that has made 'The Devil's Backbone' or 'Pan's Labyrinth', stoop so low to come up with a movie like this? But this is Guillermo del Toro, and from the vampires of 'Cronos', the ghost story of 'The Devil's Backbone' and to his twisted fairytale 'Pan's Labyrinth', his films come from his passions, and as a loveletter to the Kaiju and mecha films of Japan, 'Pacific Rim' is no different and deserves it's rightful place alongside his other films.But back to the film, and it really is a simple story, of good old heroism overcoming monstrous adversity and saving the day. The Kaiju and Jaegers are impressive and the fight scenes, although with not quite as much carnage and destruction as 'Man Of Steel', still hit the spot and are the definite highlights of the film. The characters are standard fare for this type of movie; the washed up hero back for redemption, the untested rookie, the stereotypical other pilots, the leader of the crew who used to be one of the pilots (along with the typical inspiring speech before the end), the arrogant pilot who goes up against the hero, the bickering scientists, it's all there and there to be enjoyed. I loved this film for exactly for what it is, a big dumb roller-coaster blockbuster of a movie, but oh, what a ride it was!","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The visuals never disappoint and the acting was spot on. There was drama when there needed to be, comedy when there needed to be and intensity that only made it better. I give the cast and crew a big hand for their work making this movie what it came to be. My only complaint is that it wasn't longer. Some movie-goers might say that 2 hours and 11 minutes is more than enough time. However, this movie grabs you and brings you into the world of monsters and machines and makes you want to stay.

For the robots to work, they need to be piloted by two people, and it's important that those two people are as psychically linked as possible in order to be effective. Guillermo Del Toro, who made one of my favorite action movies ever (""Hellboy II""), could, I thought, be trusted to bring just the right blend of style, comedy and characterization to make this film rise above the summer fray. But this movie is lacking in all three, instead substituting thunderous sound and visual effects, apparently in an attempt to numb its audience into submission so that we no longer care whether or not what we're watching makes any sense.I felt the same way watching this movie as I did watching last year's ""Prometheus."" It's like Del Toro conceived this elaborate story in his head and then made only the second half of it into a movie. The feeling is not unlike coming into the second of a two-part miniseries, where you know what you're watching would make a lot more sense if you had seen it from the beginning.Grade: D","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Yet again a late entry to the Agartala Rupasi Cinema Hall for us and maybe we missed the first entry of Giant alien like monster called ""Kaiju"". These aliens are into 600-foot monsters instead of mile-wide flying saucers, so they begin pumping huge beasties through the dimensional rift. Killing these monsters with conventional weapons takes days and leaves ruined cities strewn across the Pacific coast, so the only reasonable course of action is to build giant nuclear-powered robots called ""Jaeger"" that can take them on in mixed-martial-arts battles or you can say Mortal Kombat. And good thing is that No one person can pilot these giant robots - it takes two carefully matched people linked together in a neural interface called The Drift, they can mind-meld with their giant robots and fight with these monsters. For one of this Drift in a scene, feel very near to one of my favorite movie Inception and that's clinched my heart to stay in the hall. And better thing is that these robots are much more advance than the Iron Man or any other counterpart. I feel it's never been done this well before, and probably never will be again. The fights are clever and creative, because the giant monsters adapt to the tactics of the robots, which in turn receive weapons upgrades and redesigns. You never know what's going to happen next, and all of the battle scenes are eye-popping. Though they tries a bit research part, but unable to shift the magnetism of Jaeger or Kaiju.Acting wise, there is nothing to say more, because there is not much space left to show the actor skills. It's more about fighting and fighting. But few mixed tiny romance and emotion will fulfill your requirement too. Charlie Hunnam and Charlie Day are as good as their character in the film. Love the way Rinko Kikuchi as beautiful and mysterious Mako Mori slowly pronounces the English in a precocious little-girl voice on each occasion she converses and her emotion with Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba). And find irresistible when Guillermo Del Toro calls his old Hell Boy star Ron Perlman for a cameo with his golden shoe.But again some flaws are there. Interpretation in the mind of Kaiju looks very messy, less than real. While we have no choice but to accept the notion that we'll have the ability to construct 250-foot-tall robots just a few years from now—robots that can somehow be transported by eight tiny helicopters—it is never explained why chemical or biological agents, for example, were never deployed. And even question remain why they did not try any missile for these monster without disturbing the city life when they well aware their expected return. If we did not miss, there should be an explanation of original ingress of Kaiju.But overall, a lot of middle-aged guys like me are going to feel 15 years younger while watching it, and that's not bad value for your expensive theater ticket. You will experience the 2 hours of full entertainment of your life. A must watch if you are near to a Inox or any other equivalent where you will be blessed with the movie on the screen and 3D glass on your eyes.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I watched in IMAX 3d. You can never see the full shape of the creatures. It will fully disappoint you, if you are expecting to watch out the battle between machines and the creatures. The glow inside mouth and the body of the creatures make the movie more childish. This movie is not even a combat movie. There are nearly five combats in which none of them are even good. The only thing which just makes you sit in the theater is climax. After climax, you will get highly disappointed. There will be two doctors in the movie whose role is almost nothing than one minute of explanation where he will discover how to destroy those dinosaurs. The massiveness of the creatures is too high such that you will feel like two planets fighting. You cannot see the combat clearly. One cannot understand who is getting the punch in the combat. No combat is in daylight. All combats are at night in the dark so you could rarely see the creatures.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

It has been so long since I've seen a film that was about entertaining the audience I had almost forgotten what it was like. For 2 hours I was told a story- I wasn't bombarded with product ads, lame pop-culture jokes or ""tested well"" extra plot lines that muddy a film. At no point did Rihanna or JT appear. The plot is simple, clean and precise. Even the tangents and science fiction suspensions that get overly complex are tightly controlled and reigned in well. The narration is effectively used to quickly set up the film without bogging us down in needless back story. The characters are simple & effective. Nobody is complex just for the sake of being complex. The writing is also very simple- but again, it really works. I didn't have to make an effort to enjoy this movie. I didn't try to figure out what vapid point the director was trying to force down our throats- instead I watched robots smash monsters, the good guys being good and the bad guys being evil and scary.

I have been waiting for a movie like this for a long time. Growing up and going to the movies to watch Godzilla movies. I loved them but I always wished they could be done better. Cloverfield was awesome but I wanted more. Transformers are also a favorite but no monsters there. Pacific Rim really delivers. I have to say this is the best monster move of all time. Also the Robots (Jaegers) are incredible. Not a dull moment in this movie. I am going back tomorrow to see it in the IMAX theater. I want to see it in 3D now. The music score fit and sounded great. Pacific Rim starts fast and end with a fury. It keeps you locked in till the credits roll but don't forget to stay for the snippet after the first round of credits. Very funny. This is one of the best movies I have seen this summer. Right up there with the new Star Trek and maybe a little better than Iron Man 3. The movie does not disappoint. Go see it if you really want to be entertained for 2 Plus hours. You will not be sorry. After watching it at IMAX..... AWESOME! My new favorite movie. I may have to go see it for a third time. I was reading some of the negative reviews and I do not understand where these people's perspectives come from. Haters is all I see. This is one of Best summer movies in a long time.

Yes, a movie about giant robots fighting giant alien monsters has clever writing. I know, right?? Good writing is not all this brilliant piece of cinema has to offer though.

He was saying that this is the best flick he's seen so far in 2013. This intrigued me. Later that night my son 7 year old came home and said, ""Mom, I heard about some movie called Pacific Rim. Will you take me?"" Figuring it was a sign, we found ourselves at the movie theaters earlier this evening. I took he critics advice and forked over the extra cash for my theater's IMAX/3D version of the flick. Wise choice. A wise choice indeed. This movie comes very close to putting the audience into sensory overload.... Just close enough to still be incredible. Great story line. I like that it deviated from the cliché aliens from outer space. The concept was fresh. And, it was never drawn out. Action-packed for more than 3/4 of the movie. I also liked that they used recognizable, but not over-used actors. No one's celebrity status overshadowed another's. I also liked that the love story was an unlikely couple who weren't running around naked or groping each other every minute of the movie. There were also other characters who had separate story lines going... They added great humor to the action and drama. All and all a great night out. There really wasn't many swear words at all... So, other than the robot on monster violence... This was a good family flick.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

In resistance, all nations join together to build 'Jagers' - or dual-piloted robots - to fight off the invasion. Pacific Rim's premise is really interesting. There's lots of room to explore the paroles of which humans have to work around to come out victorious. Unfortunately, the film doesn't do any exploration at all.

I had already planned to see it, and after seeing the largely favorable reviews from IMDb I was very excited to get to watch it. Definitely the best movie I have seen so far this summer, and probably the best one I've seen in 2013. (I know Django Unchained came out in 2012, but I saw it a second time in theaters in 2013.) Regardless, fantastic movie. I felt just the introduction to the movie with the battle with Kaiju off the Alaskan Coast was movie-ending battle good, and that was just the beginning! The movie's plot was good but not great, but really I wasn't there to see amazing plot. Taking it for a straight action movie this was possibly the best one I've seen. Enough Kaiju battles to keep me completely interested through the entire movie, and the bright spots of the plot were able to take up time in between Kaiju attacks. Not once did I feel bored or that the movie was dragging. Del Toro outdid himself with this one. 9 out 10, and only because I have to leave a little bit of headroom for the best of the best.

Yes, there's that overused word: ""epic"" but there is no other word for this film. I was sitting in awe for the entire first act of the film.Rather than take risks with the plot Del Toro plays it safe and predictable towards the end, perhaps having realized he had a hit on his hands and not wanting to screw it up with needless risks. But as satisfied viewers, we wish he had taken more risks and given us more, more, more as most of the other positive reviews indicate.The film's credits include appropriate shout outs to the creators of Gundam and Neon Genesis Evangelion and other giant monster fare which paved the way for this film in the way that the genre of cyberpunk paved the way for The Matrix. Though don't get me wrong, The Matrix took all those risks Del Toro didn't and enjoys a much loftier status in cinematic history for it. But Pacific Rim is just as fun and it's a good thing the filmmaker kept that the focus whereas The Matrix did take on a lot of other loftier goals and baggage (quite successfully at that).This film is meant to be seen on IMAX 3D. It is the best implementation of 3D in film I've ever seen, surpassing Avatar. Think of the epic fight scenes in Man of Steel which were a delight in IMAX 3D. Now imagine the entire film was like that with lots of subtle 3D touches and flair thrown in.If you want headier sci-fi, Elysium will probably deliver on that front, but I can't imagine any film being more entertaining than this in the foreseeable future.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

So many things not to like: 1.The Kaiju are WAY overdesigned, with much too much bioluminescence effects – it looks like they've come equipped with running lights. And glow-in-the-dark breath. So they look kind of silly, at least the parts you can make out. 2. Speaking of Kaiju, there's no buildup to any sort of 'reveal' at all. We see them almost immediately (in video footage, no less) the film begins. Even the original ""Gojirah"" filmmakers back in the 1950s knew enough to keep the big 'G' offscreen for a little while, thus heightening audience anticipation. ""Pacific Rim"" blows its wad in the first minute or so. 3. And speaking again of the Kaiju, there's too many of them, they're very much alike in most ways, and their origin is unnecessarily explained (and, perhaps, over-explained). There's no star of this monster show, as it were – just a succession of variations-on-a-theme. 4. A common fault of apocalyptic sci-fi action pictures is that the characters seem to be having too good of a time, considering their circumstances and the stakes involved. Same thing here, with only Idris Elba's 'Marshall Pentecost' character displaying any sort of gravitas. 5. Like their monster counterparts, the giant robot 'Jaegers' are also overdesigned, and of such an enormous scale that it's hard for the viewer to figure out their overall form and capabilities. This is made doubly obfuscated by having most of the battles take place hip-deep in the ocean water, at night, and in the rain.Despite my problems with the monsters and the robots, the production design on the rest of the show is pretty fantastic. I especially love the rusty, dented, and otherwise bashed-about look of the Jaeger command centers/maintenance depots, which are perfect combination of fantasy tech and down-and-dirty verisimilitude. The depiction of war zone Hong Kong is likewise carried off perfectly.It's in the Hong Kong-based part of the story that ""Pacific Rim"" could have found it's real heart. The street-level view of a rampaging Kaiju is much more terrifying than the Jaeger-pilot view, or the audience's third-person view from 40 feet above sea level. The civilian perspective of life right behind front lines of the Kaiju war is much more interesting than the Jaeger barracks infighting and personality clashes. Ron Perlman's 'Hannibal Chau' character, trying to get rich quick by selling Kaiju body parts to collectors, is a classic war zone hustler character with roots going all the way back to ""Casablanca"". I would've preferred much more life-during-wartime intrigue, rather than the daddy issues and testosterone-driven competitiveness going on back at the barracks.The film didn't do all that well at the US box office, and I wonder if Giant Monsters/Giant Robots is simply a trope that simply doesn't resonate as much with American audiences as it does in Japanese pop culture. From Dracula through Hannibal Lecter, we prefer our monsters on a more personal scale (hell, even ""King Kong"" was basically a love story) and in a form we can identify with. Same with the robots – Robby, C-3 PO, Roy Batty, Commander Data. Maybe ""Pacific Rim"" was always the purview of a small coterie of American otaku, but everybody forgot that.Guillermo Del Toro has long expressed an interest in bringing H.P. Lovecraft to the screen. (His adaptation of ""At the Mountains of Madness"" was beaten into production by the similarly-themed ""Prometheus"".) Somebody at Warner Bros. should have had their thinking cap on; with a little bit of rewriting, ""Pacific Rim"" could have been the greatest Lovecraftian story ever brought to the screen. Now both of Del Toro's dreams are severely crippled – perhaps mortally so. Too bad.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Because only other movie which may be comparable to epic scenes you can see in Pacific Rim is Avatar. And what can be more epic than elbow rocket? There is WOW factor every time you watch clashing Kaju and Jaegers . Somehow you will feel perfect mix between power of the Jaeger and the monstrosity of the Kaju. But even powerful high tech mountain of steel and will struggle to stand ground against ferocity of the Kaju attack. This is something which is totally worth it to see it in 3D and on the biggest screen you can find. Some people complain about cliché lines, wants better story or they think it nonsense is according to our scientific knowledge Well common seriously? Star trek is nonsense; star wars, superman, and list go on. What's wrong with story? You want something to think about go watch Driving Miss Daisy, and cliché lines or characters I can find in every movie. I have also find information that this movie apparently is only for people with small brain, well I have studied Physic and I loved it. It is all about entertainment. I have enough of drama and personal problems in normal life and I'm not going to the cinema to watch same stuff I have to face every day of my miserable life I 'm going there because I want see something awesome and I want to be entertained.

I also had some respect for the mecha genre like Gundam, Zoids, etc. While this is not the first time kaiju and mecha class for supremacy (examples being ""Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla"" and ""Envangelion""), it has never been done on this kind of scale. What we have here is essentially a ""love letter"" to those classic films and this is coming from Guillermo del Toro of all people in all his creature mastery. Ladies and gentlemen, I give to you the ultimate clash of the titans. This is Pacific Rim.Plot: Giant monsters from another dimension called Kaiju (Japanese for monster) are sent through a portal at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean to eradicate all of humanity. As normal weapons prove ineffective against the beasts, the military develops the ultimate weapon, the Jaegars, giant robots driven by two pilots built to go toe-to-toe with their reptilian rivals. While successful at first, more and more Kaijus come in stronger than their predecessors to take down the Jaegars. With options and resources being depleted, it will take a former pilot and his new partner to control a legendary Jaegar as part of a final plan to end this war of the monsters.I've been waiting to see a film like this on the big screen since ""Godzilla 2000"". First off, I love this world Guillermo has created as a lot is established to breath life into this grand world of monsters and machines. We see how people live in a time like this and how they all see this entire situation from different perspectives. Most of the characters are surprisingly likable, each having their strengths and weaknesses, and the acting isn't half bad (if not over-the-top at times). It's hard to get likable humans in a monster movie and this film does a good job with it as I generally feel for the characters as they develop unique relationships, in particular the main pilots Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori as well as their commander Stacker Pentecost.The highlight of the film is definitely the Kaijus and the Jaegars and the battles between them and it never disappoints. These are some of the best actions scenes I've seen in a film like this. Like a giant-sized wrestling match, these titans smack each other with random objects, shooting projectiles, and smash through buildings, pretty much beating the living crap out of each other and everything in sight is reduced to rubble. I like how unpredictable the battles are as the film keeps you guessing on what's going to happen next. I also love the designs of both combatants as each of them, Kaiju or Jaegar, has it's own unique design and special abilities (not to mention cool names like Red Cyclone, Leatherback, Gypsy Danger, Otachi, etc.).Overall, I was blown away by this movie. While the beginning was a little slow, it picks up the pace in the middle and ends with an epic climax. I honestly hope a sequel is made (and believe me they're planning on it) so I can see another titanic showdown between monsters and machines. If you love action, science fiction, Guillermo del Toro, or Japanese monsters, then definitely check this one out because it's worth it.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Guillermo del Toro returns with a feast for everyone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2831748/?ref_=tt_urv","Far-Sky","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21696403/?ref_=tt_urv","13 July 2013","When monstrous, building-sized creatures (dubbed ""kaiju"") hell-bent on destruction begin pouring out of an extra-dimensional fissure at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, humanity bands together to build titanic mechas called jaegers, each controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are linked through a neural bond called ""The Drift."" As the kaiju get stronger and the signs point to an all-out flood of the beasts, the fate of humanity looks bleak, and the surviving jaegers are brought together for one last-ditch attempt at saving the world.After an agonizingly long five-year wait, filled with some heartbreaking starts and stops (like the almost-weres of 'The Hobbit' and 'At the Mountains of Madness'), Guillermo del Toro has finally returned with his biggest budget and story yet. The Mexican master of fantasy returns to the toybox of his youth, drawing from the kaiju films of old (Godzilla, Gamera, Mothra, and the like) and anime to create the modern-day monster movie we didn't even know we wanted.I am a genre man through and through, and del Toro's films are filled with both the intelligence of the best of science fiction, fantasy, and horror and a flawlessly-rendered vision unique to him. His innate knowledge of what makes those outlandish stories truly matter to us is the backbone of his work as a writer and director, and his visual style is one that invokes true wonder.It's that wonder, that childlike glee that makes 'Pacific Rim' work so well, and well it does work. This is a brawny, massive film made by a true artist and auteur at the top of his game, but while the technicals of this film could have been mounted by any number of working directors, the magic of Guillermo del Toro is that he infuses every film with himself. His love of the material, whatever it may be, shines brightly through every frame. It is this complete sincerity that makes his films such a joy to experience, and even when there are 250-foot behemoths slugging it out on the screen, there's not a trace of the disastrous irony so readily supplied by other blockbusters anywhere to be found.The cast gamely comes to play, with Idris Elba (TV's 'Luther') as Stacker Pentecost (one of my favorite character names of all time) as the stoic leader of the jaeger program, Charlie Hunnam (TV's 'Sons of Anarchy') as former pilot Raleigh Becket, who suffered a tragic loss and has to be convinced to return to jaeger service, and Oscar-nominated Rinko Kinkuchi ('Babel') as Mako Mori, another life touched by the kaiju and ready to serve up some righteous fury. If these sound like tried-and-true archetypes, it's because they are. This is a grand, epic war film on a bigger scale than anything ever attempted before in that genre, and one of the strokes of genius from del Toro and original writer Travis Beacham is that we instantly identify and identify with the characters on screen. There are so many ideas flying around (monsters, mechas, neural bonding, kaiju culture, and many, many more) that the broadly-drawn characters serve as a perfect anchor for the audience, immediately relatable in their inherent humanity.It seems that the mission statement of this movie was, in a word, ""texture."" Del Toro delivered a visual feast unlike any other big spectacle films, with his insistence on it not looking like a ""glossy car commercial."" Instead, every frame is filled with rain, snow, scuffs, smoke, debris, and other visual elements that reflect the weight and dimension of these cyclopean combatants. Unlike the ultra-glossy (and emotionally irrelevant) 'Transformers' films, or virtually any other modern big-budget actioner, this universe feels dirty, grungy, and lived-in, like the original 'Star Wars' trilogy.In fact, dubbing a film ""this generation's 'Star Wars'"" has been overused to the point of robbing the phrase of all meaning. But Pacific Rim feels just like that. It invokes those most elusive of emotions in the modern studio film: wonder, awe, and sheer enjoyment. Do you remember the awe you felt the first time you saw a Star Destroyer creep onto the screen? Discovering a brachiosaurus on Isla Nublar? Laying eyes on the verdant fields of Middle Earth? This film has that. No one builds worlds like del Toro, and here he is, the master, inviting you to play in his sandbox with him. Grab your favorite action figure and hop in.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

That was an understatement - this blockbuster goes colossal. In fact I'm hard pressed to think of a movie that's larger in terms of physical scope, if not concept or narrative. It's easy to see where the reported US$180m budget and additional year in production was spent; del Toro has crafted a visually spectacular experience that goes from one breathtaking set piece to the next, rarely allowing you to exhale, let alone notice the numerous plot contrivances or gaps in its own logic. The CGI is, predictably, utterly flawless and the 3D (the main reason behind del Toro's demands for an extra year before release) is immersive, whilst the creation of both the massive man-made machines and the gigantic alien creatures are imaginative and memorable. As for the puny humans, 'Sons of Anarchy' star Charlie Hunnam - a future A- lister without doubt - is charismatic and strong in the lead role, Rinko Kikuchi is intriguing as the sidekick shrouded in mystery and Idris Elba is reliably compelling as the tough military leader who is attempting to cancel the apocalypse. Unfortunately, this film also emphasises why I can't stand comedian (I use the term loosely) Charlie Day; he's once again painfully irritating as a shrieking douche bag. There's no denying that del Toro has discarded a strong story in place of delivering unabashed popcorn thrills, but when it looks this damn good it's hard to care.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

A visual spectacle in that regard but style more than substance. The story is predictable once it establishes itself and Charlie Hunnam has several shirtless scenes (for no reason I can think of other than to make (me) happy.) Nobody else takes their shirt off in the movie. I also wondered what the point was of having a stick fight training scene other than well, yum. It serves no purpose for operating the giant robots.Hunnam's voice-over establishes the world this movie takes place in and does a great job in conveying the scope of a film. The story follows a burned out pilot and an inexperienced rookie who are forced to work together piloting massive human controlled robots to save the world from giant monsters that have risen from the sea.I can see that there would be a definite audience for this type of movie as it looks like 'Transformers', 'Ironman', 'Battleship' etc, where the story is sort of inconsequential as its all about the huge special effects and CGI. Ultimately this wasn't for me but I knew that going in ""Transformers vs Godzilla"" is not my thing, I just figured with Idris Elba and Charlie Hunnam attached they could help me eye candy my way through it which they did 1/19/16","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Then director name, wow it will be good! Later there is information about the conversion to 3D - OK, 3D is not worth it! But, there is no IMAX without 3D, so I had to agree for IMAX 3D. I hoped that 3D will be not worse than in Iron Man 3D (and hopefully it wasn't).Pacific Rim finally came to cinemas, I took 3 friends, bought tickets for IMAX 3d and some beers for better visual effect of 3D and I was ready for watching! In spite of many unfavorable reviews, which have appeared after the first screenings I didn't change my attitude, I was still expecting something great.First scenes surprised me, I though that movie will be about it how first kaijou (monsters in Pacific Rim) appears and what whole human civilization did for stop them from destroying humanity - creating jaegers. It not happens, a brief introduction in first year of conflict between united humanity and kaijous and action of movie was placed in ~20 year of conflict, in time when it escalated.And I got exactly what I wanted from this film. Epic battles between giant robots and even bigger monsters. Destroyed cities during this battles. I got what I expected.Pity that the producers have choose the easy way and most of the action happens at night or in the water, what makes picture a little bit too dark, what for 3D image is not good. But they have to to close in 200 millions so that can be understandable.PS. No one left cinema room before end of movie like many peoples have written in their critic reviews. everyone was quite pleased with the film, so if you are excited at the thought of fighting giant robots with giant monsters, go buy your own tickets!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

My verdict: boring with the exception of the action scenes. My solution: I wouldn't make a directors cut but an action cut - cut all those boring filler scenes, and put everything that got some explosions and gunfire going on together to a non-stop Pacific Rim action pack together - it would be a way better and more honest movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

With Pacific Rim (watched on IMAX 3D) you are strapped into the directors personal roller-coaster and take a 2 hour ride through the most spectacular film I have ever seen. Everyone knows that IMAX is great and IMAX 3D is even better but for films like this it is essential to see it in this high spec format. The Mechas are piloted by two people inside the command center and it felt like the director was trying to get you the audience member to step inside his mind and his film and he achieves this spectacularly well. I don't want to get into the film in case I drop any spoilers but all I would say is that the trailers don't really do the film justice. Yes there are robots and monsters but there is a serious human interest story running throughout and while none of it is original it is all believable and mesmerising. Don't see the trailer and think, ""big robots and monsters are for kids"" , the fate of the planet is at stake here people!! Check out the featurettes on YouTube relating to the Mechas and the Monsters, it is well worth it. In summary, this film fully immerses you in a Giant Mecha while you battle fantastic monsters and save the world. What more could you want?","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Del Toro reintroduces Kaiju—monolithic monsters (such as Godzilla) wrecking havoc on the planet, and mankind's only defense against them, Jaeger—kind of ostentatiously large version of Iron Man armor controlled neutrally by a human pilot, the evolved versions use two pilots sharing the neural load by psychically bridging their minds through a technique called ""drifting"".Loaded with some ultra-cool weaponry (like Plasma gun, Rocket Elbow, Missile Launcher, Hammer) Jaeger's best was indeed the good, old Sword--only a tad bigger! The two scenes with swordplay—one mid-air, one underwater—simply blow you away, would have loved seeing more of it—hopefully in the upcoming sequel!A lot of films tried capturing the 'grandiose' of comics or graphic novels—especially the colossal alien villains—but it is Del Toro who has hit the mark closest, yet. Jaeger's designs, including its gait, movement and fights were perfect in all its grandeur. Kaiju could use little more refinement/clarity when it comes to dark and shady underwater scenes. In all, Pacific Rim has raised the bar very high when it comes to spectacularly grand designs and visual effects—Del Toro accomplished his vision on screen by collaborating with some proved artists of the field.His coterie included: robot and monster designers Wayne Barlowe, Oscar Chichoni, David Meng and Simon Lee, and Francisco Ruiz Velasco, famed for Hellboy II and The Hobbit. Special effects were handled by John Knoll and Hal T. Hickel ( Star Wars d Pirates of the Caribbean), Shane Mahan (Iron Man), John Rosengrant (Real Steel) and Clay Pinney (Independence Day, Star Trek). No wonders the awesomeness that transpired on on screen was a visual treat like never before.Even though a second fiddle, the star cast delivers as it was expected to. Idris Elba was impressive as a hard-boiled leader, Charlie Day and Ron Perlman provide the much needed gags at the right moments and Charlie Hunnam looked good too(perhaps his meatiest role since Green Street Hooligans). Calls for a definite theater watch!8.1/10","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

You have to add more to the idea, and keep things organized and fairly logical - which this movie doesn't.

But I was wrong! Pacific Rim has outstanding visual effects, great camera angles, and awesome battles. *spoiler alert* I was a little surprised when Yancy Beckett got torn out of the Jaeger named Gypsy Danger. *end of spoiler alert* There were a few mistakes throughout the film, like how other people besides Stacker Pentecost had nose bleeds for no apparent reason. It could have been explained, but I just didn't catch it. This was nothing that ruined the film, though. Also, the score of the movie was fantastic. They played it at just the right times. It was composed of only maybe 5 different notes, but hey, so was Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Now, the dialogue was a little cheesy, also nothing that ruined the film. It was pretty much pep talk, but, it was nothing bad. The makers of the film also knew when to add in a little bit of humor. You would think to find this type of comedy in low budget action comedies, but it was made better. I myself thought del Toro took a risk with this film, and I was surprised at how good it was. I am kind of disappointed that this film made less money than Grown Ups 2. Really people? Who goes to see Grown Ups 2 but not this? I was very surprise when I found this out. Let me think, am I forgetting anything? Oh! This movie was still great without all the big name actors (except Ron Perlman and Charlie Day). They really made the movie awesome. I give this film 10/10 and I am definitely going to get it on DVD.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

To fight these monsters humanity created monsters of their own, the Jaegers (giant mechs controlled by two pilots) but despite the world's best joint efforts the years of increasing attacks have pushed humans to the brink of extinction. Making one last stand the world's remaining Jaeger forces assemble for the ultimate battle of survival.The screenplay by Guillermo del Toro and Travis Beacham based on the story by Beacham is a little cliché' and clunky but does deliver some highly emotional scenes and dialogue. The story is simple and has some pacing issues but still entertaining and interesting. The movie does a great job of explaining some of Pacific Rim's deep lore and mythology but you can feel there is still so much more to be discovered. It falls into the group I find with most movies that are origin stories or have a deep lore that is crucial to the story (like Inception), because there is so much to explain most of the story is spent doing just that. It in no way makes it a bad film it just left me wanting to know and experience more. Yes I am advocating for a sequel already, which I guess is what the producers and film companies want.The human cast for the most part are great. Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket though a bit wooden in parts still has shines in pivotal scenes, Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori brings an innocence but deep strength to her role making her a great female movie character and Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost is the stand out bringing a real gravitas to his character's words and actions. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as Dr. Newton Geiszler and Dr. Hermann Gottlieb, respectively bring the most comic relief as frenemy scientists working to understand the Kaiju. Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau is an outlandish character bringing a bit of flair and humor to a role that is mostly a cameo. My biggest problem with the film is the casting of Herc and Chuck Hansen. The character's story and personality, are great and added another layer to the film's story. It is the fact that two Australian characters were played by an American and a Englishman (Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky, who are great and do their best) using dodgy accents, it can be distracting. It feels like a missed opportunity to cast two of the many great Australian actors in these roles.The real stars of course are the Jaegers and Kaiju, the designs and details are fantastic. The Jaegers are hulking mechs that look bad-ass, each countries Jaeger has a distinct style tied to its culture and the inspiration drawn from pop culture robot/mech icons is done nicely without becoming straight up copies. The Kaiju are reminiscent of animals that live in our world that have been twisted by del Toro's famously unique and artistic mind into fearsome but beautiful creatures. Both the Jaegers and Kaiju are sure to become icons themselves and sell a but load of toys.Though not as heavily as artistic as what has become expected of Guillermo del Toro's directing it is great nonetheless. He has adjusted from his movies which are generally on a smaller scale to capturing the epic size of this movie with almost perfection. The world he has filmed feels realistic and natural with the weather a constant complimentary feature though there are a few times in the battle scenes where the Jaegers and Kaiju feel obscured.The CGI and VFX created by Industrial Light and Magic and Legacy Effects to bring not only the Jaegers and Kaiju, but the world it self to life is some of the best work I have seen in a movie since Avatar. It really transported me to another place and will be a front runner come Oscar season. It is also worth noting that the 3D is of particularly high quality, I highly recommend seeing it in IMAX 3D is possible.The score composed by Ramin Djawadi really captures the emotion of the scenes from the sombre lows to the exhilarating highs. Tom Morello brings his rock groove to a few tracks the give them a really heavy feel and gets you pumped and Priscilla Ahn gives a particularly haunting performance on the track Mako.Pacific Rim is a movie that relies heavily on peoples nostalgia for the movies and TV shows of their childhood like Voltron, Transformers, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Ultraman, Power Rangers and so on. These will be the people most excited to see it but I believe that this film really has universal appeal. I myself fit into the above nostalgic category, my girlfriend who doesn't still enjoyed it because of the human aspect of the story and kids who might not pick up on the subtleties of the story will enjoy it because to them it is awesome action with giant Mechs and Monsters, it is a film for all ages.I went into this film hyped up, expecting it to be a lot of fun and despite a few missteps the whole experience was awesome and I had a great time. 9/10.P.S - Stay a minute or two into the end credits...","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

There's the fighter who lost his brother, the female Japanese orphan who wants revenge, the highly focused task force commander directing all operations and two high strung researchers running shotgun on the whole thing. These last two almost steal the show several times and that's amazing considering all that's going on.Charlie Hunman as Raleigh and Rinko Kikuchi as Mako had to make their mental and physical pairing look real (and plausible) to make it all work and they do. Probably for me the weakest part of the movie was the CGI which is state of the art and impressive, but still a little too artificial; it sometimes feels as if you're watching an animated comic book. But the ideas are big, different and fun to follow. What if we were attacked by giant creatures from another dimension? Could we cope? This really fanciful story must have seemed impossible to film at first blush and it's really very impressive that Guillermo Del Toro pulled it off with such apparent success.Definitely worth seeing for every young boy out there, especially, though my wife and I enjoyed it as well.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

However, this is mostly an Action Film, but not a bad one in my opinion. It's like combining Transformers and Godzilla. There are some points which are missing logic. For example: The last Generation of the Jaegers has rocket launchers. Why didn't the humans came up earlier with this stuff? Or: Why do 2 humans have to steer a Jaeger? Wasn't it possible to make a whole machine which is just given intentions by humans? With cameras all around it, it could see every danger and it could fight on his own. Wouldn't this be much more effective? However there is one special thing I have to mention: The absolutely Badass Soundtrack. I literally just listened to the Main Theme right after watching the movie. It kicks so hard, definitely worth listening, even without watching the movie.

Firstly the acting is appalling, I never once felt convinced by the actors and the 2 scientists suck major ass, they just got annoying towards the end, Secondly it is absolute CHEEEEEESSSSEE, its more cheesy then a cheese string, and Pathetic Rim probably contains more dairy than a cheese string! the lines in this film are cringe worthy, me and the lads almost walked out.Next there is the storyline, there are major flaws in the storyline and the kaiju never really get fully explained, we know they are all clones but they all look different? sorry if I'm wrong but aren't clones the same? and they certainly don't give birth! these underwater creatures manage to swim hundreds of miles yet there is a gorilla one? how the hell did he make it to the surface? another thing that annoyed me is the battles that take place are up to waist height in the water on the jaegers? they are flown from the land by helicopter, at enormous expense to the tax payer and dropped off yet they can still stand up? bizarre, My final rant will be on the point where the Jaegers get terminated by the government who intend to build a wall! a Wall seriously, they intended to keep monstrous aliens some of which can fly, out by building a wall, was the writer stuck for ideas? Apart form that it was a OK, fight scenes were plentiful and fun although they kept throwing the Kaijus into the water, how would that hurt it? special effects were good so if you have nothing better to do, wait for the DVD I wouldn't recommend a Cinema trip.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

There were some excellent special effects and fights. Especially Gypsy danger kicking ass of every Kaiju she encounters. The story was decent, and if you look for plot holes in an action movie, you cannot enjoy it, ever.One thing I didn't like was some cliché situations, such as Raleigh's escape from his past, a 'only you can do it' re-call by the chief, and some buddy pair scenes.

This was not the Guillermo del Toro I remember from Hellboy nor Pan's Labyrinth. This movie was shot (or rendered) like a prototypical 80'ish style action movie. Very bright neon colors, over the top acting/script and a subtitle hilarity. This is not bad per se. It can actually be very well indeed and if 'Pacific Rim' would've been grouped in the ""Comedy"" genre, I would've given this a much higher score. My friend and I were laughing throughout the movie, but not due to intentional puns or jokes, but at the ridiculousness and blatant plot holes.These are some of the questions I would ask someone responsible: -Why do Jaegers feel the need to do the ""hit the fist"" gesture with their machines and wrestle and/or have a fist fight with the aliens, when they have sophisticated weaponry?-If Jaegers are connected with a neural link and can see into each others mind, why do they even need to talk during ""alignment"".-Why do Jaegers prefer to have a fist fight with an alien instead of using any sort of weapon?-How can a Jaeger be so out of touch with the machine their piloting that they forget a weapon they have (the sword), which coincidentally slices through alien meat much faster than anything else?-How are 6 helicopters able to lift these colossal mechs for transportation, when these mechs can use a supertanker as a weapon?-How was the headquarter able to communicate with the Jaeger pilot through (!) a wormhole / into another dimension, but seem helpless at first when locating the rescue pod back on earth (very end).... The list goes on and on and on. It felt very incoherent and not thought through. It also felt very cheesy, with wooden acting by the leads.If you, like me, are unable to just disregard blatant plot holes, inconsistencies and the likes, do yourself a favor and skip this one.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Pacific Rim is larger than life flick with fantastic CGI and engrossing story.Pacific Rim tells the story of human struggle in waging a war against monster alien sea creatures who are on the verge of destroying all the cities in the world.As the movie begins , you are introduced to the world of Kaiju the sea creature and it might take some time for you to get engrossed in the film. As the characters build , the movie embarks on the fabulous journey to fight against the monsters. Hats off to Del Toro for keeping you entertained with captivating direction and enthralling action sequences. Screenplay is decent which is loosing the grip in between. Art direction is awesome along with stunning cinematography. Not much can be said about the performance as it is action driven cinema. I loved the background score of the film. It is really energetic.Overall, a high-octane action film driven by classic visual effects. Must Watch. 3/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I waited for something like this on the big screen for such long time.It felt like when I watched independence day back in 1996 although from today's standards a 1996 movie is a bit hard to compare the feeling was pretty similar. Earth's last hope and survival if human kind - it was all there. There is something grand about these types of movies.Making a movie of a historic event or a great character lived and getting it right is one thing... Making a movie of a monster/alien and getting things right is another. Yes, this type of movie is not everyone's cup of tea but even so I'm sure the most dramatics minded person would appreciate the CGI. CGI was breath taking for starters. This movie also amazed me with the plot. The story line was near perfect for a movie of this gender - it was unique too. There weren't any plot holes, There weren't any unexplained moments, it had fun in it - not over the top nor carried away, acting was great I thought. It was all full of action, thrill and adventure !!!One thing I did not get was that about 4 or 6 helicopters being able to carry a Jaeger??? Well that didn't work for me. But the rest of 98% movie did.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The completely physical cockpits did great service to the film, allowing for much more depth of reaction from the actors. The decision to avoid motion capture for the Jaegers lent a feeling of real weight and ponderous momentum that the fluidity of human movement would have lacked. The sound work was superb, the impacts could be felt through the bass- and the soundtrack was just as good at getting the heart pumping.I fully intend to have a copy of this film playing in my home at all times.

I wasn't going to mind if the characters were meaningless vessels solely to move the story along as long as the giant action scenes were done correctly, because that's what this movie is for. If I were to give you the plot of this movie I would tell you the only thing that matters is the action, and if you go into this movie with the same expectations as me, you're going to get exactly what you bargained for.Guillermo del Toro directs this film and he does a great job at making every single action scene seem huge. Every hit in the movie packs a punch, and a hard one at that. The Jaeger vs. Kaiju battles do not disappoint in the slightest and are helped hugely by the great special effects work. The CGI in the film is top notch and makes every high- octane scene that much more intense. Not to mention the sets that the actors are in inside of the Jaeger are practical. The fact that they took the time to build sets for the actors instead of just putting them in front of a green screen is something to appreciate, and adds to the film's realism.The Kaiju are so interesting to look at, from the effects work yes, but also out of the different designs of each one. Some of them walk, some swim, and some fly but they all look fantastic. Seriously, I couldn't help smiling seeing these things battle, it's everything the inner child in me could want. It's completely over the top, but everything in this movie is, right down to the script and acting.Charlie Hunnam stars as our main protagonist and, although not awful, he definitely wasn't anything memorable. Anyone could have played his character. There were only 2 standouts in this movie to me – Idris Elba and Charlie Day. Elba brought a presence of force and power that the movie obviously needs, but is also the most human out of all the mostly hollow characters. Also, that guy's mustache is awesome. Just look at that thing. If I had a list of favorite mustaches, his would be towards the top. But, in my opinion, Charlie Day steals the whole movie. Maybe it's just because I'm a fan of his, but I absolutely loved every time his character was on screen. He was hilarious, but he also served as an important part of the story. That being said, whenever the movie focused on any other characters it slowed down for me because I didn't care about them as much. Luckily, the two get a lot of screen time to balance it out.Honestly, there's not much more to say about Pacific Rim. The film follows up with exactly what it advertises – giant, incredible action. A more refined human element would have been appreciated (and if the movie had it, it would be phenomenal), but the movie is entertaining enough in its action to look past that. When it comes down to it, this movie is just a damn fun time.Pacific Rim - 4/5","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Guillermo del Toro is a marvellous director but here he has been tempted to let his imagination be kowtowed to convention - and really this is a 1980s film with 2010s special effects.Who buys that we will all have advanced so much in 5 years? That aside, Pacific Rim is simply frustrating - a cacophony of loud noise, big fights, pseudo-emotional scenes that leave us hoping the monsters win if it puts out of our misery. I cannot deny that the effects are stunning, nor that the overall effect left me stunned and not in a good way - this is not entertainment, it is boasting - and Del Toro was never Michael Bay - but here the boasting leaves no room for film.A huge shame.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Great movie for the ""I don't like summer block busters"" crowd.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2831447/?ref_=tt_urv","zowen88","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45050522/?ref_=tt_urv","14 July 2013","If you are looking for that summer block buster movie that is more than just a summer block bust, look no further than Pacific Rim. Pacific Rim has very few recognizable actors, to my memory at least. Without all the cheesy A-List actors who would inevitably remind you of another role they played, ripping your mind away from what is going on in front of you, the action is immersing. The movie is deeper than just action though but not really in a make you think kind of way. It presents you with more story and more emotional defeat and victory in the intro than most movies of the ""epic fight""/""big machine fight"" genre give you in an entire film. It doesn't stop there. We are given a very interesting dynamic between several characters that doesn't need a lot of back story to sell their motivations. A lot is said with the words that they speak. The movie isn't your run of the mill giant robots fighting HUGE MONSTERS. This movie really felt like a live action anime. Things you would have never thought were possible in live action are done throughout. The cg is impeccable. The scale of things is incredible. The monsters are ingenious. I found myself LOVING the monster design, and this was key. I feel like this movie accomplishes what other movies failed to do. Del Toro and his crew created Kaiju (monsters) that I wanted to see more of. They were awesome and terrible things that I couldn't get enough of. This goes for the Jaegers as well. They were all different in design and functionality, but not so much that it was distracting or confusing. Without giving too much away, there are not a lot of Jaegers around when you get to the meat of the story. Give this movie a chance and you will find yourself cheering on the pilots, saying ""WHAT THE FUUUU..."" about the Kaiju, helping the Jaegers fight, and celebrating victories. On it's face, this movie is about giant robots fighting giant monsters, but beneath that is a beautiful story about ENORMOUS robots fighting ENORMOUS monsters. I give it a solid 8.5/10","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Right fact one is if you can see past the power ranger, transformer, Godzilla & independence day feel of the film, its surprisingly a fantastic film. It has emotion moments with some pretty intense moments which balance the film out, a lot of thought & passion has gone into this film as it shows a lot about Honor & respect in combat situation. The C.G.I design on the creature's & the robot's were amazing & it has some of the best monster fight scenes that you will think wow!!!! that was awesome, but there is a slight twist in the story which I cant say because it will give away spoiler.What I can say is I don't think this film will be for all, as I said if you can't get past the simple film mix you won't like this film or find it fantastic or entertaining. To me I loved this film for what it is, a very passionate, emotion action fight for survival film that really gives this film its edge. Film rating for me 8 out of 10.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's an odd thing too, I always wanted to see a Giant Robot and Alien Monster beat the crap out of each other in a movie of this era, and not only do we now have a modern film of that subject, but it's actually good. I'm not going to go into details of what go's on in the story, so I will say it's an original bad- ass film, the cast was good-we see people he used from his other works like Ron Perlman (always a trip) and Santiago Segura, and new people like Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini etc. The story is simple as it needs to be, the human race sticking together to defend earth's civilization from colossal alien monsters with massive dual-piloted battle robots, and for once after countless sci-fi flops, this Sci-Fi follows it's story as it's told. As for what the monsters and robots look like, A.K.A. the Kaijus (Japanese for ""Strange Creature"") and the Jaegers (German for Hunter), they look kick- ass. The Kaijus look like Godzilla's lost array of evil cousins (I know it sounds odd but i'm geeking out right now), from Japanese inspiration, I couldn't expect more of a classic looking gang of sea-misfits than this. The Jaegers, Holy ****, I want one, I prefer these robots than most of the Bionicle-looking Autobots and Decepticons from Michael Bay's Transformers series, all of them have their own style to them, not to mention culture as well, and with the two battling each other, it looks Amazing. Realistic looking, half in half, at times there were shots where things would look real (like that one Kaiju destroying the Golden Gate Bridge, that scene were it grabs the bridge, that's frightening looking, that's a Nightmare), then at times you know it's very CGI, but you know, who cares, it's worth it. I'll lastly point out that most of you reading this are thinking, ""It wasn't that great"" or simply ""It Sucked"" (or you say this review sucks which I wouldn't blame ya my wording sucks), but for those over the top's, you reading this Film Critics, it's a movie for everyone to go to and enjoy, a Summer Movie, more importantly another Monster Great to add to Master del Toro's Collection.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The great kind of big, fun, dumb and exciting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2831160/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie_Muse_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2496397/?ref_=tt_urv","13 July 2013","Movies don't get much more straightforward than giant robots battling giant monsters from another dimension. The giant monster movie is a classic genre, so in this age of all Hollywood blockbusters feeling pressured to earn their stripes by leveling a major world city, a return to these roots was inevitable. ""Pacific Rim"" delivers that old-school feel with the added pleasure of outstanding contemporary visual effects, and it results in a towering heap of giddy entertainment. When you look at the entire film catalog of giant monster movies, more than a majority would be classified as B-movies. ""Pacific Rim"" doesn't count under ""so bad it's good,"" but director and co-writer Guillermo del Toro has no intention of allowing audiences to believe that the film takes itself too seriously, at least never for very long. As much as moviegoers' appreciation for mentally stimulating ""smart"" blockbusters has grown, that's not what this production went for by any stretch.That essentially means ""Pacific Rim"" gives your brain permission to turn off and instead soak in the scale and wonder of giant robots fighting giant monsters. In truth, the script is total garbage. Travis Beacham, who wrote the film (with help from del Toro), also credits 2010's ""Clash of the Titans"" to his name, so that tells you del Toro and his uncanny imagination play the biggest role in ""Pacific Rim's"" success. Namely it's the dialogue that's atrocious, but the characters are poorly developed, with each assigned a single past trauma that completely defines them. The salvation of it all(which understandably may not be salvation for all viewers), comes again from that all-important lack of self-seriousness. It will remind a lot of people of some of the first big special effects blockbusters of the '90s, in which wonder and excitement take the driver's seat and help you smile through all the dumb supporting characters and subplots.The film begins seven years after the Kaiju first began to emerge from a portal deep within the Pacific ocean. Our hero, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) explains that to limit the planes and tanks it took to bring the beasts down, world leaders worked together to build Jaegers, giant robots piloted by two skilled soldiers connected by a neural bridge. The way all this works is somewhat fascinating, so Beacham deserves props for that much.When a battle with a Kaiju off the Alaskan coast ends badly for Raleigh, five more years go by and the world is starting to lose the war against the Kaiju, who have begun to adapt and dispatch Jaegers with ease. When all hope appears to be lost, Raleigh's old boss, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), commander of the Jaeger operation, recruits Raleigh to pilot his old Jaeger in a last-ditch effort. Together, with the world's few remaining Jaegers and their pilots, a rookie pilot (Rinko Kikuchi) and two nutty researchers (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman), they are the last stand for humanity.The design of both bots and creatures is outstanding, and you'd expect nothing less from del Toro. A much younger version of myself would be captivated enough to buy a Jaeger toy or two, for sure. And not only that, but del Toro captures the sheer size of these things in ways that Michael Bay never has with the ""Transformers"" films. That sense of scale proves pivotal to being drawn into this film. Without that huge epic scope and some imaginative visual effects, all ""Pacific Rim"" has going for it is a neat concept.And oh, the action sequences. The film's penultimate battle would be grand finale material in 90 percent of other blockbusters. The fact that it comes earlier, however, makes the final sequence much more surprising. The plot appears to lay all the cards out on the table in this second-to-last sequence, making the ending a total mystery.How del Toro can take something as big and clunky as this film and turn it into a total thrill is mystifying. He should teach a class on how to make big movies that look and feel dumb but somehow slap a stupid smile on your face and all Hollywood studios should force their blockbuster filmmakers to enroll before they set out to make the next big and dumb but also un-watchable movie.Not every other component besides the visual one stinks. Kikuchi's Mako is a slightly more complicated character, Day's role and Ron Perlman's cameo are stupid funny but funny and the acting is solid enough across the board to make us believe that these characters do indeed care about each other, which in turn helps us care about them more than we might otherwise be inclined.For all those that complain about critics being cold and unable to appreciate a fun, mindless blockbuster, check out the Rotten Tomatoes score on this one. There are ways to make a good mindless blockbuster and there are ways to make a bad one. ""Pacific Rim"" is a nearly textbook example of the former. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

When she says more than a couple words in a row, they show her from behind, because she obviously doesn't know English and (at least seems to be) speaking her lines phonetically. There's a flashback scene with her as a child, and the LITTLE girl is amazing. The other actors, too.

The film pulls together an original concept and forms a story around it that pulls the viewer into the world of the kaiju and Jaeger.In the film, the story revolves around the concept of giant aliens invading earth in hopes to destroy mankind, so in humanities last ditch attempt to save itself they create giant robots called Jaegers to defend human kind. The amount of time and effort that was put into the special effects is incredible and payed of amazingly you can honestly believe you are watching a death-match with a giant robot and alien.The story for the film also happens to be one of the most original i have seen in quite a while. today most movies are either a reboot of a previously done idea or a book. however pacific rim breaks this streak with a new original concept that makes for an amazing film.A good original monster is such a rarity to find these days, however Pacific Rim delivers not just an amazing film but an all new experience for the viewer filled with outstanding acting, direction, story and some of the best special effects of our time","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I clearly remember at moments thinking, ""I saw this scene in Power Rangers when I was in 5th grade."" WTF I think there wasn't much salvageable about the movie. The acting was pretty standard and overdone which is common for this type of movie. The special effects weren't anything impressive.

I liked his unique vampire debut called CRONOS. I missed MIMIC and THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, but thought his BLADE II was a hell of a good time. Then he amped up the Blockbuster juice when he made HELLBOY and HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY. Both have fantastic performances from Ron Perlman, a great fantasy sensibility, and well crafted action sequences. But most people consider PAN'S LABYRINTH to be his masterpiece, and it's hard to argue with that. It's been 5 years since his last film (though he was slated to direct THE HOBBIT until Jackson took over). Well, now Del Toro is finally back and with a vengeance as he has made the biggest film of his career, PACIFIC RIM. Man, the universe that Del Toro has created here is so expansive that it's really hard to explain everything. There's just so much! Hmmm. How the hell do I do this? .okay.. So the movie is set in the future. A bunch of gigantic monsters from another dimension called Kaijus, have risen from a portal deep in the ocean. These beasts attack the coastal cities and threaten the very existence of man. To fight the Kaiju, the humans have created a bunch of gigantic robots called Jaegers. These robots are controlled by at least 2 humans at a time. The cockpit is in the head and the pilots are on some sort of treadmill-like machine that make the robots move exactly how they are moving. Also, the pilots are connected by the mind, so they can move as one. This is called ""Drifting"", which allows each pilot to enter the other's mind. It may sound like a bit to take in (and it is) but it's all pretty well explained in detail during the extended 17 minute prologue. (And thank you Mr. Del Toro for actually having the title appear in the beginning of the film!).","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

And the effects because they're good.Dialogue is boring and cliché.Characters are dull.Editing is meh.Acting (with the exception of Elba, of course) is bad.The action is ok at best.The whole melding minds thing is absolutely dumb.And why does a mech have to be piloted by two people?

Otherwise, the stupidity of the story and weaknesses in the acting take you too much out of the action.From the trailer, I was waiting to be disappointed by why it takes two people to control one robot. Turns out, the neural connection between the machine and man would overload the mind of one brain. Fine. Here's a better solution: nobody gets in the thing and a team of people operate it remotely. Look, I know the point is the show lots of action, but why start off with this silly contrivance? Sure, it's supposed to set-up for powerful emotions when one robot ""pilot"" gets his partner torn from right next to him, but there could have been better ways to create this situation. It could be pilot, co-pilot. Or navigator and weapons.Then, are robots really the best way to fight these monsters? They say even bombs and missiles are ineffective, yet some of the robots have missiles and other traditional weapons built as part of their arsenal. Either they are or they're not effective. Make up your mind.But, I get it. It's all an excuse to watch big robots box big monsters. Fine. But, the fight scenes generally disappoint. Technically the film is fine, but viscerally, I just wasn't there with our heroes during most the battles. There were moments in the Hong Kong fight scene, but even that didn't maintain its occasional high levels of excitement.And the acting was mediocre and made worse by what I guess was poor directing and a lame script. The only memorable line is when one pilot says to his brother as they're about to do battle, ""Don't get cocky."" That was awesome in ""Star Wars."" Here, it just made me think of how much I'd rather be watching that movie.The character traits that are supposed to make us care are so shoved in and over the top that it never truly connects to us on an emotional level. Yes, it's sibling pilot teams, and father-son pilot teams. But, just saying they're related and share a bond doesn't make us feel that connection. And so many characters are so cliché and overacted it's as if they're in a B-movie. It is a popcorn flick, but at its budget and pedigree, I expect more from the performances.Finally, perhaps the most distracting part of the film is its score. The movie's music pretty much consists of one theme six notes long repeated and used throughout the movie. I started cringing each time I heard those same six notes (actually, three notes played forward then backward).This film makes Michael Bay look like Orson Welles and ""Transformers"" the full-color ""Citizen Kane"" of robot movies.","16 out of 56 found this helpful.

Such giant robots have never been seen and the best thing is that it has been directed by Guillermo del Toro who is phenomenal when it comes to visual effects. The first look of Kaiju, the monster will let you know that your decision of watching it in a theatre is nowhere wrong. Two thousand five hundred tons? Well, it looks like that and when it roars you know it is an enormously giant monster. So is the impression hen these monsters fight and make global destruction.To fight them, we have equally giant and titanic proportioned robots in Pacific Rim movie. The metallic skyscrapers makes us believe they can definitely fight with equal ferocity and kill the monsters. The best thing is that much effort has gone to make the audience feel the enormity and gigantic size and density of these robots. It is done marvellously and one may feel it as they move slowly and ominously conveying their enormous power.Talking about the cast of Pacific Rim, Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket is really good in his character. The entire movie is crafted out in a manner that it is his story on an entirety. Idris Elba as the Marshal Pentecost is believable in his performance. The motivational speech he gives in the movie to his troops is really well delivered as well. Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori plays the new partner of Raleigh. With the looks she has been given, she personifies Anime and it was well enacted by her. There is a plenty of other supporting cast and mostly everyone has given a decent performance.Overall, Pacific Rim is no doubt clichéd. The script is not remarkable but it is the direction of Guillermo del Toro that makes it special. For obvious reasons, no one will want to skip this movie or keep it for later stages home viewing. Thus there is no reason you are missing such an enormous violence on screen.Another thing is that Pacific Rim offers a big relief from what the Transformer series have become lately. We seriously hope they do not end up making never ending installments for this movie as well. It is better off with just one installment only. The movie is stunning visually no doubt and that is why it is a must watch. Also, leave your brains outside of the theatre and go in just to visualize some impossibly sized monsters fighting ruthlessly and doing global destruction.Guillermo del Toro has definitely achieved that much in Pacific Rim movie. You will not get bored in the 131 min runtime and it will keep you thrilled till the end.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

This is a story about gigantic humanoid mecha (Jaegers) fighting colossal monsters (Kaiju). If you watch anime you may know that the plot is similar to a number of anime. The film, however, is a tribute to older anime and not a rip-off. Yes, it successfully captures the appeal, weirdness and style of giant robot anime in live-action form. In short, this is a film that many Japanese filmmakers wish they could make. And with the addition of excellent visual effects and a suitable cast Pacific Rim reaches heights that many anime viewers and nerds always wanted to see. Some reviewers compared Pacific Rim to Godzilla films but once you watch it it's clear that giant robot anime was the real inspiration, one of the most important being Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995) by director Hideaki Anno. The Kaiju are somewhat similar to the angels in Evangelion in their fighting abilities, size and the frequency of their appearance. Rinko Kikuchi's character Mako Mori is very much like Rei Ayanami; her behavior, her relationship with Raleigh Becket, her backstory, and of course her hair with blue highlights. The Jaegers too resemble the Evas. Then there's the action, which is tense and exciting and backed up with a good soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi. But there's no action overkill because del Toro also spent enough time on developing the characters. Charlie Hunnam does a fine job as the protagonist. Idris Elba and Charlie Day shine in their roles. When talking about Elba's character Stacker Pentecost del Toro said ""he's doing penance for all humanity... Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes."" And, unlike many recent action blockbusters, Pacific Rim doesn't involve the American military. Del Toro is a self-described pacifist so he avoided making any kind of message that says war is good. In conclusion, Pacific Rim is the best blockbuster of this summer. I doubt that any other upcoming film will be better. It's a real success. Thankfully Guillermo del Toro was chosen to direct this $190 million project. It's some proof that once in a while Hollywood studios do spend money wisely. I easily recommend it.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's original, makes very good reference to many other movies in the past (Godzilla and maybe Cloverfield) and brings in true heroes with actual backbone stories of their own. Not to mention anime and mecha references regarding the freaking robots.There are a few mistakes here and there, like how could the pod sustain the depth pressure of the Pacific or who in the right mind would decommission a project that protects people with robots, I hardly think money was supposed to be the issue for those leaders, but meh it's not impossible to be lead by idiots this days.Second of all, the acting was flawless and we are presented with humor, drama, action even a bit of horror.

It's beautiful, sexy, exciting, funny, and it kinda made me feel like a kid again. The premise involves Kaiju and Jägers scratch that. Let's call it like it is: this movie is about big robots fighting big monsters. The monsters come from another dimension, entering our world from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The robots, each manned by two psychically linked people (often blood relatives), are humanity's last hope for survival. The concept sounds like the germ of another big, loud, stupid summer movie — you know, the kind Michael Bay makes. But director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth) handily beats Bay at his own game with Pacific Rim, imbuing the film with more style and substance than any of Bay's Transformers movies ever had.Del Toro sets the tone of the film right away, and you have the option of embracing it or going home. It's a stylized comic book movie for kids and kids at heart. The sets, wardrobe, and cheeky supporting performances all encourage you to set your cynicism aside. As a kid of the 1980s, I was glad to see a fanciful approach to big-budget action flicks again. Del Toro's approach lets him get away with more poetic license and suspension of disbelief than Bay or Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) can afford themselves — their hyper-real approach to fantasy film making is old-hat now, anyway.There are two more ways in which Del Toro shows up his contemporaries here. One is in visual and editorial style. I thank the movie gods that this movie isn't orange and teal. Del Toro embraces every color of the rainbow and I applaud him for it. (This shouldn't be a big deal, but it is!) And unlike much of Bay's work or Zack Snyder's abominable Man of Steel, I can actually discern what is happening shot-to-shot in Pacific Rim. The battle sequences aren't incomprehensible blurs like they are in those other movies, and I have to think it's probably because Del Toro is more confident in his narrative, staging, and composition.Finally, and most importantly, Pacific Rim distinguishes itself from the pack by having likable characters that I cared about. Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy) carries the movie very well, demonstrating charisma in addition to smoldering good looks (thank you, Guillermo, for the gratuitous shirtless scenes!) After his Jäger co-pilot and brother (Diego Klattenhoff) is killed, Hunnam's character strikes up a new bond with his training instructor (Rinko Kikuchi), who is haunted by memories of her own. The supporting characters are all stereotypes of one kind or another, but they add personality and charm to the proceedings. I especially liked Idris Elba as the Jäger pilots' commander and Ron Perlman as a Kaiju black-market organ dealer. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman bring comic relief as two bickering scientists, while Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky are memorable as Australian father/son Jäger co-pilots who never give up the good fight — not even when their robot loses power.Pacific Rim is meant to be surface-level entertainment, but while watching its international cast of characters make a unified effort to save the planet, I was struck by something mythologist Joseph Campbell once said: ""We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet."" I was also struck by the depiction of military leaders working with scientists to solve a mutual problem. It may just be my liberal heart beginning to glow after years of dormancy, but if our kids want to see big, stupid Hollywood movies, this robot/monster free-for-all is not without moral value.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

What appear to be people walk thru several of the scenes, generally shouting at or speaking severely to each other in intense tones — except for the wild-eyed, agitated jargon-slinging of the last 2 scientists on Earth that you'd want entrusted with the preservation of civilization (who, of course, are exactly that).Much of the dialog is muddled and only semi-intelligible, except for some nice, crisp subtitles on the screen when the only female for 100 klicks in any direction, Mako Mori (played by the charming Rimko Kikuchi, the only person in the entire movie who ever smiles), gets off a few lines of ritual self-deprecation and submissiveness. Otherwise it's a testosterone-laden gonad flaunting to see who owns the fire hydrant.Mori and ostensible hero Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) are co-pilots of Gypsy Danger, the last remaining Mark 3 model jaeger (German for ""fighter""), which is a truly gargantuan robotic fighting machine that's so complicated it requires 2 synced-up human brains (said to be ""in the drift"" when linked) to control it properly. The Mark 3 is recommissioned after all the newer models are rendered useless when the invading kaiju (Japanese for ""giant beasts""), arriving thru a trans-dimensional rift on the Pacific floor, deploy electrical zappers to short out all the digital electronics. ""But the Mark 3 is analog"", exclaims Becket, as he volunteers to take it out to battle a pair of kaiju who emerged in only the last couple of hours to threaten Hong Kong (after earlier lone monster warriors had wreaked havoc on San Francisco, Manila, and either Cabo or Kabul — couldn't tell from the garbly soundtrack).The human-seeming characters have tried in the past to nuke the rift in the ocean floor and so seal it off from further kaiju incursions, but they've had trouble getting past some obstacle whose name and nature are fleetingly alluded to and thereafter ignored. This time, tho, they have the advantage of some work-around that one of the scientists discovered when doing a jaeger-pilot-style mind-meld with what's left of the brain of an earlier kaiju.The time it took you to read the above plot description is about as much as what the movie spent on it. Yet Travis Beacham will still collect a check for what is honorarily known as a ""screenplay"". Fully 80% of the film is just whirling, thudding, smashing, bashing fight scenes, which move so fast and in such close-up (also generally in darkness and lots of splashing water, since this is a surf movie of a sort) that you can't tell who's who or who's doing what to which.I saw it in Imax (a good size screen for the spectacle that director Guillermo Del Toro is obviously trying to create), 3-D (originally shot as such for the CGI scenes but post-converted for the minority of the film that pretends to pay attention to people), and 20,000 watts of surround sound (which blessedly weren't quite as deafening as the literally painful Transformers 2). The talents of Ramin Djawadi, who wrote the haunting, evocative theme song to HBO's Game of Thrones, are here wasted on what I'm sure he was instructed to render as pompous bombast, which plays relentlessly under almost every scene.There's a welcome cameo appearance by Ron Perlman as a larger-than-life underworld figure who's discovered that the market for powdered rhino horn or tiger penis pales in comparison to what flaccid Asian men are apparently willing to pay on the black market for reprocessed kaiju.You know that Del Toro is going to max out the visuals, and he doesn't disappoint in that regard, which is one of the few things keeping this regrettable pile of brainless, pointless, overwrot violence from sinking all the way down that rift in the Pacific trenches to a rating of 1.","9 out of 29 found this helpful.

In response, the world has pooled together it's resources to create monsters of our own, giant robots called Jaegers, to combat these creatures. Our story follows Raleigh, a once great fighter who is struck by tragedy and leaves the Jaegers program altogether until he is thrust back into war. I'm not going to spend much time talking about the story and characters because they aren't really the point. However, that's not to say they are bad; they're just familiar. Charlie Hunnam really immerses himself into this role of the antagonist and delivers a performance that I personally really enjoyed. All of the acting in general was passable. Some of the dialogue wasn't great and filled with clichés, but despite that Del Toro finds a way to keep you invested enough to the point where you still really care about these characters. Much like the characters, the story is pretty formulaic as well, but again Del Toro crafts it in a way that allows audiences to sink their teeth in enough.No surprise, where this film excels is in it's action scenes. Beautifully colored and spectacularly filmed, Del Toro reaches into the part of your brain that's still 12-years-old and entertains the hell out of it. Staying away from ""Transformeritis,"" Del Toro provides audiences with beautiful sweeping shots that allow us to really see how grand the whole spectacle is, making each hit all the more impactful and exciting.Pacific Rim is the summer blockbuster I've been longing to see. While all the others this summer seemed to focus on darker elements, Pacific Rim is monsters fighting robots at it's most basic form, from a director you can tell really cares. THis is the most fun I've had at the theater all year.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The characters barely scrape into the second dimension. The music is intrusive, desperately trying to wring some emotion from scenes that are devoid of them, with characters who the audience has no empathy with. The effects are impressive. But there are films out there with impressive effects that also grip you with their narrative and convince with their performances. Some of them even move you.Most affecting performance of the film - the little girl playing young Mako. And she's barely in it.The premise feels like a mish-mash of various sources, blended together into something less than fresh.The look is rather workaday - there's really nothing you haven't seen here before.

This is because he himself apparently doesn't recognise this divide, so it isn't evident in his films. In terms of scale, style, and theme, Pacific Rim might be as far from, say, The Devil's Backbone as one can get, but it's just as much the work of its author, because Del Toro is as fascinated by the Spanish Civil War as he is enthralled by the Kaiju (""strange creature"") tradition of Japanese cinema. Pacific Rim is Del Toro's love letter to Godzilla and its offspring.The setting is the near future. The story concerns a Rift between worlds, through which 100-foot monsters are coming to Earth to kick-off big style. The only thing standing between the Rift and human annihilation is the Jaeger programme: humankind builds its own, metallic monsters to bodyslam the Kaiju into oblivion. They've a matter of months to ""cancel the apocalypse"". It's too barmy a premise to start asking serious questions (why not simply guard the Rift with nuclear warheads?), and this silliness is one of the film's strengths.The special effects are a spectacle to behold. The giants never have the weightless quality of earlier CG, and the sense of scale is hugely impressive. Del Toro keeps the action admirably clear, eschewing the sorts of fast cuts that would have done an injustice to the immense power of his mighty pugilists. And while it is a film about fighting at the edge of annihilation, the tone is always light, with comic relief never far away - particularly when an old friend of Del Toro's shows up in the second act.What drags the film toward mediocrity are the protagonist and the movie's sheer length. 90 minutes of melodramatic cliché would be a breeze - but we've well over two hours with Charlie Hunnam leading the way, and he's no leading man. I thought I was watching Garrett Hedlund (Tron: Legacy) at first, but then I realised this guy has even less charisma. Main-man duties should have been left to Idris Elba, as the conflicted commander and protector of the dwindling Jaeger project, whose performance - heightened but subtle - is pitched perfectly for the material.Pacific Rim was never going to be as deep as the ocean of its title, but to expect otherwise would be like complaining that there are no slow-mo shootouts in Good Night and Good Luck. It's a robot versus monster movie, from a moviemaker who loves the genre. It could have done with a shave in the editing room, and possibly some of that big budget could have gone on a star for the driving seat (even Will Smith had Bad Boys before he got the Independence Day gig). But if you're asking for a gleefully bloated, uncynical hooray for humanity, you can't ask for more.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

A bold promise, for sure. But Del Toro and the team have strung together what is quite possibly the best summer blockbuster in years, hands down without question.What better aspect to talk about first than special effects? Oh man, are they absolutely splendid. The special effects are incredible, unreal at times. Jaegers are designed with intricate detail, glistening in the rain and snow and sleet that they fight in and are brought to life with incredible realism. Moments outside of the action are fantastic too, combining amazing sets and gorgeous backdrops to carry the neo-sci fi style throughout the film. The Kaiju are brought to life with ferocity and gruesome majesty; these big hulking meanies are awesome, ridiculously cool and fun to watch completely obliterate cities. Del Toro is known for his monsters, and Pacific Rim doesn't disappoint. One of the other high points is the incredible level of detail seen throughout the film. Every fight scene is sensory overload, with a huge amount of detail from realistic physics applied to building chunks, cars, and other structures that give a sort of tangible weight that is missing from most films of the same genre. The remarkable visuals, produced by Industrial Light and Magic (a sub-division of LucasFilm) has done the impossible: they have brought movie magic to the screen, drenched in class and style unseen in just about every single summer blockbuster for the past few years. And then there is the earth shattering, bone crushing, kaiju smashing action fight scenes. It's like Rock'em Sock'em robots on an unheard of scale, and it's perfectly balanced and respectively exciting to watch. I don't want to spoil anything, but the action scenes are just an absolute joy. An absolute, unadulterated, bring-out-your-inner-12- year-old JOY. And it proves that there can still be plenty of fun to be had in a gigantic summer blockbuster. And it simply never stops being a blast. Brining gigantic scale ideas to life is one thing, but putting that into motion, directing the action, the pacing, the character interaction so that it all combines into one incredible experience; Well, very rarely is that ever done welland here Guillermo struts his expertise and brings the fictional world of Pacific Rim to life. But the action would fall flat and the pretty images would be filler if it weren't for a convincing human component and a little smarts, which Pacific Rim succeeds mostly to bring that dynamic to the screen. Is it convincing, well written, and well directed? I thought so, in that lovable cheesy summer B movie kind-of way. The story follows Raleigh Beckett, a former Jaeger pilot out of luck after a major accident involving the kaiju. After some time to see how the other side works and lives, he's brought back to the jaeger team Gypsy Danger for one last crack attempt at stopping the Kaiju. The leading performances here are pretty good, most notably Idris Elba. His performance is strong, one that you can care for and is well written and acted. The rest of the cast, while there aren't any big name stars, is commendable on its diversity (one message that drives forward Pacific Rim), lovable cheesiness and well acted script. You can feel Guillermo's signature character writing style in every one. Despite how minor, they have a shining moment or two (and a laugh here and there!) Charlie Day (It's Always Sunny in Philly) plays a hilarious comedic relief role but ends up being very important to the crux of the conflict. Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy) does a swell job as the hero and Rinko Kikuichi (Babel, Sideways) is surprisingly strong and well acted as the heroine of the story. Plus, Ron Perlman plays a kaiju black market dealer and is hilarious; a caricature of modern businessmen. And Ellen McLain (Glados of the Portal Series) acts as the Jaeger AI and has a few portal jokes for fans.The rest of the elements that make up Pacific Rim are strong too. Ramin Djawadi's epic score is equal parts bombastic and musically memorable. What's cool is that Ramin's score matches up with the action at most points, so major brass drops and orchestra hits line up with the massive smashing punches of the Jaeger vs. Kaiju fights, further producing a cool and very Hanz- Zimmer-y effect. The sound design for the film is top notch too. Sure, it's loud, but there is a method to the madness. Every smash, crash, and subtle movement is in the mix. Dialogue is strong too, and you never have to strain to hear the humans inside the Jaegers. It's a subtle layer that most moviegoers don't even notice, but I greatly appreciatebecause it's kind of hard to care about your characters when you can't hear them!Is there anything inherently wrong with Pacific Rim? Well, personally, I would've loved to have seen just one more epic fight scene stuck somewhere in the film. But that extra baggage could've pushed the film to the near 3 hour mark. Beggars can't be choosers, I guess! Like I stated before, the characters are a little broadly drawn but it's a more than excusable flaw when the special effects start flooding in. As I'm flipping through notes and playing the movie back in my head, I can't say that there wasn't a moment where I wasn't entertained. Sure, it's a relatively simple plot, but the level of fun I had in this big monster smash-hit overshadowed any nit-picks I had with the film. It's pure unadulterated entertainment from start to finish, and I wouldn't have Pacific Rim any other way.9/10 – Golden Summer Award","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

While his influence is obvious in that the visuals and design are impressive, there is nothing new here in terms of the plot or script.

I watched this in IMAX and the visual effects were well suited to the format, however, the destruction of cities and fights with giant robots are not enough to carry the film. Idris Elba does an admirable job with a limited script but the remainder of the characters are as clichéd as they come with the two academics, Gottlieb and Newton, being particularly irritating.While I give this a score of 4 stars these are for the visual effects and not the jaded, threadbare plot.","10 out of 35 found this helpful.

The action in this movie is mindblowing; it's not like Transformers where explosions and throw downs are right infront of you face with a mixture of smoke and shaky cam and you don't even know if a good guy or a bad guy just blew up(but comparing this movie to transformers is like comparing the twilight saga to blade because there are vampires in it). But the action feels enormous, the mechs move all slow and they punch slowly because they're gigantic. The plot in this movie is surprisingly good. It's in depth, it explains everything without spoon-feeding the viewer. The acting in this movie was also surprisingly good every actor looked like they had fun in this movie. The Bad: the reason I said the acting was surprisingly good was because if George Lucas has taught us anything it's that cheesy dialog and too much time in a green room can lead to bad acting. Don't get me mistaken, the dialog in this movie is no where near as cheesy as the Shakespearean crap Lucas shoved down our throats in the Star Wars Prequels, but there were still some lines where I just thought ""ok that sounded pretty dumb"". Dialog aside you just don't care about the characters problems, Del Toro tried to relate the two main characters by giving them a broken past and making them have reasons to want to smash Godzilla's face in. Now I don't mind character development one bit, but I just did not care the least bit for the characters problems. There were also quite a few useless characters. There were three characters that of the movie didn't have it would have been no different. All in all this movie is a great time, with good acting, a compelling storyline, some cheesy dialog and pointless characters, and mindblowing action. You won't regret seeing this 'movie it's pretty awesome.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I even took my wife along, figuring there wouldn't be a lot of gore but a lot of mind-blowing action sequences instead. Damn, we weren't disappointed!This movie is like no other. If you've appreciated The Host, Cloverfield, Godzilla, and the like, you will love Pacific Rim. But even if you're just looking for powerful mecha action sequences, this movie does it far better than any Transformer movie or even animes like Evangelion. And finally, and that's really del Toro's touch, even if you're not a fan of the mecha-kaiju genre at all, which my wife isn't, you'll find a lot to love in this movie.The directing is great as always, the depth of every character is just enough to make them truly likable, on top of that the actors are surprisingly good, particularly Rinko Kikuchi and the little girl - which we see only too little - which portrays her younger self, some scenes - like the one with the younger Mako as a matter of fact - are to be remembered as classics, the SFX are beautiful, state of the art, and don't spoil the almost artistic quality of certain scenes by trying to push too far, and the scenario is extremely smart and mostly coherent from beginning to end.There are a few inconsistencies in the script and a few clichés that weren't really necessary - especially considering how many many other clichés Pacific Rim brilliantly avoids or twists - for which I remove one star, but just one. Because other than that, this movie is so close to perfection. The best piece of kaiju action ever to hit the screen. And one of the best action movies of the decade.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

""Pacific rim"" though, is more random than most monster movies, and dumber than the much-criticised ""Transformer"" films to which most will no doubt compare it. Whilst the corniness of ""Independence day"" or something is in there too, with big speeches like - ""Today! We are cancelling the apocalypse!!!"" standing out.Yes, you really have to leave your brain at the door for this one. But I'm expecting those going to see a big movie like this would probably do that anyway. I don't know what I personally was really expecting from it. But with Guillermo del Toro being behind it, I was expecting something a little more than what it is. Though it is visually amazing, like most of Guillermo del Toros other stuff.The special effects are impressive (Maybe even more so in 3D) but there's no story, or anything to really get invested in, or have a laugh along with. Some will take it as one of those fun films that ""knows its rubbish."" But I was sighing more than I was laughing.

It wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't a disappointment either. As expected, the special effects were stunning. I thought the robots were extremely well done and looked really awesome. The fight scenes with the monsters were also exceptional. Even if the monsters look similar to other movies (Cloverfield) they were still visually appealing. The plot was straightforward as one would expect, and it had few twists. However, a movie of this kind is not expected to have a superior plot full of surprises. Pacific Rim is meant to provide the viewers with 2+ hours of pure entertainment, which I can say it did.I did have a problem with some of the movie being cliché. I won't give any specifics, but some of the parts have been seen in countless other movies. In my opinion, though, the interesting concept and special effects more than made up for the platitudes. I thought the acting was solid but not exceptional. Rinko Kikuchi bothered me a little bit, but I think it was her character rather than her who I disliked. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies or end-of-the- world films. It obviously won't win an Oscar, but it accomplished what it set out to do.I'd give it a 8/10.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

When it first came out, it was a blockbuster movie. Everyone was talking about it, everyone bought the toys, everyone couldn't wait for a sequel.For quite some time, Transformers was left unchallenged. I mean really, that movie has a cult following. To challenge it would be stupid. Or is it?Pacific Rim proves that Transformers does not monopolize the giant robot/action/CGI movie industry. When I first watched it, I noticed two things: (1) The storyline was very predictable (2) I didn't care about '(1)', because most of time my face looked like this -> =O or =DTransformers had the wow factor, but it is a kid's movie compared to Pacific Rim. But the main reason I'd rate this movie 9 stars is because it brought the whole ""Godzilla"" and ""King Kong"" monster movies back in to limelight. They made evil mindless giants destroying cities cool again.Whats even better, this time, we fight back with giants of our own. If you're like me, you've played games like ""Mech Warrior"" or ""Gears of War"", then you will definitely love this movie. The giant robots are controlled by humans, like the giant robots in ""Power Rangers"" but 1000 times cooler.In my opinion however, the main selling point of this movie is the fact that Guillermo del Toro really stretched the limits of his imagination this time, fusing the Eastern ""Godzilla"" with the Western ""King Kong"" and adding a pinch of ""Alien"", creating his ""Kaiju"". He reflects these monsters with the robots too,creating ""Jaegers"". The wow factor in this movie is definitely that, combined with the amazing graphics. The tacky lines like the part where Mako Mori says ""For my family!"" before slashing the Kaiju or the part where Raleigh says ""We're out of options"" when they had a blade they didn't use until halfway through the movie, may make you frown a little when watching it. But that's all it does. You just frown. A little. You're still going to enjoy the movie, it really doesn't change anything.Ultimately, this movie is definitely going to be a classic. It doesn't matter what you may think, it's a movie that people will watch again and again, just to watch some robots beat the crap out of monsters. It is in the same league as the legendary ""Godzilla"" and ""King Kong"", and Guillermo del Toro is indeed deserving of awards (which I am sure he will get) for creating such a masterpiece.He has indeed, done it again.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The human race, in a bid to fight these monsters, is forced to create monsters of its own known as ""Jaegers""—gigantic humanoid robots controlled by two human pilots, whose minds are connected by a neural bridge capable of establishing a psychic intimacy through a phenomenon called ""The Drift"".Doesn't the story sound familiar? Well, you bet! Apparently, the plots of almost all modern sci-fi films, especially those spawned by Hollywood, seem to revolve around the very same context. The aliens are on the charge and the bravest amongst our race must rise to the occasion and put their lives on the line in order to save the world from an impending apocalypse. And, invariably, the only aspect that differentiates it from the other films of its kind is its visual appeal. How grand is the use of CGI and VFX is all that matters. For, these films are all style with very little substance. On the face of it, Pacific Rim appears to be no different. In fact, with regards to its visual makeup, Pacific Rim comes across as another perfect summer blockbuster made in the vein of Transformers or Iron Man films. Honestly speaking, after seeing the movie's rushes, I was more or less convinced that Pacific Rim was just another ostentatious, run-of-the-mill Hollywood product in the making.But, Guillermo del Toro never ceases to amaze with his genius! Pacific Rim is not merely a visual spectacle but it's also a film that can be deemed a consummate cinematic product: a great deal of attention is given to character development, the narrative works well on the emotional level, and occasional bursts of humour ensure that the tension gets punctuated every now and then. Pacific Rim reminds me of another very well made sci-fi film that seemed to perfectly blend flamboyance with substance: Neill Blomkamp's brilliant District 9 (2009). But, make no mistake! The content of Pacific Rim is far from being original. In fact, the film seems to borrow a lot from classic sci-fi films. Thus, it wouldn't be wrong to look upon Pacific Rim as del Toro's homage to classic films like Star Wars, Independence Day, Godzilla, Avatar, and Transformers.Overall, Pacific Rim comes across as an extremely well made sci-fi, action-adventure extravaganza. Its breathtaking, sumptuous visual graphics clubbed with a strong emotional quotient make it one of a kind. No one but Guillermo del Toro could have handled a seemingly commonplace plot with such delicacy, ingeniously transforming it into an end product that's not only richer but also smarter than the rest. While the acting is solid all around, the cinematography, editing and music are all, without a shadow of a doubt, topnotch. It's quite shocking that del Toro's film went completely unnoticed at all the major award functions, barring a single BAFTA nomination for Best Special Visual Effects. Pacific Rim offers truckloads of entertainment and keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat, throughout its runtime. It's a heady cocktail of style and substance that packs a powerful punch. 8/10A more in-depth review can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Perhaps an 8 if all things taken into consideration, BUT the action, the special affects, the cinematic presentation of giant monsters fighting robots is everything you want from this type of genre that I have to give extra points in this category, so a 9 is what this movie rightfully deserves. There are many people looking for this type of movie, and trust me the fight scenes won't let you down. Normally movies fail to deliver on special affects due to budgets, or just poor vision in general which is why many (like myself) turn to anime which can easily make these actions sequences come to life in cartoon form, but this movie bridged that gap easily. If you've watched Godzilla movies and always felt it was missing something in terms of actions or affects then you need not look any further as this movie is the answer. I so look so forward to the sequel!!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It deals with an international struggle between the forces of good versus evil. The force of good is represented by the Jaegers. Jaegers are giant robotic machines visual binary intelligence piloted by ""drift- compatible"" human pilots. In the struggle against evil monstrous alien creatures, Jaegers must fight the hard game and win. The joint visual binary intelligence must defeat the draconian beast. Together we find that we are the last hope for the force of good within humanity. You are either with us or you are against us. There is a struggle for the force of good that unites peoples. And there is a cause of light within us really a cause of light and order and unity that facilitates our own personal and collective evolution. We are looking forward to the joint-intelligence magic, media, merchandise, and movement from great movies like ""Pacific Rim"" that inspire the youth of our generation.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But when mounting losses prompt world leaders to look to other, perhaps less effective methods against the intensifying attacks, the remaining members of the Jaeger program gather everything they have left for one desperate strike to close the rift and save Earth.Alright, so you know walking into Pacific Rim that you're not going to get stunning plot twists, unconventional storytelling, contemplations on deep themes, or insight into serious real world issues. You're here to watch giant monsters and giant robots throw down. And do they ever. The battles are fast paced, physical, expertly staged, and beautifully filmed. The quality of the fight choreography is the highest I've seen in any giant monster movie. The designs of the mechs and monsters are excellent, and they're gorgeously brought to life with a mix of CGI motion capture, detailed models, and occasionally by what appeared to be good old fashioned rubber suits. It's like Ultraman or Power Rangers, only a hundred times better. The upcoming Godzilla reboot is going to have to work hard to equal this.Beyond the action and the effects, what sets this apart from your average kaiju flick or a certain other franchise built around giant robots is the wit, humor, and even intelligence it displays. Neither the acting nor the writing is likely to win any Oscars, but unlike far too many entries in the genre, they're actually pretty good. Character's actions actually have motivations. Instead of wooden acting and stilted lines delivered without feelings we get people who show emotion and talk the way you would expect real people to talk. Compared to the choppy dubbing jobs kaiju fans are used to, this is a godsend.The most original part of Pacific Rim is a rather interesting process called drifting. Each Jaeger carries two pilots, who share a direct neural link not only with their machine but also with each other. When this link is established their thoughts and memories become shared, as they 'drift' through their own and each other's pasts. Besides being kind of trippy, this provides the excuse for powerful flashbacks that let us and their co-pilots see who they are and what they've been through more effectively than any amount of conversation or narration. This is especially true in the case of Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) a young Japanese pilot who lost her family in one of the first kaiju attacks.Importantly, this movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It goes into enough scientific explanation to be plausible, but not so much that you're eyes will glaze over. It features destruction on a massive scale and characters that have experienced deep personal loss, but it never becomes grim or overwrought. And it leaves room for some very good comic relief, most of it centered on a pair of eccentric researchers who share a pronounced Odd Couple dynamic.By all reasoning a movie that can be summarized as giant monsters vs. giant robots should have been just another soulless explosion filled special effects fest. And it probably would have been if not for director/co writer Guillermo Del Toro, who would never let one of his projects stoop to such a level. Instead he's paired the action and explosions with solid directing and storytelling. As awesome and adrenaline pumping as the battles are, it's the human element that makes Pacific Rim one of the most fun movies of the summer.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Well, yes. A stupid plot making no sense on any level, including giant monsters which are nearly invulnerable to projectiles and rockets but vulnerable to giant robots, which come in increasingly stronger versions instead of coming in the strongest version right away, and which are pregnant despite of being reproduced by cloning. And cliché characters including dyed blonde hair Russians like Ivan Drago from Rocky III and a Marshal reproducing the motivational speech from Independence Day.﻿ It's nice to look at, I give it that. And it is not as annoying as the Transfomers sequels or Battleship. But the difference isn't too big.

It's a nonstop roller-coaster thrill-ride. It is an audio-visual spectacle that commands your attention and keeps your heart rate up with nearly continuous action that leaves you little time to breathe. One thing this movie is NOT is boring. What it is, is exciting. Watching this felt like doing 2 hours of cardio just sitting in my recliner.Is this the most brilliant movie you'll ever see? Probably not. The storyline is fairly generic and not revolutionary. It certainly has its flaws but pointing them out seems a bit nit-picky. I don't think the purpose of this film is to provide a cerebral and thought-provoking story with Academy award winning performances. Criterion isn't going to memorialize Pacific Rim in its collection. I truly believe the purpose of this film is to provide viewers with an exciting visual and audio experience.Watching this reminded me of going to an amusement park to ride one of those hydraulic shuttle simulators. No one went on them because they heard the film showing on the screen was brilliant; they went on it because it was a fun ride that made you feel like you were on a space shuttle. That's what watching Pacific Rim is like, at least for me. I watch it for how it makes me feel, not for how it makes me think. And what I feel from watching this is a nonstop adrenaline rush. Every time they're operating a Jaeger I get the sudden urge to slowly stomp my feet.It's also a movie worth owning on physical media, especially the 4K UHD version, if you have a home theater. Pacific Rim is reference quality media with its 1.78:1 aspect ratio and superb Atmos mix. The bass is so extreme it'll feel like an earthquake. So Pacific Rim isn't just visual eye-candy, it's an acoustic masterpiece that audiophiles will appreciate.Fans of action sci-fi movies like Edge of Tomorrow, War of the Worlds, Starship Troopers, etc. Will likely enjoy Pacific Rim. I mean, what's not to love about giant robots fighting giant alien sea monsters?! Sure, some elements of the story are a bit predictable and silly but so what? This movie is AWESOME. The story itself is somewhat forgettable, but still enjoyable. But what's unforgettable is the experience you'll get from watching it. What else can I say? It's just a FUN movie and one that I truly enjoyed.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I didn't expect it to make any scientific or technological sense, but it was like the producers of a bad Adult Swim anime got handed a billion dollars and given too much freedom. And stretching it to over two hours rather than 90 minutes didn't help. I found the Transformers movies more enjoyable, and I'm not at all a Transformers fan.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

In the first fifteen minutes I was concerned, I felt it came across extremely childish but once the Gypsy Danger crashed onto the beach after a failed mission I knew Del Toro would start bringing in the excellent back-stories and a sense of threat. I'm not going to dive into the characters too much as I feel they are all so richly constructed it's worth watching it and getting connected to them yourself, but I will say the cast are brilliant. Charlie Hunnam is a top lead and a believable hero, Idris Elba nailed the role of Commanding Officer Stacker Pentecost by delivering true authority. Rinko Kikuchi makes you feel the pain extremely well as Mako Mori, a Jaeger pilot who lost her family in the wake of the Kaiju, Mori's strength and fury comes out whenever she pilots the metal beasts. My only issue is with Charlie Day who seems to be stuck in Horrible Bosses mode, constantly whining and raising his voice whenever he gets the chance, although his co-star Burn Gorman does a great job of bringing you back to reality amongst the colossal fighting that goes on. The 3D is the best of 2013, this movie focuses more on depth and boy it delivers. From the get go you know you are in for a treat, check out the shot of the Kaiju trashing the bridge, it looks so close but the cars at the front separating the distance beautifully. Cars, building blocks, well actually everything comes close to exiting the screen but you are more a less immersed into the action. Underwater looks incredible as corals and rocks take on pointy surfaces, it all looks stunning. The reference moment is the harbour fight between Gyspy and the acid spitting monster, the 3D is the best I've ever seen at this moment, whole crates and containers whizz around the screen, depth is evident even in split second camera shots, it is groundbreaking in visuals and will no doubt leave you in awe, I totally geeked out and kept shouting at the screen yelling ""COME ON!"". The sound is the best to hit home cinema systems, every thud, knockout punch, Kaiju roar and splashing waves screams, it is cinematic in definition and in my opinion, better than Transformers, which is a lot coming from me as I'm a huge fan of those movies. You must own this release. As for the special effects they are awe-inspiring on a grand scale, whole cities are wiped out as Jaegers and Kaiju's leave a path of destruction whilst fighting with extreme power. I love the rain effects that dominate the action scenes, and the majority of the movie is set in the dark so the neon lights of Hong Kong look gorgeous against the backdrop of the carnage. My favourite scene though wasn't a fight, it was the scene where young Mako Mori is running away in terror from a Kaiju, every single camera shot here is excellent and the fear in the young girl's face is frightening, this scene hits hard. This is as big as Godzilla, as destructive and chaotic as Transformers but it has the most heart and depth than both those two which is a bonus, and although it does make you wait for spectacle the payoff is truly breathtaking. I highly recommend this beast of a movie, it's a visual marvel all over and it's bolstered down by wonderful characters.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Made with an obvious and beautifully apparent love for movie-making and entertainment, this film kicks down the door and strides onto the screen with such bravado and comfort in its substance and nature that I can see no way to dislike it. Yes, the plot is goddamn ridiculous at times. Yes, it's a little over-the-top at times. But you know what? That's beautiful. And we need more of that in our lives. A little unburdened fun is something we all could use, and this film delivers heaps upon heaps of unburdened fun. Let us not forget, though, that it is not all giant-robots-punching- giant-aliens in every scene (welcome though those incredible scenes are). No, this film is just as much story and characters than it is style and action. The identities of the main characters in this film are some of the most appropriately portrayed I have seen from the action/sci-fi genre in a long time. It's not a character drama, so not too much must be read into and there isn't too much weight or seriousness to the more calm parts of the story, creating a few meaningful plot points, which is perfectly enough to satisfy even the viewer who is suspicious of massive films like this lacking any plot whatsoever (and I have been accused of being one of these). I can't say exactly how I felt when it finished, but I was content with its conclusion, (though it was a tad sudden), and I was delighted that I'd taken in this film. Mr. Del Toro, you're a masterful entertainer and filmmaker, and thank you for creating a film that can stand up, be confident in its massive substance, and strive to entertain and create a good time. Because above all else, if you still need a reason to see it, Pacific Rim can guarantee a real goddamn good time at the movies.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Sounds like all it needs is some human characters we actually care about and some decent dialog thrown in and you have yourself a blockbuster, right? But this movie manages to fail on every conceivable level. The acting might possibly be the worst acting in any film I've ever seen to date. You'll find yourself halfway through the film, seriously rooting 1. for the aliens to kill off the humans and 2. for the movie to be over. The dialog is the worst in any film I've seen to date. I found myself laughing at the characters delivery of it and bored to tears at the same time. To give this film one star is only because I had to in order to rate it. This movie could have been amazing and the special effects should have saved it but I have issues with that part of the movie as well. For me, I didn't care for the color scheme of the robots or the aliens, often times when they were battling, in my opinion, it was a muddy vision and hard to detect one from the other. The action sequences just became a muddled ball. They were moments, I'll say where the visuals worked but very fleeting moments but moments that reminded me of such lost potential.

I like a lot of stupid movies, like Independence Day for instance. I disliked Pacific Rim because it didn't have any discipline. I could imagine everyone who worked on the film saying, ""You didn't come here for memorable characters or a good plot. You just came here to see giant robots fight giant monsters."" It's true that the robots and monsters are what I watched the movie for (and the special effects are good, which is why I'm giving the movie 2 stars instead of 1) but I also expected an adequate story to prop up the special effects. Independence Day might be a dumb action movie but I enjoyed it because it explained the villains' motivations decently and there were some memorable performances from Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman. The characters in Pacific Rim are incredibly bland and some of the plot points are just a bit too stupid (like the giant wall and the robot sword that the characters apparently forget about for most of the movie). I was hoping to enjoy Pacific Rim, because I thought the concept was interesting but it could have been better written. Apparently it's getting a sequel, despite only barely making twice its budget. (Movies have to make a substantial amount more than twice their productions budgets because the studios have to share the total revenue with theaters, isn't that right?) Maybe that will be better.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is a great movie and a great story. The story makes the movie. Imagine there is a global conflict that only a few have the skills to attempt to solve it. These few, while they have proved skills (have solved this problem previously), have no authority to solve the problem and go rouge. There are so many additional movies here (training, discovery, the aliens, genetics, etc.) that this movie could span many hours to tell the story. Instead, the story, told in excellent fashion, provides the detail we need to cheer for our heroes. If you disagree, post here to tell me what I missed.

The big inspirational speech by Alba that is just a rip off of the one from Independence Day. Just without the heart. The drama moment between father and son, all while the world is burning and monsters are attacking.

The film tells the story of the pilots of giant robotic machines called Jaegers who must go head to head with invading, sky-scraping beasts called Kaiju, making for some of the most jaw-dropping showdowns in recent cinema. And while the film's greatest achievement is its astounding visual effects, the human element is never lost in the mix.The film is told from the human perspective, making for some true edge-of-your-seat entertainment as the pilots are shaken and tossed around in the head of the Jaegers, adding suspense and jeopardy to scenes mostly rendered in a computer - in the hands of a lesser director, the fight scenes could easily be detached and cartoonish, but del Toro allows the audience to stay with the pilots and control centers, giving these extended battle royales genuine gravitas.The acting is well-done and each of the protagonists is given a back story and good motivations, but it is Idris Elba who delivers a standout performance as the commander of the Jaeger program. While our main hero, played by Charlie Hunnam, is given a decent character arc and background, he isn't fleshed out as well as Elba's or even Rinko Kikuchi's character, so you don't necessarily care about him as much as the other two protagonists.Ultimately, ""Pacific Rim"" is a feast for the eyes with human drama added for good measure. The main draw of the film is obviously the clash of the titans element, but audiences will also be able to connect to the characters, enriching those moments of ocean-moving, building-tumbling collisions as two beasts, one from another world, one man-made, pummel each other to the death.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Leave your logic and thinking cap home and prepare yourself for 2 hours of sitting back and getting thrilled and amazed by awesome action scenes and big-ass robots made by man.You documentary and ""based on a true story"" people shouldn't even be aloud to write a review for movies like these.

The giant monsters seen in the Sinbad movies, Godzilla, Gamera and other movies made my youth so much better. Years later the world became more cynic, and the cinema followed the same. Lost were the fun of yesterday and only the original Jurassic Park kept the spirit of the genre alive. Fast forward 20 years later, and Guillermo del Toro made a film almost impossible: a giant monsters vs giant robots with a heart (i.e.: not Transformers). I hope it inspire the same level of awe to a new generation of children, and ignite a wave of quality monster movies. With Godzilla just a year away, Pacific Rim is the best entertaining you can get until the king of the monsters movie next year. Not perfect but close enough, a sequel could only be better.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

If you were expecting anything different, well, I'm not sure why because Pan's Labyrinth this ain't. It's exactly what the promo materials promised: a big-budget SFX sandwich with a dense layer of sci-fi sensibility spread through its guts. Hold the subtlety and nuance.Fans of the classic monster movie will be, no doubt, tickled to see the evolution of that format (though some of these beasts are so foreign and complex, it's often tough to distinguish up from down amidst the mayhem of a fight scene) but I was somewhat puzzled by its herky-jerk pacing and weird sense of identity. It's a tale that can't choose between serious action and gaudy eccentricity, so it tries to move in both directions without luck. Likewise, I had difficulty looking past the odd jumble of TV stars mashed together at the center of it all, drawn from very different sources and plunked down together in a series of comically mismatched back-and-forths. The action is good, and abundant, but the plot is quite thin and the core characters are all basic caricatures. It's worth a watch, but only as a home theater demo or a simple bit of drunken escapism.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

When the flick started it immediately reminded me of course of Godzilla but also Cloverfield (2008) came to my mind. But it wasn't all about monsters here. There's a bit of a macho thing going on and a love story luckily that part you could see coming and is only a main issue the mast minute. On part of the effects they were stunning and the 3D was also worth watching. Even as it clocks in over 2 hours this flick was over before you know it. It never had any weakness. A rather big surprise that it was actually good after the failure of Battleship (2012) and Batlle Los Angeles (2011). And when it do becomes camp it's when Ron Perlman (Hannibal) comes in. Be sure to watch further when the end credits start, there's a big joke coming...Now that those monsters are killed it's time for Godzilla (2014) to attack again...Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0,5/5","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I saw this as a teen and now 10 years later. This movie delivers on giant robots fighting huge aliens. Let's be honest, that's one of the main reasons - maybe only reason - to watch this movie.The CGI and use of lighting is top notch. However, if you're looking for an intriguing plot, Pacific Rim doesn't have much to offer. There are not a ton of twists, or elements to keep you on your toes.But...if you are looking for a visual feast - a spectacle of space invaders coming to take the earth - then, this movie has got you covered!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I am really surprised that they saw anything of significance in the movie and it's a total cop out from the Mr. Shyamalan we have come to experience so far. Sorry, I just returned from the movie before it finished, yes before it finished, and it's a total washout, if you ask me. I am not going to reveal the storyline but its a plot which is not uncommon, humanity threatened by alien powers in brief. The special effects don't come into the movie until late and am sorry it come out crap. It might have some subtleness in its scope but it stands no way in comparison to the much simplistic but brilliantly devised Transformers. It just misses the point of marriage of visual effects with cause and chronology. There are advance robots which can work with a drivers mind but limited by the actions of human physiology, how lame can it get. It's like a mega version of Real steel but without the character and emotion of that movie. Waste of time more than money, if I have to be frank.","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

It is always difficult to make a film like this, which is not based on comic books, novels or an established fan base. The film is mammoth in terms of production evident by the large scale design. The film pitches the massive Jaegers against the mighty Kaijus in an last ditch effort to save humanity. Rarely there comes a film that hits all the right nodes, be it action, direction, acting, story or visual effects. It has stunning action sequences and when not in action mode, the story keeps viewers interested. The film should get an Oscar for best visual effects! Guillermo del toro and his team of designers have so lovingly created every kaiju and jaeger that they deserve a standing ovation for their brilliant work. Charlie hunnam is a likable lead and Idris Elba has a commanding screen presence. The whole cast delivers and Ron perlman and Charlie day are hilarious!!!. All in all its a must watch for everybody. It appeals to the 12 year old inside all of us!!!!","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

Before you know it, you've been thrown directly into the front-line of a world where robots battling monsters has become a way of life. The opening clearly and succinctly establishes a future in which mankind has created giant robots named Jaegers to go head to head against the Kaiju, colossal monsters that have entered our world via an inter-dimensional rift on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.The key to these type of grandiose pictures is the audience's willingness to accept and believe the fantastical elements as fact. Luckily, the film speeds along at a great pace and the overall design is convincing enough that it all feels plausible.This is especially the case with the film's explanation of the way the Jaegers are piloted. The overall idea is that two pilots, stationed in the head of this giant machine, take care of one hemisphere each: the left and the right, much like a human brain works. In order for the two pilots to be perfectly in sync with one another, their respective brains need to meld together – so to speak. It's an interesting concept that gives the film ample room to explore the emotional ramifications of being able to share the thoughts and memories of another person. And it also ties in with the film's key theme of humanity joining forces to take control of an extreme problem.Now, let's focus on this said ""problem"". The Kaiju are absolutely huge, terrifying beasts that are beautifully realized, and they look simply awesome on the big screen. The creatures are various enough to ensure they don't ever get boring or repetitive. Every time you think, ""Wow. That one is massive!"", BOOM! A new one comes along and shuts you right up.As you can expect, the special effects are fantastic. The giant fisticuffs on display are definitely entertaining and surprisingly brutal. Limbs and innards are ripped out from both robot and creature. Annoyingly, these epic-scale fights do get a little repetitive. There are only so many unique ways you can see a giant robot punch a monster. And would it hurt to have some of these battles play out in the daylight? There are moments were you can see parts of these monsters and robots in sunlight, but the majority of these battles take place at night, making it harder to appreciate the details. Towards the end there was a battle that I was sure was going to happen in daylight, but no – not at all.Comparisons with Transformers are inevitable. Michael Bay's massive action sequences are considered by many to be overblown and too confusing to clearly follow. The rampages here are much easier to keep track of. Del Toro makes sure that he gives you some wide shots, but I wanted more – especially with the aforementioned darkness that envelops the action.The cast performs well, ensuring that the world and its mechanisms are convincing. As the lead character, Raleigh Becket, Charlie Hunnam (from TV's Sons of Anarchy) is good, but his character is probably the most underwritten of the lot. Idris Elba is the stand-out of the cast. His Stacker Pentecost is a perfect combination of tough-guy antics and caring father figure. Rinko Kikuchi is quite good as Mako Mori, a young woman who has a strong reason to pilot a Jaeger. Unfortunately, Mako and Raleigh's love-story never really convinces and ultimately fizzles out.The story may be mostly entertaining, but the predictability gets quite annoying. All plot strands give irritatingly obvious signs pointing to their conclusions. Almost straight away you'll be saying, ""That guy's going to die. They'll fall in love. That won't work. That will."" Also, there are plenty of cringe-worthy moments that stick out like sore-thumbs amongst the film's other great factors.Overall, Pacific Rim ticks off most of the boxes for a decent blockbuster. The special-effects are impressive, the battles are exciting and the pacing is relentless. There are a number of issues that detract from the overall experience, but this is an exciting – even exhausting – sci-fi flick that succeeds in giving enough bang for the cinema-goer buck.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Jaeger pilot, Raleigh Becket(Charlie Hunnam) pairs up with trainee, Mako Mori(Rinko Kikuchi) to drive a unique Jaeger that does not run on electricity, in a last ditch effort to once and for all stop the Kaiju. Heading the Jaeger pilots is, General Stacker Pentecost(Idris Elba). I would like to start by saying, I really enjoyed the film. It is a treat for all action & sci-fi fans. The 3D is spectacular, especially in all the battles between the Jaegers & the Kaiju. The only problem I had with this movie was that, it had no substantial story. Almost the entire movie consists of robots & alien monsters beating the crap out of each other. I'm not complaining though. It's just that the movie would have been much better if it had a solid story as well. A note on the performances. Charlie Hunnam is brilliant as Raleigh Becket. Idris Elba is outstanding as Stacker Pentecost. Rinko Kikuchi is impressive as Mako Mori. Charlie Day is hysterical as Dr. Newton Geiszler. He was the only character to provide constant comic relief in the film. Burn Gorman is effective as Gottlieb. The supporting characters are effective as well. All in all, Pacific Rim is not a must watch, unless you're an action fan. However, go for it if you have some time to kill. You won't regret it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Just no. It's over two hours of witless CGI explosions and nonsense that left me feeling like a kid had been throwing bricks at my head and hitting it. I'm all for blockbusters, but they should at least have a story or interesting characters and this has neither. If that's too much for a blockbuster to ask for, it needs to at least have entertaining action scenes. This movie doesn't. It doesn't even have the nutty physicality and entertaining slapstick of the Hobbit trilogy, with the only memorable action moment being a giant monster getting clocked in the head with a cargo ship held as a baseball bat. (It's symbolic of what del Toro is doing to you.)Maybe giant monster movies just aren't my thing. When everything is so upscaled there's little impact when anything happens and I think that's fundamentally the same problem Bay's Transformers movies had.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Tried too hard at humor and hand-to-hand fighting / training scenes. Both were unconvincing to put it mildly. YOu take a risk with unknown actors/actresses and it showed. Remember Starship Troopers?

The attention to detail to the whole movie is just unreal. If i'm honest the only lesser graphics are that of Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day)'s Kaiju tattoos!As a spectacle Pacific Rim is amazingly entertaining, I've been too see it twice & enjoyed it hugely, especially the roles of Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) & Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) both of whom captured my attention, Raleigh for being the main character with his ""bad ass attitude"" & Stacker for simply being a ""badass!"" My only gripe about this movie is the character development. But as this is not a spoiler review I will let people rate that themselves. Overall I would say that I'm hugely impressed by this film because it is hard to make a total cgi fight entertaining without being ""robotic"" pardon the pun.

Both the mech and monster designs were done really well; the mechs look as they should, i.e. giant towering pieces of metal and the monsters look like stuff that came out of Godzilla movies. The down side to the designs is that essentially all the monsters have the color palette of either grey or darker grey and it doesn't help that all the fights occur at night or during a storm...or underneath the ocean...while the mechs have a bit more color to them, they are killed off way too quickly leaving only the two protagonist mechs which as you guessed it...just so happen to be colored grey...The film does well to capture the sheer size of the monstrosities however, as a whole, combat was done poorly. The vast majority of action shots are either low angle, worm eye or close ups - sure it shows how brutal every punch or thrust is, however, at the same time - its hard to appreciate the fight choreography when a fist or horn takes up the majority of the screen.Overall, for a popcorn flick, its average. 5/10.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Then there was a scene with the little Japanese girl which was amazing. I truly give that Scene 11/10 just mesmerize me. Seriously it was that great in all aspects. The colors looked great the acting was incredible and the scenery was well done. Then there was the other characters the 2 scientists can make anyone uncomfortable they lack charm. They were just not there (not connected to the movie at all). Another thing I noticed is that it is too long. The Movie is just too long and began getting more and more less interesting. I fell asleep twice watching it (didn't want to say it but had to). Overall the Movie is a 7.5 out of 10. I have to give it a 7.5 for that scene alone but it then started to loose depth. Guillermo del Toro could've done a better job in giving more depth to the movie and to the characters. The special effects were out of this world but like I said it lacks charm, that warmth.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This felt more like a very biased ""Favourite Scenes""-compilation from a really really epic and really really awesome movie with the barest minimum of interconnecting scenes, so as to not let the resulting plot holes get too big. I'll be pretty disappointed if there isn't a 4 hour Extended Edition coming out for Christmas, that's for sure...In some cases this brevity could of course also be interpreted as boldness. It was a bit like the film makers said, look we're not trying to pretend you do not already know this stereotype inside and out so we're not going to bore you with all the typical scenes that traditionally go with this particular character or plot element. Just fill in the blanks yourself. That's kinda cool, I guess...This movie really did not feel like it did have any fluff at all (the 131 minutes really felt more like 30) - well, except maybe for the side plot with the scientists which, though cool and funny (albeit cartoony), was completely optional (i.e. it would not have made the slightest difference to the ending of the movie if they had simply been edited out).But there were also so many more *hints* at epic side plots and character back stories, all of which were unfortunately not explored at all.Also, I found it a bit distracting that the two ""quasi-antagonists"" (Charlie Hunnam and Robert Kazinsky) look so much alike that you could mistake them for twins sometimes. Especially in the scene where they get into a fight I always caught myself looking at the clothes for distinction which I don't think is a good sign...As it is now, I would rate the movie 7.7/10 - but the Extended Edition (if it exists) might very well be a 11/10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movie is plot less, the story cliché and the acting wooden. There is no one that I can connect to as a real person performing as a real person would in the same circumstances. And don't get me started on the physics of it all. How do you ""stand and fight"" a monster in a 10 story tall robot in several hundred feet of water? How do 8 helicopters (or more) fly in sync when transporting the robots? Why would giant robots use ""rock em sock em"" tactics? There is only so much suspension of disbelief that I can muster for a movie. Or maybe I was just missing the medication the other reviewers seem to be on.

A mysterious rift under the pacific ocean allows giant monsters (termed ""Kaiju"") to enter our world. When conventional weaponry proves ineffective, the Jaeger programme was launched to create massive metal titans with the sole purpose of protecting earth's surviving cities. As years pass, the war shifts. A stalemate turns into a losing battle as each subsequent monster seems to evolve to better tackle Earth's defenses. With the Jaeger programme at risk of being discontinued, and a startling revelation about the nature of the monsters, Marshall Pentecost (leader of the programme) brings in former pilot Raleigh Backett for a perilous final strike against the Kaiju. Now Backett must learn to work with his new pilot partner Mako Mori, as well as the last of different country's Jaeger teams, and literally ""cancel the apocalypse"".Yes, we have seen this plot before many times. It is Independence Day. It is Battleship. It is every single alien invasion/end of the world scenario. You have people of clashing personalities made to work together, the hot headed rookie, the cynical veteran, charismatic military leader, racial stereotypes, everything. Yet with the giant monsters and mecha, Director Guillemo Del Toro not only gives a fresh take on a tired old genre, but he ups the ante on action and entertainment. Pacific Rim is steeped in a palpable air of hopelessness as seen in the increasingly brutal beatings the Jaegers take at the hands of the Kaiju. To realise these battles, the special effects by ILM and Legacy Effects are flawless, realistic and breathtaking to behold. Action is awesome, epic in scale and scope.The creative team tackled the film with the mind of a fanboy. For instance, the numerous monsters seen are obvious homages to famous monster movies of old and new. A lumbering beast that moves like a fat ape is no doubt a homage to King Kong. This crustacean based Kaiju seems to evoke memories of a monster from the Godzilla films called Ebirah. And an agile, skinny, long armed creature with parasites on its skin seems to be a reference to the similarly designed monster from the movie Cloverfield. Other references to the winged Rodan, split tailed King Ghidorah and more abound. The Jaegers themselves seem to reflect qualities of their countries of origin with Russia's looking like a nuclear cooling tower and America's having a typical superman physique with it's wide chest and ""Y"" shaped body.Still, beneath all the eye candy and behind the seemingly unoriginal plot lies some rather unique themes rarely expounded upon in film. We delve into some philosophy of war with regards to the Jaegers being on the losing side. When a weapon fails, is it the fault of the weapon or the one using the weapon? And what about hope? Can hope truly unite people of different ideals?The Jaeger are piloted by two pilots who have to be joined through what is called the ""Neural handshake"". The pilots, be it complete strangers, best of friends, brothers or father and son open themselves up to each other and share their most intimate memories and everything that makes each individual who they are. They can feel each other's pain if one is hurt, they know what each other is thinking. They become ""one"" and work as one, connected physically, mentally and emotionally. This concept is very similar to a deep concept about the nature of love. Brotherly love, family love, romantic love, it is all about that connection between individuals. This film is a clever metaphor for such a connection. It is a movie about love without any actual physical display of romance: Not a single kiss in the whole movie.Who needs sappy romance anyway when you have such ""larger than life"" characters. All of them are given little character arcs that are developed fully. A champion learning respect for his superiors, a father letting go of his child to walk her own path, a soldier nursing scars of the past, all of them come to satisfactory resolution. Idris Elba steals the show as the bada55 commander Pentecost. His performance is so memorable, as is his ""cancelling the apocalypse"" speech repeated in almost every trailer. Oh, and the almighty Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau, the leader of a black market syndicate selling Kaiju parts is marvellously cast in this surprising role. Special mention also goes to Charlie Day and Burn Gorman who are hilarious as the bickering Doctors Newton and Gottleib. Incidentally, it is the side characters that end up more memorable than our main characters. Rinko Kikuchi does her best but her command of English makes her character Mako Mori's dialogue sounds almost dubbed in some scenes. But the low point of the show is Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Backett whose monotone droning narration just comes across as bad acting.Well, nothing can be perfect. A more original soundtrack would have benefited this show though. Ramin Djwadi does instill the Kaiju themes with a classic giant monster movie feel but the rest of the soundtrack sounds like a retread of Iron Man with its electric guitar and heavy metal vibe. Still, Pacific Rim no doubt succeeded at what it intended to do. Guillermo Del Toro took two floundering genres and gave them a much needed face lift in the minds of movie going audiences everywhere. Mecha CAN be realised in live action, convincingly and awesomely without power ranger style puppetry. Giant Monsters can be taken seriously with none of that rubber suit crap. Pacific Rim also brings hope of more original screenplays and actually world-building in an industry dominated by movies based on pre-existing franchises.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The focus is on the visual effects and battle scenes, there are some interesting sci-fi ideas but minimal attention was devoted to their details, the acting is good, the plot is predictable but engaging and the character development is again minimal but enough (aka optimal).We are all probably used to stunning effects by now so what makes this one different? I would say its the seamless fusion of so many ideas, Godzilla sized monster aliens and to combat them Transformer sized fight machines guided by humans in co-ordination(like in Real Steel but more intricate). Also unlike many action movies that try too hard to be emotionally deep and end up being miserably melodramatic or shallow, this one hits the sweet spot. Also there is at least something amusing about a metal brute wrestling a bulbous acid throwing flying Godzilla, right?One disappointment for me was that there was potential for a lot of nice sci-fi conceptual depth but the details were mostly left out unless needed for comprehending the plot and also the acting performances could have been slightly better but Idris Elba was awesome in his role, even his voice was perfect for his dialogues.On the whole a nice and refreshing movie, if the trailers give you a run of the mill feeling I would still recommend watching it (on the best screen possible), it might surprise you.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I expected more over the top CGI effects with dreary dialog and a forgettable cast. Thank goodness my AC went out and I chose to seek refuge at the air conditioned cinema. The film's pace was quick and the story line tantalizing enough to hook me. The CGI effects were, of course, there in robust abundance, but - and this was what won my heart - they didn't steal the show from the human drama in the film. The characters are likable and even inspirational. No, these are not vastly deep characters a la Ingmar Bergman; they're more like the characters one used to find in the westerns by directors like John Ford and Howard Hawks. The heroes are archetypes, and the film takes on the qualities of a modern age myth. And to top it off, the film is a lot of fun, too.

I want to be brain-dead and have fun and whoop it up to great special effects, stuff blowing up, hot actors in tight fitting suits, large explosions, big monsters, huge ass robots......THIS what you expect from this kind of movie and it DELIVERS!!! Except the film for what it is, and what it is supposed to be. Its not a political statement, or a social commentary. Its just a DAMN GOOD TIME!! Definitely one to add to the DVD collection along with ""Independence Day"", ""Armageddon"" ""2012"" ""Transformers"" and all the other cliché budget busting Action/Sci-fi movies that you'll watch over and over again. Just embrace the fun people, let your hair down and stop taking life SO SERIOUSLY!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Its one hell of a ride in the ocean.They create monsters to fight monsters. Jaegers, the giant robots. The pilots controlling the bots, sharing the neural load. The way they fight the monsters. Its an awesome package for the action lovers out there. The plot is simple and Guillermo del Toro did a great job. The story goes well and it keeps on surprising you. The action sequences were incredibly great. People who are missing movies like Transformers, Bot fights etc are gonna love this one.Coming to music, Ramin Djawadi did a great job. It keeps you on the edge of the seat. The relation ship between brothers, Father and son, Love, caring, the performances are just perfectly done by each character. The lead role Raleigh by Charlie Hunnam. Shows the relationship between brothers. Rinko as Mako Mori did a great performance shows love, care, courage. Herc and Chuck, the perfect father and son. And not to forget the performance of Idris Elba as Stacker. Everyone did a perfect job.The Jaegers Gypsy Danger, Crimson Typhoon, Cherno Alpha and others.The way they fight is awesome. Action sequences and the visual effects are amazing.This movie deserves a perfect 10. Even with expectations, this one will never disappoint you until the very end.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

While I don't spend a lot of time listening to critics, the descriptions of a trite story and some messy, dark, special effects turned me off and it went to the ""rental"" list. For me a good choice and not only was I disappointed, I was checking my watch at the end.The monsters ARE cool, and I know del Toro is giving big nods to classic critter monsters, but ended up feeling like ripoffs of Jurassic Park, Godzilla, and Cloverfield. Lot of the time the monsters didn't seem to have sharp edges and looked kind of blobby. Lots of glowing blue eyes and glowing slime. The acting is adequate, the script is adequate, but it's all so trite and been there, done that. More ripoff of Iron Man, Transformers, Independence Day. Lots of laser light lightning. A couple of bright moments from the cast that rise like gas bubbles, pop, and then we are back to more of Top Gun.Am no hater, thought the trailers looked incredible, but meh. This looked like something that came from the Sci-Fi channel. At least Transformers has CHARACTERS even if over-the-top, whereas PR felt like it was imitating characters from other films, and without a lot of energy. Except the girl was cute.Rent this for a rainy stay-in night when you just want something to watch without having to think to much. It's OK. Not sure why some are really enthusiastic but I wasn't seeing it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It doesn't help that the lead actor looks really alike his rival. The effects are decent. The fight scenes at really boring... The other one would just stand there waiting for a punch to hit him. Are we back in the 70's? After seeing movies like transformers where the fight scenes are fast and realistic, this movie really makes a really sleep-inducing fight scenes. The scientists and hellboy's characters here makes me feel that I'm watching an 80's movies, which is most of the time good. But here, it's annoying! I'm not really sure why so many people like this movie. I hope I can see what they see in this cause I am really looking up for this movie to be a great one before seeing it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The premise is simple and unpretentious. The film honours the origins of the genre, it doesn't try to be something else and delivers on its promise. The fight between Kaiju and Jaegers are clear clean-shot action sequences, no shaky-cam, extreme zoom-ins, 360 shots or first person viewing that would make many audience uncomfortable.The action is beautifully choreographed, executed with style and magnificence.Ignore the critics' comments that the monsters or mecha shown in the film is unclear or not visible because most of the fight scenes happen at night, in the rain or underwater...because they're totally unjustified. I can clearly see them. Although no in-depth character development is provided for all of the supporting characters and there are some character issues in the film (some characters seemed to be 'specifically engineered' to serve a purpose), but the characterisation provided is sufficient enough for the audience to know them and justify their actions in the film.The film didn't try to be overly serious, a pair of mismatched scientists is included to provide some comic relief.There're some plotting issues where the prologue that serves as the backstory of the war is too fast-paced and we're only shown a glimpse of the Kaiju's first contact to humanity. There's a flashback scene worth mentioning, the little girl who plays the young Mako is extremely adorable and her expressions managed to convince the audience about her traumatic experience.If your childhood memories consists of Transformers, Evangelion, Mobile Suit Gundam, Godzilla, Ultraman...So why not give Pacific Rim a chance? This is a definite love letter to all the Kaiju/mecha fans out there, co-written, co-produced, directed by Del Toro himself to re-introduce this old genre back to the younger generation.Review: http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/07/movie-review-pacific-rim.html http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/07/pacific-rim-kaiju-and-jaegers.html","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

When they finally do actually use their weapons they easily blow massive holes in the monsters and kill them immediately. When they were on the bring of death 30,000 feet in the air and finally decided to use their sword they were able to cut the monster in half as if they were using a hot knife to cut through butter. Also how are the Jaegers able to stand up in the ocean 7 miles off the coast? I get that's a sci-fi movie but they could have at least used a bit of common sense in the making of it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movie starts with a bang, and then its bang bang all the way.The climax is bang bang(little clichéd though), but its all so enjoyable that you do not care.Its been a long time since a pure no holds barred action flick has come.

The stupid Nerd character that has to explain everything, etc, etc...Ron Perlman is here and he is annoying. The plot is predictable, the action scenes are confusing, the story and characters are chiché, the music goes unnoticed, the only interesting thing is the special effects and the action scenes.

I see a lot of reviews that are negative towards the movie take the movie way too seriously.The movie has a simple but fun and interesting story. Monsters/aliens from another dimension have come to Earth when the environment was just right to wipe out the humans and claim the land. They are smart beasts that get better and better each time they come through the connecting bridge from their dimension to Earth. The humans have developed Mecha suites to beat the monsters/aliens. I would pull a lot of Manga/Anime comparisons, but I won't because it was just awesome to see this on the big screen.There is no boring love story, they keep the love interest simple and real. There was one scene that I teared up over. I won't give too much away but it has to do with Mako Mori's character. The lines were cheesy but the movie had better character drive than any Michael Bay film has ever had. I really cared what happened to the characters.The action was sometimes hard to tell who was fighting who. I get setting the fights at night in the rain make the CGI look less fake... but Michael Bay did it. More slow motion would have been cool in the fight scenes.Graphics and sound are top notch!

I was very sadly mistaken. This is an attempt at remaking the Japanese classics of the 60's that I have found memory of watching as a young boy and even now when they run them late at night I watch them.This film seemed to take parts from many films. It tries to meld the topics of many of the 60's Japaneses greats like Godzilla and Godzilla Vs Gamora but with a more mature cast.The acting is either well over acted or well underacted, even the extras are over acting which gives the case of very poor direction and the story line is as bad as the acting.Some people reviews this stating they needed to watch this in the mind of a 10 year old, well I agree to a certain extent, the difference is even at my age now I can happily watch the 60's greats many times over and enjoy them, this I would not want to see ever again. It just didn't make it on any level. I am trying not to give anything away but it does not meet any criteria of a Sc-Fi let alone just a decent movie.I would even think kid's of today would expect more than this delivers so I wouldn't even show it to any children.A total waste of my time and this is the first bad review I have written but feel that as some how it has received a 7, someone really needs to bring it back into perspective.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Transformers series is nowhere close which I started to feel is plain dumb !!Pacific Rim is overall a typical underdog story. But Del Toro gives it a heart and soul through story telling and special effects. He also keeps the sentiment level at minimum and focuses on the action. Another wise thing he does that he casts not so famous actors and hence the audience focuses on the action and not on acting. The action set pieces are breath taking and the scene of young Rinko with a Kaiju gave me goosebumps.The climax is short and not lengthy like Man of Steel and there wasn't a single bore moment.

Films like Godzilla versus MechaGodzilla, the 7th Voyage of Sinbad and King Kong versus Godzilla got as much playtime for me as a kid as did Star Wars or Batman. B-movies have a certain charm to them, they usually have paper- thin human characters blended with whatever alien or monster element is providing the special-effects draw of the film. Pacific Rim is the perfect blend of old-world B-Movie schlock and new world visual effects. The human characters are caricatures or thinly veiled stereotypes, their backstories are predictable and so are most of their actions in the film. You can guess what's coming a mile off. Just from the trailer you can guess the basics and yet, with as stupid as the plot is, when they get into the giant Mechs (Jagers) and start battling monsters the spectacle of it is jaw-dropping. You really feel the sheer weight and size of these things, both the Kaiju and the Jagers, which is no small feat considering how hard it is to convincingly portray mass and size with CGI. There's something about traditional model making that makes it easy to get a sense of weight and scale but here the visuals manage to show us, and more importantly let us feel, just how toweringly massive these behemoths truly are.Even with a by-the-numbers plot I still found myself rooting for the Jagers every single time they faced a Kaiju. The adrenaline rush of seeing the two pilots move with the machine, all their will-power, all their memories, merged to fight this threat. Metal getting sheered, torn, battle-damage to the Jagers, monster bodies crashing through buildings. When I was a kid there was a film called Robot Jox that used stop-motion for the giant mechs. With modern CGI we've come a long way. Rather than try to get gritty or grim or realistic the film stays true to its schlocky silly predecessors.If this film had come out when I was twelve it would have changed my life forever. It's an awesome sight to behold that leaves you pumped. This is a film that admits what it is up front, if you've seen the trailer than you know what to expect. It is a homage that blends the plots of a thousand other monster movies into a perfect blend of pure visual cinematic awesome.In short, it ain't perfect, but its the most entertaining film I've seen this summer. If giant monsters battling mechanized soldiers doesn't put you in a theater what are you seeing, a comedy? On the big-screen? For shame. Go see Pacific Rim!PS. Portal fans, her voice IS in the final cut of the film!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Now don't get me wrong, I love action movies, that kind of movies I mostly watch. But I still think that action movie should have some kind of soul. This movie totally lacks the soul. Acting is horrible and dialogue is even worse, but it doesn't matter here so much because the movie is most of the time like watching an animated movie. The effects are OK but not that great, you will be noticing all the time that you are actually watching CGI animations. Basically every action sequence you will know in advance that what will happen. And even after the first fight I said to myself why the just won't do that what they then eventually did. This is just stupid and boring action movie. Do yourself a favor and watch Fast and furious instead. Its also stupid but at least fun.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

No. How on earth does punching Kaiju with giant metal fists make more sense than launching Tomahawk missiles at them (my nerdling explanation here is that the radioactive nature of the creatures prevent long range weapons from working properly, but still) Fact is, if that is the kind of detail that is a deal breaker for you, then you are way too nitpicky and will not enjoy this movie.But. If you are the kind of person who grew up a fan of Godzilla movies, or Japanese Giant Robot cartoons (not Robotech but the Grandzier variety) or hell, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, I can't see how you won't love this movie.Personally I fall in the middle category. Was never big into Godzilla and was a bit too old for Power Rangers when it first came out, but those Giant Robot cartoons with the superhero like super science? I dug it. Granted when Robotech came along I vastly preferred the slightly more realistic/militaristic approach, and if anything that is the middle ground Pacific Rim falls into.Plot wise we're talking a straight forward story. You have the invasion scenario, you have the military response, you have teams of pilots. Characterization is done fine, but a problem I think some people have is that they're expecting TOO much from Del Toro, as if he's not just suppose to do better than Transformers but give us a deep window to the human condition with giant robots punching monsters as window dressing.Let's put this movie in it's proper place. It's Top Gun. It's Star Wars. It's The Matrix without the psudo-philosophy and impossible human battery science in favour of impossible giant robot science. That's the kind of movie you're going to watch. To quote an oft-used internet meme: it ain't Citizen Kane. Nor is it supposed to be.Only one character I actively thought was full on super-cliché and that was the Iceman clone (though what happens at the end with him is better). Ron Pearlman is perhaps underused, but it's always great to see him show up.I was also surprised how I didn't mind the 3D effects. I'm not a fan of 3D (didn't have a choice in the matter), but this worked fine in that medium. It was obvious when it needed to be and wasn't when it didn't. Still not worth paying extra for, but usually there are moments where the 3D bugs me and this didn't have any of them.If I were to go into geek mode I could nitpick the hell out of it, as I alluded to before. But where Del Toro succeeds is that I didn't want to. I was too busy enjoying myself, and wishing I could see more of this world. My major complaint is that it was too short – by about ten hours.What I mean is this would have been great as a series rather than a movie, to flesh out more of the characters and give the consequences more weight. Heck, so much backstory is just hinted at in the first half hour, showing the early years of the Kaiju war, I would have loved to have seen more of that as well. Or watching them effectively become independent contractors when they lose their funding. And more time to get to know the pilot teams. Because even action movies can have characters that are developed enough for you to care about what happens to them, and I don't think this movie had enough time to do that for some of them.Taken for what this is, this succeeded where Hollywood almost always fails.Giant robots, done right. Was that so hard?","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's the most mindlessly-fun movie I've seen in several years. I'm tempted to go again just because there was so much going on at the start and end of the movie that I feel like I missed some things.Don't go expecting Shakespearean character development or a deep philosophical message. It was a little like Avatar in that it's all about the visuals. Very little effort seems to have gone into the script and acting. In fact, the best acting in the movie was done by the little Japanese girl who showed genuine terror as she was being chased down by one of the Kaiju.I watched in 3D, and thought it detracted from the movie. Everything outside the very center of the glasses was blurry as hell.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

As for the story, basically, the ocean floor has awoken creatures hiding for centuries.

Some have criticized it for being too much like Transformers where we get tons of epic action but no story and characters we don't care about. Well this movie does have the Transformers type action however the story is much more deep and the characters you actually care about.The acting in this film whom is lead by the fantastic actor Charlie Hunnam is wonderful. Hunnan finally gets a big lead in a major summer movie after years of doing a great job of acting on a popular television series Sons of Anarchy. Idris Elba another great actor works with Hunnam a lot in the movie and these two make their scenes so much better. They have so much chemistry between them that it adds something special to the film. There are tons of side characters that as well do a fantastic job of making this film one of the more well acted films of the year.Guillermo del Toro does an amazing job directing this film. The film while mostly CGI is beautiful on the big screen. This film truly comes to life right in front of your eyes and it is so wonderful to see. The shots are perfectly done and no shaky cam to worry about here. It is known del Toro was against transferring this to 3D however I'd say in my opinion the 3D adds a lot of depth to the film that makes it even better. The IMAX 3D experience of this film is also one to behold as with the giant IMAX screen(whether real or fake IMAX) you are immersed and makes the film so much better. This film should truly be watched on the giant IMAX screen.Travis Beacham and Guillermo del Toro wrote this film together with Beacham writing the story. The writing for the most part is fantastic and fast paced meaning it moves by quickly. For the most part. And here is where one of my complainants about the film come in. I'd say after about twenty minutes or so of non stop action it cuts off to build up story. Which is perfectly fine and needed. However the film drags for too long and it is a buzz kill. Thankfully it is not over the top long and the film does pick back up and from there to the finish does not stop.Music is a very important part of a film. I'm a lover of scores for films. I love listening to every soundtrack for nearly all blockbusters like this and many others as well. My only other complaint about this film is that to me the soundtrack is not that memorial. At times it is very good but I'd say for most of the film you will forget about the score and thus not leave the theater remembering anything about it.In closing this is a fantastic epic summer blockbuster that while at times can slow down is overall a must see epic joyride filled with amazing action scenes that you will leave remembering for some time. The IMAX 3D experience adds so much to the experience and simply waiting to watch this movie at home would be a mistake as the experience of the giant IMAX screen is amazing. 8/10","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The two scientist were the wrong actors for those roles and pulls my score down. In fact all of the characters were either miss- cast or poor generalizations of stereo types; even the bad guy wasn't that good at being bad.In any case, pick any a disaster flick, rename the characters and add some giant robots fighting Godzilla sized monsters. There ya go. Not much more too it. It's not on my top 100, but it's not in the bottom 100 either.

Than this is it, your not gonna find one that's better. As a fan of that genre and director Guillermo Del Toro I can say that you won't be disappointed. That being said the film does leave a little to be desired. It centers on pilots called Jaegars who are used to pilot the giant robot suits, two to a machine. To do so they must do something called drifting enabling them to tap into each others psyches so they can power the machine together one for the right and one for the left. it's an intriguing concept solidly executed but a little underdeveloped. Although it's a whole lot of fun and surprisingly more character driven than you'd expect. The character arcs don't reach the heights that you would hope for. And the finale feels a bit rushed and not as developed as you'd hope. Still the fight scenes are phenomenal and the movie is tailor made for IMAX 3D more so than any other film recently. Besides the exciting creatures and striking visuals there are an allotment of very attractive guys piloting this film Charlie Hunnam(sons of Anarchy), Diego Klattenhoff(TV's Homeland), Idris Elba (Obsessed), Charlie Day (It's always sunny in philadelphia), Max Martini (Revenge) and the delectable Robert Kazinski (True Blood Season 6) all looking very nice in Imax 3D.And as the sole female character Rinko Kikuchi(Babel) more than holds her own and her storyline is the most engaging of the characters. There's a fare bit of cheese mixed into the proceedings as well as an expected lot of typical genre clichés but Pacific Rim is a thrilling, original sci-fi, action film that needs to be seen on the big screen! 4/5","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Despite the huge scale of the fights and the scenes, it is very easy to keep up with the action, and follow what's happening, a testament to how well the movie was directed, shot and edited. It is very over the top, and cliché'd in places, but it's all the better for it. This is essentially a modern day B-movie, just with big budget, good screenplay and good directing. I found it very refreshing to watch a movie that for once, wasn't trying to be gritty and gloomy, and also wasn't just a re-hash of tired old ideas.

And after seeing it I can honestly say, it was very very average.The planet has been attacked by huge aliens, the only way we can fight them is by inventing massive robots.I know it's not much of a story line, but that is basically it. The story was very flat. There was no depth to the characters or the story itself. I thought it was actually quite boring.The film did have it's good moments though. The effects were amazing. The battle scenes were so good that I could not stop watching it. It was dark in places, but that didn't ruin the scenes. I thought the fighting was really well done. Also, the aliens looked awesome. They were very original looking and really looked horrible. I loved the way their mouths glowed blue. It really made them look good. Visually, it was an amazing film. It was a good looking movie.The movie starred Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day & Max Martini. I am sorry to say that nobody really did a great job on this. I am not saying that the actors were fully to blame for this, but the characters were not easy to play because they had no personality.This film is worth watching if you don't think about it. If you just want to watch giant monsters fighting giant robots and just want a bit of good looking fun, then it is worth watching but don't try and find a deep plot because you won't find one.I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it.I will give this film 5 out of 10.""We can either sit here and do nothing or grab those flare guns and do something really stupid.""For more reviews please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Released in 2013, this science fiction action film combines jaw-dropping visual effects with a compelling storyline to create a thrilling and memorable viewing experience.Set in a world where colossal creatures called Kaiju emerge from an interdimensional rift in the Pacific Ocean, humanity faces extinction. To counter this threat, nations unite to construct massive humanoid robots known as Jaegers, piloted by two individuals who share their thoughts through a neural link. The film centers on the last-ditch efforts of the Jaeger pilots, led by the troubled but determined Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and the talented Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), to save humanity from the relentless Kaiju.One of the standout features of ""Pacific Rim"" is its visual effects and design. The scale and detail of the Jaegers and Kaiju are breathtaking, immersing the audience in the colossal battles that unfold onscreen. The film's world-building is rich and imaginative, offering a glimpse into a future where humanity's survival hinges on these awe-inspiring war machines.The action sequences in ""Pacific Rim"" are nothing short of spectacular. The battles between the Jaegers and Kaiju are choreographed with precision and excitement. Del Toro's masterful direction keeps the pace brisk, and the sense of urgency never wanes. The film truly excels in capturing the sheer enormity of these epic confrontations.The character development in ""Pacific Rim"" is adequate, but the film's primary focus is on the action rather than deep character exploration. Nonetheless, Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi deliver solid performances, and their chemistry adds depth to the central relationship.One aspect that might leave some viewers wanting more is the backstory of the Kaiju and the mysterious rift. While the film hints at a more complex mythology, it leaves many questions unanswered, perhaps intentionally, to allow for potential future exploration.The supporting cast, including Idris Elba, Charlie Day, and Burn Gorman, provides comic relief and additional layers to the story. Elba, in particular, delivers a memorable performance as Stacker Pentecost, the stern but compassionate commander of the Jaeger program.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Which is great. This film is ALL about special effects, if your looking for anything else don't botherNot sure how this will look on a small screen, it's more of a 'cinema film'. So if you can't get to see it in the cinema, watch it round the house of which ever friend has the biggest TV.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Robots and Monsters says it all. Not to mention I want to make all the haters hate me for giving it such a high rating that I think it deserves.I will say this. If anyone avoids this movie solely based on another reviewer's or critics opinion is just naive. I will not try to say someone should or shouldn't avoid watching any film, because my opinion is mine based off of only my choice to like or dislike anything. With that said.I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't get a chance to see the film in theaters because there was a major family crisis. However I got to see the BluRay/DVD which I just picked up today. I was really entertained. It really was cool to see a giant monster movie again, it's cool to see a modern take on influences of Ray Harryhausen and Ishiro Honda and Mech Anime Some of the greatest influences of our time. Nothing like Duking it out Metal Vs. Monster. I also liked that it was a bit over the top and a movie like this should be. Not to mention it is kind of needed.I will not talk about the story, all I will say is. Make the decision for yourself, I recommend watching it even if for just a cheap 2 hour thrill. Make your own opinion about it.Was the story award winning worthy, hell no. It isn't supposed to be. Was the acting above and beyond no, because it isn't supposed to be. Albeit the visual effects were stunning and beautifully created, I think overall it is something a nerd like me can fully enjoy.I am not too crazy about overuse of CGI and any other forms of animation, but in a movie like this, there just isn't getting around that, especially when it is at this scale. For me this movie was a dream come true.I haven't seen a good monster movie(not counting Cloverfield)since King Kong, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and Godzilla. Those types of films paved the way for these types of movies and then you have the Anime element. The giant human operated mechanized robots or battle/mobile suits if you will. You enter that with a death match between battle suit vs. monster makes for a good action monster movie the whole family can enjoy.Another aspect is the profanity. There wasn't over use of profanity. And that gets my approval. I don't need gratuitous amounts of profanity and sex in movies for me to enjoy them. Profanity serves no purpose in the real world or movies, other than to sound like an unintelligent and uneducated moron. Sorry to those of you who sear up a storm, that's just my opinion.Back on topic, it is a good film and I highly recommend it if you haven't seen it. It is a film the whole family can enjoy. What ever you do, do not take someones word for it. Go in with an open mind and make an opinion of your own. Oh and don't forget to pop a bag of popcorn and have a nice cold soda at your side. If you have read all of this. I thank you for taking the time to do so and I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The plot of the film centers around Sea Creatures called Kaijus as they begin to wage war with Humanity but, Humans fight back a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge.That is what makes the film stand out is the original take on the genre.Casting wise they pick Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi and Ron Perlman to star in the film and they brought their characters to life and were the right choices to help give the film some credit instead of just being called ""Monster movie"". Guillermo del Toro did a superb job as the director of the film and actually shows how you can do a robot movie with justice to those who enjoy films about robots. He actually allow you to appreciate the talent of the filmThe film special effects are top notch everything is spared no expense with the visuals they are just wonderful and so well done it just out of this world how well they took the time to design every thing about the robots and monsters feature in the film that it will make the kid in you roar.To give it justice you have to watch for yourselfThe music is very well match it fits every scene in the film, the cast perform the best they could and brought attention to their charactersThe only drawback about Pacific Rim is that some characters you won't care for and that some of the film can feel let down Overall if you are a fan of Robot films or just curious about how this film plays out then I suggest watch the film for yourself and keep a open mind I give Pacific Rim an 8 out of 10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm sick of catching the ass end of that bridge scene with that 1st big monster, which is the unfortunate promise unkept in this movie, one of the grandest and richest unrealized promises, I think, in the history of motion pictures, especially when you factor in gems like the War of the Worlds, King Kong and Godzilla franchises, even the Roland Emmerich Godzilla. Del Toro really needs to try another version of this concept and get it right this time, with the big, scary simplicity that bridge scene promised the first time, but this time delivering us a movie worth watching, with some Joy Luck Club heat in the apocalyptic backdrop of those monsters taking over the world, with not one of those stupid assed robots in sight.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's what most people like, and this movie got it all.I didn't know much about this film before I started to watch it, just that there were giant robots in it. Since I watched Robot Jox back in the day (can't believe its score here is less than 5!!), I've always thought that somebody should make a mecha film, and never really understood why it wasn't happening. The beginning of this movie is just like that, it gave me an enormous feeling of being watching Robot Jox again: the acting, the dialogue, the music, the atmosphere... it all reminded me of it. Then, it started to remind me of other movies as well: Godzilla, Evangelion, and even HellBoy. This is particularly interesting: the mood of the movie, like some sort of comic book rather than a live action, reminded me incredibly of HellBoy. Then, I saw Santiago Segura (which gave me a funny surprise) and, after the appearance of Ron Perlman, I knew this movie had something to do with Guillermo Del Toro. I swear I didn't have a clue who the director was, but these points were unmistakable. The end credits confirmed my suspicion. Now, this says a lot about Del Toro, since he can give his particular touch to anything, apparently. However, it also says how predictable and clichéd his movies are. Because, unfortunately, the points that made me think of this director even before I knew it was him behind the camera, are the same points that make me think of this movie as a worthless piece of cinematography. The same jokes, the adolescence feeling... It's a pity that Del Toro has to be linked to these characteristics, rather than other details that shined with originality in some of their other movies like Pan's Labyrinth or The Devil's Backbone. Oh, speaking of predictability, after 33 min into the movie, you will know how it will be ending. Seriously. After 1 hour, you may even be able to predict what will happen in the next scene.Pacific Rim is the shallowest of movies. The whole point of it being simply using all and any instruments at the director's disposition to aid the showing off of hits, punches and so-called cool dialogue lines (nothing more than rancid clichés). The plot itself has sooooo many holes in it, each one of them the size of one of those giant robots. It's pointless to discuss them. This movie doesn't make any sense whatsoever. It's a flick to be enjoyed by people who has the capacity of leaving their minds blank (or who actually HAVE minds like that). For Pete's sake, we even get a harangue! Pacific Rim made me feel the same as HellBoy 2 did: it seems a potpourri of this and that movie, these and those animated series, of rancid clichés and surrender-it-all to a grandiose FX's show of explosions and destruction. Is Del Toro becoming a new Michael Bay? I really hope not.Alas, once again, IMDb's rating will be deceiving for an audience who expects more than absurd plots and puberty's amusements. I would have enjoyed this 20 years ago, maybe. Like I did enjoy Robot Jox then. Now, I can only see another piece for the children at heart (and mind).","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Awful - even for a no-brains Blockbuster","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2888372/?ref_=tt_urv","Sundance-A-Kid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24174583/?ref_=tt_urv","17 October 2013","What the hell was that? I'm as much a fan of sitting back and enjoying some popcorn- style, CGI-induced mayhem as anyone but this was truly awful. With someone like Del Toro at the helm you expect at least a little bit in the way of sympathetic, fun characters you can care about - but someone got in the way of allowing him to exercise any of his Hell Boy wit or sense of magic and wonder. It's like a bad version of a Michael Bay film(which is really saying something). Like the producers had a mission: to be bigger, better and louder than Bay. The result being that the actors out-overact Bay's actors with the unfortunate disadvantage of not having the acting chops to pull it off. Every scene is strained and over-elaborate, just like in Bay films, but even more so. It veers into farce and ridiculous melodrama, devoid of sentiment and involvement. How anyone can care about any of the characters is beyond me - whatever depth they've been given is quashed with every shouty, fake-teary-eyed confrontation that take up surprisingly and unnecessarily long swathes of the epic running time. Don't get me wrong - every film of this nature has the same predictability and cliché- ridden plot structure and character arcs. But Shia Lebeouf is capable of eliciting sympathy and the odd smile and Pirates has Johnny Depp and Armageddon has Bruce Willis shedding a tear. Pacific Rim has a B-list cast who lack charisma and most importantly they lack joy, wit, fun. Transformers had John Turturro and John Malkovich as comic relief instead of two pastiche, pseudo-comedian, cabaret revue 'actors' doing one of those duo acts where no one in the audience is laughing or paying attention except for when it's their turn to throw rotten fruit. The science duo are not just palpitations-inducingly annoying but they also get reels and reels of screen time - managing to be more nauseating than Jar-jar in the process. The main character acts and looks like a cheap version of Channing Tatum or Josh Hartnett and his Japanese side-kick spends the whole movie in tears. Idris Elba and Ron Perlman are the only characters with any kind of gravitas but are sadly lost in a sea of melodramatic absurdity. Now - obviously this film is all about Giant Robots vs. Giant Aliens so the above should be totally irrelevant. So why spend such an inordinate amount of time developing these rice paper thin characters? I don't care about plot holes and over- long exposition scenes in these kind of films - it's part of it. But if the film decides to have a lengthy story between relatively short mega-action set pieces then give them a worthy script and cast some decent actors. Also, make us excited about finally seeing these beasts and these magnificent machines fighting it out instead of showing us everything in the exposition intro. One of the great aspects of these films is the way the director gets to slowly build towards the mayhem. Here we are in it from the beginning - like it's normal. Massive oversight. And for God's sake don't set the final fight in an environment where the scale of the beasts and robots are rendered entirely irrelevant. Reminded me of Ang Lee's Hulk. Wrong part of the film to play it safe. Look to Avengers and the latest Transformers for how to massively up the ante for the final battle. I expected Battleship to be terrible but watchable - it was. I expected this to be ridiculous - it was. But not in the way it should have been. It should have been ridiculously fun but instead had us sit through a masterclass in poor scripting and acting with far too little of the thing that was written on the tin.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie is much more focused on the human characters, and less focused on monster fighting action. I would not have a problem with that at all, but if you are going to have a character driven story, you need to actually DEVELOP YOUR CHARACTERS. Characters need an arc, they need to be fleshed out and actually grow through the movie, so that we as an audience grow with them and care about them. In this movie, the characters are just cardboard cutouts, none of them are any different at the end than they are at the beginning. Pacific Rim, a movie which this is obviously compared to, is widely criticized for its lame story and characters. But the characters in Pacific Rim actually are developed and fleshed out, even if the developments are cliché. Mako overcomes her childhood fears, Raliegh overcomes his brother's death, the scientists who are normally adversarial start to work together, etc. The developments were mostly shallow, but the characters were not the focus of the movie, the focus was the action between the robots and kaiju.In what ways does any character in Godzilla actually grow? Ford thought his dad was crazy, but found out he wasn't... OK. He loves his family and wants to get home. eventually he does... great. Olsen's character loves her husband and son, good for her. The only one having anything approaching a character arc is Cranston's character, but that ends quickly. Do any of these characters learn anything or grow emotionally through out the story? I didn't see it. If you are going to do a character driven drama, you need to actually have real characters. And since they didn't all we have is a 2 hour long movie with about 15 minutes of anything interesting happening.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The plot revolves around the Earth which is under attacked with more frequency by massive and aggressively violent alien beast creatures that have entered Earth through the Pacific Rim portal in the Earth's core. Humans have tried to battle them back through a skyscraper tall robot machine that is controlled by two humans. The humans are ""drifting"" mentally together through the brain to better maneuver the robot. Why are these alien beasts attacking Earth and as opposed to the movie ""Don't Look Up"" will humans work together to stop their looming extinction? Overall, this was entertaining with a fun concept with creative beasts and robots, good tension and they didn't half-ass the character development. The special effects were well-done and they did a great job of illustrating the scale of things in the movie.

I grew up with Transformers and Voltron, robots and monsters, dinosaurs and aliens - so 'Pacific Rim', to me, was going to be fun. If I had watched it without sound, I would have loved it. Sure, CGI is at a point now where anything is possible, and the majority of CGI work now is great, but watch the movie with sound, and become bitterly disappointed.I'm Australian, so when foreigners try to act Australian, I watch (well listen) closely. The Aussie accents were bad. Atrocious to be honest. They were over-done, and forced, like most of the acting throughout the movie.Why the Australian father/son team had a British bulldog, I'll never know. Surely a Kelpie would be more appropriate? Many reviews here pan the two scientists we see on their own quests to understand the Kaiju and ultimate eliminate them. One, a Rick Moranis wanna-be is both annoying, yet entertaining. He's hypo, lively, active and quick, so stands out from the other dull performances given by the rest of the cast. I've read other reviews here and agree totally with those who ask why and how about various plot holes through which the Kaiji themselves could fly. So I add nothing new to add. But I do agree.It really is a movie for kids, despite the fighting, the death and the badly-acted emotional sub-plots. But at least they'll enjoy the robots and monsters at the innocent child-like level I was hoping to. Sure I went in wanting to be a 10 year old again, but being almost 40 made me see the movie as a professional product from Hollywood, and at that, I was disappointed.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This film has to be seen first by the person who reads this review and then he can judge for himself.First of all we take a look at the director Guillermo del Toro who has made such successful films like Hellboy (2004), its sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008), Mimic(1997), The Devil's Backbone (2001) and Pan's Labyrinth (2006), and more mainstream American action movies, such as the vampire superhero action film Blade II (2002). You can expect only the best in the special effects and sound-effects department. The cast is also equally good. All the actors act naturally and set the mood for the film. The script is very effective - there is never a dull moment in the film. I particularly liked the role of Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost. Other notable actors are Ron Perlman of Hellboy fame and Santiago Segura who played the fiendish vampire named Rush in Blade 2, Charlie Day and Burn Gorman. The hero and heroine of the film are played by Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket and Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori.Plot of film: a rift opens in the floor of the Pacific ocean in 2013, revealing a portal that connects between the earth and another dimension far across the universe. Through this rift Kaijus, colossal alien beasts which attack the human cities, come. To combat them the Pacific Rim nations build the Jaegers, equally colossal robotic war machines. Each Jaeger is piloted by two people whose brains are linked (called ""drifting"") to share the mental load of operating the machine. The Jaegers are initially effective, but many are destroyed as the Kaijus grow more powerful and their attacks more frequent. Finally humanity on the brink of extinction must make a final attempt to stop the aliens for good.Verdict: by all means buy this film if you can afford it and watch it at home on your LED TV. This film is value for money if seen at your local cineplex. Films you might also enjoy: Nemesis(1992), Robot Jox (1989), Aliens(1986), Tremors(1990), Independence Day (1996).","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Maybe the anime roots of the storyline are to blame, but I can really not stomach the ""hero loses someone close to him"", ""hero overcomes the adversity"", ""hero gets the girl"", ""hero saves the world"", etc. themes in this movie. It's a cliché after cliché and if it were done at least as a tongue-in-cheek adaptation, it would be worth something.I really liked Charlie Hunnam in Sons of Anarchy and Green Street Hooligans, but he is HORRIBLE in this movie. Every time he said or did something in the movie, it came across forced, fake and simply unbelievably bad.The FAKE Aussie accent of the Hansens' characters is abominable. I think Idris Elba is one redeeming thing about this movie (acting wise). He and Ron Perlman make the movie bearable to watch. Ron btw doesn't even need to say any lines, he has a presence on the screen that itself can change the atmosphere of the whole movie.In conclusion: I will most likely forget this movie very soon. 5 stars for Idris, Ron, awesome robots and CGI.

Monstrous creatures known as Kaiju start coming through the fissure and attacking mankind. Realising that current weaponry isn't effective in bringing a Kaiju down quickly enough, humans work together to come up with new technology to defeat the creatures. This technology comes in the shape of Jaegers...giant robot-like war machines. When the attacks start happening more frequently, a plan to close the tear is devised but this brings about it's own obvious risks. However, it's either that, or the world will be destroyed.Pacific Rim is an absolute feast for the eyes as it's a truly amazing film for special/visual effects. As a feast for the brain, however....not so much, because when you take away the superb visuals and fight scenes you have a pretty lame film.Now, I know films like this generally don't have Oscar winning story lines, but sometimes there's something there to keep you interested other than the amazing effects. Not here though, and this is a classic example of movie makers relying more on gorgeous effects than story to win audiences over.The acting - especially by Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket - is nothing to write home about either and is very cringeworthy at times. It's not just limited to him, though, as a good few of the other main stars' acting is pretty dire.Also, as I watched the movie, I saw a good few storyline similarities to Independence Day. I can't say anything without spoiling the movie, and you may well think ""how the hell do you figure that out?"", but after watching it you'll see the similarities between the two. I'm not saying Pacific Rim's a rip-off, but originality goes out the window in this movie too, so to couple that with bad acting and a lame story, you have a very mediocre popcorn action/sci-fi flick...even with all the amazing visuals.Not bad, but definitely not that good either.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

When I discovered what Pacific Rim was about, I instantly thought ""well, here we go again with another Transformers film but with monsters instead"". However, Guillermo del Toro was the director, so I had to give it a chance. Thankfully, I was extremely surprised! The main characters are well-developed, each one has a powerful and emotional backstory, plus distinct personalities. Idris Elba is a freaking badass, but the standout of the movie is Rinko Kikuchi. She is incredible and her range of expressions is astounding. Excellent work from Rinko, who elevated her already well-written character. Charlie Hunnam gets a lot of scrutiny from critics, but I usually stand on his side. However, even though he isn't bad, I didn't feel the emotions that he was supposed to transmit in more compelling moments. He doesn't bring the film down, but he also doesn't elevate it.The story is actually captivating (it even carries some twists that change the course of action) and the action is visually jaw-dropping. I mean, there are Godzilla-like monsters fighting better-designed Transformers and most importantly, del Toro is at the command. Even if he is more used to work with prosthetics, he nails the CGI. Additionally, most of the action is set on water which is known to be a very harsh environment to film decent action. Everything is seamless and there are genuinely creative sequences that left me in awe.The editing is great and the score is very cool. I love the movie's pacing, it never gets boring when there isn't a fight due to the interesting characters. Their dialogues are meaningful and the consequences of the destruction feel realistic. del Toro's world-building skills are phenomenal, he focused on creating a world where monsters and machines could exist without making it sound forced or stupid. He didn't worry about producing a franchise, he just tried to make a good standalone film and I think he even surprised himself with the final product.Nevertheless, it does have its flaws. While the main characters are remarkable, there are a couple of secondary characters who are extremely annoying. One is always screaming instead of just talking while the other is an exaggerated version of a stereotypical British person. They are even more frustrating because they are linked to an important part of the plot, hence a bigger chunk of screentime with these two. It breaks the tone since we quickly change from a serious moment to a cartoon comedy.Even though it doesn't feel slow at all, there is a gap between the first fight and the second one that I think is too long. An action-packed 20min go to 40min with pretty much no action whatsoever. Finally, del Toro uses an excess of exposition. The first act is full of narration and everything is just thrown at us. I got to a point where I actually thought ""is this guy still narrating after 15min?"". All in all, I had a blast with Pacific Rim! It makes me think how Transformers would be like if they were directed by someone more competent. Guillermo del Toro makes the most of his nack for visually stunning action and his world-building skills are intact, as the well-written characters dive in a surprisingly interesting screenplay.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The script is fairly predictable, with the acting somewhat flat and derivative.But if you do like any of the aforementioned genres, what we have here is a film that is literally big on action, scale, effects and sci fi, and genuinely unique. It is not a sequel; does not get bogged down by officially borrowing source material from any previous book, series or lore (other than it's similarities with Manga Neon Genesis Envangelion). In a golden year of original sci-fi movies, this one stands out as being a true piece of entertainment.The battles are impressive, with skyscraper tall robots fighting monsters. The key thing with these fights is that the sense of scale is brilliantly conveyed to the audience. Powerful yet lumbering, something that the increasingly poor Transformers films failed to provide in their fast blur robot battles.SO the script is predictable, but who cares? The point of this sort of film, is to entertain for a couple of hours. Which this does. If the script and acting was tighter, I would have given this film top marks.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Almost every scene with no kaiju in it is painfully bad. No characters, no dialogs, no ideas. Everything is so corny it's just pure irritation to watch. The characters are so unrelatable I could not care less for what was going on. A suicide to save the world? Whatever... And that part with a sword in space just blew my mind.

Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) joins an elite corps of fighters gathered from around the globe to combat the menace. But will the strength, cooperation and scientific genius of all mankind be enough to triumph over this monstrous invasion?Oscar Award-winning Director-writer Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, The Hellboy Series, The Blade Series) teams up with writer Travis Beacham to deliver a surprisingly successful mix of humor, spectacle, nostalgia and action in this underrated classic. Del Toro's fantasy of gigantic robots and terrifying monsters does not require mass acceptance and universal acclaim - 
in fact, his derivative opus is so well executed that it transcends its intended genre of science fiction and approaches the canon of high cinematic art. From well-written screenplay to rich thespian talent to mind-bogglingly realistic CGI effects, Pacific Rim goes well-beyond anything previously achieved with regard to the monster-movie genre. Hunnam is perfectly cast as the anti-hero Raleigh, a man who would rather be doing anything than taking orders, but proves to be a powerful warrior when challenged. Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost is perfectly cast as an unmovable foil to Raleigh's hot-headed ambitions, while Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori provides a romantic interest which strikes a balance between the two 
powerful characters.Monster movies have come a long way since Godzilla (1954), but the genre persists partly because of our child-like fascination with size and our fear of the unknown. Pacific Rim takes the genre further than ever before imagined by making its monsters bigger, more powerful and more intelligent, all while raising the production value of the movie to incredible standards, melding together talent, craft and skill to create a movie unlike any monster film before it.Special effects, talent and cinematography notwithstanding, writer-director Guillermo del Toro has masterfully delivered a must-see monster-movie-event in Pacific Rim (2013), and as many movie goers have come to find out, the best is yet to come.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Its a world in its own right. Del Toro has shown us before how capable he is at building fictional worlds in his pictures, but this one just might be his very best.The colors, designs, audio and visual effects are wonderful and they combine perfectly to form something that will stay in your memory long after you leave the theater.The characters are a bit different then your usual fare for summer blockbuster. They aren't sarcastic, they aren't fast talking, action savy smarties who sound like they fell out of the Joss Whedon show. They are very contained, without overblown personalities and quirks (except the scientists duo and the Ron Perlman character), who feel very humane, vulnerable and likable without forcing it down your throat.The story is here only as a carrier for action and characters, its simply serviceable, not extraordinary in any way or form. You might even call it bad in its essence, but nobody expects Shawshank Redemption in this kind of a flick. Compared to other summer blockbusters it falls right into middle. Nothing good, nothing bad, just serviceable.The action is where its at. The first scene gives us a lengthy ""suit up"" sequence where we are introduced to the world of Pacific Rim and its own techno visual language. It is followed by a fight scene amidst raging seas under lightning lit night sky. Its breathtaking, everything feels weighty and larger then life. Its a brilliant introduction, without too much sizzle and more then enough steak.In conclusion Pacific Rim is the definition of summer blockbuster in its most purest form. Its fun, its showy, but it doesn't bombard you with pop culture references or annoying characters that are supposed to be forcefully charming. I predict a cult status for this movie in the following years.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sure it's not a ""2001 a space odyssey"" if that's what you're expecting but it is a masterpiece in of itself.Guillermo del Toro the director of the film has done a wonderful job of making sure that Pacific Rim doesn't become a mindless action film which bombards the audience with CGI and eye candy like the ""Transformers"" series nor does it focus too much on the drama or human aspects of the film like the movie ""Godzilla"" does. A perfect balance has been stricken and there is a little bit of something for people of all age groups and hence everyone goes home happy.The movie starts by explaining about an inter-dimensional hole that has erupted in the Pacific Ocean called the ""breach"" (hence the name Pacific Rim) through which giant monsters called ""Kaiju"" come to our world and wreak havoc. Unable to defeat the Kaiju through traditional means, giant robots called jaegers are created to fight them. These jaegers have to be operated by two people as one person cannot handle the ""neural load"". The pilots need to have a good rapport or be ""drift compatible"" as the movie calls it. The pilots get access to each other's feeling, thoughts, memories etc. including their fears and anxieties; hence they have to work harmoniously lest either one of them succumb to their insecurities and get both the pilots killed. As it turns out more and more kaiju keep coming from the ""breach"" and they keep evolving and adapting and the military just can't keep up. As the plot progresses we come to understand that these kaiju attacks are not as random as they had initially thought. How our protagonist's deal with this problem permanently forms the climax of the film. The actors have done a brilliant job and we can literally sense their desperation as they happen to be Humanity's last resistance against these alien monsters. As unearthly as the plot sounds the actors dedication to their respective characters gives this film its ""realistic"" tone. All in all I'd conclude by saying that Pacific Rim is a must watch and truly happens to be a cinematic masterpiece.

The fights between the giant monsters and robots are awesome and the clear highlights of this movie. There is not really anything more I can really say about that. The other parts between the awesome fight scenes are not on the same level but are not bad. The plot is simple, gigantic monsters comes from an other dimension and ruins everything for us nice human beings and all of humanity comes together to stop the giant monsters from horribly murder us all by making giant robots. The story is a bit of a mess because there isn't much that makes sense and they do not really take time to explain anything and it reaches a level of so much doesn't make sense that it bothers me. Things like two people are needed to control the robots are good plot points but doesn't make any sense at all.One thing I loved about the movie is that it is international. The characters are from all over the world and small things like the giant robots are called Jägers and the monsters Kajju makes me smile a bit. Loads of smaller details like that and more makes the movie unique. Details in the movie like how the world adapts to the threat of giant monsters, the Aussies dog mascot and the black market for giant monster body parts just says to me that they put a lot of thought into it when they made the movie.The Characters are good. Not incredible, not great, but above what you usually see in action movies. All main characters are in some way flawed and has problems they have to overcome. The only characters that bothered me was the scientists who were really annoying and could have been done better.Even if the movie has several flaws, it is an original and a great action movie. It doesn't have any depth like the dark knight but was really entertaining and I do not regret watching it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The music was powerful and had a theme throughout and it fit with it all brilliantly. It is oozing style and enthusiasm and feeling.The plot is simplistic, silly, dumb and stupid but I just don't care, that is small compared to the rest of the elements that make up this living breathing kaiju of a movie. This movie has so much heart and soul flowing through it.I love this type of science fiction movie, where our very existence is threatened and we must unite as a race against a common enemy, usually aliens to even survive.And the films like this always do the hard bit so easy. We Unite just like that. But, don't you see? Then, and only then are we a race worthy of survival, that is the key message in Pacific Rim. That we will fail as a race of beings if we do not Unite.The special effects and sound in the film are amazing, the 3D is brilliant.There are really strong messages in Pacific Rim about the importance of father figures. Also about sacrifice. I think Guillermo really ""gets it"" you know what I mean?Pacific Rim 8 out of 10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I want to start with the positive aspects: The visuals are just breathtaking. Every second there was action I found myself scanning the screen as fast as I can to notice how they rendered the CGI and put together the visuals. One of the best eye-candies that my brain has witnessed recently. But this is how I mostly spent my two hours at the cinema, caring about pretty much nothing else about the movie. This takes us to the negative side of my review: The acting, the story, the part when you bite down the cake and the bits that hit your palate is so cheesy and done so many times, I kept thinking during the movie if I could ever stand to see another Hollywood movie in my life again. The dialogues, the predictable tear-jerking moments, pep-talks, plot progress, characters, cute elements that make the audience go ""aww"", everything was there in the most cheesy and kitsch way possible. I could just not believe Del Toro would come up with such ""Teen-oriented"" action in this way. But this might be my problem, as the director himself said that the movie should not be taken ""realistically"". Yes, I am aware that it is a sci-fi fantasy action movie where it should be viewed with an open mind with imagination, but the holes in the plot just put the movie in the awkward grey area where the scenes sometimes just feel like they've been glued together and manipulated to have it ""by the Hollywood book""! I won't give any spoilers but you'll hear some dialogues that are clearly put there to add excitement and suspense, and the next scene you'll see some actions completely disproving previous statements. All in all I enjoyed the movie very much visually, but the intellectually questionable aspects of the plot really stripped the movie of the complete fun that I could've gotten out of it. You should go see it definitely, but just prepare to experience it with a teenager perspective.To enjoy Pacific Rim fully, just have an open mind. Actually, I'd like to rephrase that: Keep your ""Eyes"" open, and your mind a little closed!","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

This movie is packed with non stop action and testosterone. If you're a Sci-Fi fan expecting to see a Sci-Fi movie, it is essentially devoid of science. It is basically mindless, mind numbing, loud, constant explosions and destruction. It makes humans look so stupid and ridiculous, I found myself almost wanting humans to lose, and believe me, the alien protagonists do not inspire sympathy. It is nearly 100% CG, 100% destruction, and 10% story. The acting is well enough but, again, this movie was written and directed for the immature, and teenage boys and those sexually aroused by weaponry and war. The 5 second back story of the aliens was only established as an excuse to show ginormous robots to fight hand to hand combat on a giant scale. And god forbid aliens ever visit and see our movies like this, because they would almost certainly declare humans a lost cause. And rightfully so.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The main issue I had with this film had to do with its story and character development. I really didn't care for any of these characters and thought that the performances were pretty weak as well. The film relies entirely on the great visuals and awesome action scenes. This is what the Transformers action scenes should have looked like because the action scenes were great and the editing was done real smoothly (unlike in the Transformers franchise where there is so much editing during the action sequences that it is hard to follow). Fans of monster movies will really enjoy Pacific Rim because del Toro knows his craft, but if you are looking for a great storyline then you will be left disappointed like I was. Guillermo del Toro pays homage to those giant monster movies the Japanese started making several decades ago and it is sort of a love letter to them. Pacific Rim is visually stylish and it has some great monster and robot sequences, but there is hardly no humanity in this film despite it trying to with all the flashbacks and neural bridges mind blending scenes. It tries to illustrate the point of having humanity teaming up together to defeat these monsters, but I really didn't feel it and that is one of the main reasons why I didn't like this film. Despite the cool action scenes I felt the movie was dragging too much and it got more and more tedious as it moved on. I was disappointed with Pacific Rim and would much rather watch Hellboy over this.Mankind has always looked to the stars for possible life forms, but what they didn't know was that it would come from the deep ocean. Monstrous creatures named Kaijus came through a portal from the bottom of the ocean and began destroying everything that was on their path. In order to stop them humans had to build these giant robots known as Jaegers. The Jaegers are controlled from within by two pilots who have their minds connected through a neural bridge; one pilot controls the left hemisphere of the robot and the other the right. The Jaegers are highly successful at first as they defeat the Kaijus and the pilots become the new superheroes, but as the years go by these Kaijus begin to adapt and come out even stronger than before. The Jaegers are beginning to be defeated and humanity is forced to build giant walls to try to keep these creatures away. However Marshall Stacker (Idris Elba) knows that the walls won't hold so he decides to create a resistance with four powerful Jaegers. He calls upon a former pilot named Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) to team up with rookie Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). Along with another group of pilots these four Jaegers remain humanity's last hope for survival. Charlie Day and Burn Gornman play two scientists who are studying a way to counterattack the Kaijus. The lead performances from Hunnam and Kikuchi are pretty weak for an action movie. I really never felt chemistry between them and was disappointed with their performances. Idris Elba is a great actor, but I never felt connected to his character either. The rest of the pilots didn't have a backstory or anything that allowed us to care for them either. The two scientist were mostly added for comedic relief and I wasn't very impressed. My favorite performance came from Ron Perlman (Hellboy), an underground lord who trafficked dead Kaiju body parts. He had a very small role, but I thought those scenes were the most interesting ones of the movie. I liked the action scenes, but they get tiresome after a while and I needed to care more for the characters in order to enjoy this more. Pacific Rim is just too ridiculous and it suffers from a weak screenplay. It is a very noisy film with no character development whatsoever. Pacific Rim is one of Guillermo del Toro's weakest films to date (along with Pan's Labyrinth which is way overrated).","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

In the past, he was best known for his pair of Hellboy movies and the masterful Pan's Labyrinth. However, the former were kind of like buddy cop movies crossed with Lord of the Rings, while the latter was an intimate, character driven fantasy and coming-of-age film. In his entire career, Del Toro has never made anything like this. The premise is simple: gargantuan, extradimensional monsters are laying waste to the world's coastal population centers. To fight back, humanity creates equally large robots to push the beasts back. It really doesn't get much more basic than than that. Clearly, this is not a film meant to be analyzed or possess some deeper meaning. All it is - and all it delivers - are old-school thrills meant to fulfill a 12-year-old's greatest fantasy. As such, the characters are strictly one-dimensional, caricatures copied and pasted from a thousand other movies. While some may find this off-putting, keep in mind that the characters are not the focus of the film. That position belongs to the robots, monsters, and scenes involving robots fighting monsters. And to that end, this film is an unqualified success.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was the great new franchise that would have everybody wearing PR t-shirts and buying PR toys. In Asia, probably yes. I really think I gave this film a fair chance at wowing me. And it did for the first 30 minutes or so. The imagery was fantastic, as in Grand Canyon fantastic. Then it was a long, long, touchy feely group exercise with our young cadets. Many people I'm sure will harken back to 1997's Starship Troopers when watching scenes of rivalry between soldiers. All I could think of as these scenes dragged on was how much more edgy director Verhoeven was with similar scenes, and thus far more interesting.Afterwards, I'm surprised how Del Toro, the director of Pan's Labyrinth, does not make a film like this without being edgy? I think it is that element that prevents this film from appealing to adult audiences. Certainly there is 'grit' in the production design. But all the gouges and chipped paint everywhere was actually a bit too distracting as well. For a military operation, they have no regard whatsoever in the upkeep of their facilities and machines. I certainly can give credit to Del Toro for doing a great job on his first big budget summer tentpole.But now I will go on about the obvious decision to mask the quality of the effects by having each and every monster vs robot battle take place at night and in the rain. The reason is the same as 1998's Godzilla. Because to sell the size of these 8 story tall creatures, they had to be able to blend in with their surroundings. Since the effects apparently weren't good enough, they get shrouded in murky rainy scenes. Another major aspect to this robot warrior world is the need for the two drivers to psychically link to each other by experiencing each other's traumatic memories (?!). I know what the intention was, to make this a more Avatar-like world where your 'spirit' world must be linked to your physical world. But really, is driving an oversized tank much harder than say, flying a commercial airliner in the near future?Eventually this kind of story manipulation to get the backstory and weaknesses of each character spelled out failed to get me excited. It started to feel more by-the-numbers screen writing, a complaint I had with Star Trek: Into Darkness. But I was encouraged by the fact that this was not a sequel, and Del Toro is a far more respectable director than Michael Bay. The best feeling I got from this mess was that I would love for Del Toro to direct one of the new Star Wars films. Not that Abrams would do a bad job, but Del Toro brings a dark element (in a disturbed kind of way) to his work. In PR the only hint you get of that is the side character played by Hellboy's Ron Perlman.I hope this plays well with a younger audience, I just had really nothing to attach to with this world. The big robots were OK, but the fight scenes were not satisfying at all. The monsters were too undefined. What's the exact difference between a 4 and a 5 monster? Those kind of details would be interesting to us adults.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

And when adding the ingredients of eye-feasting special effects, a solid plot, and Guillermo Del Toro's cutting-edge visual compulsion, your final product is an explosively entertaining thrill ride that works in more ways than one. Guillermo Del Toro, the man who gifted us with cinematic hits such as 'Pan's Labyrinth', 'Hellboy' and its sequel, knows how to keep things and does so in many ways many directors of both of the action and sci-fi genre neglect nowadays. And that is establishing a firmly even balance of explosive action set pieces and visual integrity while not letting lose on the film's narrative standpoint. His vision of giant robots battling toe-to-toe against a hideous Godzilla-like monsters work in a way that allows moviegoers to admire his dazzling directorial style while shoving popcorn in their mouths as the explosive scenery that fires on screen. There is a lot to be experienced from witnessing the major cities crumbled on a grand scale in the heat of a battle between two giant monsters fighting head-to-head, more so than just watching things go BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! This film centers around a world between the human race and an enormous alien creature known as the Kaiju who has launched an invasion that has devastated millions of lives across the lives. With mankind on the brink of extinction, its last line of defense comes at the hands of former pilot Raleigh Becket (played by Charlie Hunnam) and an inexperience pilot Maki Mori (played by Rinko Kikuchi) who arm themselves inside a giant mechanical mecha known as the Jaeger in attempt to defeat the Kaiju, with Marshal Stacker Pentecost (played by Idris Alba) in command. Unlike filmmakers like Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich, Guillermo Del Toro doesn't believe in soaking the audiences with explosive shock and awe factor with cutting-edge special effects, he also injects a heart the midst of the action. This includes blessing the characters with an arc and supporting the action with a story that firmly makes sense. In return, the film holds a gift with more than an escapist action extravaganza. Over his past works, Del Toro boasted an solid visual methodology that can only be described as unforgettable, and his style makes his return back here, only without the macabre sort of look demonstrated in 'Pan's Labyrinth'. The main military base where all the non-action takes place is beautiful look at, sporting a dazzling futuristic look. But, unsurprisingly, it is the sequences in which the two main characters Raleigh and Mako step into the Jaegers and battle against the Kaiju that marks the film's peaks. The big action sequence surrounding the destruction of downtown Hong Kong is electrifying and makes for a nice treat for the action junkies to snack on. Building exploding and disintegrating into a million pieces, what is there not to be fond about? And it is thanks to cinematographer Guillermo Navarro who captures the action with stellar integrity and not with the vexing quick cuts and shaky cam to obscure the heat of the action. Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi on the other hand, turn in some okay performances. But they are definitely no match for Idris Alba who stands with not only at the best performance in the crowd but the most solid character arc. Hunman and Kikuchi, however, are at least more tolerable than Charlie Day as the spastic scientist showers who's jittery behavior grows less an less funny as the film goes on, and Ron Perlman who serves as the supporting comic relief but is given very little to do. It comes show though, that not everyone is in for the gold. Pacific Rim is a thrillingly entertaining sci-fi action vehicle helmed by the intriguing directorial efforts of Guillermo Del Toro and his gift for visual spectacle and patent for feeding the audiences for an engaging collage of special-effects action with a heart and soul.

Enter 2 new characters- supposed to be funny but try hards and it really didn't work with a mash of bad accents, big egos and badly played 'geeks'. My way of describing this film is transformers meets power rangers with a stereotypical cast and cliché script. It had the potential for so much, and i found myself willing it do so much better but i found myself being annoyed by so much! I just have no idea how it has managed such a high score on IMDb?!","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

While that is meant in a good way, I think Pacific Rim is a smart action spectacle. While there is nonstop action and heavy special effects present at all times, this film has more of a complicated story and a more proved(and well-liked)director than Transformers. The concept of giant robots fighting these gigantic monsters really intrigued me. It's not all perfect since some fights drag on, especially in the last half, but it's an entertaining, well-written summer spectacle.Guillermo Del Toro's film is about how humankind tries to stave off extinction from these colossal monsters named Kaijus who appeared from a portal in the Pacific Ocean. The humans create these Jaegars or mecha robots to fight these robots. When things hit rock-bottom, the world must rely on a washed-up former pilot named Raleigh to save the day.This film doesn't have a big-name cast, but they get the job done. Relative newcomer Charlie Hunnam does a really good job as Raleigh the guy who has an emotional past as a pilot. Idris Elba was fantastic as Raleigh's superior, Stacker Pentecost. I was really surprised at Rinko Kikuchi's performance because I only know her from Babel and this is a complete turnaround. But she does an excellent job as the girl who uses her fury at these monsters to destroy them. Finally, Ron Perlman does a great job in his few scenes. That man can be pretty funny at times.Overall, Pacific Rim is a gorgeous movie to look at and the visuals are spectacular. Unlike the Transformers films, this film has a purposeful story and it's more layered than one would expect. On the outside, it looks like another movie about robots, but on the inside it's about comradeship, family, and believing in another. This is a rather unique taste on telling the story about the apocalypse. While the action is excellent, some of the scenes could be more toned. Also, this film closely resembles 1998's Godzilla monster-wise, although it's much better than that train wreck. I had a good time thanks to Guillermo Del Toro. I rate this film 8/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Anyway yeah Pacific Rim, it's a strange one. I went in thinking this was gonna be the anti-Transformers, making sense and having a soul and in some ways it delivers but in others it just doesn't cut it.I'm starting to think the internet has ruined movies for me, people are so quick to point out the minutest flaws in any movie that you end up looking for them. But this has flaws.The plot for starters wouldn't be out of place in a mid 90's computer game and I'm not spoiling anything to reveal this as it's in the first 30 seconds of the film. The story is that there are monsters coming out of the earth called Kaiju, and to tackle these mankind built huge manned robots named Jaeger's. And the movie basically consists of giant battles punctuated with tacky dialogue and questionable acting.The positives of the movie are obviously the design and look, which are at times spectacular. The robots are fleshed out and given enough appreciation to see them as a character, and Guillermo Del Toro takes time to show you how they work, unlike Transoformers which has two giant piles of indistinct silver hitting each other.The CGI overall is amazing and the design as always with Guillermo Del Toro is delicious. But the problems with the movie however are with the script, I think maybe the movie was trying to engage a younger audience more as the acting and dialogue are at times incredibly tacky and contrived. The plot is by the numbers all the way through and features a collection of wooden characters, and also features a series of plot points which don't make a lot of senses when looked at a little deeper.Overall not my cup of tea, some impressive touches and the battles are fun but didn't satisfy my intellect remotely and left me feeling a bit indifferent towards it.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Pacific Rim is basically a slugfest between giant robots called Jaegers and giant monsters called Kaiju after the Japanese word for, what else, monster. It takes monsters to destroy monsters, and after an invasion by aliens from another dimension through a rift in the ocean floor, the governments of Earth unite and build giant robots to smash the living daylights out of those monsters who want to colonize the planet.Synopsis out of the way, the pluses in this movie are many. Eye-popping special effects, monsters that actually look like they weigh what they're supposed to weigh--some CGI effects take that mass effect away--a solid supporting cast led by Idris Elba, and del Toro's trademark offbeat humor displayed so aptly by Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau, Burn Gorman as Doctor Gottlieb, Charlie Day as Doctor Geizler (both he and Gorman play the typical eccentric scientists that S/F movies always have to have) and a very nice semi-romantic ending between the two leads (Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Hunnam) along with a rousing musical score by Ramin Djawadi.Kikuchi plays her part nicely and doesn't stoop to stereotype, while the love/hero interest is portrayed by Charlie Hunnam......and that leads to the one drawback of the movie. His performance is only a shade above wooden. Granted, he looks good and shares a couple of nicely underplayed scenes with Rinko Kikuchi--their relationship is marked by loss at first rather than actual physical attraction--but overall, a store mannequin would have given an equally moving performance and Hunnam is largely forgettable. His narration at the beginning of the movie is also somewhat offputting, but overall the movie is so much fun and Perlman in particular steals every scene that he's in, that it's hard not to like this film.Will there be a sequel? Hopefully yes, as long as Perlman (and his trademark gold shoes) is in it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Seriously? The first thing that struck me was the absolutely awful accents. If actors can't do an accent properly, they should just stick to their normal voice. The two 'Australians' (at least I think that's what they were suppose to be) were absolutely terrible. And Idris's English accent was pretty ordinary. In fact, apart from Rinko and Charlie, the acting was below what it should have been. The two 'science guys' were way over the top...but not believable. And Ron Perlman just couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. (sorry Ron!!)But hey, I wasn't expecting to be riveted by the story line, I went to see Cloverfield V Transformers and visually, it was spectacular and really well done.It felt a lot like it was trying to be Godzilla, with a few zany bits and giggles thrown in....some of which almost worked.Leave you're brain at the popcorn stand and enjoy the visual feast.

I enjoy films most when I feel as though I've developed an emotional connection to one (or more) of the characters. On a slight sidenote, some people like listening to music purely for the shredding of the guitars, the pounding of the bass etc. or the melody in general. Others enjoy music most when they can connect to the song through the lyrics. This movie fell into the unfortunate category of ""good music - with uninspiring, cookie-cutter lyrics and bad vocals"".The storyline was banged up to fit around the action sequences really. That wouldn't be a problem, had the actors actually breathed some life into their characters. Due to average performances and one-dimensional dialogue, I didn't give a damn about any of the characters. Charlie Hunnam sounded like he was narrating a B-grade video game throughout the entire movie; his performance was pretty weak. Idris Elba has been average in pretty much everything other than Prometheus (from what I've seen of him so far), but he does the job. Rinko Kikuchi did a nice job with what she had to work with. I enjoy Ron Perlman usually and he was pretty good in this, but nowhere near his usual charismatic self. I felt like punching the two Scientists in the face... One was a complete and utter nerd, the other was a strap-on to pop culture. Both of them completely unfunny and annoying.However, let's move on to what really made me angry.As an Australian, I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH how INSULTING it is when Americans attempt our accent. Not even Robert Downey Jr. in all of his brilliance can do it (and I'm a big fan of RDJ). STOP IT. GIVE IT UP. YOU'LL NEVER DO IT. It is pure ignorance and arrogance at the same time, thinking people will take you seriously.Note: AUSTRALIANS DO NOT SOUND LIKE ENGLISHMEN WHO HAVE LIVED IN SOUTH Africa AND/OR NEW ZEALAND. Hire REAL Australians. There are tens of thousands of Aussies who would jump at the chance to feature in Hollywood Blockbusters.Having said that, Max Martini's Australian accent was at least 75% better than Robert Kazinky's. Being a Brit, one would expect Robert to be pretty convincing, but no... The New Yorker kicked the Brit's ayess!All in all, the movie was a letdown.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

New technology and science produce the next generation of defenses for the Earth. These new defenses, dependent on humans, are limited by their vulnerabilities while simultaneously bolstered by their vitality.The not-too-revealing-review:Pacific Rim captures ""big"". The movie convincingly relates the big threat to humanity, the big communal response, the big industrial production, and the big adversary. This near future is even made plausible on the political, technological, and fantasy level. The movie fails, however, to escape the graphic novel origins. Where storyline development could have come through the explanation and development of the futuristic technology, it settles for unsurprising weaponry ""reveals""; where it could have entertained grand science fiction questions, it throws in another action scene; where it could have showcased large-scale action choreography, it focuses in on a punch landing or head being knocked backward. It belongs in the video game movie genre with all the flaws one expects to accompany such a label: weak storyline, repetitive action scenes, and cliché characters. It does fare better than expected in a number of categories: the acting was acceptable nor and the character development was less than ruinous. It was as shiny and glossy as one expects from a big budget motion picture of this sort, but the action scenes were sluggish and clunky. It matches up with Transformers in effects but is more Godzilla (1954) in terms of action choreography. I enjoyed it while I was in the theater, but I will not think fondly of it on the outside. I do not recommend the movie, but neither would I discourage those who desire a good solid two hours of big effects and mayhem.Acting: 6/10 Cinematography: 7/10 Character Development: 5/10 Choreography: 3/10 Storyline: 6/10 Resonance: 1/10","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

That's not to say that I'm a fan of the old style kaiju movies, but I think it's a genre that is perfect for this day and age of CGI. There is so much you can do, and this movie is an example of that. Guillermo Del Toro was certainly the right man for the job to do this film. His creativity really shines through, especially with the monsters, and it's great to see, especially if you saw it on the big screen. It's also a wonderfully colourful film, which is really visually appealing. The place where Del Toro goes wrong, however, is with the screenplay. I know there is two actual screenplay credits, but it feels like it was written heavily by Del Toro. When it comes to writing American characters or just English speaking characters in general, Del Toro isn't that great. In fact, it can be downright cheesy. But just like the recent television show The Strain, which Del Toro also wrote, the cheesy-ness kinda makes it fun. Most of the characters are stereotypes, but they are fun ones that can be easily enjoyed. Also similar to the writing of The Strain, the stand out thing with this movie is just the who general idea of the Kaiju and their attack on earth. It just feels like a really cool and creative general idea, and that keeps you on board even when the individual characters dialogue falls flat. At the end of the day, this movie is total fun. It's not some deep art house film, it's just a visually appealing and well made action film that entertains. It's certainly a movie that needs to be seen by people who like films like Godzilla and other monster movies. (Ironically enough, if you have seen the recent 2014 Godzilla remake, the two monsters that Godzilla fights are incredibly similar to two Kaiju that show up in this movie. In both films, one monster has wings and flys, and the other moves like a Gorilla. Just thought i'd mention that fun fact.)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Movies don't have to be a showcase for brilliant actors, touch your heart or change the world in order to be worthwhile. Isn't ""to be entertained"" the simple reason that we go to the movies in the first place? Of course, I'm often entertained by movies that do one or more of the things that I just listed, but sometimes a movie is entertaining just because it's FUN. And ""Pacific Rim"" (PG-13, 2:05) is a lot of fun! In this movie, enormous, ugly, ill-tempered sea creatures (called Kaiju) periodically emerge from the Pacific Ocean, come ashore and wreak havoc on populated areas of countries that border the world's largest body of water. The only thing that humans have found to fight these extremely unpleasant monsters with any degree of success are giant robots (called Jaegers) operated by two people inside the robot's head. These two ""pilots"" make the Jaeger's arms and legs move by moving their own arms and legs, oh, and sharing their thoughts and synchronizing their actions through some sort of high tech mind meld. Sound dumb? It is. And delightfully so! As quirky characters mix with serious warriors who are all trying to stem the increasing tide of unwanted visitors emerging from the deep, they forge bonds, solve problems and get to the bottom of why all this is happening and how to stop it. The basic story, the relationships between the characters, and the way they deal with problems aren't terribly original (borrowing from any number of movies, to include ""Transformers"", ""Godzilla"", ""Starship Troopers"", ""Avatar"", ""Independence Day"", ""Armageddon"", ""Top Gun"" and even ""Inception""), but it's still very enjoyable to watch. Here's one example: When the leader of the pilots gets up on a vehicle and makes a rousing speech that ends with the line ""Today we are cancelling the apocalypse!"", you'll probably think of Bill Pullman's big moment before the climactic battle in ""Independence Day"", but it won't bother you.One reason I liked this movie so much is the actors – especially Idris Elba (""Prometheus"", ""Luther"", ""The Big C"") as Stacker Pentecost (!), the man in charge of the Jaeger program (or whatever they call it – it really doesn't matter), Charlie Day (""Horrible Bosses"", ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") as an over-caffeinated scientist who just might be able to figure out the answer to how to save the world, and Ron Perlman (the ""Hellboy"" movies, ""Sons of Anarchy"") as a mysterious man who is able to help Day's character – and who wears the coolest shoes ever captured on film. Also appealing are Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi as the very different, but very well-matched heroes who pilot the oldest Jaeger in the inventory at a critical moment in the effort to rid the world of the Kaiju once and for all.The main thing this movie has going for it is the visual effects. Just about every frame of this movie explodes with color – more than in any live-action movie I can remember seeing – and the 3-D makes that color seem to go on forever. The sound effects are pretty amazing too. I'd give the film Oscars in several of the technical categories. But don't worry about how many awards ""Pacific Rim"" did or didn't win – just see it, if possible, while wearing those plastic glasses with the special lenses! For not having any higher goal than giving people a good time watching a movie (and delivering) and for its stunning audio and visual effects, I give ""Pacific Rim"" an ""A""!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The robots aren't hiding in dark lighting there isn't massive amounts of lens flare there isn't cut after cut to hide crappy fight scenes.
The fight scenes are actually amazing and have great attention to detail with what is happening punch after punch.
You wonder why the EMP Kaiju doesn't EMP again? Because Gyspy clearly rips the EMP generating part of the Kaiju off in a fight scene.
Being able to actually give us substance and detail in a fight scene is what all these other movies constantly lack.
The details put into this film make it amazing, Guillermo Del Toro did wonders with this, he put passion into this.Which is why it's so sad to see the sequel be given over to the kind of people that would say ""I wish the robots would hurry up, just hurry up."" said by Boyega the lead actor.
Why not just star in a transformers film?""The actor admits that he found the movements of the original Jaegers a little too cumbersome, and has brought fight co-ordinator Liang Yang over from Star Wars: Rogue One and The Force Awakens to bring the aforementioned ""martial arts feel"" to Uprising.""Way to ruin parts of what made the original film so great. Why take your time with anything? This is what Hollywood does over and over. Rush projects, no passion.
From the characters, the feel of the movie the music this movie just tells you that time was spent on it, that love went into it.Guillermo Del Toro made these mechs lumbering towering giants and perfectly sold us the illusion of how big they actually are.
They aren't going to do spin flips unless someone makes a sequel and thinks it's transformers.. Which unfortunatly happened.Being a movie that gives attention to detail to the world it is set in is wonderful, we don't get that in a lot of movies. From Kaiju harvesting to black market Kaiju scamming powders to boost your sex life and the opening credits talking about how the world reacted to Kaiju's appearing. Everything is spot on in this film and shows how a film should be done.I saw the trailers before it came out and said ""Oh no not another Transformers."" But I could not have been more wrong. 
You really should watch this.This is not just a great movie. This is what film making should be.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Plain and simple ... this is not my kind of movie. I fully understand there exists movie-goers who are thrilled that director Guillermo del Toro's latest finally hit theatres, but I really struggled with this mash-up of Transformers, Battleship and Godzilla, as well as what I believe to be a new world record for noise level. That being said, I do have some positive comments to make.The technological aspects of the movie are exceptional. It has a unique look with some of the best CGI ever seen. There is no shortage of action, which is typically good for an action movie ... but here, it seemed that one monster vs robot fight led right into the next one. The cast is very talented and represent some of the most entertaining shows on TV: Sons of Anarchy, True Blood, Homeland, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Justified. The downside is many of them don't seem overly excited to be here just to spout some of the worst dialogue of the year.The basic story is a war between mankind and the Kaiju - monsters from another world. World leaders work together to develop the Jaeger program ... robots co-piloted by two people who are drift compatible (a kind of mind meld that let's them fight as one). After years of struggling against the Kaiju, the world leaders decide instead to build a security wall around the main cities. Clearly they had not seen World War Z or read any of the ""fence"" stories from the US/Mexico border. No surprise, but the robots have to be reactivated for the climactic battle scene.Iris Elba runs the Jaeger program and commands the pilots that include Charlie Hunnam, Rinko Kikuchi, Max Martini, and Robert Kazinski. Hunnam is battling inner demons after the death of his brother (Diego Klattenhoff). For some reason, Hunnam plays his part with an overdose of bland. He seems to have been cast for his effectiveness in his shirtless scenes. Martini and Kazinski stand out here, probably because competition is so uninspired, oh and they have a dog. Ms. Kikuchi seems to be under the impression that her scenes were rehearsals as she can't quite hash out a consistent approach (translated: she is painful to watch). The usually great Elba alternates between a mumbled whisper and a full-out yell ... neither working too well. His ""canceling the apocalypse"" speech seems to be right out of Independence Day.The comedy relief is provided by the shared scenes of Charlie Day and del Toro favorite Ron Perlman. Day is at his screechiest and Perlman at his most flamboyant, but it's not enough of the story to salvage much hope. Instead we get an endless number of hand-to-hand combat scenes between Jaeger and Kaiju. And they mostly all look the same: waist deep in water while its dark and rainy. Unless they happen to be completely underwater, where it's even darker.For all the negatives tossed out here, it must be ended with the reminder that the movie is a technical marvel to look at. I much prefer del Toro in the Pan's Labyrinth mode, and I would even prefer the old Japanese Godzilla monster-fests to this, but he has raised the bar for robotic and monster CGI. Maybe that's enough for your eyes and ears.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Not until ""Transformers"" was it possible for modern cinema to adapt it for the big audience. As child I always dreamt of a real movie with anime style robots, now it has come true. This isn't an Arthaus-Movie and it never tries to be one. It's full of cool animation, stunning visuals and action. Yes the plot is simple, but hey, I've watched almost every single Sci-Fi flick out there - believe me, I saw much worse when it comes to narrations and plots! The acting is adequate, at times a bit overacted, but it won't really make you sick either. Like most of the late movies, this one is also aimed at world audition, so expect it not wholly concentrated on western culture, although Asians and Hong Kong serve just as some sort of ""extras"". I loved these battle machines so much more than the ""Transformers"" because of their style, but yes, without the latter, there would never be a ""Pacific Rim"" at all. All of the other guys going to watch it were very much pleased as well, but admittedly: this nothing for the girls. It's a love or hate movie and I love it.

But they are neither the pioneers, nor polishers. With Pacific Rim, Guillermo del Toro satiates his own filmmaking fad, but this is just too fictitious to interpret and is just a potpourri of overwhelming visual effects and poor dialog delivery by an inept & loose cast.The base idea, had the makers taken few more moments out of 120 minutes to explain, the experience would've amplified twofold. But, they got to attend to the gaudy CGI. Then we have some half-baked to raw characters who do not fail to indulge in light-hearted banter when a monster-led apocalypse is inevitable. Or two of the worst scientist characters who play with their wits & ideologies while working on glossy instruments. Terrible.Music is the only thing ""pacific"" in this tale of otherwise poor screenplay & plot. The action sequences are larger than life and beautiful, but with the aforementioned use of heavy CGI, it got garbled towards the few end scenes. The countenances of characters were funny & the poor placement of humor just wrecked havoc to my experience. I felt like running out of the theater hall, but the concept is surely intriguing, which kept me.It sets a base for future filmmakers. But Pacific Rim just doesn't work as it dwells solely on cheap Hollywood tactics, which the viewer should decide how to act on.BOTTOM LINE: Have a look for this is a re-birth of a genre.

I'm not talking about the battle between robots and monsters around which the film revolves, but rather the battle between Guillermo Del Toro and Michael Bay to see who can make the most expensive, most tedious, most special effects driven piece of mainstream blockbuster drivel humanly possible.In an attempt to go one better than Bay's Transformers series, Del Toro's Pacific Rim not only features massive mechanoids causing untold damage but also throws in enormous monsters (known as Kaiju) for good measure. The result is a charmless mess of bland performances, difficult to follow, state-of-the-art digital mayhem, and nonsensical plot developments designed to please those viewers for whom logic, narrative cohesion and convincing acting are of little importance just as long as stuff gets destroyed on a massive scale.Transformers 4 and Pacific Rim 2 will no doubt up the ante even further—and probably prove all the more terrible for it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There are several comic relief characters too, who are all immensely annoying.The CG is nice enough, as is standard now, although the sets look like they've fallen out of a mid 1990s Godzilla film, which is to say, they look incredibly cheap and tacky. Maybe that's the idea, who knows.Del Toro is a director who has proved he can make hugely imaginative, original, and beautiful works.

Watch like a grown up kid who still likes Cartoon... !My ratings 8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This isn't just a monster movie. It's a movie where people from whatever background come together to fight together against aliens who are trying to take what it ours. This movie is so uplifting and positive. There is no evil exec who is trying to hurt the heroes for no reason at all. There are just brave men and women fighting against an impossible foe and winning. This movie shows the best in human nature, They fight and spoiler ......win despite some pretty bad odds, without it ever feeling cheesy or forced. Can't wait for Pacific RIm 2.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A gripping, fascinating and totally awesome movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2997594/?ref_=tt_urv","English-Class2014","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur51639025/?ref_=tt_urv","14 April 2014","Pacific Rim is a science fiction monster film by Guillermo del Toro about the future (2020s), where Kaijus, colossal monsters looking like dinosaurs, want to take over the world. The humans are defending their world with giant robots called Jaeger. They are controlled by two pilots, whose minds have to be connected.The main character, Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam), is a former pilot and has always been very headstrong. When he was recalled by the commanding officer, he wanted to reject because of his brother's death. The other two main characters, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) and Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), share a common past, but it would be a spoiler to tell it here. The actors did a very good job and are really convincing. The music always fits with the scenes and is really supportive. Great and colourful effects in contrast to darkness and gloomy settings are creating a gripping atmosphere. The special effects are really authentic and impressive, and the animations are thoroughly realistic. Therefore the budget of 190mio $ was well-used. This sum is quite normal for a science fiction movie of this magnitude. The fights between Jaegers and Kaijus are in the foreground of the movie, but the actual plot doesn't get lost, because the movie makes sense, the explanations are plausible and comprehensible for the audience. Pacific Rim is a gripping, fascinating and totally awesome movie with a marvellous story. It's absolutely worth watching.

It should have been an astonishing fun spectacle with the crew and cast but instead was one of the very few films that I ended up flicking through the chapters on the Blu Ray. At least I got my money back.Absolute travesty of a film, appalling acting, dire plot, even the audio was odd (the reverb added to a lot of the voices in scenes did not go with the environments) If felt like an advert for a video game, just one great long drawn out piece of 3d trash.I can handle dumb (I enjoyed the Transformers movies!) and I'm a sucker for monster movies and am a keen but casual gamer (hell I worked in video games studios as an artist for a good few years so I know all about dumb) but this had that same empty feeling as Sucker Punch. Soul-less, life less and riddled with ridiculous holes in its logic.Find something better to do with your life than watch this like read a good book, paint or draw something, go for a walk or just plain relax and meditate for half an hour but please don't encourage them to make more movies like this.We all deserve better.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The characters where so likable and believable and the plot twists where so effective. Oh and the visual effects...wow. One of the best visual effects movies I've ever seen. The pacing was perfect. It could have gone wrong if directed by someone else but Guillermo del Toro did it perfectly. There were some unrealistic points in the film but the film makers know this and you just need to embrace that. The film has a consistent feeling which is really cool and whenever you think about the movie, you have the same feeling. I was so taken into the world of the movie, I felt it was real...and this was in 2D, on my computer screen.

Like a Saturday morning children's action cartoon of 5 minutes that makes no common sense, is pew bam POW and a lot of happy colors and effects. but in this case a whole adult movie of it.There should be a new rating category for these type of movies.

However, Guillermo del Toro diverges from this norm by portraying the machines in a more realistic, lifelike manner.Although it may be scientifically accurate for a machine to take more than 20 seconds to punch a monster, it risks being perceived as dull. Despite this, del Toro enhances the depiction with his masterful production skills, allowing audiences to virtually sense the enormity of the machines.It's disappointing when sequels revert to traditional production methods, but I believe del Toro's interpretation paved the way for later works like the Dune Series, where the cinematic portrayal of overwhelming power expands beyond physics to the abstract.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, it was a rather boring story, predictable and full of testosterone (in a bad way)... In lack of imagination they wrote a typical corny love story that you've seen a thousand times before. The character played by Charlie Hunnam sounded tired and bored, on the other hand, Idris Elba did a brilliant job as well as Rinko Kikuchi, which brings me to another bad thing about this movie namely that it is only one woman among the main characters, tiresome and old-fashioned, would love to have seen it a bit more up to date. The good thing about this movie was the special effects, they were actually quite powerful and impressive and that's why it's getting a 4 and not less.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

That said, the movie is NOT Japanese, but Master Director Guillermo del Toro's work. You feel the enormity of the giant war machines, the Jaegers. You feel their incredible size, and the earth-shaking vibration of every foot step. You feel the terror unleashed by the monstrous Kaiju from the depths of the Pacific. And you revel in the incredible technological wizardry of the battle scenes. It is awesome!
And in classic del Toro style, he actually slows it down every so often so we get a glimpse into some very interesting characters. You are witnessing a master filmmaker at work. Go have fun and watch this film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In all the fairness most SF movies show disrespect for the laws of physics, however the worth-watching ones provide us with either a decent explanation (e.g. Matrix)or they just keep it simple in order to avoid potentially embarrassing details (e.g Kryptonite powers). Pacific Rim's director has chosen the nonsensical approach (e.g. Giant robots weighing thousands of tons are lifted by helicopters). It is not the abundance of plot holes that surprised me but the fact that many of them could have been easily avoided with minimal effort. It seems that the director was concerned only to deliver CGIs and clichés. Have fun.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

PR is way better than any Godzilla flic because it weaves an actual story involving people, not just cardboard characters that bring nothing to the story.Some time in the future, Kaiju (Japanese for Beasts) start to emerge from a breach in the tectonic plates under the Pacific ocean. Humans end up creating Jaegers (German for Hunter), huge robot fighting machines, to stop the Kaiju. These robots are massive - tall as skyscrapers, and weigh thousands of tons.The story pulls you in because the world is under siege and countries actually cooperate with each other for self survival. Your interest starts at the country level, while director Del Toro quickly brings it down to a level you can better identify with - the one-on-one type. You learn about a Jaeger pilot, Raleigh (played by unknown Charlie Hunnam), and his brother. These Jaegers require two pilots to operate them, left brain/right brain, because the neural stress is too much for one person. These brother pilots go out on a hunt and things go bad. There's a terrific fight scene in Alaska with a beach scene that introduces you to the sacrifices these people make to save the world. The story then pulls you in and never lets go.Raleigh gives up piloting and takes up construction to help build a wall that no one believes can stop these monsters, but he withdraws from the world. Until we then meet Commander Stacker, played masterfully by Idris Elba - he was terrific. The story then goes all over the world, from New York to California, to England, to Hong Kong. Other interesting characters come into play, led by Mako (Rinko Kikuchi - actually a pretty well-established actress). Two crazy scientists, a con/Kaiju parts dealer (Ron Perlman is excellent), and internal adversaries join the excellent cast.Casting was terrific. Raleigh and Mako have great chemistry on screen. Cmdr Stacker exudes leadership. Crazy scientists excude wild abandon in search of science. Bad guys are heartless. In the end, internal adversaries bond together, and it was all terrifically believable due to the casting. The acting was also top notch. All actors gave strong performances in their roles.The cinematography was uneven, mostly due to lighting. As Jaegers and Kaiju did battle in various scenes, just like the Transformer movies, it was often hard to tell who was doing what to whom because of the darkness. Smashing battles in the city were easier, and monsters spewing colored venom helped, but that's my major issue with the movie. Better lighting definition would have drawn me in more to the fight scenes, which were numerous.By far the best part of the movie, after the excellent storyline, was the CGI. The robot hunters were very realistic. The computer control rooms were very realistic, as were the graphics used by the Jaeger pilots in their control room. You never felt the monstors or robots were out of scale to themselves or their surroundings, which is often an issue with cheaper CGI films, like the old Godzilla vs Mothra type movies. The monsters were really well done too. You could tell that the fight scenes took a lot time and care to make them very realistic.Pacific Rim succeeds on every level, while throwing in a cliche here and there, and your expected Hollywood ending. You'll feel happy, sad, happy/sad, and relate to these poor people fighting for their lives against all odds. Story, acting, casting, directing, CGI, oh, and the music too, which strongly supported the story. All were great.PR is a must-see film for monster-movie enthusiasts and general film lovers alike. Enjoy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's for sure another addition to his masterpieces.The reason I'm writing this review is to share about this incredible movie made by Guillermo del Toro. The story is your typical mecha movie, with humanity utilizing robots to defeat the enemy. I won't be spoiling any of the plot in here though.Now to get a clear picture: The robots are called Jaegers and were specifically built to battle the Kaiju, huge monsters that appeared from another dimension. What makes it unique is the piloting system. The Jaeger is controlled by human consciousness and because it's a big rig it requires two pilots. These pilots make a bridge between their two consciousness so they can sync and control the Jaeger together. The characters in this movie are interesting but sometimes the acting is cliché. My favorite are the scientists. Although were made for comedic relief, they also deserve the attention and love that the main characters get.Something that is always in Gullermo del Toro's movies is of course the amazing graphics and sound and I'm glad we can still see it in this movie. I highly recommend watching Pacific Rim on your TV as watching it on your phone is a waste of time. By watching it on the TV you can enjoy the amazing realistic CGI put into the Jaegers, Kaiju, and even the environment. The movie is aesthetically pleasing to the eye and the soundtrack makes it better. You can feel the emotion and situation through the sound as if you are right there in the movie.The story has Godzilla elements I won't deny that, but it also has its own charm. It displays a good portion of Jaegers and humans, meaning there isn't too much human involvement that you forget about the Jaeger, but the humans don't always rely on the Jaeger either. This is something I find very pleasing because I didn't find it in a certain franchise where the robots relied too much on humans (iykyk).Overall this is my favourite movie of all time and I can't wait to watch it again when I have the chance. 5/5.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Only problem is that the alien monster don't get injured by being punched in the face.

But these Human Robots do have secret weapons, (sword) which they use 1 second before being completely destroyed. The defense plating on them is as thick as a coca-cola can and their god damn weapons are so damn slow like in this one scene where it took the robot 20 seconds to charge its damn laser weapon but then could fire it because the alien ripped of the arm holding the laser.

Even the background music was similar and probably re-scored from those films. The monsters maybe and are actually digitized but I can't help thinking that these are actually played by human actors in monsters suit like they used to do back then. Really neat! Gypsy Danger really reminds of the remade 80's Gigantor and the other robots is kinda similar to those robots found in that anime cartoons Voltes V.

You expect a film about big robots (like in Transformers) versus Godzilla monsters. When I saw that the film was 132 minutes long, I wondered if we would just analyze horses like this, sort of, one more time, get to see them in the film. Fortunately, this is not the case.
The film starts with a prologue, It has been said that a portal in the Pacific takes place samples (called Kaiju) and then attack the earth. The people have to make their own monsters, giant robots called Jeagers to fight the Kaiju. The Jeagers need two pilots. The thoughts, memories and emotions of the two pilots are connected to each other in order to control the Jeager.
The story goes somewhere in the middle of what it is now. The first fight takes place at night, it is difficult to see what is happening. The Kaiju was safe to see. You can not clearly see from the Kaiju a real picture that it has been edited with the computer. Fortunately, all other Kaiju feathers are good to see. After the first fight, the movie really starts.
Idris Elba's character asks the main character, an old Jeager pilot to come back to the Jeager team. Back at the Jeager team, the protagonist meets the character Mako. The two goes finally together in a Jeager against the Kaiju fighting to protect the world. We see a few fights between the Kaiju and Jeagers. You learn more about the other characters and their view of the world. The goal of the Jeagers is to stop the Kaiju, close the portal in the Pacific Ocean and thus prevent the earth from being lost.
The fighting between the Kaiju and Jeagers looks great. You really get the feeling that two huge things are being destroyed and everything around them.
The Kaiju were not all the same what the trailer is so late. Each Kaiju looked different and had given his own special gifts. The characters are interesting to see because they are in each other's brains during the fighting and get a special bond. What is special is that it is not the most important thing to look at. The character Mako steals the show, especially with the emotional scene about her past. Idris Elba is also doing great as the leader of Jeager's team.
Pacific Rim is a great film with a good story. Definitely worth seeing. So far it is not the best film I saw in 2013.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Gloriously violent, loud, and breathtakingly gorgeous and grotesque, Pacific Rim delivers in ways I've not often seen in a blockbuster film before. It is, however, one of the worst stories for a film I've ever seen, and has some of the most wooden acting ever recorded on film. Idris Elba, about halfway through the movie, seems to realize that the script just isn't getting better, and turns into a caricature of his character from his guest stint on The Office - and I feel horrible for him, because he deserves so much better.But the worst...the absolute worst thing was whatever accent the lead actor decided to use in this film. I can only assume it was supposed to be a north eastern US accent - however, it sounded like he had only ever had the accent described to him, rather than hearing it himself.

"5","/10","I did not hate this movie, however, the reception it has received? Thats a different story...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2846149/?ref_=tt_urv","iamstemo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31394126/?ref_=tt_urv","6 August 2013","First of all, I'd like to clarify: Did I think this was a good movie? Yes. But did I think this was a groundbreaking masterpiece? Hell no. There is very little to be said about this movie, I had a pretty good idea of what I was going to get when I walked into the cinema and I got almost exactly what I expected. Therefore, I cannot say this movie was bad when I knew what I was getting into. However, I am puzzled by people's response to this movie. Majority of the reviews I seen for this film, more or less, follow the lines of ""Robots+Monsters=BADASS!!!"" and while agree with that statement to an extent, I have to play Devil's advocate here and raise the point, that while giant robots and monsters are badass, those factors do not necessarily make a great movie.My criticisms of the movie: 1. Very little character development: while we're given brief back stories to our main protagonists, they are so brief it feels like the film is just trying to get them out of the way for more action. Some characters are given no development at all. Come to think of it, we never find out why Robert Kazinsky is so cranky in this movie. 2. You already know the main plot just from watching the trailer: big robots seek to destroy monsters, robots win, monsters lose. End. I actually found the subplot involving the scientist trying to hook his brain to the monsters more interesting than this. 3. Not enough Ron Perlman: I'm sure another online critique said something very similar, but anyway, I agree. 4. Too long: for a film with such a simple plot, it runs too long. While I was not going ""Come on! When will this movie end already?!"" I did find myself checking my watch now and again. And its these 4 factors, in my opinion, that make this film over-hyped. Like I said, its not bad, but a 7.7 rating is being FAR too generous. All because a movie has giant robots and monsters, doesn't necessarily make it a great film.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

There is just no way to tell the Difference.

Speaking of the Brain, nah, better Not.In Short Bursts there are some Pretty Cool Colors and Whirly Computer Screens that Hang in the Air, and other Shiny Things along side of Rusty Things.

Entirely sincere. The only good things of substance were the performances and the bits of passable dialog between Elba, the blonde guy (the main one, not the 5 other ones), and Kikuchi. The script was interminably and unrepentantly stupid without a shred of self awareness. There is no sense of what's going on in the wider world, and the action scenes - despite having technically competent effects and production design - were just boring. Another entirely derivative and forgettable action film, barely having a personality past its formula. The child actor playing little Mako in the flashback sequence was incredible, however.

We have the hopeless who sacrifices to the enemy that caused their illness, bringing the nuclear bomb that destroyed the command center of the enemy. To access the portal and the mother ship, we have to use a ship or genetic signature Kaiju, extraterrestrial scene watching the atomic bomb that ends the invasion is very similar.

Not to ignore the problems of logic that many of the explanations given by scientists, I mean, there are no alien enemy which has a constant blanks, it should be known all theorizing and things like that are part of an invasion, but that's a subject for another debate. In the graphic is more than outstanding, monster battles are well choreographed with a riot of special effects where it has been most of the budget not spent in familiar faces.

I was hoping for a great spoof on the Godzilla-geek culture. A movie to make fun of said movies, the pathetic/flatulent nationalistic-army-kitsch and of Hollywood altogether behind a mask of a sci-fi action movie. Sometimes, for a few seconds (e.g. the black-market) I had hope, but it was lost to end up in a deluge of clichés and cinematic commonplaces. Verhoeven put the viewer in the skin of a fascist and he made them want to be one. In a fascist society you take the part of the fascist or the bugs. And given that no human can identify themselves with insects, you had to a be fascist. There were many-many details that were great, that had some deeper meaning, but I won't go deeper here, because this is a review about Pacific Rim. The actors were weak, but again in Starship Troopers, there were only one actor in leading role, Michael Ironside. The others were only bioscenery (Denise Richards, Casper Van Dien). Here we had Idris Elba, the others were only models, part of the decoration. (Yes, Ron Perlman and Santiago Segura, but they were not in leading roles). So I was waiting for something that just did not come. The visuals were stunning, but boring: you see these monster/robots in every game/movie/tutorial, etc. A lot of work for nothing. It is amazing how a bland and bloodless movie like Pacific Rim can attain a score above 3, but now it is on 7.

Both the monsters and mechs, while quick for their size, move slowly and purposefully, giving a real feel for their size and power.It's just the plot kind of sucks. Ironically, in the same way that this movie has the strengths of anime, it also has its weaknesses. You name the trope, it's probably in here.

Watching poorly executed scenes with poorly written and meaningless dialogue for and hour to get to see 20 minutes of robots and/or monsters was not worth it.How is there going to be a sequel to this? That is mind-boggling.

Amazing movie posters, incredible nail biting trailers and a promising cast. So where did it all go wrong? A main storyline filled with plot holes, awkward screenplay filled with racial stereotypes and poorly directed scenes.The acting had a non-intentional comical feel which greatly conflicted with the storyline and was very distracting. However not directly to the fault of the actors themselves, the uncomfortable cliché 'one-liners' and senseless scenes where everyone just screams and dies is resulted from poorly written scripts and directing. Also, the unsellable foreign aspects of the film is riddled with racial stereotypes and slanders. Such derogatory scenes even included a ""Russian"" woman wearing an eye-patch and grunting like a masculine commando, purely retched material.To sum up, although it had lots of CGI eye candy, it was painful to watch. The main story is filled with holes and is lost to the action in the film. This could have been avoided if the side-story, 'about a girl', was expanded and adapted into the main story. In addition, the actors struggle to uphold the seriousness of the film due to distasteful scripts and directing. Also, the drama scenes dragged out too long and the anticipation of the cool robot on alien scenes did not compensate.Best if fast-forwarding straight to action scenes, a sci-fi not worth watching in full or ever again. 2 out of 10 stars.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

In this film you will get to see all clichés ever used in either a straight up action movie or in a ""end of the world""-movie. The script of Pacific Rim could just as well have been a parody of the above mentioned films. On the other hand, the production and acting is good. But it almost seems to be a waste to spend so much time, effort and money on such a bad script. However, the movie is loaded with special effects, and exciting action scenes. This makes it an entertaining movie if that is what you are looking for.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I won't go into how that split most likely occurs but this film has been clearly aimed at those who just love effects and couldn't give a hoot about the storyline and continuity.Hence Pacific Rim has astounding special effects, the battle scenes, technical military facilities and 'jaegers' are very well done. But as a result very little attention is spent on the storyline, it shallowly consists of 'mad' but brilliant of course larger than life (over acted) scientist characters plus warriors (soldiers) some with the utmost integrity and some just 'bad ass'. Basically good guys V bad guys but both on the same side... ""Who will save the world?"".... Q internal wrangles and corridor scuffles over who has the best idea.... Yawn !Then you have scenes such as the one where the clever lady with an immaculate hairstyle is waiting on a busy rain soaked and windy military dock holding an umbrella waits for a helicopter to land just in front of her.

Its the closest Hollywood has ever come close to realistic manga (with CGI)(AFAIK - the previous Godzilla films were too much Hollywood and not enough manga). Lets face it, the big draw of this film is big robots vs. big monsters a la the well loved Godzilla. Those parts are perfectly implemented. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THEM and I'm v.critical. Where the film fails, uncommonly for Del Torro, is the effeminate screenplay and bad acting. Idris Elba & Ron Perlman are excellent but others are wishy-washy and the scientists are terrible - which I cannot believe from the guy who made the excellent Hellboy.There is way way too much touchy-feely talky talky and girly stuff. The fact the film makers missed was that girly girls are not ever going to flock to giant monster/robot films. So all you managed to do was alienate the majority of the potential audience. I feel VERY VERY let down by the glaring flaws in the run-of-the-mill areas of the film-making.I really hope the next film plays to its strengths - there's a big worldwide audience for that, and the potential technical achievement of 'reality' Manga is a world first.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I am guilty! I was born 11 years after Godzilla, and among the first things I remember was Ultraman, Ultraseven and other ultras, and Mothra, and King Ghidorah and if you don't know what I am talking about, it is going to be easy for you to enjoy Guillermo Del Toro's mix of transformers-voltron meet the ""kaiju"", and let's leave to the side the political issue about the ""kaiju"" being the bad children of nuclear energy, (ask the Japanese). Pacific Rim DID NOT work for me, because one of the main reasons in the making of a movie must be ""caring for the characters"" and the only one I was worried about was Ron Perlman and his ""goddamn shoe"". The only thing that Charlie Hunnam is capable in this movie is to leave the bike and leather at home for a shiny armor, because the attitude and acting is the same he portrays in ""Sons of Anarchy"", ""Lucky"" for him he will be ""Christian Grey"", in a movie that I won't watch unless I am paid 40.00 dollars for two hours of my life. In the other hand it's a shame that the talent of Idris Elba is wasted doing an impression of Bill Pullman's speech from Independence Day. Every other character is like the rest of the extras, even though an attempt of character development is made, it fails badly, because is already too late on the movie! As born Mexican, I am proud of Guillermo Del Toro accomplishments, and I cheer for him, but for this movie he has become ""Mr. Hollywood"", a suggestion to Memo, why don't you try ""El Santo"" (Samson for the ones who doesn't know better), maybe you (Del Toro) , will get your feet back on the ground. Pacific Rim looks and feels like G.I. Joe, overcrowded with special effects, and lack of a real human element. Still, after watching the abomination of ""The Lone Ranger"", I have no more choice but recommending Pacific Rim, because is entertaining, and the ""pretty colors"" and explosions will get you an OK time for your money. I just hope that Gareth Edwards (Monsters) provide us (as he did) with likable characters for Godzilla (2014) and hopefully one day I will get to see Gaiking (201) and have the fun I did not have watching Pacific Rim.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The common line is that the movie is about robots fighting giant monsters, so what did you expect? And while I guess that is true, there are so many other movies that this can be applied to that we generally agree are awful (Transformers). This movie has just as bad writing, just as flat characters, and just as cliché a plot as that series, and yet I'm supposed to forgive all that because the fight scenes are well made? The problem with the ""What did you expect?"" argument is that sci-fi action doesn't have to be inherently stupid. ""The Terminator"" is just about a time traveling robot assassin, and yet it's held up by interesting characters and actual good writing. ""RoboCop"" is just about a cop who is turned into a cyborg, and yet the movie has satire and violently dark comedy. We shouldn't excuse an awful script full of rampant clichés and forced romance just because we like the fight scenes. Speaking of which, I am giving it 3 stars because Guillermo obviously knows what he is doing in the special effects department and the overall look of the film is great. The problem with the fight scenes is that all of the characters are so flat and boring and unmemorable that I couldn't care less about the outcome. The tense chase scenes in the aforementioned Terminator work because we like the characters involved and we know the consequences of their failure. Sure, there are consequences in this movie, but so much infrastructure is destroyed that a bit more just seems irrelevant.If you want to watch the fight scenes, just find them on YouTube, don't waste 2+ hours on this movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's overtly formulaic and over the top action. I do not like action movies for some unless there is a story worth rooting for. This has action that is technically brilliant but it does not have a have worth rooting for. It's all open and shut from the word go. We know the heroes, the villains, the conflict. It's how they overcome is what shall be projected differently.Technically you may say it's brilliant. I will agree to that only partially coz greatest technology devoid of human concern will not work. Similarly, there is more of commerce in this than concern for heart. So it did not work for me. How greatly you will project the conflict and how shall it be made with thorough 3d technology is what was looked into. Now this disappointed me.Considering that this a film of Guillermo Del Toro who gave us 'Pan's Labyrinth' earlier it irks me more. I am not happy with what I have seen in this film. You may like it or love it. I just did not in many ways. This is strictly mediocre in content and high on technology. A 2/5 would be the best I can give this film.

Said creatures are built in the vein of Godzilla, in that you can basically tell they're rubber in the more close-up fight scenes. The robots are nicely designed, and the action scenes have solid pacing and fun to them.That said, the plot is rather thin, which is almost a shock considering how long it takes to get going. Idris Elba's character is the most interesting, but still is a basket of tropes that doesn't go much of anywhere. The real highlight is Ron Perlman, who is the smartest character in the film. That's not a high bar to clear, but he is ahead of the game for the most part, and is a fun presence that lends some comic aspects that the film needs.But mostly this involves people inside of cockpits screaming at each other about finishing things and killing things. If that's what your game is, this is your film. It's fancy, its creatures are imaginatively designed, but it's not something that's going to give you a lot to take home with you. Its drama is only skin deep, and its character development doesn't really happen, and it drags on far too long.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

World governments get together to build giant robots called Jaegers to combat the Kaiju. Inside the robots are 2-people who act as left-sided brain and right-sided brain because one person alone is not capable of handling the Jaeger. The ultimate goal is to close the rift and be rid of the Kaiju. There is no other way to say it: this is a CGI-fest. There are some acting scenes and they are pretty good by all. What was most annoying were the 2-scientists whose constant bickering almost made me align myself on the side of the Kaiju. Hey, I said ""almost."" The 2-scientists Charlie Day as Dr. Geiszler and Burn Gorman as Dr Gottlieb could possibly start their own stand-up comedy team except for one thing: they weren't funny and were highly annoying. They could have been handled in a better way, but weren't and this goes to prove that comedy is hard to do. And, to make matters even worse they talked so fast no one could possibly understand what they said. The hero is Charlie Hunnam (never heard of him before) as Becket and his love interest is Rinko Kikuchi (never heard of her before either) as Mako. They form the team to go into the ultimate Jaeger to defeat the Kaiju and to try to drop a nuclear bomb into the rift and close the bridge to upper earth. Idris Elba is Stacker Pentecost but is referred to as Marshall, at times, in the movie and he does a credible job as the person in charge of everything. Ron Pearlman as Hannibal Chau was in here and it is not clear what his purpose was. Maybe most of his scenes were cut and we were left with wondering why he was cast.Most of the movie is CGI with battle scenes after battle scenes and they are very good, but when it goes on for too long, too often, I tend to go into La La land when that happens. This movie is also in 3-D but the DVD I had wasn't. Bummer.If you are a CGI Nerd, this is for you. If the battle scenes were shortened , a better rating would have been given. They just go on for toooooo long. Hey, I'm yawning here. Can't you tell? But, here's the thing: Let's say the bomb works (and, I'm not telling) and the bridge is closed, the Kaiju would still be down there waiting for another opportunity to come up again. The movie did indicate that the Kaiju were not acting on instinct, but were commanded by higher-ups in their species. Would you like to live on a planet where this scenario exists? Huh? I know some will say it's only a movie. Right? (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

San Francisco is one of the first. These huge monsters are given the name ""Kaijus"" and current military weaponry is insufficient to contain them. So the nations of the world join forces and create huge manned robots called ""Jaegers"" which initially have great success against them. However, the Kaijus adapt and become more powerful and more numerous. As the Jaegers become more obsolescent a new plan is formulated which halts production of them in favor of the creation of huge walls upon the coasts of all nations. But the idea is a tremendous failure and the world is left with only a few remaining Jaegers to combat more frequent and powerful Kaijus. Now, rather than disclose the entire plot and risk spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it, allow me to just say that fans of CGI and action will probably love this film as it has elements of both in copious amounts. Likewise, it also has an incredibly beautiful heroine named ""Mako Mori"" (Rinko Kikuchi) to add to the scenery as well. Unfortunately, because of all of the attention to these special effects it seemed that everything else was secondary. What you see is what you get--CGI and action. That said, although I liked it to an extent, I would have definitely preferred more drama and suspense in place of some of the high octane action. It would have made the film a bit less tedious. As such I give this movie an average rating.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The pitch to the money boys who provided the $180M cost of the movie must have been simple: ""It's Godzilla meets Transformers - but bigger, much bigger"". So the threat comes from gigantic sea creatures called Kaiju (Japanese for 'strange beast') who emerge from a crack in the Pacific floor to smash up seaboard cities like San Francisco and Sydney, while the attempt to beat them takes the form of enormous robots called Jaegers (German for 'hunter') manned by two 'pilots' who need to be neurally connected (much like my wife and her twin sister), most of whom are battling internal demons as well as those ever-more colossal Kaiju.The whole thing is directed and co-written by the Mexican Guillermo del Toro who crafted the wonderful ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and he has made sure that he has a cast drawn from the United States, Britain, Australia and Japan (the only woman) and located the fight back in Hong Kong to maximise the worldwide audience draw. The pacing is excellent with a really strong opening and then a gradual build up to a climax on an oceanic scale but, as so often with blockbusters, the whole thing is a bit too long. The special effects are fun, although the beasts are not as well 'drawn' as the robots, and, as well as plenty of drama and destruction, there is humour, including a pair of scientists who are human versions of R2D2 and C3PO. It's silly but entertainingly so.Note: early on in the credits, there is a short extra scene.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Del Toro and writer Travis Beacham's concept is steeped in Asian mythology and pop culture, not seen since B-film Robot Jox (1989) and more recently the panned Skyline (2010). While it lacks the complexly of Del Toro's other offerings it delivers on wonderful spectacular visuals and impressive special effects. It's dark, it's oily - reminiscent of Godzilla (1998) and Del Toro's own Mimic (1997) and Hellboy (2004) in atmosphere it's still Del Toro but he makes every 12 year old dream come true in content. Comparably where Transformers (2007) felt over long and 'promised' to deliver, crammed with unnecessary padded dialogue, Rim actually delivers and doesn't pretend to be anything it's not.It has a memorable score by Ramin Djawadi and a powerful sound design to match. The lead actors are functional and effective enough although no one matches Idris Elba's calibre. Ron Perlman is limited to a humours extended cameo. There's the obligatory comic release characters, a character out for revenge, the doubting jock, and a guy haunted by the events from his past to name a few clichés - yes it has its Independence Day (1996) moments too but that limited cheese is addressed with the other players mocking and bringing the pretentious speeches back down to earth like a Jaeger's crashing on a Kaiju.There's no smoke and mirrors it's a B-film concept with a big budget, Pacific Rim is a basic fun move with the ILM visuals being more impressive than they need to be.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I guess the fans made me think ""Maybe this is an unappreciated gem"". But hell no. This is as generic as an action movie can be. It could have been easily made in the 80s. The Russians can get you any weapon, there are quirky characters and attempts of ""comedic relief"". Things remain the same: we have one damaged, mourning hero that is going to succeed in his work while facing the backlash of the new, fresher guy that is paired with his father (That is only 14 year his senior). I guess Del Toro thought it could be progressive to have a black man in charge and a woman fighting but nothe girl fights but she is always rescued ever since she was a girl and then our hero has to ask the other guy to ""apologize"" to herthey also later are going to do something ""to clear the path for the lady"". So, no. There are no new things in this movie. The camera movements are so done, the victory speeches are cheesy, falling down while being chased downGod! I'm amazed anybody would love this being as generic as it is.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

With stunning visuals, this movie does what its predecessors failed before to focus on the titans and not on the supporting humans, well at least not all the time. Battles involve adapting combat strategy and blending weapons with martial arts leading to some epic challenges that span for minutes at a time instead of a thirty second blast to the spark chamber. Combine this with the intense soundtrack and you get a collection of sequences that draw you into the adventure you've been craving for most of the summer. The plot isn't bad either, but movie goers like me will see how much they knocked off from other films. These mashed dynamics were nicely edited together, but I'll admit there are some tie-ins that are a bit overstretched for my taste and a bit lazy on their part. Unfortunately, the team failed the challenge of balancing combat between robots. Once again they built up an epic arsenal of robotic warriors, only to fail on giving them screen time, many having about four minutes of glory. Sorry, but what's the point of making these things if you're only going to focus on Optimus, I mean Gypsy. There are a few other things that this movie fails on, but overall it's a fun time at the movies, and in my opinion worthy of a trip to the 3-D cinema.

"","","Pacific Rim- Although Conceptually Intriguing and Entertainingly Absurd Guillermo Del Toro's Latest Film Lacks Both Lasting Science-Fiction Braininess and Creative Soul","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2830379/?ref_=tt_urv","generationfilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22971631/?ref_=tt_urv","12 July 2013","Two words come to mind that are generally synonymous with Mexican director/writer Guillermo Del Toro, an undeniably creative auteur who has a familiarity with various pop-culture mediums, multiple mythologies, and a keen sense of original storytelling, and those words are passionate and imaginative. Whether it's the brooding vampiric mythos of his debut film Cronos, the dark escapism of his fantasy tale Pan's Labyrinth, or even the colorful superhero interpretation of the Dark Horse Comics character Hellboy there is a distinct feel, tone, and beauty that links all of his varying yet inventive pieces together. His latest passion project Pacific Rim, a blend of Japanese pop-culture influenced monster films with a live action anime intention, undoubtedly shares a great deal of characteristics a majority of his other films possess, including his odd humor deviations, impeccable detail, and a particular visual tone, and yet doesn't possess enough to distinguish itself from the rest of the summer blockbuster parade of mediocrity. Pacific Rim opens with the potential of a truly original and intriguingly conceptual work for the science-fiction genre but the film not only leaves behind the braininess early on for too much loud, abrasive brawn it also doesn't possess enough heart in the lumbering beast of a film machine to make a true link between the director's passionate fun and the audience's potential sympathetic investment. Del Toro's intentions with Pacific Rim are clearly about making pleasurable absurdity with self-consciousness towards the ridiculousness of his own premise but it is unfortunately anchored down by its stilted dialogue, inappropriate uses of humor amidst often times boring drama, and incredibly limited performances interpreting apathetically developed characters. Instead of getting a usual dose of Del Toro creativity through makeup artistry, distinct set designs, and beautifully imagined characters we've been given a rather hollow and undoubtedly dumb CGI-fest of giant monsters, giant robots, and giant destruction which for the most part is amusing though highly disappointing. Though Pacific Rim contains a myriad of blockbuster clichés they are presented in a humorously self-referential fashion through Del Toro's signature imagination but the final product feels limited by the expansive use of freewheeling special effects instead of enhanced which is the usual outcome for a majority of typical, loud, and expensive blockbuster films.Read more on this review: http://wp.me/py8op-AC; read more reviews: Generationfilm.net","0 out of 7 found this helpful.
