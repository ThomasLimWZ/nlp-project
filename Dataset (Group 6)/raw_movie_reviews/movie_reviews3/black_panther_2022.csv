Mind-numbing boring. Sleep-inducing boring. ""Are we there,yet?""-boring.Dang, I liked Mr. Bozeman and they pay some propper respect to his character in the first couple of minutes and it really hits you in the feels but after that we are let known that Wakanda have mastered the technology of exposition dialogue. If that is their main achievement then I say we forget vibranium and let them slink back behind their stealth shield and call it a day.They could have done so much with this movie and show Africa as a vibrant place full of ideas and hope in the face of many problems. Maybe explore Ubuntu philosophy, or visual art. Unfortunately, Wakandan culture is reduced to a song&dance number for the day-trip tourists in cinema seats.This was a missed opportunity and almost a missed movie if not for a good double espresso I had before it.","761 out of 933 found this helpful.

"Phase 4 MCU's average movie to end an average phase","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8774552/?ref_=tt_urv","Benjamin-M-Weilert","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur100116496/?ref_=tt_urv","2 January 2023","As the last film in the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) proves that there was no plan for this phase other than to clean up the remains of the Infinity War saga. To its credit, though, Wakanda Forever was burdened with finding an in-universe replacement for the titular Black Panther after the untimely passing of Chadwick Boseman. However, considering how most of Phase 4 was passing the mantle from one hero to the next generation, it fits well within this theming.There's a line in Avengers: Endgame (2019) where Naka (Lupita Nyong'o) states that Wakanda is aware of an anomaly on the ocean floor near their country and that they were handling it. This throwaway line was likely played for laughs, but it's peculiar how Wakanda was woefully unprepared for the invasion of their land by underwater enemies, even though they clearly knew about it three years ago. Phase 4 of the MCU has highlighted how difficult it is to maintain continuity in a franchise as huge as it has become.Even though Marvel has introduced new characters in movies outside their own standalone works since the early Phases, I would have liked something more dedicated to introducing Ironheart (Dominique Thorne) considering how influential Iron Man was to the MCU. I also would have appreciated action sequences that weren't so dark or hard to follow, because I can't honestly recall any of them that happened in this movie. Overall, I felt the end of the MCU Phase 4 was average-which aligns with the MCU Phase 4 as a whole. Here's to hoping the next Phase actually goes somewhere.Phase 4 MCU's average movie to end an average phase, I give Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 3.0 stars out of 5.","196 out of 259 found this helpful.

Sadly none of that could save this terrible story which the director made it look like he was clueless as what to do with it. Not his fault really as it was woefully lacking in worth, tension, excitement, interest or quality in any way. My personal thoughts as I sat watching it (fighting hard with myself not to just switch it off) was that if they had no creative outstanding story for a sequel then Hollywood should have stopped just trying to cash in on what they thought would be a successful film franchise; whereas instead they made one of the most disappointing rubbish sequels of a film.They spoilt the memory of a great Black Panther and this will most likely do so bad at the box office that there may not be a third film being made in the future. Its the typical cash in if you can, from people involved in the putting together of the fans heroes, from directors and studios who don't give a toss about the Marvel/DC heroes and heroines; they are there too see if they can amass better wages and high end film contracts.In straight forward simplistic words, ""This was a bloody disgrace and only did damage to a superhero that has never had enough exposure!","372 out of 526 found this helpful.

"A big challenge that Ryan Coogler overcame!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8664025/?ref_=tt_urv","Matt-Canalcon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15712795/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2022","I want to start by saying I haven't been the biggest fan of this Phase 4 by Marvel that started with Black Widow in 2020, it's been hit & miss for me so I was nervous for the sequel to Black Panther. I'm happy to report that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a success. I think Ryan Coogler and his team hit a home run with Wakanda Forever by paying tribute to Chadwick Boseman and moving the story forward respectfully.I won't go into spoilers, but the movie starts with an emotional bang. Wakanda Forever builds on the great fondation that was established in the first Black Panther, a visual feast with breathtaking production design, fantastic costumes and impressive action sequences. The music from Ludwig Goransson is once again phenomenal, he creates a signature to this film that gives us the iconic sound of Wakanda while incorporing new themes for this sequel.Similar to the first film with Wakanda, there's a lot of world-building with the newly introduced Namor and the underwater world. This allows director Ryan Coogler to let his vision shine on the screen, it's spectacular to look at and the way they filmed the underwater sequences was truly astonishing. Ironically, most of superhero movies depend on their villains in order to succeed, they nailed it with Killmonger and what they did here is just as good, if not better.I don't think it's a perfect film, with a hefty runtime of 161 minutes, there are some moments that were dragging in the middle for me, but I think it was necessary for this film to be a bit longer than usual. Every character has their shining moments, Shuri is at the heart of this movie but Nakia, Okoye, M'Baku and Queen Ramonda all get their shining moments and a solid story arc that is rewarding by the end, so I don't really have an issue with the movie being this long.I have some other nitpicks that are spoiler-y, so I cannot really discuss them at the time. Everyone's motivation is clear and the main story is so engaging that I didn't really care for Marvel doing their usual ""laying the ground for the future"" stuff with certain characters (without getting into details). However, I can say that Namor was a terrific character, I absolutely love what they did with him storywise and visually. He absolutely slays during the action sequences, Tenoch Huerta is a great actor that fits the role perfectly, no surprise with the spot-on Marvel casting there.This is a movie to see on the big screen, without a doubt this is the best film the MCU has delivered in the Phase 4. The scale is epic but the film feels very intimate and personal because of what happened with Chadwick. The fact that they incorporated his passing into the story beautifully was so important & crucial. Ryan Coogler is probably the best director working for Marvel right now and I'm very excited to see what he does next after this big win.8/10.","405 out of 899 found this helpful.

I can't imagine how hard it was for everyone in the film to come back without a lead, and most importantly, their friend. Chadwick's passing is unbelievably sad but it did leave a gap for Marcel to fill, and they could have done it so well. But they didn't.Firstly, the good. All the emotional scenes were well-scripted and well-acted, and I have to commend Angela Bassett and Letita Wright for their fantastic acting. I never cry in the cinema but this film really had me going because it felt from the heart in some scenes, and I am sure it was.I also enjoyed the costumes - wow were they beautiful. The only one I didn't like was the Midnight Angels (or whatever they were called). They didn't feel like they fit. Some of the fighting was great as per.The rest of the film felt slow, boring almost. I've just come from the cinema and I am struggling to remember much of it.The story was gaping with holes and so much was skipped over with little explanation. The beginning when T'Challa dies felt cold and rushed. That should have been the pivotal moment for the story, but it was brushed over. However, maybe it was too hard for the cast and crew to linger on.The Talokan/Atlantis story was odd to me and felt so disconnected from Wakanda. I didn't enjoy that storyline. They could have made it so much better.Anyway, it was enjoyable and I'll maybe watch it again. But I won't rush to do that.","304 out of 428 found this helpful.

It's a better put together movie than both Thor: Love & Thunder and Doctor Strange & The Multiverse of Madness, and there is no sense it was butchered in the editing room, like both of those movies. That said I probably had more fun with those two.The Chadwick Bosman stuff was touching, but I expected more. Disappointed not to see at least, Bucky there. When I heard there was a cameo, I expected it to be someone at the funeral. I DID NOT see that cameo coming. I thought the Marvel logo was a nice touch.Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett are both good, but I'm not sure where this Oscar nomination talk is coming from. Then again, I didn't think Black Panther should have got a nomination for Best Picture, so she could get one. Winston Duke was a bit wasted as Umkaku, disappointed by what he did at the endThere is no reason for it to be as long as it is. I was bored a few times. I was especially bored during the story between Martin Freeman and Julia Drefuss, it was really weak and unnecessary. Was it just there to put some white people in it? I didn't like the scientist girl, she irritated me and had awful dialogue. Some of the CGI/Green screen work was not the best, too.I can safely say, with the exception of Spider-Man: No Way Home, nothing from Phase 4 will be rewatched, never mind find its way into my collection.Overall I found it OK.","284 out of 413 found this helpful.

It's been a truly inconsistent run of films. There was the good (Shang-Chi, Spider-Man, some of Dr. Strange 2), the eh (other parts of Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow and Eternals), and the ugly (Thor 4, which is easily the worst MCU movie so far). If this movie had been bad, it might have been enough to make me bail on keeping up with the MCU's movies, and truth be told, I've already bailed on the Disney+ series', because WandaVision, Falcon & Winter Soldier, and Loki really didn't do it for me.If you're expecting Black Panther 2 to wrap up Phase 4, you might be disappointed. But then again, there hasn't been a consistent narrative to the last two years of Marvel releases, so there's really nothing to conclude, overall. Importantly, it's just a very good movie, and that's enough to ensure it ends Phase 4 on a high. It's not a total slam-dunk, but there's a great deal about Black Panther 2 that's extremely effective, and enough great stuff that I feel the overall movie is a strong one.I think the pacing is its greatest strength. I really didn't feel the 2 hour 40 minute runtime. The opening half-hour doesn't flow the best, but there was a need to adjust after Chadwick Boseman's passing meant T'Challa died, too. Once the movie establishes this and sets up its main plot, it's pretty smooth-sailing, and unlike many Marvel movies, it saves its most emotional moments and best action scenes for its excellent final hour.It's a very emotional movie, and the way it pays respect to Boseman and T'Challa is essentially perfect. With good action, a solid story, a very good new antagonist (Namor and the whole underworld were great), and fantastic music (maybe the best Marvel score so far?), this was a very good MCU movie, and gives me a little more hope for the franchise going forward.","416 out of 984 found this helpful.

It has its moments, with some very solid dramatic acting work by its performers, but on the whole it is an admirable effort but also a major step down in quality from its predecessor. I personally feel they should have waited on a sequel, and take more time to figure out what to do with the Black Panther and Wakanda as the Marvel Cinematic Universe was progressing post Endgame and after the unfortunate passing of Chadwick Boseman. The loss of T'Challa is seriously felt in this story, and I think most would have been fine with a recast just a few years later, the new actor might not have been on Mr. Boseman's level, but they could have still performed the part well and carry the franchise further. As is, the mantle gets passed, and its executed just okay, but it would have more impact if the story were more focused. Namor is a nice addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is adapted fine, I would certainly like to see more of him in later installments. Still, you feel that the character probably should have come into the picture a lot earlier on, like in Phase Two or Phase Three at the least.","196 out of 269 found this helpful.

"Pays an appropriately sombre tribute to its recently deceased lead actor by showing how things can still move forward in the wake of his absence","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8666142/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","10 November 2022","""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is the sequel to 2018's ""Black Panther"" and the 30th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler (""Fruitvale Station"", ""Creed""), it pays an appropriately sombre tribute to its recently deceased lead actor by showing how things can still move forward in the wake of his absence.One year after the untimely death of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the African kingdom of Wakanda is still in mourning as they struggle without their beloved monarch to lead them. T'Challa's younger sister, Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), feels the immense pressure to take over as ruler but believes she cannot handle such a huge responsibility all by herself. Not long after, the inhabitants of the underwater civilisation of Talokan, led by King Namor (Tenoch Huerta), emerge to wage a war against the surface world. With limited time remaining, the citizens of Wakanda must quickly overcome their grief to put a stop to the Talokan threat before everything is destroyed.After the unfortunate passing of ""Black Panther"" actor Chadwick Boseman in 2020 due to cancer, the MCU was left with a complicated dilemma - should the sequel recast the lead role with a different actor or should they re-write an entirely new story without him? Either of these options would have been a risky move since audiences have become so familiar with Boseman's portrayal of King T'Challa (a.k.a the Black Panther) that it would be near impossible to accept anyone else in the role. It was soon revealed that out of respect for both Boseman and the fans that the latter option was chosen, with the character's in-world demise intended to mirror the actor's real-life death. Now with the release of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"", we see how all of this has managed to play out, in a follow-up that makes good use of its supporting cast while also remaining respectful to the foundations that have already been laid down.Anybody who saw the 2018 film will remember it has already been established that Wakanda is a place full of interesting characters that have helped this kingdom thrive for so long in seclusion. Because of this, it is believable that its citizens can continue to function without a King due to their personal code of discipline. However, due to their overwhelming admiration for King T'Challa, the Wakandans still feel a sense of emptiness with him no longer being around to lead them and as a result, they are living directionless lives. This is all conveyed to us primarily through the characters that knew T'Challa best and the audience gains a solid understanding of the grief they are each experiencing.I think the film does a decent job of exploring the concept of losing someone you deeply care about, whether it is a close family member or someone you admired from afar. In particular, we get a good look at how Shuri, the next in line to the throne, just cannot bring herself to take her brother's place as the rightful ruler of Wakanda. Despite her lingering heartache, Shuri, along with the rest of Wakanda's de facto leaders, must find a way to set aside her sadness to confront the looming annihilation by advancing enemy forces. Most of the film shows how not only Shuri, but also Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ramonda (Angela Bassett) all need to work together in order to prevent a major catastrophe from happening. I interpret this plot element as a metaphor for depression as a whole, since rising above intense emotional pain often requires the help of others. Because of that, this is a nice way of telling the audience that no matter how hard things may seem, there will always be others to aid them through their own personal difficulties.Due to the prevalent themes of loss and despair, this is the most melancholic film in the entire MCU library, even more so than the beginning of ""Avengers: Endgame"". Naturally this is a striking departure from the MCU we are all familiar with, which is usually light-hearted and fun for practically everybody. As a result, there are very few moments of comic relief to brighten the mood, and even then it does little to help alleviate the severity of a specific scene. If you are expecting the usual humorous situations that MCU fans have grown accustomed to after all these years or the characters constantly cracking jokes at a convenient time, you are going to be sorely disappointed.This film never wavers on its downbeat tone, with frequent reminders that the original hero is dead and not coming back. Of course, this is entirely understandable considering it would be disrespectful to not take into account Chadwick Boseman's monumental contribution to the series and the film plays along like something crucial is missing without him. Bearing that in mind, the film is still enjoyable in other ways. It does contain a number of good action scenes with some creative fight choreography and a deeper exploration of Wakandan lore to keep the audience invested. These are easily the most entertaining aspects of the film, as they remind us that Wakanda is more than simply the location where the Black Panther character originated. Just don't expect to be smiling too much during these highlights.Out of the three main actors whom the film chooses to focus on, I think Letitia Wright really shone the most as Shuri. Though we have seen Shuri do many important things in previous MCU films, I think it is here where we finally get to see her come into her own. Gone is the confident, meme-quoting sister of King T'Challa and in her place is a mournful, vulnerable young woman who misses her brother and just can't see herself taking his place as leader. Regardless of this shift in personality, Shuri still retains her intelligent side, which is featured much more extensively in this film than we've ever seen before. It's quite impressive to see how well Wright plays into Shuri's insecurities, never once exaggerating her emotions to the point of caricature or melodrama. Instead, she is shown to be a relatable human being, coming to terms with the sudden curveball life has thrown her.Though I must admit, none of this would have worked as well for Wright without the help of Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira as Ramonda and Okoye, respectively. As previously mentioned, they are all dealing with grief in their own unique ways but soon learn that working together to overcome it as a team is the best strategy. These characters feel like a real family, sticking together through what needs to be done to protect Wakanda from anything that threatens their existence. Even with the King no longer around to assist them, these three still prove themselves a formidable force against any hardship they may face.Given the unexpected turn of events surrounding the death of its main star, this film works surprisingly well with its remaining cast members and a more interesting look at Wakanda's place in the MCU. It's hard to say for certain how things may have turned out had Chadwick Boseman lived to reprise his role here, but if I had to guess I would assume we'd have gotten a more optimistic sequel without that feeling of loss hovering over every scene. Personally, I think they made the right decision not to recast and with all of that said, I am nonetheless convinced that Boseman would be pleased to see his legacy honoured in the best way possible under these circumstances.

A laugh here or there, PERFECTLY BALANCED (as all things should be). As someone who recently lost a loved one, the movie hit me in the feels hard, something I've come to not expect from a Disney/Marvel production. I mean seriously loved this movie. I also find it admirable how respectful the production was towards Mr. Boseman. I'm also glad they did not over play Ironman through Riri Williams. Of course there's always something to nitpick but they were completely overshadowed in my opinion. Someone please give Ms. Bassett a damn crown, she was a jewel in this film! I will 100% see this again!","66 out of 147 found this helpful.

This sequel was a hot mess. Wakanda is no longer even a semblance of a secret African country, just a location where black people are playing dress up in a movie. A lot of the storylines just fell flat. Some characters just appeared for 2 minutes and never heard of again.At times there was so much dialogue which did nothing to further the plot, where was the editing team? There are very few actors who can captivate the audience with their words none of those actors happened to be in this movie.The CGI was good and the action was pretty good. Its a Marvel superhero movie so I didn't expect much more than this. Black Panther was always a favorite comic book hero of mine and I am saddened that they could not do better for that legacy.","264 out of 342 found this helpful.

"A Fantastic, Emotional, and Mature Marvel Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8668856/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","11 November 2022","Black Panther was a very welcome addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe back in 2018 and I was really looking forward to seeing the progression of that character. Obviously, with the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, that just wasn't possible anymore. I figured they would recast the character and continue forward, but they made the tough decision to write the death of the character into the film as well. For that reason, I was worried and relieved all at the same time. It seemed like an impossible task to make a sequel to such a beloved film, but not have the core character there the entire time. Well, after seeing Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, I can confidently say that they handled it as well as they possibly could have. I thought this film was emotional and fantastic, and here's why.Picking up six years after the events of Black Panther (in accordance to the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame), this film focuses heavily on the loss of T'Challa and how the country can move forward without their leader. With the emergence of Namor and the underwater city of Talokan threatening all of Wakanda, the remaining characters must band together and protect their country. Shuri (Letitia Wright) is easily the one with the most screentime here and the burden of carrying this franchise is on her shoulders the whole time. This must have been a daunting task, but she pulled it off. Her character, along with her mother, portrayed incredibly well once again by Angela Basset, are the beating hearts of this film. The emotional aspect of this film got me on a few occasions.Some people may complain about the fact that the death of Chadwick Boseman is basically the jumping-off point for this story to even happen, but I found that it was very tastefully done. With the addition of other characters that will have a future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film was filled to the brim with story. Where I might have my only complaint though, is the fact that this feels like a big budget prelude to what will come next. It's a fantastically made film by director Ryan Coogler and I loved watching every minute of this one, but I have to admit that it did feel like more of a long eulogy for the passing of Boseman.With all of that said though, I'm only complaining about that because I'm reviewing it and criticizing it. That complaint isn't something I will regularly say about this film. They take the time to make a great film on top of that, so it really worked for me overall. I can't wait to see where certain storylines continue later and the fact that I'm excited about that, all while this film is satisfying on its own, is nothing short of great. I wept, I was entertained, and I was engaged in the story at hand, so what else could I really have asked for from this film? Also, the final scene that takes place during the credits is easily one of my favourite post-credit scenes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was very well handled. Now playing in theatres, I absolutely recommend checking out Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.","528 out of 1,364 found this helpful.

Instead, I want to focus on a question no one else seems to be asking: what is up with these Wakandans?I was a definite fan of the first movie, but as the sequel progressed, I found myself more and more annoyed (and irritated) by the film's semi-religious Wakandaphilia. Frankly, the constant self-adulation and smug sense of exceptionalism displayed by every Wakandan character really started to grate. After a while, what I'm sure the film-makers see as a message of empowerment starts to sound a lot like fascistic aggrandizement. If this degree of messianic self-love were displayed by characters in any other (real) country, it would be dismissed as overblown nationalism.Let's not forget, as the film itself points out, Wakanda is a superpower - possibly the most powerful nation on earth, thanks to its stocks of 'vibranium' - so it's difficult to swallow the idea that they are also somehow persecuted victims. Add to this the fact that they jealously try to preserve their monopoly of this most valuable resource, and its associated technology, and its hard not to see Wakanda as just another arrogant and self-interested power.Indeed, after a while, my sympathies shifted much more to the rival Talocans, who with some justification came to see Wakanda as more of a threat than an ally. Maybe the next movie could be called Talocan Forever, and show their side of the story instead.","658 out of 898 found this helpful.

Seeing wakanda vs Tolkan (sorry if misspelled) was thrilling and both sides had really good points and arguments. The performances across the board were perfect and riri made a great addition to the movie. I do have some issues with the movie however the action at points can be a bit generic and in the third act there's a montage used to try and get the characters ready for the final battle and feels a bit lazy.

"Unlikely to make the same impact as the original, Wakanda Forever is a mature and effective Marvel outing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8665634/?ref_=tt_urv","eddie_baggins","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8462477/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2022","A cultural phenomenon that was the rare type of film that struck a chord with critics, audiences, box office booths and the awards circuits, 2018's Black Panther was one of the most resounding success stories of the Marvel cinematic universe, with it always going to be a tough task for returning director Ryan Coogler to strike the same gold he did with his beloved first foray into the Marvel world.The task Coogler and his creative partners faced was made all the monumental by the tragic and shattering passing of T'Challa/Black Panther himself Chadwick Boseman, the type of heartbreaking real life loss the Marvel world has never had to overcome before in this way but against all the odds Black Panther: Wakanda Forever succeeds in somehow working with the passing of Boseman to make a cohesive film, that may not be ground-breaking, but offers up a very different type of Marvel film that is centred and driven by grief both imagined and real.Undoubtedly an entirely different film than the one that was first being developed by Coogler, Forever wastes little time dealing with T'Challa's demise and all of the films sombre moments of respect and consideration for the life of both the character and Boseman in turn is handled with aplomb here and when moving through the films (sadly overlong) 160 minute runtime, it's not too see and feel that this is an entirely different type of Marvel exercise that thankfully places the off-kilter comedic focussed mode it's been operating in since the early Guardians and Thor: Ragnarok days to deliver a more mature offering that's fairly likely to not win over the younger fans that have made Marvel their own over the last decade.With Boseman and T'Challa no longer the central focus of the Black Panther universe, much extra weight has been added onto the likes of Letitia Wright's Shuri, Angela Bassett's Ramonda, Winston Duke's M'Baku and Danai Gurira's Okoye, with all returning players once more delivering the goods for Coogler on the acting front with Wright in particular impressing with a character that is now largely far removed from the one we initially saw in the original.As is usually the case with a Marvel outing some of the best moments in Forever stem from the new players with Dominique Thorne's feisty and gung-ho Riri likely to be a new fan favourite (even if her role here is slightly forced) while Tenoch Huerta's new adversary Namor is one of the more effective ""villains"" Marvel has introduced in the cinematic landscape since the full reveal of Thanos many moons ago.Mostly recognisable from some TV work and mid-tier feature films, Huerta's take on the underwater dwelling Namor is a massive win for the film and much like Killmonger in the 2018 outing, his performance and character arc provides much weight to a film that without him may have felt like a lesser event, with motivations one can understand up to a point and enough development and growth where we can see so much potential both good and bad, Huerta and in turn Namor make us wish for more exploration of a whole new kingdom of Marvel that is hopefully explored even more than it is successfully but briefly looked at here.Another element of Forever that must be made note of and celebrated is the work of composer Ludwig Göransson who creates one of the most unique and noticeably effective Marvel scores we've yet encountered and while his work in the first film and other recent outings such as Tenet and The Mandalorian TV series showcase a talented artist at work, this is the type of score that heralds in the official arrival of a composer that could be about to shake the industry up in all the right ways.With a lot of elements to enjoy, Forever is unlikely to have the same type of impact either culturally or narratively as the first outing did and there will be some that find Coogler's close to three hour epic overly long in the tooth with a sagging middle section the most notable instance of running through the motions, while some side characters that appear set to play bigger parts merely come and go when it pleases the story, with the film at its best when it allows the likes of Shuri and Namor the time they deserve in the spotlight, especially without an Avenger or an unnecessary cameo in sightFinal Say -Considering the odds stacked against it, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is without question another success story for Marvel but not everything pays off in Coogler's high-reaching outing that overstays its welcome at times and may find itself fairly/unfairly judged against an original it's not going to match for impact or sentiment.3 1/2 wing feet out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","123 out of 316 found this helpful.

"A very mediocre movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8828158/?ref_=tt_urv","lorenzonicoli-98494","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur159305061/?ref_=tt_urv","26 January 2023","Really? Is this one of the most appreciated Marvel movies of the last two years? Just let me explain. This movie is not bad, it's just...average. The plot is really simple, just the classic hero that tries to save his (or her?) kingdom from a threatening new menace, who is Namor (that i must admit, he's one of the most characterized villains of all time in the MCU). The problem of this movie is the length, two and a half hours to explain a story that it would have taken just 2 hours maximum is too much. Then again, the tribute to Chadwick Boseman was really beautiful, but you can't just judge an entire film based on the commemoration of that actor. This movie is just really boring, too slow, and the third and final act is mediocre to say the least, with the final fight of the new Black Panther and Namor that lasts something like...30 seconds? (and i am really generous). It's another mediocre film of the phase 4, Ryan Coogler just had no ideas how to write this new film and decided to base the entire narration about loss and family themes but, unfortunately, it didn't work really well for him.","17 out of 35 found this helpful.

"Emotional, Mature Film With A Lot To Say","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8669056/?ref_=tt_urv","JayDeeezy","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur134485651/?ref_=tt_urv","11 November 2022","This film was special. We knew it was going to be emotional, but it ended up having a lot more to say than I anticipated. Themes of loss, grief, legacy, are also intertwined with a story our world's history of invasion and war over the balance of power and resources. It was definitely a long film for a reason but there was a purpose to every scene. Overall this ended up being one of (if not the) heaviest and most emotional films of the MCU.Starting with the cinematography - this film was absolutely beautiful. Wakanda is as vibrant as ever and Talokan was an awesome addition as a setting. The costume design, environments, colors, character designs of the Talokan's were just stunning and some of the battle sequences were amazing to look at.The plot was very good. Expectedly, I was crying 60 seconds into the film. A tragedy sends all of our characters into mourning but the relentless looming threats forces them to hold their heads up and choose their future. Shuri is ironically and poetically thrust into a very similar heroes journey focused on revenge that her brother originally walked during Civil War. In the meantime, Namor and his people are portrayed as a sympathetic people - victims of prior invasion. The common ground they share with Wakanda is very intentional and very interesting as a plot point. Even with different cultures and ideologies, the similarities between human beings are ever present and we are all vulnerable to conflict, hatred, and greed.The performances were incredibly strong - likely because the actors were in a sense living a similar story, which is awful, but it shows and they make you feel it. Angela Bassett is just stunning and powerful as Queen Mother. Leticia Wright just makes you feel every second of her grief. And Danai Gurira absolutely shines here - I've never felt so much for Okoye. Dominique Thorne was awesome as Riri and I'm very excited to see more of Ironheart.All in all, this was a special and beautiful film. It does get a bit long and serious in the middle for a superhero movie so people may find that hard to sit with, especially upon rewatch. But I think Ryan Coogler used that time to tell an important, heart wrenching story filled with grief but also hope and shined a light of respect and legacy upon the crew's late friend, Chadwick Boseman.","57 out of 147 found this helpful.

"Bloated but otherwise solid Marvel sequel","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9374370/?ref_=tt_urv","TheRetroCritic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4027771/?ref_=tt_urv","13 October 2023","The follow-up to the hugely popular Black Panther, which earned itself several Academy Award nominations back in 2019, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever had a tough job following the tragic death of actor Chadwick Boseman. Filming was interrupted with rewrites prompting reshoots as the film's release was delayed and Letitia Wright's controversial time on Twitter didn't help matters much.Wakanda Forever was tasked with building on the first film and concluding Marvel's Phase 4 as a new villain enters the picture, and a new hero is forced to step up and become the Black Panther. Wakanda is pressured by the rest of the world to share its vibranium resource, but Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) refuses so these political headbutts soon start to cause dangerous ripples. The bad guy this time is Namor, played by Tenoch Huerta Mejía, who breaks into Wakanda, threatening the country with an attack if he is not given the scientist who designed a machine capable of detecting vibranium.Losing the main actor in the franchise was always going to prove challenging for the filmmakers but the approach taken here feels appropriate: after T'Challa is given a considerable, moving send-off, the story continues and Shuri (Letitia Wright) eventually assumes the mantle. Having not one but two massive funerals in a film as lengthy as this one does hurt the pacing of the movie quite a bit, however. This is definitely a film that could have done with a bit of a trim but one suspects that necessary changes to the script caused the budget to inflate too much already so changing the entire plot was not really an option, which is understandable.All of that aside, this is a good sequel and the best film in Marvel's Phase 4 by far. The action sequences are big and exciting, the cast is on top form, there's plenty of drama and intrigue to hold onto, Namor is an interesting foe who lives in a bit of a grey area like Killmonger did and the new culture that is introduced is fascinating. The film takes what worked so well in the first Black Panther and puts it on a more global scale. On the minus side, the introduction of Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) falls resoundingly flat and Lupita Nyong'o is barely given anything to do as Nakia, a character that has felt criminally underwritten since the first movie.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever isn't a perfect film by any stretch, and it's hardly one of Marvel's very best, but it remains a thoroughly entertaining sequel with new environments to discover, characters going through a lot emotionally and a well done build-up to an all-out war that is worth the watch alone.Solid.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is a vast improvement over its predecessor offering (2018), if not the best picture to ever come out of the Marvel Universe. It's the kind of film that shows comic book movies can indeed go beyond action sequences and endless explosions to offer viewers something more meaningful and substantial, a result capable of silencing critics like filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who blanketly contend that these releases are without artistic merit. What's more, this second outing in the franchise has undoubtedly saved it from oblivion after losing its lead character in the wake of its initial outing with the untimely death of protagonist Chadwick Boseman. In addition to telling a compelling story, this film provides a credible bridge to the future while fittingly serving as a respectful tribute to its fallen star, one that honors the actor in a way that the movie industry unfortunately never did. Its tactful, reverential treatment of this issue is sure to evoke an emotional response, if not a few tears, in a truly loving but not maudlin way. Beyond that, the narrative and character development in this installment are also a significant cut above the original, telling a more engaging story with deftly nuanced themes that make its predecessor look comparatively simple. It also features fine performances by its ensemble cast, particularly Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and, most notably, Angela Bassett in a genuinely Oscar-worthy portrayal. But what's most impressive is the film's handling of its principal themes, delving into concepts that action-adventure offerings rarely, if ever, do, and certainly not as capably addressed as here (making pictures like ""The Woman King"" appear somewhat amateurish by comparison). To be sure, there are a few elements that might have been handled better (the picture is a little too long, it underutilizes the talents of Winston Duke, and there are a few too many James Cameron-esque graphic and cinematic attributes reminiscent of ""Avatar"" (2009) and ""The Abyss"" (1989)), but these are minor shortcomings in comparison to everything else the picture has to offer. Of course, it's impossible to talk about this release without noting that it probably wouldn't have the same onscreen impact were it not for the tragic offscreen story that has sadly accompanied it, though the filmmakers truly deserve praise for their sensitive handling of this matter without giving in to cheap exploitation or sensationalism, results that may very well have occurred in lesser-skilled hands. It's truly comforting to see that the ""Black Panther"" franchise has managed to weather this storm and to do so as well as it has. Wakanda Forever indeed.","129 out of 363 found this helpful.

There were hundreds of places I would have cut a second here, two seconds there, enough not only to bring some energy into the pacing, but also to buy more time to understand Namor's people. Little time is spent really getting to empathize with them. Even Namor's story lacked clarity and fleshing out.More than 90 minutes in, the story finally started to get interesting, with noteworthily well-done action sequences. But even then, it was painfully obvious that some sequences where done by entirely different teams, with completely inconsistent tonality.

"""Black Panther 2"" is beautiful and emotional, but it is not able to dedicate the necessary attention to developing each one of the several plots with ideal efficiency","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9550179/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","8 January 2024","""Black Panther 2"" divides its (ambitious) priorities in such a distant way, the film ends up not being able to dedicate the necessary attention to developing each of them with ideal efficiency, making certain key elements of the narrative sound weak and superficial - and it is no surprise that, when the time finally arrives for the protagonist and antagonist to face each other in the third act, the emotional effect caused by that fight never seems to result from an emotional escalation that had been building cohesively throughout the two hours and previous half, sounding, instead, like a technically efficient confrontation, but lacking in dramatic support. To make matters worse, if the 2018 film became an undeniable cultural phenomenon thanks to its surprising thematic ambition and its ability to articulate well the issues it addressed (and which it discussed with remarkable awareness and density), this sequel barely finds time to develop any political topic that it raises with a minimum of depth, collapsing under the weight of its own pretensions - which culminates in a terribly hasty and lazy resolution to the clash between Shuri, Namor and the people they represent (without spoilers, suffice it to say that the script simply decides to throw all the dualities he had been building under the carpet in order to quickly reach an outcome for all that).In this aspect, even as a ""film about grief"" Black Panther 2 does not fully work, since, instead of establishing the feeling in question as a central (or, at least, constant) piece of the entire narrative, the film only finds opportunities to develop the characters' pain here and there, in specific - and very limited - moments of the projection. That doesn't mean, however, that Coogler doesn't achieve moving results, and if there's something that certainly helps put ""Wakanda Forever After"" above the average of recent Marvel productions, it's the fact that most of the emotions the film attempts provoke sound legitimate, resulting from those that those responsible for the work felt in the first place. Thus, when we see Shuri, for example, crying when remembering her brother, the scene is recorded by Coogler with an introspective and melancholic delicacy that manages to bring the viewer to tears (or a lump in the throat, at least) without ever sounding manipulative or schematic - and, speaking of Shuri, it is important to highlight that Letitia Wright does what she can with great competence in both the scope of the action and the drama to give grandeur and dramatic dimension to a character who, until the previous film, was thought to be almost as a comic relief, being successful in embodying the heroine's suffering and doubts in the face of the role she now assumes, while Angela Bassett, even without starring in any action scenes, establishes herself as the most powerful and intense figure in the entire narrative, evoking Queen Mother Ramonda's pain as she deals not only with the sudden loss of her son, but with the threats made to the people she defends.Still, the highlight of this sequel isn't even a resident of Wakanda, but rather the underwater Namor, who takes on the role of the story's real antagonist even without ever becoming a villain. Presented by Ryan Coogler as an individual who, at first glance, does not exude any trace of intimidation (which is interesting, as it creates in the viewer the expectation that that character will be portrayed in a more ""stripped down"" way than the film eventually comes to believe). Portray, making his radical actions even more surprising than they already would be), the king of Talokan is played by Tenoch Huerta Mejía as a suitably unpredictable figure, being efficient as well as demonstrating a legitimate affection for the people he defends ( notice the pain that takes over his face when witnessing the loss of a subject), he also conveys intransigence and threat by vowing to exterminate those who get in his way - or harm him in any way.Obviously, one of the reasons for this change was to distance the character from DC's rival, Aquaman (Jason Momoa). Although Aquaman was inspired by Namor in the comics, the DC character debuted on the big screen before. So, to avoid criticism and accusations from those who don't know the stories, this distance from each other is quite logical. Furthermore, betting on Talocan instead of Atlantis is even a matter of coherence in the MCU, since Greek myths and legends were justified by Eternals (2021). And since they didn't even mention the existence of Namor, it makes sense that they move away from this mythology and focus on an underwater kingdom inspired by Mayan traditions. While Atlantis in ""Aquaman"" was excessively bright and colorful, Talocan has more sober and dark lighting, replicating the feeling of diving into an underwater cave. Not that it bothers you, but after building so many vibrant and colorful magical worlds, it's a brief disappointment that they don't explore the vibrant colors of Mesoamerican art as much to create this kingdom. On the other hand, the water movement of the people is more visually interesting than that proposed by the DC rival. In fact, this society's approach is much more credible. The customs, traditions, and activities of the people on a daily basis. The entire concept of the existence of this population is very well constructed and believable, exploring marine elements and animals as a functional part of this civilization. And as this is just the introduction of this nucleus, there is a colossal expectation for what could be shown in the future.What's more: the fact that he is the leader of a civilization of Aztec origins is fundamental to establish him as a counterpoint to the warriors of Wakanda, since, while this is an African nation that stood out precisely by resisting European colonization, Talokan is an civilization that (literally) succumbed due to the barbarities committed by the Spanish invaders, positioning one fictional country as a distorted reflection of the other - and, therefore, it is appropriate that costume designer Ruth E. Carter brings elements of Aztec culture to the costumes of the Talokanians and that production designer Hannah Beachler portrays the underwater kingdom as an abandoned, uncomfortable environment that only seems to endure thanks to its occupants' persistence in clinging to every scrap of past life they have left, sounding radically different from the hidden paradise that is Wakanda. (That at a given moment a North American agent sees some Talokanian soldiers and, without understanding who they are, deduces that ""They must be the Wakandans"" is something that exposes an obviously racist and generalist view on the part of that person towards foreign peoples - in a comment subtle but effective social-political aspect on the part of the film.) On the other hand, not even this justifies the excessive darkness that takes over most of the night and/or underwater sequences - and there are moments when it is almost impossible to see what is happening in the scene, even when that clearly wasn't Ryan Coogler or cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw's intention.The biggest issue to be addressed in ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" comes from the title itself: if, on the one hand, it takes too long until, finally, a new Black Panther is presented (and, finally, it only appears two hours after the beginning of the film, which in total is more than 180 minutes long) - and, when it happens, it is more due to the conjuncture of events than the result of a natural process of awareness and calling - little attention is also given to the continuity of Wakanda as a state - and cultural phenomenon. After all, since the object they possess, coveted by so many, will not be shared, these others try to divert their attention elsewhere. The clash, therefore, is between the USA and Talokan, without the former, in fact, even being aware of the existence of the latter. Wakanda was just unlucky enough to be in the middle of this dispute. All Namor would have to do was defend what is his, and that's it. What is the need, therefore, to go into confrontation against the only people also in possession of the same benefit? Watching Wakandeans and Talokeans face off is not only disappointing, it's manipulative. After all, there are two oppressed peoples - in an extra-filmic spectrum, it is Latins against Africans - killing each other, while the explorers (North Americans) remain at a safe distance, waiting for the first casualty to collect the remains. Of battle, like profiteering hyenas.As entertainment - it is important not to forget that, after all, it is a superhero film based on comic book characters - ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a delight to the eyes, right from the action scenes (Namor demonstrates a strong which deserves to be better utilized in the future), as well as the composition of new scenarios (the underwater world of Talokan is stunning). However, the very points highlighted in this paragraph make the best of the set clear: the newcomers from the bottom of the sea, and not the palace intrigues in a kingdom in the heart of Africa, which would be expected. Both Bassett and Nyong'o could have been explored better, and in the end, there are so many loose ends - what is Okoye's future? What does M'Baku want? What is Martin Freeman doing in the middle of all this? - that what is certain is that only one of the original intentions was achieved. Boseman is gone, and the grief at this unexpected departure is felt from beginning to end. However, not in a way that takes the whole thing forward, as seen in ""Fast and Furious 7 (2015)"", for example. On the contrary, it was made like an anchor, preventing such progress. And as it turned out, it's good not to play with what comes from the depths.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I liked the actor who played Namor and I'm becoming more and more of a fan of Winston Duke. Mr Duke has the rare ability to be both an action and comedy performer.Director Coogler had a very difficult task in directing this movie knowing that there would be a lot of real emotions from the fans on how they dealt with the passing of Chad. I think he handled this perfectly in my opinion. At the end of the day there is nothing you can write in a script to replace Chad.In summary, solid Marvel movie with great acting and BEAUTIFUL cinematography and musical score.

Directed by Ryan Coogler, this sequel to the groundbreaking 2018 movie ""Black Panther"" picks up where its predecessor left off, delivering a gripping story filled with action, drama, and heart.The film does a fantastic job of exploring the world of Wakanda and its people, delving deeper into their culture and traditions. The stunning visuals and impressive cinematography bring this fictional African nation to life, making it feel like a real place that audiences can connect with and root for.The characters are also a highlight of the film, with returning favorites like Letitia Wright's Shuri and Lupita Nyong'o's Nakia shining alongside new additions like Tenoch Huerta's villainous character. The performances are all top-notch, with the actors bringing depth and nuance to their roles, making the audience invested in their journeys.Moreover, the film tackles important themes like loss, grief, and the idea of legacy, which are all handled with care and sensitivity. The story also explores the concept of leadership and what it means to be a true leader, making it a relevant and thought-provoking piece of cinema.Overall, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a great film that pays homage to the legacy of the late Chadwick Boseman while also forging its own path. The movie is a fitting tribute to the first film, expanding the world and the characters in exciting and unexpected ways. It is a must-watch for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and anyone who appreciates great storytelling and stunning visuals.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

It would also give the audience more time to appreciate the production design and costumes. The appealing look of the film helped to give the character performances more impact. The story rightly avoids being about the missing main character, the now deceased Black Panther. His absence draws the movie's attention to the supporting characters, and they are given a lot to do.The large story justifies the long running time, sure. But the storylines could have been given more attention to the audiences' benefit. So good filmmaking all around. Angela Bassett commands the screen in Chad Boseman's place with great success.

Losing Boseman really killed the franchise unfortunately and I'd never say a bad word about Chadwick as I thought he was fabulous and perfect as BP. A Black Panther movie without the titular hero didn't seem like a good idea in theory and unfortunately that's what transpired in this film. None of the Wakandan side characters are all that interesting to start with. Their acting (apart from Bassett) is horrible. The girl that played Rori was annoying and extremely unlikable. Namor, however, absolutely crushed it. He kind of carried this awful movie. The director is also horrible. His movies are terrible. The writing was so dumb and there were so many plot holes and mistakes. They should have recasted BP honestly. I think that and a competent director/script are the only things that could have saved this atrocious movie.

Less action and more about honoring Black Panther's death, if felt more real considering Chadwick himself passed; it was also more political handling the passing of power and as I did my best to avoid spoilers and teaser trailers, I've found out the big secret was already revealed in a leak. I'll try avoiding the spoilers.As said earlier, this one doesn't not only like focus on wakanda, it widens it's scope to the whole world. It increases the stakes, making it seem like an elaborate plot scheme. I loved that it was evenly matched throughout, Wakanda seemed to have better tech but Talocans seemed to be stronger fighters.Namor had a really cool, mysterious intro. M'baku was hilarious, the movie was generally quite comedic for the first half but unlike other recent marvel movies it fortunately wasn't forced humor. Action felt seldom especially considering the runtime, but after watching the first black panther just before they were better. It's slow paced so this isn't as blood rushing as other marvel movies, don't expect constant tension or fights. Everyone was as good as you'd expect but Angela Bassett gave an amazing performance and stood out. As was the first movie, I still feel like Andy Serkis is an underrated perfect casting.Opening scene honors T'challa and opening credits for Chadwick, it's continued throughout. It had flashbacks and tributes that made the movie more of a farewell to both, everything seemed secondary.I watched this as a double feature with the first back to back and Wakanda Forever is better. I didn't really have high expectations as a lot of Phase 4 productions have disappointed me, and some of the projects that I actually liked were met with criticisms.End Game carried a lot of emotions a closure to Phase three, this has to be the most devotedly emotional in depth marvel movie, not because of the fan love but because it was written that way. Might not be the best at it but for a superhero movie it was. It was a great way to honor Chadwick and a good movie, I however didn't get that feeling leaving the cinema like I had just seen something special. You know, the way you felt after endgame, even though that's a high bar. The movie still does an impressive job and difficult task bettering it's prequel without it's beloved star, delivering the most emotional take in the MCU thus far.","60 out of 166 found this helpful.

And then on top of all that, the story for this feel has to be one of the weakest (except for Thor: Love & Thunder). I feel like Marvel studios thinks that if they put in enough jokes and enough comic references that we will look over lazy writing. But they are wrong!

Her poise and strength was fantastic , as were many of the performances. It balanced loss with humour , which is no easy thing to do. Aside from the great acting , the fight scenes and cinematography were excellent. There were even a few scenes which almost had me in tears of both joy and sadness. I am really glad they brought many of the characters back and developed them a bit more. If you liked the first , I would highly recommend this one also. Loved it.","22 out of 51 found this helpful.

Since then i cant say the same. This is not to say that they didnt handle the death of Chadwick Boseman well. Thats honestly the only redeeming factor in this whole story.The journey that the story took before even the credits rolled and just shows the range that Letitia Wright has, was totally shown in those first 10 minutes. For the rest these were performances that just seemed that they were taking the cash and running. I cant enjoy a film like this. The only other actor like this was Winston Duke who yet again a fun addition to a very bland filmStory, well its just the same as aquaman but from the opposite point of view! The Oceans were the bad guys and the land were the good guys who didnt have a quick treasure hunt half way through. The whole film was just setting up another story and im slowly losing interest in the MCU if they keep putting these types of stories out.I cant wait to see if they can produce any good stories going forward since maybe 2 or 3 stories have been good in the latest phase of the MCU.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

What even was this?First of all, this movie focused way too much on the loss of the late great Chadwick Boseman and instead of just using a short time on that and the rest on the plot, they instead focused mostly on Chadwick and very little on plot. It's truly a shame. But i'm not even that mad, since I did expect this little from this awful sequel.On top of that, it was very unnecessarily long. I felt like I wasted 2 hours and 46 minutes of my life which i'll never get back. Everything after Endgame sucks, and this is by far no exception. This might even be up there for my least favorite MCU movie, right up there with Eternals and Black Widow. Also, let's not talk about the awful casting of Namor. Absolutely dreadful, don't recommend.","79 out of 107 found this helpful.

However, the plot is thinly spread out over its tedious runtime instead of being consolidated into a tighter narrative and is also undermined by its bland execution, uninspiring action & dry effects.There is hardly any sense of awe & wonder evident in its spectacle, the underwater kingdom is surprisingly unappealing, and even the action scenes are terribly choreographed. The film was doing better when addressing Wakanda getting challenged by intervening world powers during its state of mourning. Still, the performances help keep things afloat and Angela Bassett steals the show with a commanding showcase.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is an inferior follow-up that also qualifies as Coogler's weakest directorial effort to date. The story begins with plenty of potential but it fizzles out as it trudges the 161 mins runtime with nothing new or exciting to offer. A mediocre entry in what has been a mediocre phase for Marvel Studios, their latest offering is another forgettable dud in the canon that impresses & entertains in only bits n pieces.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

The storyline had a nice flow from beginning to end. The action and Sci fi was entertaining. Solid directing and acting. Angela Bassett was the most compelling actor in this film. She carried the first half of this film on her back and it's close to 3 hrs long. She was definitely snubbed at the Oscar's this year. I watched both films and Angela definitely outperformed JLC for supporting actress. Honorable mention also goes to the actor who played Namor (villain). During his scenes I couldn't take my eyes off of him. I hope to see him in more roles. Where the movie lacked was in that tension heart racing feeling that action-dramas are supposed to evoke. Also there was zero comic relief. The film maintained a serious tone all through out, in contrast with other Marvel films. There were maybe 3 or 4 times throughout the 2.41 hr film where they even attempted a joke, and they weren't funny or landed flat. Even with these flaws, overall it's entertaining.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Directed by Ryan Coogler and starring an ensemble cast of incredible talent, the film manages to live up to the expectations and legacy of its predecessor while also carving out its own unique space.The plot of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever picks up where the previous film left off, after the death of T'Challa, the king of Wakanda. The film explores how the nation and its people are coping with the loss, as well as how they must navigate new threats to their way of life. The themes of family, legacy, and responsibility are woven throughout the narrative, as well as the larger themes of power and what it means to be a leader.The acting and characters are top-notch, with returning cast members such as Letitia Wright as Shuri and Danai Gurira as Okoye and Angela Bassett delivering standout performances. Newcomers to the franchise, such as Michaela Coel and Tenoch Huerta, add depth and complexity to the already rich cast of characters. Their performances bring to life the emotions and struggles of the characters they portray, making the audience invest in their stories and their fates.The direction by Ryan Coogler is masterful, showcasing his ability to handle the intricate and emotional beats of the story. The film's score, cinematography, and production design work seamlessly together to create a breathtaking and immersive world that transports the audience to the fictional nation of Wakanda. The special effects are stunning, and the editing and pace keep the story moving forward while also allowing time for character development and emotional resonance.The dialog in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is both intelligent and engaging, as characters grapple with weighty issues such as loss, grief, and the burden of leadership. The film balances these moments of reflection with thrilling action sequences that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The tone of the movie is a balance of seriousness and levity, making it an emotional rollercoaster that will leave the audience feeling a wide range of emotions.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a worthy successor to the original film, and a fitting tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, who played T'Challa in the first film. It celebrates Black culture, elevates the voices of Black creators and performers, and delivers a powerful message about the importance of community, tradition, and hope. It's a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer, and one that is sure to resonate with audiences for years to come.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

In order to somehow fix this broken continuity, Wakanda Forever was born, but it feels like a movie made by committee (which it probably was). It has good acting, but choppy plot. It has things appearing out of nowhere when the story needs them and characters that behave inconsistently throughout the film. It has problems in editing! At one point the music just glitches because they removed a scene late in postproduction, probably. It has women of color running everything: Black female Panther, Black female Ironman, Black female Black Widow, Black female Queen. It's not that it hurts the story in anyway, but it gives the impression that they dumped everything they had in this film just to make it not suck. I mean, they added Mexicans, too. They were trying to take the Wakandan jobs. Ok, bad joke, but the whole concept felt more racist than whatever I can say.It's not a totally bad movie, taken as a standalone, but in the context of so much source material and so many previous good MCU films, it does suck. The best part was Lupita Nyong'o. Her character weas interesting and she is so beautiful!In the end they drop a post-credits scene that ensures the possibility of a replacement for Chadwick, but I don't see how, unless they add some ""go to ancestral land and return 20 years older"" plot.Bottom line: compared to the first Black Panther movie, this film was accompanied by overwhelming silence. It's easy to find things to make fun of in it, but the fact that not many people even bothered says a lot. This is a run of the mill, committee approved flatliner.","12 out of 30 found this helpful.

It's a devastating loss, and Coogler and the rest of the cast and crew were reeling from that loss. Coogler made a genius writing choice by making the characters in Wakanda Forever go through the the exact same emotions that the actors themselves went through. All the characters in this film are struggling to come to terms with a loss that they did not expect nor do they fully understand it. In that way we immediately relate to them and are sucked into the story because we as audience and fans of Chadwick feel the exact same way. Coogler made the absolute best of an heartbreaking situation.Wakanda Forever is a geopolitical drama about loss, grief, pain, revenge, suffering and healing - all in the disguise of a blockbuster. Unbelievable performances by the entire cast. Especially Angela Basset, Letitia Wright & Tenoch Huerta. Basset portrays the role of the struggling queen, the grieving mother so believable und raw it's tour de force of acting. Wright also has to relieve every single emotion an actor can show I was completely blown away by her as I did not except that a previous supporting character could carry a movie so well. Lupita Nyong'o as usual is phenomenal, with every scene she's in she injects an extra load of charisma and life into the movie. Her presence is mesmerizing. Danai Gurira's Okoye and Dominique Thorne's Riri bring the humor and laughs to the film, and they were great.And oh boy Marvel Studios just put a new superstar on the field - Tenoch Huerta as Namor is a delight! Raw, almost mystical, full of energy and power. A worthy follow up to the amazing Killmonger. Talocan's introduction is a highlight of the movie, it may be even more fascinating than Wakanda's introduction in the first movie. So visually dazzling, creative and rich in Detail.The VFX scenes where Namor is attacking ships don't look good in parts even unfinished which I found frustrating at times especially because the rest of the movie looks so beautiful.The movie constantly thrives on the cathartic, wonderful, touching and unbelievably atmospheric directing and writing by Ryan Coogler. Ludwig Göransson's score is absolutely incredible. There's a scene in the ancestral plane, it's my favorite moment in the movie - the setup, timing, dialogue and exposition here are peak cinema. Chadwick Boseman's spirit radiates through the whole movie. Everything is build around him, his character and the legacy he left. Coogler and his team honored Chad in the most beautiful and respectful way possible. This is a movie that transcends it's medium. It something very special that will be remembered forever. Chad would be proud.Cinema.","19 out of 54 found this helpful.

It is hard to believe that if the sad passing of Boseman had not happened, the movie would have been good with the Talokan as the main plot.

It's quite long compared to the usual scale of standalone movies in the MCU. Therefore, for those who love movies with many action elements, it will make you feel boring. However, for me this is a good movie and brings a lot of emotions. It is the story of women and how they overcome the pain of losing a loved one. Besides introducing new superheroes, Phase 4 is also a healing phase after the End Game, and this movie does a great job of that. I feel like I've been with the characters through their pain and finally over it. I love the silence scenes Ryan created, it's a great way to pay tribute to Chadwick.The movie is great but I still can only give it 8 points because the Talokan scene is poetic but a bit dark, if it were a little brighter, it would be better but still ensure the aesthetic and realistic level that the director wanted. In addition, Iron Heart's performance has not left me too much. I will be looking forward to Dominique's better performance in her own movie.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Her scenes in whole were wonderful. But that is just about it. The movie was a complete waste of time with mediocre story and horrible costumes. We ALL miss Chadwick Boseman. He was and always will be the BLACK PANTHER. There is no other - he was the king! But in that is the problem because there is NO ONE left to carry the mantel. And no - Disney - Suri unfortunately is not the answer. Neither is transformer look a like version of ""not-an-Iron-man"" whatever her name was. I am sorry.I hope Disney reads this because it might help them fix the disaster slate of TV and movies, they have created post end-game.You CANNOT REPLACE the actors that helped build the MCU. YOU CANNOT. It will not work and you further alienate the fans that give you their hard earned money for each cinematic release. You must expand into new characters!!!Iron man is dead. Captain American is old. Black Panther passed away and so did Black Widow. Hawkeye is now retired and that is where it ends. You need to begin finding NEW CHARACTERS TO MOVE THE FRANCHISE FORWARD.

Jordan and the late Chadwick Boseman stole the show in the first Black Panther, every cast member in this sequel delivers an amazing performance.Letitia Wright in the main role delivers the most range, from grief to fury, far from the cocky savant in other Marvel movies.Angela Basset is supposed to be a queen, but amps it up to Goddess.Danai Gurira takes haughty warrior to the next level, and navigates it through a fairly dramatic arc.The less-melanin-endowed - Tenoch Huerta, Martin Freeman, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus - also bring their a-game, dropping lines like bombs throughout.Everyone has so much swagger that those with slightly less screen time, like Winston Duke, Dominique Thorne, and Lupita Nyong'o are drowned out or do not get the development they deserve.There are so many important characters that some disappear for big chunks of the film. Wakanda Forever, at 2 hours 40 minutes could have been 2 films, though I was never bored.It's a pity that the great performances are poorly supported by forgettable dialogue and clumsy plotting.Even with that handicap, the actors go beyond having chemistry to be more like pieces of flint striking each other and giving off sparks. The tension is picked up by decent camera work, zoom, and framing.Which brings me the worst part for me. The 2:39 extra-wide aspect ratio is best suited to wide Imax vistas, of which the movie has very few. When used on ensemble dramas, the cropping of characters becomes distractingly clear as does the empty space to the sides. (I kept checking my TV settings to see if they were the problem.) It's even wrong for the battle sequences, which instead of being wide line clashes play out vertically, on tall structures or surface-to-sky.Despite these difficulties, Wakanda Forever is full of actors and characters I would love to see again.""Uhambe"" for now.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

In the case of Black Panther, it is explicit that the loss of Chadwick is, and tends to remain, an open wound with serious difficulties to heal.This second film in the saga presents the mourning and rebirth of the most interesting character in the current Marvel Universe.The richness of Black Panther continues: extraordinary scenarios, afro futurism, good action scenes and a great evolution in the special effects, but setbacks in the construction of the narrative.Weak plots take up much of the film, exposing Letitia Wright's difficulty in so suddenly assuming the leading role, making her a supporting character in a film that often seems to be about Namor, played by Tenoch Huerta.Unfortunately, Wakanda Forever's emotions point to a weak resolution, which doesn't exploit the story's dramatic potential.A wonderful, but not groundbreaking, blockbuster which will likely earn another Oscar nomination for Ruth E.

They HAD to make a movie and find some way around it. The tribute to Chad was very well done and I think this movie had one of the best soundtracks of any marvel film. Namor is the antagonist, but he wasn't really the villain. To me they showed that they were just like the Wakandan's and would do anything to protect their home/kingdom; even though the Wakandan's didn't agree with their methods. There isn't really anything wrong with the film, but there was nothing memorable. There were some action scenes that felt like they were copy and pasted from previous marvel films.

He and everyone else involved didn't really have much of a choice for him not to be in it. So what was the other options? Never make another Black Panther film? Deep fake him for the rest of his MCU appearances?This sequel was a great tribute to Chadwick. A great sequel overall. And for me personally, I might prefer it based mostly around the villain(s).There were a lot of unfair comments based around the actor playing Namor before anyone actually got to see him portray the character. Mostly based around his looks. In my opinion, he did a great job at portraying this character; you could empathise with him and his people, whilst they also came across as very intimidating and pretty spooky at times. Also Namor is actually very easy on the eyes if I do say so myself 😌Riri Williams didn't irk the way people made her out she would, obviously basing their initial opinions on the comic version of her which is fair. But she came across as pretty grounded and likeable to me.The soundtrack was fantastic and I have no complaints in terms of VFX. The actors' performances were top notch as to be expected.So generally, no complaints from me.

The movie serves as a tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, who passed away in 2020, and it's clear from the opening moments that his presence is deeply missed.The film is set in the fictional African nation of Wakanda, where T'Challa (Boseman's character) has passed away, and his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) is struggling to come to terms with his loss. The plot revolves around the various characters trying to honor T'Challa's legacy and protect Wakanda from external threats.The movie features a stellar cast that includes returning favorites like Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Winston Duke, as well as new additions like Michaela Coel and Tenoch Huerta. The performances are all top-notch, with each actor bringing their unique voice and energy to their respective roles.The action sequences are also a highlight, with director Ryan Coogler delivering some of the most visually stunning and exciting set pieces ever seen in a superhero movie. The special effects and production design are also remarkable, immersing the viewer in the lush and vibrant world of Wakanda.However, what sets Black Panther: Wakanda Forever apart from other superhero movies is its emotional depth and heart. The movie tackles themes of grief, loss, and legacy in a poignant and resonant way that is sure to leave audiences moved and inspired.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman's legacy and a worthy sequel to the original film. It's a thrilling and emotional ride that will please fans of the genre, but also offers a message of hope and unity that is sorely needed in today's world.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"Wankada Forever has a lot going on","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8896256/?ref_=tt_urv","Entertainmentsparadise","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur131752399/?ref_=tt_urv","27 February 2023","Upon my initial watch of Wakanda Forever, I was slightly underwhelmed, coming in with no expectations. However, the film had a lot to tackle in a short two and half hours long movie. It did appeal heavily to emotions. Of course, the film focus on the mourning of T'Challa. But it also has an arduous task of attempting to fill those shoes and introduce us to a new world and antagonist. All of which can serve as a stand-alone central theme for a movie. With that being said, I had a tough time grappling with the development of the plot, the main issue, and how it all culminated. Unfortunately, the revenge aspect was the least convincing arc of this film.What stood out to me was the disrespect to tradition and the illogical methods afterward.Although some critiques ultimately led me to compare my feelings for the original Black Panther film, there were also some good ones.As I mentioned earlier, the emotions were on point. Angela Bassett acted her ass off in this movie. Also, what's a Marvel movie without a cameo or introducing a new character from the universe? Also, did we finally hear the word ""Mutant"" in the Marvel cinematic universe?Ultimately Wankada Forever has a lot going on; it thrives by including representation and political aspects while also incorporating three challenging elements of mourning, development, and integration. While that's positive, it is also a fault; I left the movie feeling underwhelmed by what I watched. I feel this is the filler movie that needed to tie up loose ends and project us into the next sequence. The ending credit scene was the icing on the cake. Therefore I rate Wakanda Forever a 7/10 3.5
Long live the King.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"Solid Follow Up with Big Shoes to Fill","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8918431/?ref_=tt_urv","Reviews_of_the_Dead","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23318905/?ref_=tt_urv","10 March 2023","This was a movie that I was intrigued by what they would do with the untimely and sad passing of Chadwick Boseman. I wasn't sure if they would replace the character or just carry on the movies in name only. It was one that I didn't catch in the theater so I watched it at home on Disney+.We start this with a heartfelt remembrance to King T'Challa (Boseman). Shuri (Letitia Wright) tried to save him but failed. Ramonda (Angela Bassett) has assumed being queen again, this time in full control. She is more ruthless than her predecessors. There is good reason though. Other places now that they know Wakanda exists is trying to take advantage of them and get their hands on vibranium.It turns out that they're not the only location on Earth that has this precious metal. Riri (Dominique Thorne) is a student at MIT and she's created a machine that can search for it. The United States' government. This draws the attention of a threat to Wakanda. One that is more advanced and stronger. They're led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta) and this explains what happened to the Mayans. The Wakandians are also faced with the CIA and Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). If you've watched the Disney+ Marvel shows, she's popped up a few times and is doing things behind the scenes.So that is where I'm going to leave my recap and introduction to the characters. What I'm going to start with is that I remember when this movie was projected to come out. People were wondering who was going to take the mantel of the Black Panther character. Who does is the character that I figured would. It falls in line with what the MCU is going toward and it works for me. I won't spoil things, but it should be obvious in my opinion.Now this one didn't seem to have the same buzz that the original did. It was a big deal, especially for the Black community since they had a superhero that matched their race. This one I think does well in continuing with similar themes. There are jokes made toward Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) about him being a colonizer. We also have Riri and Shuri who are both young Black women who are genius level of intelligence. That adds an element. What I find interesting is that we are pitting Wakanda against Namor's people who are indigenous to Central America. I don't have an issue there, but we are pitting two minority groups against each other.That is where I want to go next, Namor and his crew. I had to look it up as this character is normally a hero. He is the Marvel version of Aquaman. He almost might be one of the first superheroes for Marvel as well. I did find it curious that he's our 'villain' here. They did complicate him though to the point where the lines of both sides are blurred. They both have good reasons to fight and can be problematic. That adds maturity to movies like this for me. I am curious as to where we are going to go next with this character.I will then go to the acting. I'm not sure Wright is as strong an actor as Boseman, but I don't mind her taking over as our lead. She plays well with the strong cast around her. This one brings in Lupita Nyong'o, who I'm a big fan of. We also bring back Danai Gurira, Winston Duke and Bassett. They're all good. I liked Tenoch Huerta as Namor. Freeman, Louis-Dreyfus and Thorne are also good. The cast as I've said is just good. They helps carry this for sure.Then finally will be the filmmaking. This is well-made. I don't know if this is a stylized as the previous one. It still is a fun, popcorn action movie that has a bit more to say underneath the surface. There is a lot of CGI, but I come to expect that. It looks good with that Disney money for sure. There are no issues there. I'd also say that I like the soundtrack. It has an African flair to it that adds more culture. I'd recommend this if you like the original or you're going through the MCU. This is worth at least a watch.My Rating: 7 out of 10.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Angela Bassett as Ramonda, Letitia Wright as Shuri, Danai Gurira as Okoye, and Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia all give powerful performances as their roles were expanded from the original movie. Two new actresses joined their ranks -- Michaela Coel as Aneka, and Dominique Thorne as Riri, both stepping up in their hero game.The new anti-hero Namor is played by charismatic Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta. The film gave him the full backstory dating back to the 16th century, telling the origin of his incredible abilities, and even how he got his name. Even if Namor was the main antagonist of the film, Huerta played him as a passionate protector of his undersea city of Talokan and the Vibranium that sustained it. His comics name Submariner has yet to come up.Director Ryan Coogler's production design, costume design and hair and makeup teams outdid themselves in this sequel as they did not only designed Wakanda, but also Talokan. In the comics, Namor's underwater kingdom was called Atlantis, inspired by Greek mythology. However in this new film, Atlantis was given a decidedly Mesoamerican civilzation, from its architecture, costumes, language and culture.Even though lead actor and original Black Panther Chadwick Boseman had already passed away two years, Marvel made this sequel a beautiful tribute to his memory. From the specially altered opening credits all the way up to the emotionally-rich mid-credits scene, and all the scenes in between with lines that looked back on the life and extolled the nobility of T'Challa, Boseman was still very much part of this new film.","261 out of 820 found this helpful.

Whilst the visuals and actors make this film a 6/10, the storyline just fell short, by a country mile. It doesn't seem to flow, seemed rushed and the ending was just a bit rubbish. I'm gutted. It feels as though there were 2 movies here that have been blended to make a single movie. It's a darned shame really. The Wakandan addition to the MARVEL screen universe opens up so many opportunities for incredible stories and this one, so soon after Chadwick Boseman's passing just lacks 'direction' it feels like it was rushed out rather than put together in good time.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

What unfolds is a layered story worried less about action. The performances all round are truly excellent and you forget this is a mostly women cast (not that it matters) When the action and stakes are ramped up by the third act it feels earned, not just edited in. I love the score, I love the moments of quiet and almost slowness and that it took its time. I loved the comedy sprinkled through. Also the 3D had moments but mostly I didn't notice it. A couple of negatives, runtime feels a little long and I could have done with a little more action but these are nitpicks to what is ultimately a great movie and touching tribute to Chadwick Boseman.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/10I'll preface this by stating that I do NOT understand the mixed reviews. There is not one element of this that I would've done differently.This 2-hour-and-41-minute epic had me hooked from start to finish. No other Marvel property in my opinion, particularly in Phase 4, can match this level of quality, and that's in no small part due to Ryan Coogler, Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, and the incredibly talented (not to mention gorgeous) newcomer Tenoch Huerta.The talent on display in *every single element* of this film is going to be tough to match, even from next month's Avatar: The Way of Water.Speaking of Avatar 2, they now have some SERIOUS competition in EVERY Oscar category next year, thanks to this film. I could honestly see this sweeping every category and making a strong play for Best Picture.The acting: Fantastic. Angela Bassett is magnificent. Letitia Wright is wonderful. Tenoch Huerta brings a depth to his Namor that is rare in any film, much less a Marvel one.I believe he is perhaps an even better incarnation of the already-deep Killmonger from the first film. It's hard not to see the world from his perspective at least once.The technical craft: Spectacular. I haven't wanted to visit a new world so badly (the underwater world of Talokan) since the first Black Panther sent me to Wakanda and the first Avatar sent me to Pandora. It. Is. Breathtaking.The score: Unparalleled. Ludwig Goransson has outdone himself with this. It's even better than the first film. It's my favorite score for a movie in years.The writing and direction: Masterful. Ryan Coogler deserves recognition for elevating this DRAMATICALLY above anything else offered up in Marvel's mixed-bag Phase 4. Coogler manages to make an above-par Marvel epic that has meaningful things to say about loss, grief, sisterhood, motherhood, friendship, and moving on, while also ending on a POWERFUL and prescient note about how nations should treat each other in this post-modern world we all inhabit.What else is there to say? I loved every minute of it.","52 out of 145 found this helpful.

You can tell that they purposely dialled down the usual MCU humour to give this movie the somber tone it needed. The memorial scenes at the beginning and ending of the movie are handled very well. They are respectful of his legacy and poignant. And although the beating heart of the first movie in Boseman isn't there, Letitia Wright still manages to pull off a rousing and impressive performance, stepping into Chadwick's shoes and taking up the mantle of The Black Panther. Another superb performance inside of this movie is Angela Basset as Queen Ramonda. With her scenes at the UN and the throne room being highlights. Tenoch Huerta is also very good as Namor. Who although is different from the comics is very interesting as a character. Another bright spot in the movie is the visuals. Coogler really nailed it here. There are many simply breathtaking shots especially in the underwater scenes and Wakandan scenes. Another strength is the side characters. Riri Williams played by Dominique Thorne is fun when on screen and it made me more excited for her Disney + show. As always, Winston Duke's M'Baku was very cool. And Martin Freeman returns again as Everett Ross and although he has a minor part to play in the movie's story, he is still enjoyable. Despite all these positives the movie definitely isn't perfect. It is overlong and perhaps too light on action (although when there is action it is done very well), the movie sometimes feels too slow-paced and it potentially could have devoted more of it's runtime to paying respect to Chadwick Boseman. Another odd thing I noticed was the designs of some of the characters and costumes. Some of them feel slightly derivative at times. Especially Namor's people, who look a lot like the people from Avatar. Which was especially funny since the cinema I watched it at played trailers for Way of the Water before the movie started. Another odd thing that I noticed was Ironheart's suit. It looks more like the Red Power Ranger suit or Samus's suit then a Iron Man style suit, with that being said though, it was nice to see some Iron Man style action again.All in all, I really liked this movie and thought it was a fitting tribute to Boseman.I'll give it an 8/10.","15 out of 45 found this helpful.

The acting is quite appalling when you consider the budget these films have it is scandalous to think they can't find any convincing actors but I guess they're not bothered about the quality. I breve it's got to a point that these Marvel franchise films are just so complacent that they feel they can just churn out any old story, regardless to how poor it is and expect a very healthy profit and sadly this does seem to be true. There is a reason for this which won't be discussed at this time but is a sad reflection of where we have gad to come to. I'm sure the next Marvel film will be just as poor but that won't stop people raving about it.","21 out of 26 found this helpful.

They had a great story to tell, but it never rose above mediocrity. Many unnecessary subplots and lame jokes took away the gravitas of the story. Namor and his nation of Talokan was very intriguing, Okoye's action scenes were really tense, Angela Bassett gave a fierce performance, fantastic Costume Designing and Music. But Shuri in this new avatar remains unconvincing, the hard shift her character takes doesn't feel earned. Also sloppy editing and pacing and the scale of the war felt wrong. These are two of the most powerful Nations in the world, felt more like two village tribes fighting. Another disappointing Phase 4 film...","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever - Navigating Grief and Expectations in a Mature Marvel Outing""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9094882/?ref_=tt_urv","doyler79","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23616134/?ref_=tt_urv","2 June 2023","7/10
Unlikely to make the same impact as the original, Wakanda Forever is a mature and effective Marvel outing
A cultural phenomenon that was the rare type of film that struck a chord with critics, audiences, box office booths and the awards circuits, 2018's Black Panther was one of the most resounding success stories of the Marvel cinematic universe, with it always going to be a tough task for returning director Ryan Coogler to strike the same gold he did with his beloved first foray into the Marvel world.The task Coogler and his creative partners faced was made all the monumental by the tragic and shattering passing of T'Challa/Black Panther himself Chadwick Boseman, the type of heartbreaking real life loss the Marvel world has never had to overcome before in this way but against all the odds Black Panther: Wakanda Forever succeeds in somehow working with the passing of Boseman to make a cohesive film, that may not be ground-breaking, but offers up a very different type of Marvel film that is centred and driven by grief both imagined and real.Undoubtedly an entirely different film than the one that was first being developed by Coogler, Forever wastes little time dealing with T'Challa's demise and all of the films sombre moments of respect and consideration for the life of both the character and Boseman in turn is handled with aplomb here and when moving through the films (sadly overlong) 160 minute runtime, it's not too see and feel that this is an entirely different type of Marvel exercise that thankfully places the off-kilter comedic focussed mode it's been operating in since the early Guardians and Thor: Ragnarok days to deliver a more mature offering that's fairly likely to not win over the younger fans that have made Marvel their own over the last decade.With Boseman and T'Challa no longer the central focus of the Black Panther universe, much extra weight has been added onto the likes of Letitia Wright's Shuri, Angela Bassett's Ramonda, Winston Duke's M'Baku and Danai Gurira's Okoye, with all returning players once more delivering the goods for Coogler on the acting front with Wright in particular impressing with a character that is now largely far removed from the one we initially saw in the original.As is usually the case with a Marvel outing some of the best moments in Forever stem from the new players with Dominique Thorne's feisty and gung-ho Riri likely to be a new fan favourite (even if her role here is slightly forced) while Tenoch Huerta's new adversary Namor is one of the more effective ""villains"" Marvel has introduced in the cinematic landscape since the full reveal of Thanos many moons ago.Mostly recognisable from some TV work and mid-tier feature films, Huerta's take on the underwater dwelling Namor is a massive win for the film and much like Killmonger in the 2018 outing, his performance and character arc provides much weight to a film that without him may have felt like a lesser event, with motivations one can understand up to a point and enough development and growth where we can see so much potential both good and bad, Huerta and in turn Namor make us wish for more exploration of a whole new kingdom of Marvel that is hopefully explored even more than it is successfully but briefly looked at here.Another element of Forever that must be made note of and celebrated is the work of composer Ludwig Göransson who creates one of the most unique and noticeably effective Marvel scores we've yet encountered and while his work in the first film and other recent outings such as Tenet and The Mandalorian TV series showcase a talented artist at work, this is the type of score that heralds in the official arrival of a composer that could be about to shake the industry up in all the right ways.With a lot of elements to enjoy, Forever is unlikely to have the same type of impact either culturally or narratively as the first outing did and there will be some that find Coogler's close to three hour epic overly long in the tooth with a sagging middle section the most notable instance of running through the motions, while some side characters that appear set to play bigger parts merely come and go when it pleases the story, with the film at its best when it allows the likes of Shuri and Namor the time they deserve in the spotlight, especially without an Avenger or an unnecessary cameo in sightFinal Say -Considering the odds stacked against it, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is without question another success story for Marvel but not everything pays off in Coogler's high-reaching outing that overstays its welcome at times and may find itself fairly/unfairly judged against an original it's not going to match for impact or sentiment.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Still, worth a watch for sure, especially if you are a fan of the the 1st movie. Many of the same themes remain. Overall, quite lacking and it's riding on the previous film's coattails for sure. I'm not gonna lie... I got really bored through part of it and just wasn't sure what this movie is trying to say, and even why it was made. So a part of me feels like this is the Director getting to be a little more artistic and edging away from MCU, but at the same time, it also feels like a bit of a money grab because I don't know why the story needed to be told.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

There are action scenes but they don't take a big part of the movie. There were some really good 1v1 fights, but a battle was a little boring.The ending is very emotional and closes Wakanda's story well, but there could have been a more detailed ending.In short, I think it was a great, emotional movie, and I will definitely watch it again, but the ending might be strange for somebody.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The acting remained strong, with notable performances from the cast. The music added depth to the film's emotional resonance, and the casting was generally well-done, introducing new characters seamlessly. Cinematography showcased the vibrant world of Wakanda beautifully. However, the direction faced the challenge of honoring Chadwick Boseman's legacy, resulting in a somewhat fragmented narrative. The writing had moments of brilliance but struggled to balance multiple storylines. The film's strength lies in its dedication to exploring the legacy of Wakanda, but it also grapples with the weight of expectations, which occasionally hampers its flow and cohesiveness.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"The Beautifully Crafted Film Is Heart Wrenching, But Showcases The Power Of Identity, Culture, Family And Pride","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8666911/?ref_=tt_urv","rannynm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1257208/?ref_=tt_urv","10 November 2022","The beautifully crafted film, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is heart wrenching, but also showcases the power of identity, culture, family and pride. The costumes are intricate and gorgeous; the music is moving; and the acting is just spectacular. I felt captivated during every moment of the film, and the nearly realistic world of Wakanda made me feel like I was there myself, even though it is futuristic and fictional.The storyline follows Princess Shuri (Letita Wright) and the Wakandan army as they fight to protect Wakanda from a new force that threatens to attack their home. After the heartbreaking passing of King T'Challah (Chadwick Boseman), Shuri and her mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) are left with the weight of the country on their shoulders. They must band together with Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), General Okoye (Danai Gurira), and young scientist Riri (Domonique Thorne) as they constantly battle to save the only home they know from an otherworldly army, which threatens the secrets of Wakanda's renowned Vibranium. Will they win this excruciating battle, or will Wakanda fall?Letita Wright, as the protagonist, Princess Shuri, performs beautifully. Her acting choices and authentic emotion are captivating. While this film is dark and somber, there is still enough comedy to keep you chuckling, just at the moment when a little happiness feels most necessary. The music in this film is perfectly aligned with every sequence in the story - powerful in battle scenes; sorrowful at moments of loss; and uplifting in moments of triumph. Without the music, viewers would not be so easily transported into Marvel's Wakandan world. The intricate and bedazzled costuming is gorgeous, displaying the marvelous variety of design from diverse cultures around the world. And last, but most certainly not least, the visual effects and CGI are spectacular. The beauty of Wakanda's futuristic world and technology is so real that you can almost touch it.There are many messages in this film, but two stand out to me the most. First, always trust your heart; it will lead you in the right direction no matter how many paths there are to stray from. Second, no one is ever truly gone, they will live for as long as their memory lives inside you. These messages are uplifting for everyone who needs comfort. Although there is violence in this movie, there is not much gore. The use of a variety of weapons makes this film more appropriate for older children and teens.I give Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

"Barely surviving the tragic death of Chadwick Boseman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9713059/?ref_=tt_urv","glenaobrien","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54033747/?ref_=tt_urv","1 April 2024","It's hard to bounce back after your lead actor tragically dies. There is a touching effort to honour Chadwick Boseman here. The Marvel opening logo sequence which normally showcases all the tentpole characters is dedicated exclusively to Boseman's Black Panther and there is some footage of him from the first film spliced in. His absence, however, is very strongly felt, leaving this second instalment somewhat flat.We need to talk about Prince Namor, the Submariner. His introduction to the MCU has been eagerly anticipated and certainly there are some things that get the character right including green shorts, winged ankles, pointy ears, and a surface-world hating narcissism. The character was created (by Bill Everett) in the Golden Age of comics, debuting in Marvel Comics #1 (1939). In WWII, he sunk both Allied and Axis ships with an equal hatred for the surface dwellers. This made him an interesting portrait in neutrality. Of course, once America entered the war he was enlisted to fight alongside Captain America and the Human Torch to smash Hitler and the 'Japanazis.' In the Silver Age he became a rival for the affections of Susan Storm and an antihero who often came up against the Fantastic Four and other Marvel heroes as a less than friendly semi-ally but he always kept his distance from tbe surface dwellers. In the 1980s he was rebooted by John Byrne as a business-suited corporate eco-warrior. He continues in the present timeline most prominently as a member of The Illuminati (though not included in the Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness (2022) iteration of that group).The major change in the MCU version is that Namor is reconfigured as a mutant descended from the ancient Mayans, rather than Lord of the undersea kingdom of Atlantis. I get that this provided an opportunity to set Latin American culture alongside African American culture in (potential) joint opposition to 'the colonisers' (a gag that worked well in the first film but is mercilessly flogged to death here through multiple repetitions). I'm not a purist and I understand that retconning is a staple of comic book creators. If it works in the world of sequential panels, there's no reason it can't work in cinema. It probably also helps to distance the character from DC's less than stellar derivative, Aquaman. Maybe it's my affection for the character but I just couldn't buy the Mayan thing. The blue skin, yes, and the kingdom under the seas, all good, but when Namor uttered his famous cry, 'Imperius Rex!' it fell a little flat for me, given the reconfiguration of the origin story. Mexican actor, Tenoch Huerta, does a fine job but in all the Submariner comics I've read, I've never heard a South American accent in my head. Okay, maybe that's my problem and not the film's but, still, it affected my enjoyment of it.Enough about Namor. The film is nominated for five Oscars, including Best Music, Best Costume Design, Best Special Effects and Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role (Angela Bassett as Ramonda). Martin Freeman is back as the White Guy and Julia Louise-Dreyfus is introduced as his ex-wife and government agent. Letitia Wright is back in the role of Shuri and gives a good performance as do other cast members returning to their characters. There has to be a replacement for a new Black Panther and there are two offered here that indicate that Marvel wants to keep this hugely successful character in the mix. Whether it can survive without Chadwick Boseman's definitive performance is yet to be seen.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

You could just made a basic superhero with a star and everyone would have loved it. Instead you made an unnecessary movie and most people will not be interested when you make another one. You've thored it. Or iron man 2 and 3ed it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie is an emotional rollercoaster and a presence of sadness is felt throughout as we also mourn the death of our Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman. This movie was humorous, sad and exciting all in one! It is a perfect balance of emotions and isn't overdosed with unnecessary humour, like in the most recent Marvel movies. Namor is a brilliant character and a worthy opponent, who Wakanda stand an equal chance against, which makes this movie so anticipating. This movie delivers exciting action scenes and a storyline you will never forget. Wakanda and talokan are so beautiful and intriguing that every time the movie turned to the CIA, I immediately wanted to go back to Wakanda and talokan. The only thing I would change about it is, we didn't get much screen time with M'baku, Namora or Attuma. I also don't like how Everot Ross was added in just for the lead up for future movies as this was easily recognisable as he played no major part in the storyline of the movie. However this was such an exciting experience and it feels as if I could watch it over however maybe not too much. Overall, this movie represents the passing of Chadwick Boseman beautifully and for that reason, he will forever be in our hearts.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

My expectations from Marvel movie is that they have to be sharp, about 2 hours mark (except for Avengers) and lots of actions. This movie is none of these. The movie is quite long, a lot of talking and is on very less actions. Plot wise few things don't make sense. Clearly missing Chadwick's charm.Good: CGI look slick. There is some humour and little bit of predictable suspense factor. Movie is high on emotions.I am a big fan of superheroes movies but this one along with Thor 4 has been disappointed for me. In fact, I have found Black Adam more entertaining than Black Panther 2.I wish Marvel invests more into action sequences in such a long movie and also shorten the length in general.","9 out of 10 found this helpful.

My main problem is having an actress physically ill suited to the role. Don't care if she's eaten the herbs or wears the powered suit she looks anorexic to the point of looking skeletal. That's not an appealing look for a superhero. The movie is too long and has little action though the three action set pieces are well done and the director uses slow motion to great effects. The movie's main strength is its villain Namor ( though I know they changed his origin completely ). The actor did a good job and the origin presented here was unique and interesting. As always the special effects are top notch. Marvel has done a great job with its casting and getting the actors physically fit for their roles but here with the main protagonist they failed miserably and I have to say the Wakandan's forever superior attitudes were so annoying that I was half rooting for the Talokans. Definitely one of Marvel inferior efforts.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

The opening is dedicated to Chadwick Boseman in a beautiful and powerful way. Is the movie Predictable? Yes. But not in a bad way. In my opinion the sequel is actually better than the first. Which was even more predictable. The acting is probably the best I've seen in any Marvel movie. Miss Basset is just perfect as a queen and very convincing as a mother. Her acting was Oscar worthy.Tenochs acting is also very good. He plays Namor with passion and belief. I haven't heard from Tenoch before this movie, but I am sure we will hear a lot more from him in the future.Namor is a villain with a vision that is predictable but also makes sense. You could in a way, root for him, because his fear is not unrealistic. Namor is a different kind of villian. He could have easily become the (anti) hero. If they had switched the story up just a little bit.Please don't focus on all the reviews but just go see this movie!","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

"MCU Phase 4 and T'Challa get neat closure! [+69%]","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8848531/?ref_=tt_urv","arungeorge13","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30872044/?ref_=tt_urv","3 February 2023","The MCU Phase 4 fatigue has definitely sunk in, and gone are the days of one or two tentpole entries per year. For someone who has seen every film in the MCU until Endgame, I've grown dispassionate about having to keep up with too many spin-off TV shows and such and such. I did watch most of the films from Phase 4 (barring Eternals) but I was quick to notice that you had to be aware of events from some of the shows to fully comprehend certain plot points. However, the enchanting world of Wakanda wasn't one you could see in any other films, and that somehow made it distinct. Also, the passing of everyone's favourite Chadwick Boseman made me want to know how director Ryan Coogler would move the Wakandans' story forward.Wakanda is still beautiful as ever, but it takes its own sweet time to acknowledge the sorrow and loss from T'Challa's death. It's a recurring theme throughout the film; one that solidifies the decisions taken by Shuri (who's the new Black Panther). It also helps that the key characters we loved from the first film are all given their moments to shine, be it in set-pieces or on the emotional front. The antagonist's entry was powerful but his backstory lacked depth. Danai Gurira (Okoye), Lupita Nyong'o (Nakia), and Angela Bassett (Ramonda) occupy screenspace for all the right reasons.I'm a bit divided on Shuri's sudden ascent to becoming the next Black Panther (even the suit agrees?). The whole scenario plays out too quickly for us to get too excited about it. I didn't care much for the entire episode in the US, or the random addition of Riri Williams / Ironheart. Also, it'd be difficult to look past the resemblances between Avatar 2's Metkayina clan and the Talokan army portrayed in this film, especially given the aquatic setting and the release dates of both. The set-pieces are impressively crafted, and even though they're limited in number, they make you sit up each time. The mid-credits scene is a sweet little tribute, and it succeeds in working our tear glands. Ludwig Göransson's score is pitch-perfect!","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

This one however was extremely refreshing, with a much more powerful emotional scenes, awe inspiring visuals and quite fresh designs of two exotic nations. The almost all female ensemble on the side of Wakanda delivered really great performances and the Namor was also depicted in fascinating way, that will probably make him one of the most interesting villain/anti-heroes of the whole franchise.

I can appreciate some of the special effects in this movie, but some of the story line is just way too silly. The villain, as an example, has flapping wings on his ankles??? Come on man......seriously? Someone needs to be fired over that stupid detail. A lot of Disney movies are overplaying to that Disney youth viewer and that's ruining the true potential of these movies. Let's get back to a serious Marvel movie. I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this flick. I would have felt like it was not money well spent. It's passable, but no where close to being one of the better Marvel movies. If you are a fringe Marvel fan, I'd recommend you pass on this and spend your time elsewhere. The people that super love this movie tend to be super Marvel fans that blindly think all Marvel movies are amazing.

That means he made Wakanda Forever a deeper film, with more dialogue and meaningful interactions between characters.Angela Basset's dynamic performance is breathtaking. It feels like she really carries the whole film. There are also quite a few subtle non-verbal interactions between characters, that channel their thoughts and feelings seamlessly.The costumes were already a strong card of the Black Panther world, but now they ascended in a whole other level. You really can't take your eyes off the colourful designs.Also, i am glad the aesthetic of Wakandans is now much more native African oriented, than African-American. That means less rap and swag, to my relief. It reinforces the antithesis with the brilliant choice of making Namor's people ancient Mayans, as well.The relationship Wakanda forms with the foe kingdom of Talocan, reflects a new relationship that forms with itself, forcing it to look within.Wakanda Forever succeeded all that, after tragically loosing the actor who plays the character with the franchise's name. And doing it respectfully, in top of that. Boseman was a perfect choice for the role and i am glad they didn't recast him.Which brings me to the bad stuff.The successor isn't worthy of the mantle in a lot of ways (morally, physically, emotionally), and it shows. The movie almost winks to the audience, every time it happens. In the first movie, T'Challa almost died and the whole country fell into civil war just to stay impartially consistent to their own rules. But all this is now out of the window. Stuff are now just plate served, just because.The final conflict resolution has a certain reasoning behind it, but the rushed delivery makes it a bit childish.Riri Williams really wasn't necessary, at all. An anonymous character could be in her position and everything would be exactly the same. Not to mention that flying around in the battlefield makes her vulnerable and her whole plot point invalid.It is a personal nitpicking, but it puts me off to see civilisations talk underwater without even air bubbles out of their mouths. Looks lazy filter work, but that maybe is just me.Overall, i had lower expectations for this film, given the circumstances and some impressions from the prequel. But it had me a invested until the very end. If only Chadwick was alive, i would love to see him be a part of it.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

And I thought the actors were really good, I wish they would have stuck closer to the comics though for Namor but he did a really good job also. I also think that they shouldn't have called Marty Freeman colonizer seeing how he helped them in the last one and was helping them in this one, he was their friend and you don't call your friend bad names.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

"Better Than the Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8942835/?ref_=tt_urv","Eric266","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23467935/?ref_=tt_urv","21 March 2023","By now, everyone knows that this movie was made after Chadwick Boseman's untimely passing. Many of the critics have trashed it as bloated and boring. I can agree on the first criticism, but not with the second. Considering the events under which it was being made, this is actually a really good movie.As the movie opens, T'Challa is dying. His genius sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright) is frantically trying to develop a cure. Sadly, he passes. The kingdom of Wakanda is thrown into crises as T'Challa's mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett) becomes queen. She resents the council as they aligned with Kilmonger in the original movie, but she does trust M'Baku (Winston Duke) who took her in during that trying time. After an international survey team discovers vibranium on the depths of the ocean floor, a society of ocean dwellers known as Talokans appear and kill them. Their king, Namor (Tenoch Huerta) emerges from the ocean wishing to form an alliance with Wakanda. When this alliance does not work out, a battle ensures between the two nations. Shuri is kidnapped by Namor while being guarded by Okoye on a mission to rescue a young scientist, Riri (Dominique Thorne). In a rage, Queen Ramonda removes Okoya from the Royal Guard and enlists the aid of Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), T'Challa's former girlfriend.The cast is really good and you can sense the pall that fell over them making this movie. The funeral scene for T'Challa is moving and intense. Its probably the highlight of the film as the pace and choreography are perfect. Angela Bassett brings plenty of gravitas to the scene and Letitia Wright is appropriately grief stricken. The backstory for Namor is well handled and kind of makes sense since a meteor did hit the Yukutan peninsula (bringing the vibranium that was later discovered) as well as explaining the sudden disappearance of the Mayans as they became sea dwellers.Where the movie falters is the run time and the need to keep impressing upon us how smart Shuri and Riri are by having them do some serious mental gymnastics. (This is an issue with all of the Marvel movies to include Tony Stark figuring out time travel overnight). Also, Nakia's rescue of Shuri and Riri is pretty preposterous. There is an implied love story between Namor and Shuri that had some serious potential for audience by in and character conflict, but it gets dropped almost immediately. Its a shame because some of this run time could have been used for a romance plot to give the proceedings some stakes for the final conflict. And that is my other big critique of the film. The final battle is just a CGI mess. Looks like a bunch of ants running around on a toy boat.This was a good effort to keep the legacy of the Black Panther alive. While it is not perfect, it was entertaining and I wasn't bother so much by the run time as I was by the use of it. The acting and cast are top-notch. The scenery is beautiful and the cultural touches are wonderful.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

But somehow this film managed to be even better than the first installment. Angela Bassett is always excellent and leads the ensemble of excellent players, and the audience, on an emotional journey of grief and adventure. The introduction of Tenoch Huerta (again excellent performance) as Namor is exciting and it will be interesting to see where his character goes from here. The film is a bit long but the cast is so good that their performances outweigh the length. Yes there's many effects and action scenes as we've come to expect from Marvel movies but after awhile I even forgot this was a Marvel movie and was caught up in the drama.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

About 90% of the movie consists of scenes with a couple of people in a room talking to each other. Insanely boring.There are a couple scenes that are ok but they are so short compared to the dialogue scenes. The part where they visit the underwater kingdom is great but it's brief and underdeveloped.I'm not exaggerating when I say that about 45 minutes of this movie consists of a few people taking in an underwater cave. The writer and director of this movie should retire immediately. I can't even imagine what would happen if a little kid went to see this. Expecting Marvel superhero action and instead seeing a half baked underwater equivalent of 12 Angry Men.","14 out of 17 found this helpful.

At the time of writing this, this film has a higher rating than black adam which I just cannot understand. Black adam was funny and entertaining. This film has no humor whatsoever which is a shame. So it loses points for that. For the money that was clearly spent on this film I was disappointed. The first half of the film is introducing us to army 1. We already know wakanda which is army 2. Both talk in alien languages throughout most of the film and it is hard to follow the story as a result. I feel it would have made more sense if this was played out on a completely foreign alien planet which I just pretended it was most of the film. A lot of gibberish and there is a bit of action but nothing as entertaining as black adam provided. Why does army 2 invade army 1? I don't know. Maybe this was mentioned in the gibberish that I could not understand through half the film but whatever the reason, it was just a fake reason over a fake element called.vibranium. Nothing I could really relate to. I should really give this film a lower score but there was a lot of good flying spaceships... Anyway the enemies leader called Fishman was just a complete joke, and not in a funny way. It's a flying fish man like spider man who has pigeon wings to make him fly. Like what? Check it out and you will see what I mean. He has pigeon wings to make him fly. It's hilariously stupid. So I cannot relate to why this film has such a high rating at the time of writing this review. I have liked wakanda films so far but this one was just a let down. Wakanda has been portrayed as pretty much invincible, in charge of vibranium and the most advanced technology on this planet so what could marvel do to enhance their story? Not much to be honest but this just felt like an embarrassment. So yes they create a new invading army that feels the need to invade wakanda for what reason, I still don't know. Half way through the film once the fighting actually starts I thought, ok this must be the reason for the high rating but after a 5 minute fight that leads to nothing much there is then a lot of gibberish talking again, a big outrage, a bit more talking, a bit more talking, followed by more talking. What happens to fish man? Who knows - the talking is more important at this point and fish man loses his screen time. We are now approaching the end of the film and there is still more drama, over what? Not really sure. If you are a fan of tv soap drama's this might be right up your alley but if you like action films avoid this travesty. There is 5 minutes of action at about the 90 minute mark of the film that fizzles out into nothing but drama. The wakanda council convenes to plot a plan. The final battle takes place resulting in a big water sports spectable. Nothing you would expect from a 21st century marvel fim. Maybe one of those low budget horror films where a bunch of tourists get attacked by a giant shark. You know the type of film I mean. Anyway that pretty much concludes the film and my less than impressed review. Clearly others have enjoyed this more than me. The ending actually gets worse than I have revealed in my review but I will not give away marvels glorious final twist too much. Lets's just say for a fake battle the ending was the most pathetic ending I have seen in a film in the past decade along the lines of peace is more important than war. I mean I agree with that message but this was meant to be an action film, not a lame drama.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

After the sudden death of the lead they not only had to deliver a movie but also try to pay an emotional tribute to Chadwick Boseman. And they kinda did.God, the movie does feel like forever. It deals with Wakanda mourning it's king and finding new ways to protect itself and it's resources in the increasingly hostile world.The move opens up with a 6 minute funeral scene that was design to pay tribute to Chadwick. It's a touching tribute. But the movie never really picks up in any meaningful way after that. A bit too much ""tell"" and not enough ""show"", full of long scenes filled with unnecessary dialogue that slow the movie way down and kill any momentum it might've otherwise built up.The production is fairly strong, Angela Bassett is very good as the queen of Wakanda. Even CGI is better than the first Black Panther. But the movie is far too long and suffers as a result. Won't go into too much detail not to spoil it for anyone and ultimately everyone will have their own opinion. But it's a very slow and fairly disappointing movie with stop and start action and the feeling that it's not sure what it wanted to be. Instead of an amazing tribute to Chadwick Boseman we get a forgettable movie that tries a bit too much to play on our emotions and forgets what it was supposed to be.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Namor (Tenoch Huerta)Aztec-like Namor rules the prosperous underwater kingdom, Talokan, but is impressed by the thriving African nation, Wakanda, both nations having their secret wealth tied to a powerful ore, vibranium. As in the case of gold in other African nations, they need to protect their wealth. Yet, Wakanda has lost a wealth far greater, their deceased King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman).Writer/director Ryan Coogler (with co-writer Jake Robert Cole), nurses the melancholy of regret to make another blockbuster addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that deals with mortality seriously, not casually, as the usual case. With Namor's Latin resemblance, Wakanda Forever also gently extends the Universe.In Wakanda Forever. As he did in Black Panther, Coogler crafts a memorable mythology with sterling actors, gorgeous sets, and colorful costumes. This sequel thrives, despite the tragic loss of Boseman, because it depicts an essentially good people (think the USA) peaceful until roused to national fervor protecting their natural resources and their pride.In the background lies the African history of exploitation and colonial slavery. Wakanda could have been real if not for those barbarians. The best exemplar of the proud fictional nation is its matriarch, Ramonda (Angela Basset), who would rift a loyal general and friend for a battle screwup.The real future of Wakanda is Shuri (Letitia Wright, the late King's sister), whose braininess and boldness promise the ""Forever"" of the title. Because she is modern and openminded, she can dance the diplomacy dance nimbly, especially with the confounding complications of the underwater kingdom. Wakanda Forever's universal tough love promises we will have many more confrontations with countries and personal ambitions.

After the real life death of Chadwick Boseman, who played King T'Challa of Wakanda in the first Black Panther, it looked like this film was on the verge of not being made, but Ryan Coogler pulled off the impossible and made it work while also following key details from the comics. The film honors Chadwick Boseman in the best way that can be done and is probably one of the saddest movies of the MCU. Shuri played by Letitia Wright steps into the shoes as the lead character in this film and pulls it off successfully while using real life elements to fill in the shoes of her on screen brothers role. This is also hands down Angela Bassett's best role she's ever done as the current leader of Wakanda following King T'Challa's passing and as well as one of the best performances by an actor/actress in the MCU and superhero movies period. She steals the show in every single scene she is in and knows how to grab the audiences attention making her one of the standout characters of this film. Tenoch Huerta who played the villain Namor is phenomenal and one of my favorite villains currently in the MCU. He brought us a villain that wasn't always bad and always tried to do things for the best of his people, making him a villain that audiences alike can relate too. It was great to see some of the old cast from the first Black Panther again as well as newcomers such as Riri Williams Iron Heart. It's also worth noting that the visual effects on this movie were probably some of the best to come out of Phase 4. Overall, this is a powerful film mixed with real life elements that pulled off what was thought to be impossible to do, only to pull it off in the end in a big way. Rating 8/10.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Which they absolutely nailed through this long fun movie.I wasn't optimistic about the idea of making a new Black Panther movie, without T'Challa, the only black panther we consider . However, this was definitely the best way to make such as a movie .The ending was very open to new possibilities, it's kind of scary but they gave themselves a space to consider making more movies in Wakanda.The amazing water environment in this movie and visuals in general were stunning , I'm not going to compare it to ""Avatar: the way of water"" once again because I haven't seen it yet and this movie's visuals and production design are astonishing anyway, but the spotlight for me were the soundtracks that were unbelievable , I loved themAngela Bassett's performance was indeed remarkable, as everyone else did a good job, the villain this time was different than what we used to see, but he was fine overall .","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

You can really feel some scenes like you're in them. The cinematography was also really good but of course the movie has it's weaknesses...For example some characters seam unnecessary, don't do much to the plot and are not so good written and every scene with them just doesn't feels right, but at the end it's a good movie.So if you're a fan of the first movie you will probably love this movie so go watch this movie but even if you're not a fan of the first movie you should probably also go watch this movie because you will still find it good.For me it's a 7/10 but really really close to the 8/10.","7 out of 21 found this helpful.

Oops maybe not it's another big miss again for MarvelI will start by saying I absolutely loved the first movie, Loved it , it 100% stood out amongst a sea of films of this genre and with Chadwick Boseman leading the Wakandan people along with Michael B Jordan & great support cast they all just nailed it in every respect , however with the devastatingly sad early passing of Boseman who's career was about to explode after blossoming well for the last decade I feared for the worse & after watching it this afternoon coming after a long delay my fears were realised as it doesn't compare or come close in any way to the first film, I don't wish to drop spoilers but the very premise of the first movie which is the strongest person leading the Wakandans which was arguably both in body and mind , this was completely chucked in the bin for the benefit of lazy crap writing and inclusivity , the old saying of trying to fit square pegs in round holes suits perfectly , I've scored it a 5/10 but I'm all honestly had the content involving Boseman not been in this movie invoking the feeling of loss & contemplating what could have or maybe should have been had we not lost him this film would probably have only pinched a 2/10 from me... I don't wish to drop spoilers but this movie was everything I didn't want it to be ,
I will leave it like this

This was all about Panther's Wakanda and the.world of Nemor- it didn't have much interventions from the MCU, no star cameo, no unnecessary superhero entrances.But somehow, the journey of the characters didn't feel very satisfying.

Both T'Challa and Chadwick Boseman are gone and there is a huge gap in both this film and the Marvel universe left by his passing. He really is sorely missed.This film kind of represents where Marvel is at at the moment: unsure of what to do because of core characters that have departed, and where the overall arc of the story is heading.It's portrayal of grief is spot on and I felt so bad for Shuri as she loses so much in this film. But the healing process is present in this film and I'm glad they handled the loss of T'Challa well.Namor was OK, but definitely not as good as Killmonger in in the first film in terms of antagonists.Okoye gets to shine in this film. While she is presented as an unflappable bad-ass warrior, whenever she fails at a mission, she turns into a heartbroken little girl, begging not to be punished.I did not care for Riri Williams. Her character is handled in a similar way that America Chavez is in Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness, in that she is a teenager with a unique set of skills whose primary aim is being a driving plot device. But while I found America sympathetic and likeable, Riri came off slightly annoying and underdeveloped. I'm unsure if I'm going to watch her upcoming series Ironheart.Phase 4 has been so-so. While it's been described as being about grief and PTSD, it hasn't always lived up to its expectations. This film certainly tackles these issues well, but it's no Endgame. Then again I wouldn't expect it to be.","8 out of 26 found this helpful.

Truly, Wakanda Forever is a story unique and distinct compared to all the other marvel movies. I have no explanation for why the reviews here seem to be so negative. For all the nitpicking you can do, in the end the plot was insanely ambitious and the creators pull it off magnificently. The conflicts and tension throughout kept me on edge and the introduction of Atlantis as a mirror to Wakanda was an incredible choice.This movie left more of an impact on me than most marvel movies. I was shocked that it rated lower on IMDB than Ant man or Dr Strange Multiverse or Love and Thunder.... I don't mind those films like some other marvel fans but rating Wakanda Forever as lower really makes zero sense. I'd hate to think there is a negative bias to the Black Panther series.Seriously this is a very mature film that blew my expectations away and raised my hope and excitement for the next story into the stratosphere. The only mid part of the script was the random teenage engineer character, but apart from that, a hell of a movie and one that honours the late Chadwick Boseman. All Hail.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

So, after the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman I was interested in how Black panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) was going to do without him in the leading role for the movie.It is hard for me to say if Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) is as good as the first or better, because I liked this second movie a lot. The acting in this movie is what makes this movie good, along with great emotional moments.Letitia Wright as Shuri was great in her performance and the way the character acted was nice to watch. I did believe her as someone who not only lost a king but her own brother, along with the queen of Wakanda played by Angela Bassett giving a believable performance as someone who has lost a lot of people in her life.I liked Namor the Sub-mariner played by Tenoch Huerta and thought the Namor character was threatening but was also trying hard to keep the underwater city Talokan safe, along with him looking cool flying around with the wings on his feet. Plus, I like the introduction of Riri Williams/Ironheart in this movie and how she is part of the plot of the movie.The action scenes are cool to watch and fun, and I like how they play out in the story. This movie has effective emotional moments that genuinely made me cry at times from how well handled it was, also the after credits scene was emotionally well handled and might make you cry.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) was a good sequel to the first Black Panther movie. It has great acting, great action, effective emotional moments, some funny moments, and it has a great tribute to both Chadwick Boseman and his character T'Challa that will tug on your heart strings.","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

I love both Marvel AND DC equally, so no one can accuse me of being biased in my review of Black Panther Wikanda Forever.I absolutely loved the first Black Panther movie which was released at the absolute pinnacle of Marvel cinematic popularity. He was the latest and greatest Avenger back in.2018.The great thing about the original Black Panther was that it gave African Americans a hero of their own to cherish within the Marvel universe which is what th late great Stan Lee wanted from the beginning of it all.However ever since the release of Endgame back in 2019, it seem the quality of Marvel films has been slipping, from very disappointing Marvel shows like She-Hul, to Wandavision, to the release of Love and Thunder it seems that the quality of Marvel films has taken s serious nosedive.Black Panther Wikanda Forever, I'm sorry to say is no different from most of the Marvel films from the very disappointing Phase Four of this cinematic universe. WIth the recent passing of Chadwick Boseman, it's a film without a soul of a center. It's simply a film about people coming to grieve, without a real story or purpose.Characters are given no motivation or conflict, and the film needlessly DRAGS on for nearly three hours.This film in fact felt more like a Disney Plus film. But instead was released because Disney has been losing a lot of money lately.I hate to say it but I found the recently released Black Adam starring Dwayne Johnson to be a far more enjoyable film than Black Panther 2, and I'm saying this as a dis hard Marvel fan.Disney has turned Stan Lee's awesome creations into noting more than a way to give the executives at Disney bonus paychecks rather than pleasing their fans, if they don't right this ship, the public will soon become tired of comic book movies just like the public became tired of Star Wars after Disney ruined that cinematic franchise with poor writing and dull characters.If Marvel and Disney continue to put out subpar films like Black Panther 2 and the upcoming The. Marvels, you can bet the fanbase will abandon it just like they did other film franchises.","43 out of 63 found this helpful.

I didn't feel the time to be honest.The performances in this were also very strong. Angela Basset, Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o and Letita Wright all had to give emotional heavy performances that had you wondering whether they were acting or just being real... Whilst there was limited comedy (rightly so) it was funny and memorable whenever it came :).I really enjoyed the villains too. The civilisation were interesting (albeit a bit Avatar - The Way of the Water like - That isn't being released until next month) and their leader (Namor) is a strong impressive presence in the film.The music was fire - Both the soundtrack with Tems, Rihanna, Stormzy, Burna Boy etc and the original score by Ludwig Gorannson who is one of my favourite composers. The CGI was on point too. It has generally been hit and miss during phase 4 but there were only a couple of moment i questioned which is very impressive given the nature of the villain's powers.A worthy follow up to the original Black Panther and a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman throughout.P.s The man next to me definitely in tears by the end of the film 😢","25 out of 72 found this helpful.

"This was Shuri's story - Ok but not best entry","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8852074/?ref_=tt_urv","donnagrei","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61883926/?ref_=tt_urv","4 February 2023","I believe a lot of the haters will hate on this because this Black Panther sequel became very much Shuri's story. Or, Shuri and the women of Wakanda perhaps.Actually shifting the focus to the powerful women of Wakanda is one of the things I liked about this film and story. But overall, it just wasn't a GREAT story period. Instead of a sequel we got another origin story - this time for the scientific minded Shuri - and the problem is she just wasn't suited to be the Black Panther. I think the writers did what they could given the circumstances of the untimely passing of its star. And in a way, it made SENSE, but it also ended up feeling like a bridge story and that was unfortunate.Nevertheless there are some good moments, and some sad moments that are much more of a downer than a typical Marvel movie. Initially, I liked the introduction of Namor and the underwater city, which was visually appealing. But again, Marvel wastes a villain on a rather petty dispute that could've been solved had they all just calmed the F down, as it was obvious the girl had not intended to harm anyone with her machine. Bizzare and useless plot!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"Marvel's emotional meta-eulogy to the late Chadwick Boseman that also sets up future Marvel shows on DisneyPlus","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8743019/?ref_=tt_urv","ObsessiveCinemaDisorder","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur77520024/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2022","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, at its heart, is a meditative film about loss and grief that acts as a meta-eulogy for late actor Chadwick Boseman.Writer-director Ryan Coogler fully commits to the premise and directs in full cinematic glory, energizing this sequel with brightly-paletted cinematography, elaborate costume designs, an awesome soulful soundtrack, and a standout performance from Angela Bassett.Unfortunately, Wakanda Forever runs overlong from being jam-packed with too many side characters in subplots doing the contractually-obligated setup of future films. The franchise obligations end up muddling the sincerity of what Ryan Coogler is artfully saying.The unexpected passing of T'Challa leaves Wakanda vulnerable as other nations are pressuring them to share vibranium. As Wakanda mourns, Queen Ramonda, Shuri, and Nakia fight to protect their nation at the arrival of the Talokan, an ancient Mayan underwater nation, led by Namor.""Everybody mourns in their own way"" was a recurring thought I had throughout Wakanda Forever. This film was how the Marvel producers chose to mourn Chadwick Boseman's passing.There's magic in Ryan Coogler's films that has the audience always rooting for his protagonists. Whether it is Creed or Black Panther, Coogler viscerally pulls you into his heroes as the underdog in every frame, and the whole world is against them. For this reason, out of the solo Marvel movies, the Black Panther movies are consistently the most emotional to sit through. Coogler earnestly carries the themes of grief and loss from beginning to end, giving a solid emotional through line that anchors the film.With her towering air of regality, Angela Bassett commands the screen and carries the film on her shoulders. When the first X-Men film was announced in the 90s, the first fan casting I made in my head was Angela Bassett as Storm. It's easy to picture her god-like, possessed, and summoning lightning from the sky. Bassett naturally carries power and that is on full display as Queen Ramonda.When it came time for Letitia Wright's Shuri to carry the film, she came up short of matching Angela Bassett's dramatic weight. It's not for lack of trying as Wright gives a good performance. I can't put my finger on whether it's the lack of pathos or Letitia Wright herself or the fact that there's an undeniable vacuum at the film's center, but the Shuri character works better as a supporting character.Tenoch Huerta Mejía's Namor was an intriguing antagonist that deserved more time devoted to development. Danai Gurira's Okoye is short-changed from having to wear an unfortunate costume.I didn't care for the Ironheart stuff. There's a kid character that is in line to replace every major Marvel hero now, most likely for building a future Avengers roster. I suspect I'll stop caring the day that transition happens.Admittedly, I was for Marvel recasting the Black Panther role. A person's life is infinitely more than the part they play in a superhero movie. The power was in the producers' hands and despite how unfathomable they say it was, they could have recast and instrumentally make it less of a deal. Even Chadwick Boseman's brother reportedly said Chadwick would have wanted T'Challa's story to continue.I can't help but imagine an alternate universe where Kevin Feige recasted the T'Challa part and the Black Panther story went to new places and perhaps an emotional silent title card for Chadwick Boseman in the credits.In a film predominantly occupied with mourning its lead actor, setting up an upcoming TV show on DisneyPlus just undercuts the sincerity of its tribute. It's such an odd way to mourn someone's memory. But that's just me.The heart of the film, or the eulogy, is all in the soundtrack, featuring Rihanna, Nigerian singer Tems, Fireboy DML, and many other African musical artists. The African-themed playlist is a dynamic, soulful search for meaning after loss. Some songs are crying, some are mourning, and other tracks are celebrations of life.The soundtrack made me want to dance; something I do not ever do. In my theater, two kids got up in the aisle and danced over the end credits-better them than me.","7 out of 23 found this helpful.

I need to stop going to see Marvel movies expecting them to change my life as when, like ""Wakanda Forever"", they're just fine, I come away feeling underwhelmed.With King T'Challa succumbing to a mystery illness, his younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) struggles with the guilt of being unable to save him. With no Black Panther to defend Wakanda, other countries take the opportunity to try and get their hands on Vibranium deposits. After Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) makes it clear that they will not be parting with any, the US discovers another source, deep in the Atlantic Ocean. Their discovery brings them into contact with an undersea Kingdom led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejia), an empire whose use of the mineral makes them a formidable opponent.One of ""Wakanda Forever's"" real problems also provides its most meaningful moments. It is a film about grief, and what people should take from it. The early funeral of King T'Challa, as well as seeing murals of Chadwick Boseman on buildings is genuinely moving - and that is not to even speak of the films one post credits scene. I can't imagine what it was like for the cast to film those various scenes. But it hurts the overall plot of the film. We've just done overwhelming grief with Wanda and it feels like a bit of a redux to do it again here. It's not the only failure of the plot too, Namor is a great character and it's interesting to see him and his world and its painfully obvious that this is going to be the last time they use him, which hamstrings the resolution of the film. I appreciate that a criticism of the MCU has been too reliant on comedy recently but here, for obvious tonal reasons, its desperately lacking.But it's not a bad film. The other great criticism of the MCU recently has been poor visual effects - that is certainly not the case here as Coogler has created another visually stunning film. It's probably lacking one major action scene, but the ones that are present are pretty good. It introduces or rejigs a number of characters that will pay into the MCU for the forthcoming years.I liked it and I thought it was good, but I want to love these films and I'm afraid that again, I couldn't quite get there.","10 out of 37 found this helpful.

Like the previous film, this new work is considered one of Marvel's outstanding works. Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright and Tenoch huerta were also able to play their roles well.Black Panther 2 is a beautiful tribute to Chadwick Boseman and his loss.

The movie lacks the originality, the uplifting message and the quality of acting of its prequel, and its end reduces the whole thing to being a bridge to a sequel.

It was brilliantly acted and poorly crafted at the same time. Truly some of the best acting that the MCU has to offer and a great job honoring the late Chadwick Boseman. That being said, RiRi Williams felt forced into this film so Disney can ensure their coffers are filled come her solo spin-off series. It doesn't come as a shock to me given the social awareness boondoggles Disney has produced in Phase 4 that they would choose one of Marvel's biggest comic flops to showcase in the name of ""righteous equality"". That's great on its face, the problem is, her story was never compelling to begin with. The Black Panther was an established Marvel character with an omnibus of great storytelling to his credit. The twenty minutes of screen time we were allowed to see The ""new"" Panther in was decent but I left feeling I deserved a better payoff after sitting for nearly 3 hours. Again, it was ok. Good not great, but that's not going to cut the mustard anymore after 20 years of terrific film making.

Chadwick's death hit hard on everybody, but I still want to see the character's story and journey in the MCU, but I guess the studio see that Chadwick is irreplaceable, which is understandable, but I also think they should wait awhile to start production of this film. Ever since Phase 4 started, it has been overall mediocre to begin with. The only acceptable of good out of this phase was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Shang-Chi. The rest of the movies and Disney shows have potential with good moments in them, but it all falls flat with its writing, direction, and some weird agenda they have going on. Because of this, BP: Wakanda Forever will be my last MCU film. After Endgame ended, things haven't been the same. Now, my review.I enjoyed the tribute for Chadwick at the beginning of the movie and Shuri was up next to the throne of Wakanda. After that, it became slow-paced film. There were some good jokes in there, but I wish they could tone it down a bit from one character. I don't like how they dumb down Shuri's character being how she's supposably a smart character into what she is in the film. The editing of this film is a bit weird and the final fight scene was over the place. Namor was a good antagonist, but not as good as the other bad guy characters in the rest of the MCU. The movie was overall an average action superhero movie. I don't think it will be memorable as the first movie since the movie felt high spirited and the second film was just fine.","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

I believe the studio gave director Ryan Coogler free rein to do whatever he wanted with the film, and it shows in his presentation, which is emotionally satisfying and pays tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman!Unlike conventional Marvel, the narrative here slows down as well as cuts down on the action to give each of the main characters sufficient space to prosper. As a result, not only was the story endowed by compelling characters and performances (Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira were standouts for me), but it also massively contributed to the creation of a beautiful world full of wonders and awe.Here I have a question, was James Cameron involved in the creation of this new world? Was he involved in the process in any way? Look I'm not kidding, I'm actually serious; the people of Talokan do bear similarities to the Metkayina clan of Na'vi people in Avatar, I'm not sure if it's just a crazy coincidence or if there's actually some backstory to it, I really wanna know.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

Losing a powerful and beloved character in T'Challa is gut-wrenching. ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a tribute to him and the filmmakers approach his death with reverence and respect. In T'Challa's absence, the rest of the characters step up to the plate. His younger sister, Shuri, grapples with grief, doubt, and disbelief in a profound way. His mother, Ramonda, wears her heart on her sleeve and the acting performance by Angela Bassett is one of the best in the MCU.Not only are the returning characters excellent, but the new personalities are equally captivating. The film's antagonist, Namor, is a top-tier foe and he brings the story to a deeper level. His conversations, especially with Shuri, are some of the best moments in the film. Their scenes together are dialogue heavy, but everything said is necessary and thoughtful.Though the music is superb, this film is not afraid of silence. There are multiple, near-silent moments that allow the audience to absorb the story. This technique is not used often in modern filmmaking, and I absolutely loved it.Ryan Coogler, the writer/director of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"", had a tall task ahead of him when Boseman passed. With the saga's protector gone, where would the narrative go? This lack of surety is felt throughout the movie. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it just makes for an uneasy and emotional 2 ½ hour journey.There are a few scenes that took place in the United States that drag a bit and did not have much impact on the plot. I found myself less invested whenever the story left Wakanda or Talokan (Namor's home). The scenes involving the CIA and other American characters did not fit the overall narrative and were only there to set up future MCU projects. This movie does not reach the same level as its predecessor, but they did an admirable job.When the credits rolled (after a stunning mid-credit scene) I wanted to ask the projectionist to run it back again. This is only the second movie this year (the first being ""Top Gun: Maverick"") that I wanted to re-watch immediately following my viewing.Unlike other films in Phase 4 of the MCU, this movie did not rely on jokes or over-the-top action sequences. Instead, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" paid respectful homage to one of the most beloved characters in modern cinema. Without a doubt, there is a hole left where T'Challa used to be, however, Coogler and his team handled his absence with class.Best Character: Namor
Best Scene: Visiting Talokan
Best Quote: ""Have I not given everything?"" - Ramonda
Best Piece of Score: ""T'Challa""","22 out of 65 found this helpful.

Makes you wonder what the forced changes, due to unexpected situations, made to the script! But there are still things to enjoy like the character of Namor, who has a great introduction and background as well as look (yet feels underdeveloped as it concludes, like Atlantis itself). Some of the emotional tones and character challenges, if steered in a different direction, would have given more weight to the plot. The music and sound mixing are great, as well as general design of clothing and structures.Sadly, I found myself disappointed and bored throughout. With forgettable action and set-pieces, constant sequences that take you out of the movie by generating questions on ""why things aren't done differently"" and a dull ending. Can't really recommend it, and that makes sad. Wait for it on streaming.","333 out of 573 found this helpful.

Many new aspects were brought in, as well as new characters. The timing on this movie is expected with such a large storyline.

There is not as much action as in past avenger movies but that to me is very normal because the center of attention is the complexity of all the issues that are risen in Wakanda and in T' Chala's family after he is gone.Generally all the actors deliver a very good performance but personally I really liked Leticia Wright's and Angela Basett's performances. Very sincere and true to their roles.

A phase that divided i would say Marvel fana. This Black Panther is very different since Chadwick Boseman was absent. I would say that this movie was a challenge for Marvel. Beyond they had to do everything good to honor Chadwick, creating a film without your protagonist who has been loved by the audience all these years, but also to manage the character for the future of the MCU is just as challenging to do. I believe they succeeded to a satisfactory grade Phase 4 ended in a pretty good way.First the movie contains a lot of action. More than all the recent Marvel movies. From the very first scene, while I was waiting for the intro to drop, it starts full force. It immediately draws you into the plot.The effects were very impressive. Ok Marvel has us used to strong CGI (with the exception of some recent projects) and effects but really in this particular movie for me it was awesome as well as the fight scenes.As for the cast. I think the lead Letitia Wright ( Shuri ) had a very difficult task. This particular film was a special case for her. Because she was not called to simply embody Shuri. She had to capture through her role her sadness for the loss of not only her cinematography brother Ta Chala but especially Chadwick and pass it on to the viewer as intensely as possible. He tried to give it his all because it is not about a death of an MCU character but a real death of a loved and very talented actor like Chadwick. Especially when the film is dedicated to him. And I think he responded perfectly, as did the rest of the actors.Finally, regarding the passage of Iron Heart, I personally am waiting for her series very much after her appearance in the film. Namor is an interesting character
The credit scene is very interesting.I'm not saying it's a perfect one. It has some problems but is a very very good marvel movie.","8 out of 32 found this helpful.

Namor is a brilliant antagonist, one of the finest in the MCU with a terrific performance from Tenoch Huerta.I loved the comedy in this film, never trying too hard but always drawing a laugh.I do think some of the action sequences could have been developed and pushed a bit more, although saying that there were some fantastic moments.The runtime is perhaps slightly bloated, but not by much and that can be forgiven given the other accomplishments of the film.Overall Wakanda Forever is a very fine way to end Phase 4 of the MCU. On its own, it stands up as a very entertaining, emotional, and punchy film, but it also tugs at some interesting threads in the overarching Marvel story, promising good things to come.","22 out of 66 found this helpful.

for the most part, because it is (To my knowledge) the only Marvel movie that is mainly a WOC & a majority female cast. I also think it is written wonderfully and shows all types of WOC, not just stereotypes. Additionally, the CGI is extremely well done, it made me feel as though I was in the movie itself. Also, the fight scenes were seemingly very accurate, well the whole movie seemed to be extremely accurate in all of its writing, character-wise (especially with the representations of African cultures) and violence-wise. I think this movie is such a good face for Marvel because it shows young girls (especially POC) that girls and women are equally as important to justice as men (even if it is all fictional).","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Not just MCU but whole marvel stuff is precious to me in terms of being part of my childhood. My awareness of rules and roots of the sup's world is not always helpful while watching MCU. But speaking about this movie - there is something else to talk about.Starting with director and passing straight to cast I got confused by something I didn't recognize to be true when watching previous movies about Black Panther ( there's two more). As a person who had seen all the interviews for press tour and premier as well as hearing comments of Kevin Feige on making of the film I got the idea - filming process to be more of a group work then achievement of one particular actor\actress. Through all supporting material it is visible that no one turned to try to be ' bigger' then other. As a result - family energy is wholesome, actors are giving head up to each other's talent without being suppressed by one's previous acting works.On screen job is impeccable talking about Angela Basset and Lupita Nyong'o. The first is just a huge figure in this film and through all franchise as a mother of King and whole Wakanda. The energy of love, tenderness but flows around her up until it to defend the homeland. Nakia is in fact already taking up a place of Quin with heart open speeches and same dedication to the place she ' s been born to. Both actress's made a bunch of work to show how strong women can lead in grief.Man's side of the film is all about Namor. The first , mean, masculine -that is what I expected knowing him from comics. What I really get disappointed me in any way. Honestly, I grew not to be fan of choosing Tenoch Huerta. My fear of not been comfortable with seeing such a different choice from comic variant. As soon as he appeared on-screen the feeling of wrong choice disappeared, for except one scene about Namor's childhood witch just wasn't filmed good. Summing up - charisma of mr. Huerta is great deal and I am looking forward to see him more in the Cinematic Universe.Martin Freeman's appearance brings cozy vibes to the film of coolness. Winston Duke is a pure gold in terms of silly and strong leader. My gut tells me that there will be love line between him and Shuri.Talking about grief - this was honorable ' Goodbye' to Chadwick Boseman. I would rather call it ' saying aloud all the thinks witch we ought have said but wasn't made it on time' hoping that he'll watch from up above. I guess this is the best page closing up for an era of this Black Panther to give the way to progress in future. Have no clue what next phase of MCU will be for this hero but the way is clear and me personally ready to percept whatever is coming.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

In my humble opinion, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever takes the number one spot in Phase 4 and closes it with a heart.You gotta give it to director Ryan Coogler for continuing the story richly and excellently, which is challenging. And yet he delivers a great tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman's character. Coogler successfully pulls the audience back into the world without losing its touch while also introducing us to a new one. This movie has better writing in recent years with the 2 hours and 41 minutes runtime, they utilize all the time available perfectly for telling the subplots and why it's connected to the central conflict. And surprisingly well-done character development.This movie is also packed with solid action.As for the performance go, Tenoch Huerta as Namor is impressive, he definitely deserves this role and I need to see more of him in MCU. Letitia Wright and Angela Basset's performances are the most powerful. The cinematography, score, production, and costume design are outstanding, I'm not surprised if this movie gets nominated for an Academy award.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is Marvel's most powerful and emotional outing to date that didn't lose its touch from the beginning to end. It serves as one of if not the greatest sequels in the MCU.Final Rating: 8.7.","18 out of 52 found this helpful.

"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8709951/?ref_=tt_urv","theredsky","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur101697549/?ref_=tt_urv","2 December 2022","Phase 4 of the MCU really isn't that great in my opinion bar Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home but the writing for both of those is very weak at points. Wakanda Forever however stands way above the rest of Phase 4 and I'm really happy that Phase 4 ended this way. This film is an improvement over the first film in my opinion in almost every aspect. The visual effects while still off look better than the PS2 effects of the first movie. The characters here are all very well written and incredibly well acted. Angela Bassett gives probably one of the best performances in the entire series here and Letitia Wright does an amazing job as well. Wright probably has one of the best character arcs in the MCU as well. Watching her learn to process her grief over the death of her brother is heartbreaking. Her arc feels a lot more personal as does most of the rest of this film. To address the obvious, Chadwick Boseman's presence here is sorely missed but the film does an absolutly beautiful job at handling this. The film not really respects the character of T'Challa but also Chadwick as well. The first 10 minutes and last 5 address his departure and those last 5 minutes caused me to start crying. Tenoch Huerta does a great job as well and plays a great antagonist here although I do prefer Killmonger. Namor has an understandable motivation of protecting his people from being found on although he goes about it through the wrong way of attacking Wakanda. I struggle to call Namor a villain nor an anti-hero because of his motivation and his intentions to try and make peace at first. Ryan Coogler once again proves that he is easily one of the best directors in the MCU and the film just looks absolutely gorgeous. Easily one of the best looking films in the MCU and one of the best sounding. Ludwig Göransson's score is once again great although the music from the first film is just a little bit better. I did have some minor issues with the film though. I already mentioned the visual effects but the pacing here is definitely off. The first act (minus the first 10 minutes) speeds through everything before finally slowing down and the humor when it is used only works about 50% of the time although I do really like that this film MAJORLY cuts back on the typical MCU comedy. This is very easily one of the best entries in the MCU and I would definitely recommend watching this when you get the chance.","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

The storyline follows the tragic death of Black Panther, the king of Wakanda, and the grief that is left on his people and the strength of his family to continue to lead with pride. Meanwhile, the world wants the source of Wakanda's power, vibranium. It becomes apparent another source of vibranium is available under water and the world rushes to obtain it, but the Earth doesn't know a civilization is under the Earth to protect it...a civilization stronger than Wakanda and its people. That civilization blames Wakanda for the Earth knowing about vibranium and demands Wakanda help take the world over or fall under its foot with everyone else.This movie is directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed) and stars Letitia Wright (Letitia Wright), Lupita Nyong'o (Us), Danai Gurira (The Walking Dead), Angela Bassett (Strange Days), Winston Duke (Modern Family), Tenoch Huerta (The Forever Purge) and Martin Freeman (The Hobbit).The depth of this movie and what it tackles in terms of grief, pride, strength and collaboration is tremendous. The depiction of the Wakanda people and how they deal with grief and their pride is perfectly depicted. The villain is absolutely out of this world as is how his backstory is told. Their methods and approaches both to life and violence were entertaining. The cast delivers tremendous performances top to bottom, especially Angela Bassett and Tenoch Huerta. The CGI and special effects were again out of this world as were the action scenes. The ultimate outcome of every character, sub plot and storyline was perfect, as was the after credit scenes.Overall, the storyline and direction of this movie is very unique for the super hero genre and an absolutely must see. I would score this movie an 8.5-9/10 and strongly recommend it.","36 out of 117 found this helpful.

The performances are good, the action is good, the vfx is good, but it's not Great.Riri Williams aka Iron heart felt tacked on and could have shaved off 20 minutes of run time. Shuri took a back seat in her own movie and didn't do much of anything until she became black panther.There's also Namor's motivations which weren't well thought out.Overall I'm growing tired of superhero films and the logic inherent in most of them. Tony Stark was special because he created a suit of armour that was unique to him, but now Riri, Shuri and just about anyone with a mechanical engineering degree can make iron man suits.Also if the heart shaped vibranium flower can give anyone the power of black panther why not feed it to an entire army so you are guaranteed to win? It's like when Thor imbued all those kids with the power of Thor.These plot holes are starting to become more evident the deeper we go down the MCU rabbit hole.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The tribute to Boseman is effectively moving and the story is good and quite mature, but there's nowhere near enough action and it feels like a hodge-podge of lots of other things. The film is slow, long and dull; the action is bland and lacking, the American CIA scenes were completely unnecessary and although there are some visual spectacles in the grand scale, it's never that spectacular.

Even though I didn't expect much from this movie anyway.So first of all, let me say that they did a good job of sending off Boseman's T'challa, though I actually expected a way longer tribute than what we actually got. But it was a good one nonetheless.I didn't really like having Shuri as BP at first, and I still don't think she really has the same charisma as Chadwick for the main role protagonist, especially as the main Black Panther. It's just that she works better as a side character, at least in this universe and in this movie. But as the movie goes on, they give her more characterization fortunately and she becomes a decent character by the end, and I really don't have a problem with her being the Black Panther now.Though with the unfortunate passing of Chadwick Boseman, his absence is felt big time in this movie, especially in the first and second acts. And that might be what they were going for and you think it helps the movie that there's not a real protagonist yet, but in my opinion, not replacing T'Challa's actor or at least having his wife be the Black Panther really hurt the narrative and the movie as a whole. Because half of the movie passes and you wonder what even happened and who's the protagonist, and like I said, Shuri's actress is just not as charismatic as Boseman was and it hurts the movie. So it might've been a good choice not to recast him, but in my opinion, the negatives in this regard outway the positives, and the first two acts could've benefited from a more charismatic protagonist. And it's not like she doesn't have charisma, they write those first acts in a way that there isn't much focus on her like the movie doesn't even consider her the protagonist either. And again, this might've been intentional to convey the loss, but I didn't appreciate it and would've rather better writing.This made the movie less enjoyable than the first one and the tone of the movie was really weird too. It felt like a fever dream to be honest, it was stuck in a limbo of not being sure whether to be completely somber and serious or be a little light-hearted in between too. Most of the attempts at jokes fail miserably again and some of them feel out of place. This whole thing made the movie feel really weird and not that enjoyable, not to mention the movie was way too long for its own good and could've shaved off a lot of scenes, especially the jokes. Movies like Doctor Strange 2 would've benefited from 20 minutes more and this movie could've benefited from 20 or 10 minutes less. The whole thing kinda feels disjointed for some reason, even though it isn't. So the narrative of this movie is really weird and I liked how they did the first movie way better.Before continuing to point out negative after negative, let me also say what I liked about this movie;And I think that's it, I don't really think I enjoyed the other things in this movie that much.Now back to the negatives and what I didn't like;All in All, I did not enjoy this movie as much as I wanted because I really didn't like the vibe of the movie and the script is not that great. The movie doesn't really take advantage of its lengthy run-time and wastes it on unnecessary scenes. I liked their tribute to Boseman's Black Panther and I liked the ending of the movie a lot, but overall, I didn't enjoy the movie that much and this could've been a way better movie if they had just spent more time fixing the script.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Aquaman can learn a lot from him. No need for orange spandex, hair extensions and poser tattoos.Everything else about Wakanda Forever is slow, boring, and repetitive.

Queen Ramonda, Shuri, M'Baku, Okoye, and the Dora Milaje fight to protect the kingdom of Wakanda from intervening world powers in the wake of King T'Challa's death. As the Wakandans strive to embrace their next chapter, the heroes must band together with the help of War Dog Nakia and Everett Ross and forge a new path for their nation.Ryan Coogler directed the superhero movie, as well as wrote the screenplay with Joe Robert Cole.THINGS I LIKED:
The fantastic cast includes Lupita Nyongo'o, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Danai Gurira, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Tenoch Huerta, and many more!Clearly, Chadwick Boseman will be missed. He was a fantastic actor. His brother has opposed retiring the character and thought that Chadwick would have preferred that the role be simply recast in his absence. The director said that making this movie without Chadwick was the hardest thing he had ever done.Fun fact: The actors who played Talocan actually learned a Mayan language for the movie!This is an incredibly emotional movie
Before filming this movie, Tenoch Huerta didn't know how to swim. When the director asked him if he knew how to swim, Huerta simply replied, ""I've never drowned before.""
This film is absolutely gorgeous to look at.Fantastic costumes.Stunning set designs.Beautiful cinematography.Impressive stuntwork and plenty of action sequences.Super cool technologyTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Some of the CGI doesn't look that great, particularly under the water.The scenes at night time are dark and might be hard to watch on small devices when streaming.This movie is VERY long!Men are completely emasculated in this movie. The big, muscular black men of Wakanda do nothing but stand around. The male villain with superhero powers gets defeated by a skinny, young woman. The only Wakanda warriors who are featured are the women. Why does Hollywood think that the only way women can be shown as powerful is by making all men weak and worthless? As a mother of 4 sons, this narrative infuriates me.Reversing consequences is lazy writing.I loved the closing song by Rihanna called Lift Me Up.As with all Marvel movies, keep watching until the end of the closing credits for a shocking and exciting reveal!TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of violence
Destruction
Some profanity
Talk of death
Spanish is spoken with subtitles.!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The bet was risky after the unfortunate death of Chadwick Boseman, but the intelligence to close a chapter and open another by its director is a truly remarkable result, who says goodbye to our Black Panther in the most poetic and deserved way.After what was done, we fully entered into a proposal that continues with that commercial cinema that is supposed to be Marvel, but that does not lose the essence of a director who does not hesitate to put his own look at what he has to offer.It is a film that at all times processes to be serious maintaining the line of its predecessor, giving a tonality full of roots and culture to a film that gives us the most rooted superhero in the entire Marvel cinematographic universe.As I thought with its first installment, the seriousness with which the entire world of Wakanda and its culture is faced allows us to enter into a challenge as spectators, to feel qualified or not to receive more forceful proposals than a set of action sequences and jokes to release tension.That is the challenge that gives you to understand the true spectacle that turns out to be the world that Ryan Coogler proposes with his Black Panther. Proof of that is managing to give an actress the first Oscar nomination for playing a character in Marvel, as is the absolutely brutal performance of Angela Bassett who is pure feeling and emotions in her presence throughout her time on screen. That scene facing Okoye justifies understanding what is really behind Coogler's proposal.It is also valid to be able to connect or not with the proposal that they offer us, that is left to the judgment of each viewer and what they expect to receive when going to see Black Panther 2.In great detail it is a film that maintains the level of its first installment, which has an excess of footage for those who are looking for something different and more dynamic, it is really a film that if you do not connect from the beginning it is very difficult for you to process its duration in a positive way.It is also true that it falls into the same mistakes as several of the previous films, that of inconsequentially handling certain characters that end up being more connectors or triggers for conflicts rather than a real contribution to the story or to the film itself.Cases like the character of Martin Freeman or Julia Louis-Dreyfus that feel like just an ornament that could not be there or the most graphic case, the little connection that is achieved with Dominique Thorne and her role as Riri. On the contrary, we have the splendid use that is given to Namor and everything that corresponds to his culture and his actions that Tenoch Huerta interprets in a solid way, as well as the testimony that Letitia Wright receives as the new Black Panther, a background and a path by which he takes the character that makes it clear to us what his director is really looking for with all this.A film that generated diverse opinions, but that in its central nucleus once again gives it a little more blood and shows that superhero cinema can also be without as much spectacle as we are used to.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Movie Review :-Chadwick Boseman's departure made things very difficult for the Black Panther sequel, not just in terms of casting but also theoretically. Black Panther was a highly successful film because it represented the meeting of American and African cultures in the Marvel universe. I couldn't believe it for a second that a standalone superhero flick like Black Panther earned more than Avengers: Infinity War at the American box office. But that's what describes its popularity, no. Now that Chadwick is gone, it was a big task for the makers to live up to the standard set by him as a character and as a film too. Marvel knows how to make sequels and how to take stories forward, and they did exactly that with Ryan Coogler's superhero saga. Wakanda Forever is somewhat slow but steady sequel that gives new rise to the entire Wakanda universe in the MCU.The film begins with T'Challa's death, and then his mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett), takes charge as the Queen, who is secretly grieving her big personal loss. Wakanda is left without their protector and most powerful person, Black Panther, when they are attacked by Namor (Tenoch Huerta). Namor also has the same vibranium powers, but he has set his kingdom underwater. An MIT student, Riri (Dominique Thorne), builds a machine that can help the Americans trace vibranium, which is the main reason why Namor wants her dead. However, he has to tackle the Wakandians who stand beside Riri. So it's a three-way battle, but only two sides have to settle things first. Will Wakanda survive against powerful Namor without their protector, or will there be a new hero for them?Wakanda Forever is a well-written script, and Ryan really knew where to spill the dice. He, along with Joe Robert Cole, has written a solid screenplay that compiles the usual conflicts of a superhero flick with human emotions, family drama, and social conscience very well. It takes time to settle, which is fair enough because it isn't a typical money-spinner franchise for Marvel. Black Panther is supposed to be story-driven, unlike other superheroes in the Marvel Universe, and that's what they have tried to do there. Even so, it still has a few flaws that can't be overlooked. A few scenes follow the same tantrums from days gone by, and the heroism is missing too (even with females). Nevertheless, there are more good things than bad, so the battle is won.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has more female characters than male ones, so it wouldn't be inappropriate to say that the females are the top performers here. Letitia Wright as Shuri takes the lead here. I kind of liked her in the first Black Panther film more than any other supporting character in any Marvel film. There was some excitement about her character, and then the tech-savvy boost really made me fall in love with it. Wakanda Forever takes that away, which is sad, but it brings her to the front, which is the best thing that happened to her. Tenoch Huerta's sexy body and physical appeal speak more than dialogues, and even the attitude is fine. The two supporting pillars of T'Challa's life, his mother, played by Angela Bassett, and his lover, played by Lupita Nyong'o, also deliver a steady performance. Danai Gurira, Winston Duke, Dominique Thorne, Florence Kasumba, Michaela Coel, and Martin Freeman's support are excellent throughout the film.Wakanda Forever is not a heavy VFX film (it was never supposed to be one even in the previous appearances of the superhero), but the action scenes are well executed. They are fewer in number, and with a long runtime of 160 minutes, it is definitely too little. The framework of Autumn Durald Arkapaw is quite fascinating, as the film has so many underwater scenes and many ashore. That ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" feeling has arrived a month earlier. Some may argue, but the editing could have been more crisp, in my opinion. Ryan Coogler knew that he had to carry Boseman's references along with the new story, and he has done a superb job there. Watch out for the surprise in the end credit scene. Wakanda Forever stands steady as an individual film of its own, and you have to watch it for that. It does not include much of the outer world or even the other Avengers like every other Marvel film, so just keep that in mind. It's a wholesome 'Black Panther' film and nothing else, but the emotional quotient adds extra to your viewing experience.RATING - 6/10*","9 out of 41 found this helpful.

Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it more than the first film, and it's a fairly decent one-time watch.","6 out of 24 found this helpful.

For me, it felt as though The Wakandans had a worthy adversary here, it was a real twist.First off, I loved the way it paid tribute to Chadwick Boseman, the credits were a truly nice touch, his tragic passing was very sensitively dealt with.High energy, action packed, this truly was a visual masterpiece, the production team absolutely nailed it. Great music also, it worked with the film, it never clashed with it, or felt overdone.The acting was quite something, terrific in every corner, two powerhouse performances stood out for me though, Laetitia Wright and Tenoch Huerta, the pair were just incredible, their scenes together were captivating.Really enjoyed it, 8/10.","28 out of 89 found this helpful.

"While not quite as strong as its predecessor due to a cluttered narrative, Wakanda Forever serves as a somber tribute to the gone too soon Chadwick Boseman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9013698/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","24 April 2023","One year after T'Challa is lost to an aggressive terminal illness, both the nation of Wakanda and T'Challa's family including his mother now queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett), younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), and T'Challa's former lover Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) continue to mourn T'Challa's loss as international superpowers try every tactic they can to gain access to Wakanda's vibranium sources with Ramonda keeping them at bay for now. When a CIA team use new technology to track Vibranium to a source in the Atlantic Ocean, this spurs the wrath of Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejia), the king of the underwater civilization of Talokan that holds a grudge against the surface as the Talokans are descendants of massacred and enslaved Mesoamericans. With his sighs on war with the surface world, Namor approaches the Wakandans about an alliance against the world superpowers who want Vibranium and won't take no for an answer as the Wakandans try to save Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne), a young tech prodigy who invented the Vibranium detector, from both the Talokans and the American government.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is the long awaited follow-up to 2018's Black Panther which broke several records upon its release and became a bonified hit earning $1 billion worldwide and rave praise for star Chadwick Boseman positioning him not only as a fan favorite in the MCU but also an up and coming A-lister. While a sequel was planned, things took a tragic turn when Boseman tragically lost his life in August 2020 after having a prolonged battle with cancer. Various options were discussed between director Ryan Coogler and Marvel Studios with the ultimate decision being to not recast T'Challa and instead shift focus to the nation of Wakanda itself and how it deals with the loss of their king and essentially making the film a tribute to Boseman. While not the record breaker its predecessor was, the movie made a respectable $860 million against a $200 million budget and as a tribute to the gone too soon Boseman it's undeniably heartfelt even if the movie does feel a little overstuffed and unfocused to a degree.Regardless of how they went about doing it, the follow-up to Black Panther was going to have an uphill battle. The movie wisely keeps T'Challa's illness vague but with parallels to the suddenness of Boseman's real life death but it never feels exploitative or ill judged in its handling of the subject. The scenes that are placed throughout the movie with the characters discussing or experiencing their grief are well done and the ending in particular is incredibly heartfelt and feels like a fitting goodbye to both T'Challa and Boseman. The fact that the original Black Panther had a strong supporting cast of proven actors and actresses means there's plenty of talent to carry the movie and there's a strong emotional throughline for the cast. Tenoch Huerta Mejia is a great antagonist as Namor and despite inevitable comparisons to Jason Momoa's Aquaman turns, Mejia is given enough to give us a different take on this character with his strong ties to Mesoamerican culture which gives him established ground with the Wakandans as a dark reflection for them to face off against. I do feel like there's a little too much plot in Wakanda Forever and elements like the Americans and European nations staging black ops missions to obtain Vibranium does feel like it's edged out by the other plotlines in the film with Martin Freeman reprising his Everett K. Ross role in greatly reduced capacity along with Julia Louis-Dreyfus appearing as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine which felt unneeded to a degree, but I did feel like at least they gave us a better explanation of who de Fontaine is which is more than Black Widow and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier did.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever carries a heavy responsibility in saying farewell to Chadwick Boseman and for all intents and purposes it successfully does so. The movie still feels engaging with themes of revenge and grief but the narrative does feel a bit overcrowded even with a 160 minute runtime. Take that for what you will.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Our session clapped and laughed throughout the movie and I could hear/see a few guys around sniffing or discretely wiping their eyes so I think the performances and story was quite compelling.The story revolving around two very unique cultures, their leaders and their interaction with each other was not lost on me (fantasy being better than reality as always)The effects, scenes and settings were in my opinion excellent and immersive.

This is a story of grief, vengeance and forgiveness - with wonderful performances from its strong female cast. However, pacing is a real issue, and the film drags unnecessarily. Every time there is a build up to what should be a typical MCU action scene the mood shifts downwards with misplaced and superfluous dialogue. I've been to see this film twice already to see if the pacing really was an issue, or whether my expectations were too high - but I've concluded that Act III really is a chore to get through..It was always going to be a difficult story to tell, but I think if some of the scenes were rearranged and dialogue cut to really build up to the climax of the film we'd be seeing one of the absolute best films in the MCU.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

The makers of the Black Panther series of films for the MCU had a difficult task to accomplish. How do they pay tribute to their lost lead while also leading the series in a new direction? In the end, they ultimately decided to lean INTO (and not away from) his passing - and your emotional involvement in this film will be predicated on how you react to this, for basing an entire SuperHero Movie on grief and longing for a return to the past is not going to make the ""feel good movie of the year"".Directed and Written (with Joe Robert Cole) by Ryan Coogler (he of the first BLACK PANTHER film), BLACK PANTHER:WAKANDA FOREVER starts on a somber note with the off-screen passing of King T'Chala and the grief and celebration of life for him by his Sister Suri (Letitia Wright) and Mother Queen Ramonda (Angela Basset), both of whom are reprising their roles from previous MCU outings. This is all well and good and Basset, especially, shines in these early parts of the film for she is one of the best actresses working today and she rises above the material (and, if I'm honest, the other actors on the screen) to show actual grief and sorrow on the screen. Some are calling for her to be nominated for an Oscar for this role and she would be a deserved recipient of this.With that out of the way, it's time for this film to move on to it's current adventure and the emergence of a new Black Panther. But, Coogler doesn't do that, he hangs onto the grief, anger and sorrow that is being felt and this mood permeates the entire film - to, ultimately, it's detriment.Newcomer (at least to the MCU) Tenoch Huerta (THE FOREVER PURGE) shows up as Namor, the Sub-Mariner, the villain of the piece and he is formidable enough but with the lack of a Black Panther to battle him, it doesn't seem like a fair fight. Suri, Okoye (Danai Gurira), M'Baku (Winston Duke) and the Dora Milaje (with Florence Kasumba and Michaela Coel being at the forefront - and they are terrific) all are game at the battles and trying to make it to the forefront. But this Wakandan group needed something.They needed Chadwick Boseman.While Angela Bassett was the star power the film needed in the first half of the film, Lupita Nyong'o filled that bill in the 2nd half and it was comforting to see her - and her character, Nakia - back in the MCU.Unfortunately, the character that didn't really gel was the catalyst to the conflict, Riri Williams (and her MCU SuperHero alter-ego Ironheart) played by Dominique Thorne. This character felt tacked onto this story and her Superhero origins were not really explained, so one will just need to ""go with me here"" on this one.Because their is no real emotional center to the battles, they felt like CGI forces fighting CGI forces and the underwater scenery was ""fine"" but nothing special.As stated earlier, this film has a dour, mourning mood to it throughout, making it feel more like a morose DC film than a life-affirming, fun MCU film. So just be prepared for that.BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER should have been titled BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA MOURNS and it would have been a more accurate title.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","6 out of 25 found this helpful.

Then I read this is based on a volume of the comics where another panther steps in because I guess the hero passed away in the series too at one point. Still, I really enjoyed the first movie so much I saw it three times in theaters and bought the blu ray. So not only was I skeptical about a new panther but skeptical about sequels in general because they never hold a candle to the original.Within the first few minutes though I was hooked in the story. It opens with a pretty surprising emotional bang then goes from there. This movie is over 2 1/2 hours long but it seemed to just fly on by and my interest was held the whole entire way. Ryan Coogler returns as director who brought the first one to life and I'm glad he came back to tell this story. He did an excellent job with this movie and told an exciting story along the way.No spoilers but if the beginning of this doesn't grab your attention then something's wrong. I found it to be a surprising tribute but also a motivational piece of life goes on so you can never quit. Loss, hurt, regret, survivor's guilt, and other emotions make this feel more than just a comic book movie. Disney has a habit of trying to make everything politically safe but I'm glad Ryan Coogler didn't go that way. Instead he chose to focus more on the character's and their stories. I recommend this one be seen in theaters to get the full experience of action and some of the better effects in movies.","44 out of 154 found this helpful.

Loved the dialogue, witty but not overdone. Also unlike the other marvel movies I actually empathised with the villain. Yes he was a bit extreme but do you blame his fear especially considering the history of his people and when he noticed the rest of the world trying to get their paws in Wakanda's honey after T'challa and his dad went public with their nation . Obviously the movie has to have a villain but initially I was rooting for the guy. The chemistry between him and Shuri was palpable.

"One of the more emotional MCU films","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8865916/?ref_=tt_urv","MovieWarfare","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112855274/?ref_=tt_urv","11 February 2023","I enjoyed the first Black Panther film and loved Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa. I was looking forward to seeing him more in the MCU which is why his passing was heartbreaking. The sequel then had a tough choice on whether to recast T'Challa or not. Marvel Studios decided to go down the route of not recasting him which I understand but was a little disappointed by. I love the character of T'Challa and having his journey in the MCU end so prematurely was slightly saddening. Did Ryan Coogler make the right choice, or was this an unfortunate misstep?I have to say that this is indeed one of the most emotional and mature Marvel films in a long time. The choice to have T'Challa killed off is handled with the utmost respect and care within the story. Shuri is the main central character and the emotional core is about her grief with her brother's death. The story does a phenomenal job of illustrating her emotional journey which is deep and compelling. We also get to see how other characters handle the passing such as Ramonda and their way of handling grief which is different from Shuri. I appreciated that as people do indeed handle grief differently. One issue with MCU movies lately is the overabundance of comedy. Thankfully, this movie does not do that and for the most part, is a very serious movie. The beginning and ending are wonderfully done as well and are not typical of Marvel.It is clear that Chadwick's passing affected the actors as their performance is stunning. Letitia Wright gives a vastly different performance as Shuri that shows the pain and anger of her loss. Danai Gurira also delivers a great performance as Okoye and Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia respectively. Winston Duke returns as M'Baku and is still more or less the funny character but there are some great moments of serious from him that I love. Tenoch Huerta Mejía is the antagonist Namor, King of the underwater country Talokan, and I think he does a great job. He is fearsome and royal but his performance is quite charming with some heart. The biggest performance standout comes from Angela Bassett as Ramonda. Her performance is phenomenal! I am not surprised she got the best supporting actress because it is that good.On that note, I really like that Talokan does not look like Atlantis from Aquaman (2019). The design is more traditional and inspired by Mesoamerican which is a great choice. Ludwig Göransson returns to compose the soundtrack and he just continues to do a brilliant job. There is a scene where it is about exploring Talokan which sticks in my mind because of the great design and the amazing music score. In terms of action scenes, there is a pretty enjoyable car chase near the beginning that I liked.However, that is the only action scene I enjoyed. One thing this film does not do as well is the action scenes. The first issue is that there aren't a lot of action scenes and the second is that every action scene after the car chase is not entertaining. The choreography is not as well done and the final fight is just dull. The final fight is also logically baffling tactically as it felt like an incredibly silly and dumb plan. The movie just lacked a lot of triumphant moments that would make you cheer. It doesn't help that this movie is an incredibly slow burner with it taking a while for things to happen. The movie is really long at 160 minutes as well and it didn't even need to be. The movie could cut 20 minutes of its runtime and most of the core story stays the same.In terms of story, they try to incorporate the idea of other countries going for Vibranium ever since T'Challa opened Wakanda to the world. I don't think they do a good job at this as it felt distracting from the main conflict. Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) returns from the first film and Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) returns from other Marvel projects. However, their incorporation into the plot is forced and doesn't add to the main narrative. One issue I have with Phase 4 of MCU is this running theme of kids being hunted down by bad guys. It happened in Doctor Strange 2 and Hawkeye but also here in Wakanda forever with Riri Williams being hunted by Namor. It's it flame as it feels like it was done to give Riri a TV series rather than being an integral character plot-wise. I also don't think the film does a good job of showing how Talokan is a huge threat. Their tech feels minimal compared to Wakanda so it is hard to believe that Wakanda would struggle against them.Overall, Ryan Coogler handled this wonderfully. He treated the passing of Chadwick with the utmost respect, and I got to admire that. I don't think this movie is as good as the first one but it is definitely one of the more emotional ones. I'm not sure what direction Black Panther can go in now but whatever it is, I hope it retains the mature take of Wakanda Forever.","10 out of 27 found this helpful.

"Awful acting, bad action scenes, too long, divisive","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8922456/?ref_=tt_urv","Christopher_Reid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13995491/?ref_=tt_urv","12 March 2023","A new low for the MCU. Why did I even watch this? There's just too much hope with new superhero movies. Infinity War and Endgame were great. Nolan's Batman films are superb. Every superhero movie comes with that tiny glimmer of a hope that maybe it's good or even great.Superheroes are an exciting concept and the MCU has tonnes of potential at this point in terms of budget, cross-overs (and the multiverse), source material, good actors, etc. But Wakanda Forever is an offensive waste of all that. And I mean offensive.If the movie was about a European country, could you imagine them lecturing the rest of the world about being the most powerful, wisest and most disciplined? This movie represents black supremacy. It makes itself about race and it asserts that black people are the best people. It's not about intelligence, principles, laws, communication, etc. The message is far simpler. The US is bad. White people are bad. Wakanda is good because it has no white people.Nobody would accept the reverse. But the despicable racism promoted by this movie gets ignored. It's also laughable in the face of reality where Africa is hardly known as a continent full of tolerance, prosperity, responsibility, etc.The plot itself is convoluted. The Talokan are interesting but only in their surface details - how they look and sound, not so much what they say or do. They get less interesting the more we learn. At times I wished I was watching Aquaman which I didn't even like that much - at least it was fun at times.The acting by the main two actresses is barely watchable. So forced, so superficial. There is no subtlety or depth. The humour falls flat. I couldn't believe some of the jokes. There's a reference to ""the white girl from Indiana Jones"". Why mention her skin colour? It doesn't help indicate who they mean and it isn't funny. I can't stand people obsessed with race rather than actual human qualities.The CGI is mixed. Sometimes kinda cool but most of it looks completely fake. The physics are terrible and really take you out of the movie. Too many sudden changes in speed, inconsistent momentum/impact, no gravity, etc. It's arbitrary who dies or gets injured as well.The dedication to Chadwick Boseman is touching. It is truly said that he died so young and the movie pays tribute to him. I just wish the movie could have been better to do his legacy justice. I also didn't really like what they did with his character. It just felt empty compared to the alternatives available.Why just a 1 out of 10? Surely some parts of the movie are entertaining? Maybe a little bit. But nowhere near enough to forgive the huge flaws. I don't like the characters, especially the main two. I don't like the message or tone of the movie at all. I found the action confusing and boring. And of course the women are on the front lines, which is completely standard.I'm Aussie but the US has clearly been a beacon of freedom in terms of long term history. To arbitrarily imply that the fictional country Wakanda is superior in technology AND morality is offensive. Why slap people who value history and freedom in the face and expect them to like your pathetic movie? It adds nothing to the MCU, just resentment and appropriation of all kinds of moments and tropes done better elsewhere.","19 out of 27 found this helpful.

"Imperfect, but Still Highly Effective in Execution","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8756572/?ref_=tt_urv","bagainsboro16-982-565177","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52258235/?ref_=tt_urv","25 December 2022","First off, I feel it necessary to give Ryan Coogler and the entire production team working on Black Panther: Wakanda Forever a nod of credit. I believe - and you can tell quite early on in the film - that five years ago, this is not the movie Coogler and his team thought they would be crafting.Improvising on the fly to overcome a real-life tragedy (RIP the immortal Mr. Boseman), I thought the entire film was quite well done. Acting-wise, we saw Letitia Wright (as Shuri) go from sidekick standout to full-blown star. She handled the emotional scenes well, clearly understood her character's conflicting emotions, and proved, at least to me, that she is fully capable of carrying the massive weight of a blockbuster film like this one.Moreover, Angela Bassett flexes her acting chops with a far more nuanced yet charged performance as Queen Ramonda. It was great to see her character get additional time to shine in the sequel. As always, Lupita Nyong'o (as Nakia), Winston Duke (as M'Baku), and Danai Gurira (as Okoye) all thrive in their respective roles.One lowlight? While Martin Freeman was endearing and engaging in the original Black Panther, I found his presence in this film wholly unnecessary and often played for cheap (and ineffective) laughs.Lastly, while Tenoch Huerta's turn as Namor comes with sometimes questionable motives, I found his screen presence and visuals to be captivating. The film set up more Namor in the future, and that is a character I cannot wait to see make his return in some capacity.Visually, the film is stunning. From the vibrant underwater world of Talokan to the ever-vivacious streets of Wakanda, I thought the film thrived when focusing on these specific set-pieces. Elsewhere, I thought, at times, the film was (quite simply), a little too dark. While dark spots in MCU films have worked in the past, I felt that some of these low-light scenes took away from the engagement. Wright, Bassett, and Huerta are all gifted actors when it comes to facial expressions, and the lighting choices sometimes made it difficult to be fully immersed.Story-wise, I've seen a few reviews so far that have questioned the character's motives. I agree, to an extent, and the pacing of the film is highly flawed. There were a couple of scenes in which I thought the character's deserved more time to converse, and then Coogler decided to rapidly jump to another less engaging plot point. Moreover, the climax of the movie is greatly flawed (as often happens with MCU films). The narrative is there, and the arc works, but the timing/pacing was not always aligned.Overall, I greatly enjoyed this MCU romp. In my opinion, it was greatly more engaging than Doctor Strange 2 and Thor: Love and Thunder. While I'm not quite ready to put it on the same pedestal as the extraordinarily thrilling Spider-Man: No Way Home, I thought it compared nicely to Shang Chi.If you are an MCU fan, this is a must-watch.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I particularly enjoyed the scenes involving Ramonda because Angela Bassett is so magnetic on screen and Letitia Wright does good job of leading the majority of the film.I like the concept of the Talokan and this aspect of the story plays out to a fairly logical conclusion. It's good that certain arcs are left open for future stories, but for me it slightly retreads familiar ground to the original by involving Wakanda in another conflict with an aggrieved supervillain looking to right the wrongs of history.Where I struggle is the general pacing and length of the story. There is some material that stretches the screen time for the sake of franchise expansion. With the 'Ironheart' streaming show on the horizon, plus other movies, this story has to introduce certain characters and continue the arcs of others and for it me this adds a bloated corporate feel to it. Also a lot of dialogue is dedicated to exposition.A big positive is the cinematography and art design. There are so many cinematic shots and beautifully coloured imagery from Wakanda. Plus Talokan is brought to life extremely well.As with many Marvel movies I have grown tired of the extended action spectacle. I think this movie is another example as so much of it is very familiar, such as Ironman type suits flying about with cuts to faces inside the helmets and Wakandans in cool car chases on foreign soil. Other sequences feel quite cartoonishly over the top.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

But on the other, there's a far more authentic, palpable melancholy present from the start that contradicts the lighter joviality we're accustomed to (interspersed throughout) & consequently, that makes the humour seem forced & dishonest - considering the expressions of happiness portrayed aren't as sincere as we're led to believe. Due to this, I can only describe the viewing experience as akin to watching a sanitised depiction of a filmmaker's sorrow; there's a multitude of depth (ironically) brimming beneath the surface (you could even say ""an ocean's worth""), yet little of it is permitted to actually be shown without restraint - in case the intensity of it deters prospective audiences from attending screenings in theatres & alienates cinema-goers.Therein lies the problem; the need to remain marketable (staying consistent with the brand) & the desire to be something else entirely; two immense forces which pull at each other from within & leave this somewhat inconsistent in tone.Then we have the technical aspect & although strong by the normal standards of a corporate project in this saga, when the basic premise involves blue skinned inhabitants of an underwater world warring against the encroaching technological advancements made by man, recklessly pursuing his own militaristic ambitions, parallels will obviously be drawn with James Cameron's ""Avatar"" & when such blatant comparisons are directly made (both thematically & visually)... This does undoubtedly pale, in respect to that.All in all, I don't dislike this follow-up but I'm dissatisfied with it (as it's perhaps dissatisfied with itself) because similarly to the ensemble (who do a commendable amount of soul searching in front of the camera), I'm also unsure as to their motivations & the reasons for the continued existence. Maybe when they figure it out, things will improve... And like any healing process, that comes with time this didn't possess when it was made.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Immediately, the movie focalizes on the loss of Chadwick Boseman, and pays homage to him through a distressing yet powerful sequence. Then the actual movie starts, and it gets mediocre pretty quickly. To my memory, the MCU has never been more dull, more visually boring: the cinematography didn't give us the grandiosity we were expecting from a movie touching the death of a beloved actor, the discovery of a new and misterious civilization. It all feels and looks flavorless, rushed and disjointed. Despite the massive space in narration that is given to exposition, we get never really acquainted with the reign of Talocan and its tradition, and the explanation on why the conflict arises never feels believable or justified. Where the movie is best at is at paying homage to the late Boseman, giving us some thoughtful reflections on the tragedy of the death of a dear one, and how we can grow in a difficult situation such as this one. Unfortunately, the rest of the movies shies away from this somber tone, and prefers to get back to the usual, predictable (tiresome?) Marvel formula.","368 out of 677 found this helpful.

"Wakanda Forever fails at it's iron heart.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8908309/?ref_=tt_urv","Web_Of_Doom","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur119169565/?ref_=tt_urv","5 March 2023","Wakanda Forever has a very good start & pays the correct amount of respect ( at the start ) to Chadwick Boseman ( unfortunately the film is too slow, lacks in enough action & character motivation is very poor ).Overall I give the film 6 out of 10, however with it's budget scoring less than 9 is bad however compared to the Marvel phase 4 film disasters I list below at least it is not Ryan Coogler's fault Marvel films are dead.Overall the casting is very good except for one exception of Dominique Thorne ( the person selected to take over from Robert Downey Jr, as I have no idea why she was chosen to be ""Iron Heart"" as her acting I find is really terrible. Hearing she was cast without auditions taking place is unforgivable as she really adds nothing with her bad acting. It's not like she has proved anything before, as she was obviously chosen for all the wrong reasons & really takes away more than she gives ).I do wish her good luck in the future, however I just did not like her acting performance as hopefully with a better script she will do much better. I just did not find her acting at all believable or entertaining.Now Lupita Nyong'o & Angela Bassett ( who with her body of work behind her anyone would accept she would not need to audition ) we're both fantastic & really did fantastic acting & are a real credit to the acting profession, as I would have preferred Lupita to have been the new Black Panther however some decisions made little sense in this film for me. Tenoch Huerta was very good casting also as I did enjoy his commitment to his role ( as they were the 3 stars of the movie ).Just think how good they would have been with a much better script.The overall story + script writing by Ryan Coogler in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is really poor & relies on totally illogical character motivations, which is a surprise as the first Black Panther film was a lot better ( it was like this story & script was rushed to cash in for Disney ), though I think the Directing was OK taking into account the bad script.As the story & directing are by the same person this is a real shame.Marvel Phase 4 ( in general ) has been an absolute disaster as in my honest opinion Black Widow was ( 7 out of 10 ) which looked below par compared to Marvel Phase 1 - 3 ( which in general were 8 to 10, out of 10 scored films ), however you accept Black Widow's own movie should have been done sooner & with a better script ( yet now it looks great in compassion to the vast majority of the other phase 4 films done, as the standard of Marvel films is phase four is mostly awful ).Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings I gave ( 7 out of 10 ) however this film had so much potential to be way better but was another real disappointment. The slide in Marvel quality could have recovered. Then came out Eternals ( 5 out of 10 ) which was were Marvel films died. Sony owns Spider-man ( so I've not watched no way home yet, as Eternals ruined it for me ), but as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was on Disney plus I thought the fist movie was so good I'll watch that, however D. S. I. T. M. O. M ( I gave 2 out of 10 ) has got to be one of the worst sequels I have ever watched, then I decided to watch Thor: Love and Thunder ( I gave 5 out of 10 ) so at this point I knew Marvel was 100% dead which is a real shame.The only marvel film I have any real hope for is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 as with James Gunn in charge at least it will be great.So to sum up Black Panther Wakanda Forever ( 2022 ) is a forever disappointment compared to Phase 1 - 3 ( including Black Panther 2018 obviously ), but compared to the rest of Phase Four it is an average film ( so though it did not kill Marvel films it also did not give any hope for phase five that Marvel could some how actually recover, as personally the Marvel Universe is ruined for me ""Eternally"" as I have lost my ""Love"" with the lack of ""Thunder"" ). The Disney decision making process with Marvel films has proved total ""Madness"" to me, as Disney obviously put the wrong people in charge in deciding who should be writing the stories, scripts & directing in phase four as instead of looking for quality scripts that could stand the test of time they seem to give US$Billions to people who's politics they agree with unfortunately most people want talent over forced political opinions.Now James Gunn is in charge of DC films it will be interesting to see if he is able to raise DC's quality up to Marvel Phase 1 - 3, as how could Disney be so reckless to have allowed DC to take away their asset?( still Disney did not use Jame's Gunn talent instead they relied on Disney directors to make decisions with no history of any success ).Disney use to stand for the best quality, now it has lost that image.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"Building Worlds","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8919056/?ref_=tt_urv","boblipton","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1617546/?ref_=tt_urv","11 March 2023","I am not going to give my usual recounting of the beginning of the story of this movie. If you are a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you likely have already seen it. If you have no interest in the subject, or have tired of the Matter Of Earth-616, my semi-synopsis would serve no purpose. Instead I am going to make of this review a discussion of one of the primary issues of serious science fiction and high fantasy. I am going to talk about world building, and how movies, being primarily a visual medium accomplish that.In the movies, world-building is done by visual stylists, like Joseph von Sternberg, and nowadays by Benicio del Toro. You can always recognize the works of these two directors. With von Sternberg, it's a matter of the scrim work, the shadows thrown by complicated beadwork, or the curlicues of wood as a drill pokes through elaborately carved woodwork. With del Toro, it's the filled sets, whether it's the Biedermeier furniture, or a tent filled with jars of pickled freaks, or elaborate clockwork mechanisms. In both directors, it's a matter of paying attention to the details, even the details that the audience does not consciously see. For one artist to do it, or even supervise the skilled workers who achieve it, is a wearying and even an insane achievement. Then you must write the story that can be told in that world, and imagine the people who live in that world and enact that story, and find the technicians to put it on film, and the performers to portray them.Is it any wonder that the individual who can do this is so rare, and the misfires so frequent?This movie has a great advantage. First, the world this movie takes place in has been written and drawn, and made into movies by thousands, if not tens of thousands of people over more than eighty years. A world, a society, even a single village, is not made by a single individual. It's made by many people over a length of time. A housing project may be designed by a single man, built by a few. When completed, each unit may be identical. But put people in there, and after a few years, each apartment will be decorated differently, no two alike. That is world-building. It is also one advantage that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has. Every writer, every artist, every technician, every actor has put his or her mark on it, giving that variety that makes up a world that shows that thousand have lived here, if only for a little while. The graveyard has tombstones that have settled and tilted, and the names of the dead erased by wind and water. They are still part of that world.The other advantage that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has is that it is a rich franchise. They spent a quarter of a billion dollars making this movie, hiring many artists and set designers and technicians and skilled actors to dedicate themselves to showing that richness of history and character.And so a world is built well for this movie.You may love this movie. Or you may be utterly indifferent to it. That's fine. There are many movies, many stories which tell tales I am not interested in, or have seen too many times. Tearjerkers do not interest me, although show me a great one and I can appreciate, however coldly, its achievement. World building may not interest you. As an old fan of science fiction and fantasy, I treasure the efforts of those writers and artists, like Hal Clement, Ursula K. Leguin, and Poul Anderson, and M. C. Escher. Each of them could singly build a world that was self-consistent in its own way and make it work to tell a story. Sometimes the story was rote, and sometimes it was poorly told, but the beauty, the artistry, was in building that world. The fact that it took a multitude of people and a fortune to make this movie, does not detract from its successes. In fact, in many ways, it makes it even more impressive.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Even the writing is off at times as you cannot take a side between Talhokan or Wakanda as both of them are victims in their own way. As a result, it's difficult to empathise with or cheer for one group, resulting in the disconnect.Technically, the movie hits more than it misses, be it the background score or the costumes or the art settings, everything is either decent or brilliant. We do have an interesting post credit scene that serves as a nice build-up for the next part.It could have been better than the first if the runtime had been reduced and there was more emotional connection in the story.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I've never bought into the thought that this film is only around for equality, think that's ridiculous.This film is beautifully handled, at 3 points I cried and I'm not ashamed, they just did things in such a beautiful way, I'd say it was one of my favourite endings to a marvel film, it was just the right tone and a beautiful moment. It gets you wanting this franchise to succeed, a group of talented lovely people who must've gone through an emotional nightmare.The film is long but flies by, the one question was who's the next panther and IMO I thought it was the perfect choice, there was a couple of shocks but it was just really well done. When it's done well like it is here, there's a real joy in seeing badass women take control and fight, it was great in that respect. It wasn't in your face, the choices and logic just made it work, everyone played their part beautifully.Best antagonist for a long while, really creative and it just creates some awesome scenarios, I know some did hards didn't love it because it ventured from the comics but with what happened I think that's fine. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and as someone who went in as not even a big fan of the franchise I couldn't find a fault.Beautifully handled, great new crafted works, endless potential. Never forget this heart.","25 out of 85 found this helpful.

His performance as the first black comic book character was a defining one and with the sequel already announced prior, his death left everyone guessing, how will they follow up such a film with the high standard that Bosmen set.Although, the absence of Bosman's T'Challa is severely felt, the film is still entertaining as far as Marvel movies go. Unlike Christopher Nolan's approach in The Dark Knight Rises (2012) in which The Joker is never mentioned in respect for Heath Leger, Ryan Coogler (If Beele St. Could Talk, Creed) decided to make Bosman and T'Challa's death the main driving force of the film.Each character has a moment where they talk about what the Black Panther did for them and how they remember him, in the same way Bosman's performance impacted movie fans the comics community as strongly as it did.Everyone experiences grief differently, yet people are united by it and Coogler truly made this film about that. The opening funeral scene is very powerful and Angela Basset and Danai Gurira make stellar performances as warriors broken by their loss. The introduction of Namor (Tenoch Huerta) is also a kick-ass scene that does justice to the cult favourite anti-hero.One thing that this film suffers from however is, whenever they hire a director with a certain style such as Shane Black, Taika Watiti or James Gunn, Marvel's urge to stay slavishly faithful to the ""superhero"" format gets in the way of a lot of the interesting ideas that notable filmmakers can do with these stories and it has only been getting worse post-Endgame.There are some that occasionally diverge from the format such as Iron Man 3, and Thor: Ragnarok (although these too end up wrapping it up with a depth-free CGI battle) and the first Black Panther was one of these. Coogler kept the story as contained as he could without shoehorning in many elements from the other films.Coogler's return made certain that this entry stayed as intimate as it could be without intrusion from the other Marvel worlds in the universe, though IronHeart (Dominique Thorne) and the land of Talkoan, felt very forced in their inclusion.Despite all that's annoying about it. Wakanda Forever is still a must-see.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Bring this scientist to him, and the destiny for this scientist is up to him, probably to be killed.Ramonda allows Shuri to go with general Okoye (Danai Gurira) to the USA. With the help of CIA executive Ross (Martin Freeman), they find the scientist, who turns out to be a student at Cambridge, the 19 year old Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne), not all by her own free will she follows the two. But underways they are stopped by warriors from Talokan, only Okoye escapes.Ramonda now really are worried, she contacts T'Challa's girlfriend Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) who has been living for 6 years in Haiti.

The way it beautifully weaves together the rich history of Wakanda with the introduction of the Mexican Native people adds a layer of cultural diversity that enriches the storytelling.Chadwick Boseman's memory is kept alive with grace and dignity throughout the film. His presence is felt in every scene, and it's a touching reminder of the incredible talent and legacy he left behind.The film's commitment to celebrating black and brown communities is evident in its narrative and character development. It emphasizes the importance of unity and strength when faced with adversity, and it resonates deeply.The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, and the visual effects are a feast for the eyes. The film effortlessly combines breathtaking action with moments of genuine emotion and reflection.This is a beautiful movie continuation of the Wakandan story, and it pays homage to the character of T'Challa in a way that is both respectful and moving.In a world where representation in cinema matters, this film stands as a shining example of how storytelling can bring people together and celebrate diversity.In summary, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is not just a movie; it's a heartfelt tribute, a celebration of unity, and a brilliant addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's a must-see film that leaves a lasting impact and a sense of hope for the future of cinema and society as a whole.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Wakanda Forever is just missing something, a driving force, and despite Leticia Wright and Angela Bassett both nailing it, something is missing. The actual plot is the big disappointment, it was hard to swallow that another race could have existed for so long, yet remain unknown, it was maybe too dialog laden as well.

While the film doesn't quite reach the same level of brilliance as the original, it still offers a captivating story that explores the complexities of grief, leadership, and cultural identity.Set shortly after the tragic passing of King T'Challa, Wakanda Forever finds the nation grappling with its loss and facing new threats from within and without. As Wakanda's leaders navigate this uncertain landscape, they must also contend with the legacy of T'Challa, a void that cannot easily be filled.The film takes its time in exploring the emotional turmoil of Wakanda's characters, providing ample opportunity for them to process their grief and navigate the challenges they face. This approach lends depth and nuance to the story, going beyond the action sequences and spectacle that were so prevalent in the original.Letitia Wright delivers a solid performance as Shuri, the brilliant and resourceful sister of T'Challa, who steps up to assume the role of Wakanda's new leader. She captures Shuri's intelligence and determination, as she grapples with the weight of responsibility and the expectations placed upon her.The supporting cast is also strong, with Winston Duke returning as M'Baku, the fiercely loyal warrior who takes on a more prominent role in the sequel. Danai Gurira reprises her role as Okoye, the formidable general who continues to protect Wakanda with unwavering loyalty.Ryan Coogler, who also directed the original Black Panther, returns to helm Wakanda Forever, and his visual storytelling remains impressive. The film showcases the rich culture and traditions of Wakanda, with cinematography that captures the beauty of the nation's landscapes and the intricate details of its architecture and technology.Despite its strengths, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever doesn't quite match the exceptional storytelling and emotional impact of its predecessor. The film's plot sometimes feels convoluted and predictable, and the emotional arc of its characters could have been more fully developed.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a visually appealing and emotionally resonant sequel that honors the legacy of its groundbreaking predecessor. While it may not quite reach the same level of brilliance, the film still offers a captivating story with room for growth.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Before I really get into my review I have to acknowledge that making this film into a masterpiece was a daunting task given the loss of Chadwick Boseman, and it's so hard to replicate how incredible the first movie was. At times I found my attention starting to drift, so there were times where I had to rewind to catch up on what I missed.The biggest hit to this film is the runtime. This movie is so loooooong. There was so much good in it, I like the backstory of Namor's people. I think we could have slimmed down several parts, like the Cambridge section, for example. The action scenes are also a downgrade for me, there's just not much in the way of memorable action.I have to praise the acting and the world building. Angela Bassett commands so many great scenes. Letitia Wright really steps up as a lead. I was hesitant going in, but she really does an impressive job. The attention to detail in both Wakanda and Talokan just blew my mind. The love and care given to Meso-American culture was beautiful.I wish I could give it more stars. Alot of thought came into the making of this film, it just missed the mark.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The roots of the movie lies behind the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman. This is a tribute and it serves it's purpose...The movie doesn't promise you an original, creative or a complex storyline as it is basically not what it's going for. This move, excluding the Chadwick Boseman tribute parts, is very dull. Like a whole movie of a filler episode. But let me tell you it is, quite acceptable as the movie isn't trying hard to shine on such qualities in it's storytelling.The movie begins with an exceptional tribute for Chadwick Boseman, leaving every seat in the theater with at least mildly teared up eyes. What I personally felt as I was watching the movie and see the marvel fanfare flow through my eyes, was the fact that this person, non fictional person, played a part in my life. I remember going to Infinity War in 2018, to Endgame a year later. With the scenes flowing on the big screen, I acknowledge that Chadwick's art has had an impact in my life. Therefore he had a place in my life. These thoughts made tribute even more impactfull for me and I can tell you that the tribute is quite dignified and sober. So go in there with no expectations, but just memories of the late Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman.I don't think that the other parts of the movie is worth reviewing or discussing as the current state of the MCU is lame. The rest of the movie is fun, could be classified as an ordinary action film with some emotional spikes. So watching this as a standalone tribute would be the wisest thing you can do.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"A messy Phase finale elevated by a loving tribute","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8668464/?ref_=tt_urv","TheVictoriousV","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tt_urv","11 November 2022","Virtually all movies and shows from Phase Four of the MCU (or Marvel Cinematic Universe for you Silent Genarationers out there) have one significant problem in common.It's not the fact that they no longer indicate a clear common goal and now seem to compete in who can introduce the most awesome new character or ""next Infinity Gauntlet"" contender, yet also treat those revelations as throwaway adventures-of-the-week that largely go unmentioned by other canon media. (If you're extra nerdy, questions like ""How has nobody brought up the Book of Vishanty, Eternity, the Egyptian gods, or the Eternals earlier?"", ""Why didn't any one of said entities help fight Thanos?"", and the classic ""So where are the Avengers right now?"" have been more nagging than ever.) That's a problem too, certainly, but it's not the one I'm talking about today.Instead, it's a problem best illustrated by the way people responded to the trailer for Phase Four's finale, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever: ""Holy sh-t! This one actually looks like a movie!""Indeed, most of the other Phase Four media feels like the same thing: commercial sludge made in a cold, soulless factory to meet a Disney+ content quota before a set date (yes, even the theatrical releases had this feel to them), where the most interesting artistry and personality come in the form of Raimi's weird editing in Multiverse of Madness or Waititi being more unfunny than ever with Thor: Love and Thunder. Meanwhile, Wakanda Forever seemed to have acting, framing, music, and special effects that felt genuinely cinematic.In no world should ""it feels like a movie"" constitute a remarkable point of praise for a film. Alas, we live in a world of Thor: Love and Thunder and Ant-Man: Quantumania (the preview for which is the most ""Spy Kids"" that the MCU has looked yet, on top of displaying some truly clunky compositions) so what can ya do?There are some aspects of Wakanda Forever that look thrown together (don't get me started on the CGI for ""Not Atlantis"" in some shots, or a certain costume that I'll get to later), but it never looks like an ad for Bluetooth speakers the way that Love and Thunder often did (sometimes literally). By the start, it also seems to opt for a relatively small and personal story -- largely concerned with Shuri (Letitia Wright), Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett), and the other Wakandans processing the passing of King T'Challa and the implications of Wakanda unveiling itself to the world -- instead of going on another multidimensional roller-coaster ride where ""all life"" is at stake (on Earth or in the totality of existence) that goes so over-the-top that it becomes boring.Sadly, what we ultimately end up with is still very much a post-Endgame MCU movie: There ""need"" to be cameos and subplots. There ""need"" to be references to The Blip. There ""needs"" to be a globe-trotting quest involving special new items and superheroes. There ""needs"" to be a set-up for a future TV show starring Dominique Thorne's new Ironheart character -- whose costume is so laughable that it took me a good minute to realize that the promo pic circulating online was from the actual film and not the Asylum knock-off. As Robert Daniels wrote in his review, the transition from T'Challa's funeral to the Marvel logo is a sign of things to come.Sure, we don't get unnecessary post-credits teases for Doctor Doom or Galactus or whatever, but one still gets the impression that Ryan Coogler didn't have the same freedom with this one. Black Panther was relatively self-contained and, in a way, ""deeper"" than many other MCU titles; I once dismissed it as merely being ""good for a Marvel film"" (which still rings true on the level of art direction, acting, and such) but appreciate it more in retrospect. As YouTube essayist F. D. Signifier argues in a highly interesting video, it did something new for the way black characters (and the dualisms/conflicts of the ""black psyche""), as well as the African continent, are depicted in media -- namely media of this size, reach, and success. Hollywood product or not, there's a reason its Afrofuturism and themes resonated with viewers in a way that transcended fandoms.I was hoping that Wakanda Forever would similarly set itself apart from Phase Four. Truth is, the Phase has ended on a jumbled note; a tug-of-war between a universe-building studio and a movie-maker who wants to do something halfway serious --not the least of which is paying tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman.Fans have argued enough about what the best option would be vis-à-vis Boseman's passing: Would it have been tasteless to simply recast him, or is it worse to ""milk"" his real-world death -- to ""monetize his corpse"", as one critic put it -- by killing T'Challa off-screen and turning his demise into a crucial plot element? I'm not sure where I stand on the killing-off vs recasting of T'Challa as such, but wish to note that we likely wouldn't be asking that question if this wasn't ultimately a comic book product (designed to sell toys and future adventures) and just a genuine, personal, and untarnished piece of art by Ryan Coogler. Something tells me it was gonna feel weird one way or the other.Maybe it's not my place to say, partly because I can't possibly know how Boseman would've felt about this being the format his eulogy took, but also because, hey, I'm not a part of the ""true"" intended audience here:As someone pointed out on TikTok, what's really important is that we let PoC viewers ""have"" this movie, enjoy it in peace, and be the ones to speak on what is or isn't appropriate. I straight-up saw someone ask that white folks don't even go see this film in a theater on premiere night. Out of respect for this supplication, I watched Wakanda Forever on a pirated CAMRip and so got a double whammy by not having to give Disney any money. You're welcome, guys!","317 out of 604 found this helpful.

It never felt awkward or ham-fisted, which is an amazing feat. The inclusion of Namor and his underwater subjects! It allowed the film to explore the divisions and conflicts colonisation causes between marginalised groups. Both Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett gave emotionally charged performances.Plus, the film's original music was fantastic! Two musical pieces in particular really caught my ear, especially the more horror-esque one.

Its introduction to the new phase was underscored by a captivating storyline, especially with the depiction of the people of Talokan. However, when it came to the undersea visuals, the comparison with James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is almost inevitable, where the latter arguably captured our hearts with its ethereal beauty. The representation of the city underwater might have felt a tad underwhelming, but I surmise this could be attributed to the narrative's stronger emphasis on Wakanda. My anticipation tells me that Talokan might soon get its own dedicated film or series, broadening the universe even further. A poignant observation for me was the portrayal of the leadership's response to Black Panther's death, which seemed to overshadow the communal emotions of Wakanda's citizens. Nevertheless, while the movie felt a bit stretched in its runtime, it undeniably sets an intriguing foundation for what's to come.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"It's still Marvel..","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8861786/?ref_=tt_urv","thePopcornExplorer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur36922988/?ref_=tt_urv","9 February 2023","I felt the first installment of Black Panther didn't do justice to the potential the hero had, I felt it was overhyped and it came down to a very straight forward basic Marvel plot, however for some reason with the possibility of evolution and the occasional good film that Marvel puts out I was kind of hoping for an improvement the second time around, but its a bit of a drag.Let me start with the positives, the inclusion and depiction of different cultures, although a fictional depiction of both African and Mayan real life cultures its great to see it being depicted not as secondary aspect of a film but as the actual main narrative, I can't speak for accuracy in the production design elements from either side but nonetheless I felt that in a way both heritages were somehow celebrated if only for the ensemble of actors.And of course for the beautiful and respectful homage to the late Chadwick Boseman, it felt like a natural way as a send off to the character.Now for the slightly bigger list of down sides, the movie starts with great potential, a believable and intriguing antagonist (not villain, just the the other perspective) and I was actually invested, but then all the usual Marvel stuff gets in the way.The scientist.. I mean they did everything wrong with that aspect, without spoilers, that's the only person in the world capable of building the device really? That entire character construct is completely over the top and as the movie goes forward it seems for whatever reason the antagonist perspective which made sense up until half way through the film suddenly is ignored to become an excuse to have Black Panther vs ""main villain"" last showdown boring fight?Also, the speed in which the main character goes from understanding to a revenge machine is a complete weird change in character development its just too fast.. There are several plot developments that made no sense in the second and third acts of the movie and is filled with so much stereotypical hero movie stuff, the ""preparation to beat the villain"", the unsuspecting person without super powers that enters the fight without any previous experience yet manages to beat everyone, the ""spy/secret weapon"" that enters an ancient nation no one has ever been before without anyone blinking an eye... I can't give an higher rate no matter how good it is to see the inclusion aspect which I hope is a trend in Marvel going forward.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Namor, who comes from the sea kingdom, terrorizes Wakanda regarding the existence of Vibranium which is now being controlled by the world.The second sequel is a final tribute to Chadwick Boseman. Without his presence, this film feels like it is missing something distinctive and important. Losing Chadwick makes the film have a different storyline, but still stick to the previous principles. Wakanda Forever comes with a dark story in celebrating the disappearance of Black Panther and their king. The early part of the film shows a deep emotional side to give the last funeral of the King. Later, the film is brought to the story of sadness that is still attached to Ramonda and Shuri. Only then did conflict come with the existence of the sea world which then attacked Wakanda. Namor and Wakanda become a new story that complicates the situation and conditions of Wakanda.Wakanda Forever is a sequel that too much to tell and deliver. For almost three hours, the film brings a lot of sad stories and new introductions that are less solid and neat to tell. The film's already good and interesting opening pays homage to T'Challa, immediately slamming to accept the fact that in the next scene the film is disoriented. Wakanda Forever tries to tell a new story of Wakanda's life after T'Challa's legacy. However, the presentation of the story is not right so that it makes the entire film less neat. The movement of each scene that seemed to me to be too fast even less flowed, as if moving one scene to another that was too focused and on the point. Emphasized by the unsatisfactory completion of the film and felt capable of more than just a scientific battle.Wakanda Forever still presents a series of eye-catching visuals in it, from T'Challa's funeral ceremony to the depiction of the underworld and the beautiful kingdom of Namor through small details in it. The beauty of Namor's costume and his underwater kingdom deserves to be appreciated. Likewise, Queen Ramonda's appearance is quite good with large portions. Also Tenoch Huerta's performance as Namor who looks cool and impressive. One thing that was less interesting to me was Shuri's selection as Black Panther which was not satisfied and for me was not quite right. Likewise, the post credit scene that features T'Challa's child scene which for me is too forced (especially seen using a dubber to voice the child).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

For the most part, anyway.The action scenes are pretty well done and the scale of the movie is much bigger than the first one. I remember people complaining about the CGI in the last movie. Don't worry, it looks far better in 'Wakanda Forever'.It does feel more of an ensemble movie. But that also means the plot kind of jumps from one point to another following different characters. Some do a nice job.Angela Bassett is excellent as Queen Ramonda. It's no wonder she got an Oscar nomination. Winston Duke is pretty good as M'Baku but he's not onscreen that much. Honestly, the teen scientist chick is not that interesting yet she gets a huge chunk of the story dedicated to her even being there Letitia Wright is the main protagonist and she's okay but I just preferred Chadwick Boseman.I have to admit that I feel sad that he's not in the movie given his untimely passing and they just killed off the character of T'Challa. It leaves the movie with a melancholy tone that seems appropriate. But it's not always fun to watch.Tenoch Huerta is the main villain as Namor the Sub-Mariner. His motivation is understandable but I cannot say it makes him interesting. I think the movie wants Namor to be more sympathetic than he actually comes off as onscreen. He's a lot more of a jerkass than what they probably intended. Although I'm surprisingly not laughing at the tiny wings on his feet helping Namor fly.The MCU version of Atlantis actually look intimidating and their introduction into the story is a suspenseful set-piece. The design of their culture taking cues from Mesoamerican civilizations like the Maya is an inspired one. Although I will admit, the lighting is pretty dim during the Atlantis scenes so I couldn't always get a good look. It's a unique approach but I think I prefer the version we saw in the DCEU's Aquaman movie.Ryan Coogler's direction is good. There is nothing wrong with the fight choreography or how the plot beats unfold. It's a competently made and reasonably entertaining entry into the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. And thank heavens there actually feels like some semblance of gravitas to the story.But I was left with the melancholy feeling that it won't be the same knowing that T'Challa (or Boseman for that matter) will not be a part of Black Panther's future in this franchise. And that's a shame.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

One I was really annoyed about them not replacing Chadwick Boseman, because I felt that the Black Panther character story should still be told and then secondly I was concerned about the underwater scene in marvels Aquaman version would feel like a rip off.. but after watching this movie, oh my God!, what a beautiful craftsmanship of symbolism and beautiful storytelling bringing cultures together, literally and figuratively. After watching the underwater scenes with Namor, I forgot that Aquaman even ever existed. And as far as Chadwick Boseman's is concerned, I think what they did was the most beautiful way of honoring him and you just have to see it with an open mind because I think what they did was amazing.

This contained some of Marvel's worst cgi, the new panther suit was almost as bad as the old green lantern suit in spots. The pacing was horribly disjointed, the action sequences and especially the final battle didn't even manage mediocre. The introduction of Ironheart felt forced. A film that was supposed to be an ode to Chadwick Boseman did not need to be a vehicle for introduction of a character that has her own series coming soon. All in all I rank this as one of the worst overall Marvel movies.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This reason may piss some people but if we can just ignore that fact then I really don't think this is a bad movie after all considering what we are getting in Phase-4..This movie also gives us some important practical life lessons. Such a Vengeance can comsume everything and how much it can cost. It also teaches us life never stand still. The world will keep moving on even after we are gone. I don't know about everyone but these things personally hit me while watching the movie...This movie had some cool action scenes too. Unlike Taskmaster in ""Black Widow "" which was not properly portrayed here I think Namor is perfectly portrayed as a Villain. We were understanding the motive behind what he was doing. I think they have made a good job on this...This movie is definitely worth watching and brings officially a perfect end of Phase - 4.. Hopefully Phase - 5&6 will be great..Don't miss the mid credit scene.

Talking about acting, Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, and Lupita Nyong'o are all standouts.In the technical fields, it's even a better film than the 1st. Personally, I loved the score (harmonic elements of the two cultures that perfectly complement each other). The visual effects are better, the sound great, and the production design, hairstyling, and make-up are at a similar level (not impressed by the aquatic world though).In addition to some interesting dark elements, final praise for the use of subtle humor that, once again, contrasts with the typical cheesy humor - pausing for audience laughs - that the MCU uses so much in other films. Not as good as the first, but a necessary film that manages to ensure the continuity of the franchise on a positive note.","6 out of 31 found this helpful.

I assumed it would have been filled with rap music *rolls eyes*Villain: Just like with Killmonger. Aqua... I mean Namor isn't really a villain. He means well, but ignorant people are in his way. Namor really isn't different from many heroes when you think about it. All he wants is Peace. Though, ignorant people are in the way.Highlight: When Shuri said ""Madness"" because it reminded me when Loki said it to the Mighty Thor. Coincidently both were sitting on steps when they stated it.Elaine, and she looks horrible. She looked very frail. I've been watching Seinfeld clips, and it's weird seeing Elaine in the MCU universe.Laugh Meter: 1. Shocking to see an MCU movie take itself seriously.Is this movie worthy?: For a couple of months. Too many drawn out scenes and not enough action or scenes that make me want to rewatch this.What can be learned?: Recast T'Challa.Should you watch this? Sure. Still, Love and Thunder was a more fun movie. The most fun movie of phase 4,","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

Overall, a marvel movie that is a bit different considering how it deals with loss and grief, but is still flawed with its uninteresting plot and boilerplate Marvel template.Pretty Good Direction (Able to take command of his actors and drive the story forward (that be in a very Marvel way)), Pretty Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Letitia Wright (Really shows a range of emotions throughout the movie and is able to get through some of the tough moments very well; she is able to command lead in this film and really play a character trying to go through the grieving process), Pretty Good from Lupita Nyong'o (Nothing spectacular but she does hold her own), Pretty Good from Danai Gurira, Pretty Good to Good from Winston Duke (Really shows his presence with his charisma, power and humor in all the scenes he is in), Decent from Dominique Thorne (A character kinda just thrown into the movie, but she does a decent job with what she was given), Decent to Pretty Good from Tenoch Huerta Mejía (Plays the role decently well and shows some range (it just isn't really his fault given he isn't given that much to work with)), Pretty Good from Martin Freeman (Continues where he left off from the previous film), Very Good from Angela Bassett (The best performance of the movie as she uses her experience very well to be a powerful and loving figure that tries to pick up the pieces of a fractured nation), Decent from the rest of the cast), Pretty Bad Story (The overall narrative follows the boilerplate Marvel formula, but the moments dealing with grief were surprising and pretty good overall (especially for a marvel movie); the conflict overall was very boring as the villains and their world were just not that interesting (and pretty similar to Avatar)), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (Dialogue was pretty average for a marvel movie; the humor is very hit or miss (but when it hits it is very clever); the foreshadowing and symbolism was pretty predictable for a marvel movie), Very Good Score/Pretty Bad to Decent Soundtrack (at least in comparison to the previous soundtrack cause it does not match on the same level), Decent to Pretty Bad Cinematography (For the most part it is pretty typical of other Marvel movies but there are moments when it gets very nauseating), Good Sound, Good Editing (There were some edits that were very good like the parallelism in the climax and when it shows the villains mom getting older, but some of the editing techniques were not that appealing (like the slow-motion editing)), Pretty Bad Visual Effects (Felt very tacky (especially with raising his body) and feels like how other Marvel movies are in recent times (which is not a good thing)), Good Production Design, Good Makeup, Pretty Bad to Decent Costumes (The overall Wakanda costumes were good, its just Shuri's fits when being a regular person were pretty bad), Plot Structure was very typical of marvel movies, Pacing was the same pacing of marvel movies, Build to climax was good and shows the transition of power in the movie; climax was very typical of Marvel movies; the ending was incredibly safe and very predictable, Tone did share the same aspects of other marvel movies but there were more depressing tones throughout the movie due to the major themes of dealing with grief and loss, this movie does venture away a bit from the typical marvel model through its tributes to Boseman (which was a nice touch that they never actually showed his face) and how the characters have to deal with his death (something they had to change the whole direction of the movie for)","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Wakanda revels in its monopoly on vibranium, sharing nothing with anyone. Then, out of the blue, literally, a different nation-state is found out to be holding. Apparently something happens when you hold vibranium stocks because Roman, I mean Namor, the leader of the new player, Talokan, his underwater world, wants to kill everyone if that's what it takes to keep his city, people and powers secret.

"Barely Saves Face for an Unsavory Phase 4.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8691513/?ref_=tt_urv","FallenEye","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur63040106/?ref_=tt_urv","23 November 2022","Perhaps the most disappointing thing about Wakanda Forever is that, the trailers succeeded in evoking emotion far more effectively than the film itself, as I found all the expressive beats of the movie, whether in tribute to Chadwick Boseman or otherwise, lacking the power to captivate for the most part, making the beats feel more like taps, or a snare.On that train of thought, the score however, played a large role in amplifying the movie's deeper elements, and so assisted greatly towards the capturing of audiences' emotion, though sadly, unlike capturing lightening in a bottle, the score still couldn't assist in fully capturing some of the electrifying and shock factors Wakanda Forever attempted to deliver; factors which essentially felt unearned, and premature.Apart from the score, one other element that really helped this movie, was Angela Bassett's performance, which I felt was really good, though not necessarily amazing, as it was essentially one scene that she really dialled her ability up to 10 within all the rest of her scenes where she was simply just good (which is good enough), and demonstrated her expertise with much appreciated excellent execution. Winston Duke also successfully delivered a few moments here and there.Riri Williams, who was also badly cast to boot, on the other hand, and her suit that felt like it just walked out of the Spy Kids franchise, did more harm than good to the movie, while Namor was an uncompelling portrayal of the anti-villain, the new Black Panther is an unconvincing one, the finale sequence was reminiscent of Iron Man the movie and character in several ways, but not nearly as good or exciting, the story and action were unsatisfying, and, the twist was good, but at a practical level, rather than an impactful one.Understandably, yes, the movie was presented with an uphill battle after the tragedy of Chad, but, with what Phase 4 has been, it is difficult to tell if this movie ended up being this that it was, due to circumstances, or Marvel Studios' new self-sabotage approach. Either way, Wakanda Forever didn't quite manage to achieve saving this phase, but it did help it perhaps, to save face, though barely, as the damage has already been done.6.5/10.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The trademark overbearing humour is restrained but definitely not enough.Letitia Wright rises to meet her uneasy task and gives an incredible lead performance, bringing so much more depth, nuance and emotion to Shuri than ever before and absolutely proving that she is more than capable of being the new lead of this franchise.Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira are both terrific with the most powerful performances of the film. Winston Duke is once again instantly loveable and always a joy to see and Lupita Nyong'o is great but massively underutilized.Tenoch Huerta struggles a little in the shadow of Michael B. Jordan's terrific Killmonger but he still makes Namor a really compelling antagonist with an intimidating presence and more than enough depth, especially for an MCU villain.Ryan Coogler's direction is pretty good overall, the film looks nice with a impressive sense of intimacy for the most part but the action scenes feel bland (apart from a standout car chase early on) and there's a definite overuse of slow motion.As usual the CG is very hit and miss throughout constantly swapping from impressive to poor. Ludwig Göransson's score is really good, bringing back all the iconic themes and some solid new pieces and the closing song by Rihanna is extremely heart wrenching and works perfectly.","4 out of 20 found this helpful.

There are some details which are spoilery, but I think it'll be very divisive.Namor was well introduced and portrayed by the actor, but the movie fails in doing the same for Talocan. I get that it'd have made the movie even longer, but it's already too long with possibility of trimming 20 odd minutes, and when you have to do conflict between Talocan vs Wakanda, then you have to lean into it. Maybe, it wasn't a good decision to involve it in a movie which was already dealing with tribube to the main character this franchise is based on. Maybe, recasting someone for this iconic role would've been better decision, but their emotions got the better of it as they were very close to filming it when Boseman sadly passed away.Overall, it's not as good as the 1st one, still enjoyable. MCU needed lifting after DS2 & Thor 4, but I think some people would still prefer DS:2 over it for reasons which might not go well with everyone.","150 out of 284 found this helpful.

The film needed a stronger lead to follow throughout the film but how can you if you don't recast T'Challa? The film ultimately suffered from that absence but when you lose your star player the rest of the team generally suffers somewhat. Angela Bassett was great, probably the most impactful I've seen her in some time. Love Okoye in this one... She had the best action scene in the whole film. Shuri, Nakia, Umbaku, and Namor had their moments to shine but just like great role players they are not perfect stars but solid nonetheless. The outfit choices and some poor CGI, a long with a slog of a middle portion of the film is what dragged this down out of the top 10 MCU films for me. Fyi younger kids will likely not enjoy this film due to the mature themes throughout and lack of entertaining scenes.","3 out of 14 found this helpful.

I'm not sure how I feel about the plot in general, but the character work in this movie is great. Shuri and Okoye being my obvious faves, their arcs in this script are really good. The actors are great and there is not a single weak link in the cast. It does feel a bit disjointed at times, and there are some minor characters whose motivations aren't very clear to me.I also think this might be Marvel's most feminist movie to date. Like 80% of the main cast is made up of women, a lot of them in positions of power, which is never once questioned. The women are written as full and complex people with strengths and weaknesses and I honestly CAN'T BELIEVE I have to praise this movie for that because it should be the bare freaking minimum. But it isn't and I'm really happy this movie shows such a wide range of female characters portrayed by incredible actresses.Oh and btw, I truly thought I was watching the wrong movie for a second when the blue water-people showed up, especially since they showed the Avatar-trailer right before the movie started. Now I feel even less of a need to see the new Avatar. Great news for me tbh!","8 out of 55 found this helpful.

It wasn't bad, and it was certainly far from great. The fact that it got nominated for best picture is a joke. For the majority of this film however, I found myself to be really liking it. The slower pace, and cinematography were aspects that I was not expecting to appreciate. Sadly there are a few issues that really bog it down for me. The first one being that there is a new Black Panther, I won't say who but I think it would've been more impactful if no one took on the mantle. The Ironheart character felt extremely underdeveloped. And the climax was very unsatisfying. Overall this film is about as Oscar worthy as it's predecessor, in that it's not Oscar worthy at all.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

How about using your brain and look up the runtime before deciding to see the movie. Then if you decide not to see said movie, don't go. Save the time writing a dumb dumb review. Rotten Tomatoes has it right!As for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever I found it enjoyable. Not a great movie but enjoyable. My review is really 8.5/10. It would be higher if:1. Yes it was too long but not terribly so.2. Some of the story is jumbled a bit. You can decide for yourself.The good: Angela Bassett. She is a Queen in my book and deserves EVERY award she is nominated for this film. It's one heck of a performance. And of course the tribute for T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is extraordinary.The reason I decided to watch this film is b/c of a speech Boseman gave at the AFI Lifetime Achievement celebrating the works of Denzel Washington. It a speech for the ages. Every time I watching it makes me cry. I highly recommend it. The video should be available on YouTube.WAKANDA FOREVER!","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Even when they're good solid works, rarely a continuation of an original idea, surpasses said previous work, in any way, technical or otherwise. This film had me crying one minute, jumping, rooting for the heroes the next, falling in love with the many profound messages throughout, and then having myself another cry. I've written only a couple of these reviews, and I very much doubt anyone will read this one. It's ok I'm doing it not for any audience, but as thank you to the creators, writers, director, and so on, because in the same way they have made a truly magnificent tribute to a great actor, human being, artist, and altogether ""best of us""guy, Mr. Chadwick, this movie allowed me to contemplate for an instant how, having lost my mother very recently to cancer, it's in the works, actions, steps, and what we do, how we honor those very dear to us who have passed. Thank you, you have outdone yourselves in every way possible, and in these times when it's so common for comic book adaptations to be anything but outstanding, again this experience has been transcendental, key, and I believe historical in setting an example, for works to come.

No chance I'm going to waste another 2 hours of my life to finish it.I gave it a 3 because so many people did their jobs so well. Costume designers, digital artists, prop makers...even the acting was ok.The real problem was focus which was really emphasized by a lack of editing. I am certain that a minimum of 30 minutes could be cut from this movie and nothing would be lost. Often a movie can find more focus when a director is forced to justify a scene to not get cutThis movie had so much waste in the 40 minutes I watched. And still get messy and to be honest I wasn't sure who to even care about.I liked the first movie. But this movie lost the charm of the first completely. I began to route for everyone, but the wakandans. Because how can a nation so advanced yet so selfish to the worlds needs (kind of a superhero trait...and the show seems to make every single wakandan a super hero). They came off aragant and elitist. The aqua people seemed cool but their development and screen time was not enough to make me keep watching.This movie seemed to pander to world issues on nearly every scene and took me out of the fantasy of the movie. Just felt preached too.Did I mention that doting issues? So much wasted film time covering jokes that didn't deliver and nonsense conversationsThe past couple years has been really rough for marvel. Like dc movie bad. I loved the Thor movies until love and thunder(which was terrible)...and even that was better focused and edited than this movie. Dr strange was mediocre at best. Spider-Man was watchable. I think Loki was as the only thing in the past couple years I can rave about. Wandavision was the worst superhero show I've ever seen...and I'm old enough to have seen Flash Gordon.Don't normally have this much to write, but my kid wanted to watch a bit more of the movie ti see if was redeemable...nope, my son just gave up.

It is frustrating that in order to pander to younger generations, older, parental characters are customarily disposed of as an impetus for younger heroes/heroines to bestir themselves or accomplish a rite of passage (by no accident, I vented the same frustration in BLACK PANTHER 4 years ago), what if Ramonda succeeds to be the new panther, can you imagine that?

However, I believe that the movie was a solid tribute, and great movie overall. In my opinion, what also helped, is that (thankfully), the movie took a much more serious tone than the last few entries in the MCU, allowing for more deeper storytelling with less focus on humor. The new characters introduced are some nice additions too. My only real grievance is that the movie is a bit too long, but I never felt it got to the point where I kept checking the time over and over. Marvel took their time with this movie, and it paid off.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

It's been a while since I had seen the first ""Black Panther"", and I must admit that I didn't have the opportunity to rewatch the film before seeing it's sequel. So maybe a little bit of getting lost in some of the plot intricacies is on me. Some superfluous dialogue moments that didn't necessarily need to be there. Some pacing issues that could have been cleaned up just a bit.The main female cast was excellent. I loved seeing all of the recurring characters. They handled the posthumous celebration of Chadwick Boseman in a discreet and respectful manner that didn't come off as overstated or eat away too much at the film standing out on its own two legs without the support of its former lead actor.I definitely felt that it was nowhere near as good as what I remember the first one being. The main villain here, Namor (Tenoch Huerta), is not nearly as strong as Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. That being said, it is much better than the majority of the mediocre endeavors that Marvel has put out in the post ""Endgame"" era of Phase Four. If you were a fan of the original I think you will be pleased with a lot of what this movie has to offer, but I also think you will be let down in a few other aspects. A good movie nonetheless that I recommend checking out if you get the chance.","4 out of 23 found this helpful.

But, that said, it's worth it. As a movie, it had so many jobs to do, and I think it did all of them really well. The story is good, the writing is good, the cinematography is gorgeous, the VFX are mixed but mostly pretty decent, the acting is incredible all across the board, the soundtrack (both the score and actual music) is brilliant, and on the whole, it's one of my favourite things we've gotten out of Phase 4.There's honestly not a whole lot that I feel I can talk about regarding the film without saying anything that could potentially spoil something for anyone, so I'm going to keep this one short...To summarise, though, it's a solid MARVEL movie that brings me back to when MCU movies were frequently of high quality. It's been about a year since I last left the cinema having watched a MARVEL movie where I had this happy feeling inside. It's almost a nostalgic feeling...

1)The musical score is stunning, very profound and really adds and complements the nuanced acting in the film between vengeance and forgiveness.2)The acting is solid. Angela Basset gives an Oscar winning performance as the grieving Queen mother, mother and ruler of Wakanda. Leticia Wright is also a solid actor, stepping into a much larger role due to the unexpected death of Chadwick Boseman.3)The theme, as I mentioned before is the subtle interplay between vengeance and forgiveness built around loss and grief. While this has become commonplace in Batman, Superman, even the X men franchises, seeing it with Wakanda Forever just feels more mature, more fully developed characters that you actually care about.4) Ryan Coogler really stepped up to the job. He wrote the entire script with Chadwick in mind, when he died (RIP) Ryan had to re-write the script in a very short about of time.Cons:
1)The film is 2 hours and 45 mins, which is really 30 mins too long. Much of it was taking up by having far too many disjointed characters.2) This brings me to RiRi Williams character as Ironheart, I found her role and acting really annoying, it was clear the producers had overwhelming control over Ryan Coogler about how the story should be developed in order to set characters up for spin offs.3) Lastly, the underwater scene was too dark, and because of that you don't get to appreciate Nemor's world as much as Wakanda's even though we are meant to believe Talocan's world has the same technological advantage as Wakanda...seems unrealistic.Conclusion: The cons should not take away from how solid the film is, the acting, musical score and themes are great.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"Pretty alright Marvel film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8701854/?ref_=tt_urv","hakuthedragon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur157951094/?ref_=tt_urv","29 November 2022","Just watched the film in theatres. I'd say it was a pretty alright Marvel film - standard, enjoyable, but definitely pales in comparison to the first Black Panther.I enjoyed the overall story, it's nothing mind-blowing, just the average Marvel film. I thought the VFX were great and the new country of people introduced are quite unique; their underwater world looked amazing. The fight scenes were OK.I didn't quite like the character design. Namor (who some characters call Nay-mor when I thought it was pronounced Nah-mor?), sort of just wears briefs all the time, which is understandable I guess. The two new suits that are worn by Riri and Okoye were just ugly to me. It was giving Power Ranger and Abe Sapien with a mane. I did like Shuri's suit that incorporates silver and gold, and the outfits worn by the Talocan warriors look pretty badass.In typical Marvel fashion, the villain and the hero's lives will have some sort of parallel that makes them more empathetic etcetc. In Namor and Shuri's case, I felt that the similarities that were being drawn between the two were kind of heavy handed/unnecessary, won't get into spoilers but yeah. Somehow I just couldn't empathise with Namor as much as I did with Killmonger.I felt like some plot points were unnecessary and seemed shoehorned in to give Shuri more trauma to speed up her character development, lol.As a whole though, it was an enjoyable experience. The soundtrack is great too (though the first Black Panther soundtrack remains undefeated), I was bumping to the Burna Boy song when it came on. Wakanda Forever is overall a pretty decent film, but I wouldn't rewatch it again like I would the first.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"A movie that works better in parts than in its entirety.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8847123/?ref_=tt_urv","MoviesWithX","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur131966393/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2023","I knew this movie was not going to be as enjoyable as the first given the loss of the late Chadwick Boseman. Every movie that he's not a part of from here on out will suffer because of his untimely death. However, this movie, despite being watchable, is not a movie that I think I would want to watch through its entire run time again. I didn't hate the movie, and I have good things to say about it, but it also falls into some of the exact same Marvel trappings that they've been stuck in for a while that have had me kind of jaded with them. First, I feel that everyone gave mostly great performances in this film. A lot of attention is obviously on Angela Bassett right now (who won a Golden Globe for her performance and has received her second Oscar nomination and is expected to win) and she's fantastic, but I feel that the main standout in this movie in my opinion when she wasn't on-screen was Danai Gurira as Okoye. I thought she had the best humor in the movie and I thought she had the best individual action scenes. Letitia Wright is very good as Shuri once again, and Winston Duke as M'Baku is great to see again. Lupita Nyong'o was also wonderful in her small doses. Tenoch Huerta was fine as Namor. I had no issue with him. While I'm still on the positives of things, I also thought that this movie once again had terrific production design, and I enjoyed a lot of the exterior shots. I don't know if they actually shot all of these shots on location when they were in different parts of the world (probably not) but those parts looked nice. Great costumes as well once again. And now, I'm going to get on to the things that I don't like so much. There are two characters in this movie that I don't think really needed to be in it: Riri Williams and even less so, whoever the character was that Julia Louis-Dreyfus played. I thought the actress that played Riri Williams did a fine job but her inclusion in this film was literally for nothing except to say ""Hey, welcome to the MCU"" because she's getting a Disney+ show sometime this year. It's just a vehicle for her. The Julia Louis-Dreyfus character was in ""Black Widow"" (didn't see it) from what I've heard and even with the few scenes she had here, I found her kind of annoying and not funny. She just felt like she was written into this movie just to crowd Martin Freeman's character, despite what her job is. In Martin Freeman's introductory scene, he's out running and he's swatting a bug out of his face or what he thinks is a bug. That's how I felt about JLD's character in this. Their inclusions overall is an issue I guess you could say is why I'm tired of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, because they won't just let the movie be contained enough to focus on what they're doing. They just have to remind you that ""Hey, this is someone else that Marvel made and you're going to see them again later. It's all connected."" I don't care. Focus on what you're doing right now. Namor as a villain is honestly kind of boring and Talokan does not look nearly as cool as Wakanda. You really don't even need the comparison. It just doesn't look all that great by itself to me. And also the music in my opinion by Ludwig Goransson was a disappointment this time around. There's hardly anything that I'd want to go back and listen to later. Also, I've become aware of how awful Marvel tends to treat their visual effects artists, and it's a real shame. And I mean that for their sakes, not the films. I don't endorse it whatsoever, but I'm simply talking about the work here as it is in the finished film. I feel like once you seen one big Marvel set piece, you've seen them all now. The scene when Namor is in Wakanda felt to me like I was watching any other Marvel movie, from a visual effects standpoint. It's like it's just automatically boring now to watch some of these scenes. And they for some reason in this movie incorporated the use of slow-mo a few times. No need for that. And the battle at the end has some of the same issues too, aforementioned and these to follow. Instead of showing one main scene go on, they have to cut back and forth between two other things going on at the same time. Granted, Marvel movies are not the first to do that, but I'm honestly getting really sick of this because I just feel like I can see it coming from a mile away now. Let me see what is happening. Also, the movie like a lot of movies these days isn't long because it knows what to do with the length, but rather it's just long just to be long. I don't have a problem with long movies as long as you use your runtime well. ""The Batman"" in my mind used its runtime well. But I wasn't really into this that much, especially when Shuri was in Talokan. There are good scenes in this, and I particularly like the ending of this movie as well as the mid-credits scene. But at the end of the day this movie to me is at its best, just good to decent moments instead of ""I can't wait to see this movie again"". Watching clips online or something is a better way of experiencing it. I'm not holding the passing of Chadwick Boseman against this movie and I knew I wasn't going to like this movie as much without him being a part of it, but also I'm not so sure about the direction they went in either. They should've recast him.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's way too long and I felt like Shuri had backwards character development in comparison to the first film. They didn't show her strengths properly that were already established in the first film. I missed her main character moment, she doesn't get to shine. Also I missed more of the ""Black Panther as superhero"" narrative, we only got brief glimpses of that. The Black Panther serves more as a symbol rather than the real deal like it was with T'Challa. Next, the movie is very political. I wish it would've focused even more on family and how you gather strength from your loved ones to inspire good in this world.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

First it has to be said, Chadwick Boseman is obviously irreplaceable and his loss made it impossible for the rest of the cast to fill gap he left. That being said, why on earth it had to be so long is beyond me. That character development was atrocious and ultra boring. My girlfriend was legitimately sleeping 45 minutes into the film. Beginning to end you're left wondering when it is going to get better and it really never does. The battle scenes are a shadow of the first installation for choreography to cgi and everything in between. The story itself is not at all compelling. Suri is just not a lead character. The actress was really nice in a supporting role but she did not stand out in a positive way at all. Namor... ooooffff. Brutal representation of the comic character. Marbles on the guys mouth. Be ready to hit rewind to understand what the hell he's saying.The intro to what appears to be the iron man is disappointing as well. This director just copies a couple of things from iron man 1 to represent a « similar struggle » to Tony Stark I guess. This actress has been put in such a brutal situation to try and replace tony stark. She has zero chance of being well received in this role.As a lifelong marvel fan, I was so impressed with virtually everything through Phase 4. After this I think it's safe to say, expectations need to be lowered across the board. This was just disappointing, it was an outright terrible movie that was incredibly difficult to stay awake through.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

And I'm happy to say it was done in a tasteful and respectful way.In my view, this is a worthy sequel to the uber successful first Blank Panther movie. There are new unique elements shown here to keep you interested including introucing never seen and known before adversary that are equally as powerful to keep the Wakandans in check. I'm glad they didn't resort to more alien invaders in this area.As expected, the special effects is first class, and cinematography impressive. But I think some elements where included just for the purpose of putting something different in. I'm refering to the Wakandan ship. Its design had no practical elements to it considering what is was used for. What makes movies like this believable is if every aspect of their design made sense, if they were real in the real world. Having said that, this movie delivered in CGI delight.There is plenty of action to be had, but far too many moments of slow burn. Puttimg an unecessary pause to the increasing fast pace the movie has built up.VERDICT: If you like super-hero movies and/or you liked the first Black Panther movie, then you'll enjoy this. It's more of the same but different.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"A Great Tribute to Chadwick Boseman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8674980/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","14 November 2022","After the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, the future of the Black Panther franchise was up in the air but now we have Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees after the death of T'challa, Wakanda is at the mercy of other countries and a force which has chosen now to rise up.Main Character
Letitia Wright gets more of the centre stage as Shuri and her character has changed a plenty. Gone is the fun and charming teenager and in her place is this dark and brooding young woman who is clearly angry at the world. Considering the story the film is trying to tell it works and Wright does a really good job in her role and you clearly see a journey that she goes on in the film.Supporting Characters
Danai Gurira reprises her role as Okoye and she is really good, she is a really talented actress and her character gets some development here. She is good in the action sequences too with her filling this role as a warrior really well. Angela Basset gets a pretty substantial role as Queen Ramonda and this is the performance that most people have been talking about. She is fantastic in her role, you see the pain that comes from her after the events of the previous films and she does a great job in this royal role. Tenoch Huerta makes his debut as Namor and he is fantastic, even though he is technically the antagonist in this film his character is so well written and realised by Huerta that you can't help but kind of see his point of view on things and that is great to see. Dominique Thorne also makes her first appearance as Riri Williams, she is a lot of fun and her performance reminds me of what Shuri was like in the first Black Panther film and I think that was on purpose.Story
The story is incredibly heavy and emotional, it just feels real. The first act in particular feels like a true tribute to Chadwick Boseman and the character of T'Challa. But it also plays into the story and takes this group of broken people and makes them face this threat from a group of people who are also suffering. This is when the film is at its best, but it does have some issues. There is one part of the story that feels really out of place featuring a returning character that just feels shoehorned in. Also the last act had a few things that didn't quite sit well with me and let the film down a bit from a storytelling point of view.Script
The script is incredibly dramatic, this isn't your typical Marvel film and deals with the true consequences of grief and trauma. The jokes are alright but that isn't why we are here, the characters are well written and proper time is given for us to care.Style
The style of the film is a bit of a mixed bag. The soundtrack and overall sound design is really awesome and Ludwig Goransson continues his great streak of awesome music in film & TV. The film looks beautiful too, Wakanda & Talocan (Where Namor lives) are both very vibrant and nice to look out. But I don't know if it was just me who found the majority of the action scenes a bit jarring to watch, especially at the beginning of the film. There is plenty of shaky cam and it doesn't allow these performers to deliver as well as I think they can. Also the film does drag a bit, it is over 2 Hours & 30 Mins and I think a good 10/15 mins could have been cut off and the film would have been better.Overall
Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a great film that feels like a real classy tribute to Chadwick Boseman but also tells its own story that resonated for me and I think it will any fan of this franchise.Overall - 8/10.","15 out of 52 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, the delivery fell short. Things moved too fast with minimal dialogue and plot depth. The underwater CG was also not so great. It was hard to become invested in all that happened. The result is a lot of senseless deaths for naught.And at the end, as if a tribute to Chadwick Boseman could cover up all the shortcomings. That felt cheap.It's not a total disaster.

There's not enough people dying to make the story worthwhile. So in the end, I'm like, is it really worth my time?The acting is spectacular from the cast, I can see the emotions and feel what they feel. Besides the acting, the story doesn't have much meaning & the action wasn't intense.On the cinema screen, it seems the background is always blurry. Not sure if that's my eye problem or the direction the director is taking.It was a good movie, just not the best.Will I watch it again? No, will I recommend to watch it?

It's unbelievable how Ryan Coogler managed to make the impossible possible. He made us miss Chadwick Boseman but still feel his presence in this movie. The movie is emotional, the story is well told and I think Namor is a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and he was introduced in a great way. Great pictures, fantastic worlds and some funny scenes.Going into the movie I actually thought somebody else was going to end up being the new black panther. I can live with the director's decision here, it clearly makes sense.It hurt me personally as a woman to see the actress Letitia Wright look so thin at the end of the movie, but that does not have anything to do with my movie rating at all, I just wanted to mention it. I hope she is alright. I love her as an actress.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I. P). The movie is visually stunning and introduces one of the best villains in the MCU, however it just doesn't feel right. The plot wasn't especially interesting and it just didn't have the same feeling and connection as the first movie, maybe that's due to the change in protagonist or due to the events surrounding the movie but the plot didn't feel super engaging and I didn't really feel connected or invested in the storyline's or characters. The focus has shifted from Wakanda and it's rich culture and history which is understandable, however it still was barely included in the movie at all which is something that gave the first movie such a unique feeling. It's fine as a popcorn flick, but it didn't have me engaged enough to be invested in a sequel.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Then, they learn that an underwater expedition by the US has discovered Vibranium elsewhere, and following that a powerful underwater civilization. So each feel threatened and arguments and battles ensue.My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library. It is a long movie at somewhere over 2 1/2 hours. One of our interests in seeing it was for Angela Bassett who played the Queen, she famously failed to win Best Supporting Actress at the recent Oscars and, being a poor sport about it, refused to clap when Jaime Lee Curtis was announced the winner. Her performance her is OK, nothing special.We enjoyed the movie at some level but we didn't think it all made sense in the context of a fictional movie. I don't plan to watch it again.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Wakanda is struggling after the unexpected death of King T'Challa. Ramonda (Angela Bassett) takes over as Queen. It's a year later. The outside world is demanding that Wakanda shares its technology and vibranium. Unbeknownst to them, the CIA led by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) has found vibranium buried under the sea. The CIA crew is massacred by Namor (Tenoch Huerta) and his people although Wakanda is blamed. Namor is demanding the death of the inventor of the vibranium detector and that Wakanda join him in a war against the surface.The real world death of Chadwick Boseman has thrown this part of the MCU into turmoil. This movie relies heavily on the acting power of veteran Angela Bassett and she gets an Oscar nomination. Arguably, she leads the movie for the first half despite not being on the action mission. The other big aspects of this movie are the passing of the torch and the introduction of Namor. I am not that enamored with the torch passing. It needs to be done, but it could be better. Quite frankly, I'm not sold on the who. Like so many things, time will tell. Finally, Namor gets introduced into the MCU. He is probably one of the bigger Marvel character to not get something so far. I like his story and his history. Again, time will tell, but this has good potential. After Boseman's death, this will always going to be a memorial service and a patchwork story. Both are done well enough and Angela Bassett really shoulders the load.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Every minute spent on the core characters are phenomenal. Shuri and Ramonda are the two standouts that deliver consistent and top tier quality acting scene after scene. Namor is a solid antagonist that I want to see more of in the future. The way the story in the movie follows the real world reaction to the death of Chandwick Bozeman is well executed.Having the characters caught off guard like us is a great way for the audience to immediately connect with character's experience. Their are some things that don't work though. Iron Heart should have been introduced in another movie or at the very least had a quick introduction in Wakanda Forever and then had time to develop in a different movie (similar to the MCU Spider-Man). Their are some odd choices with pacing which can sometimes take away from certain characters decisions.Overall I like this movie and at the same time love parts of it as well. Is it as good as the first? Probably not, but it's still a good and worthy sequel.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The death of T'Challa - and actor Chadwick Boseman - weighs heavy on Wakanda Forever, with the fictional nation struggling to replace both their monarch and their champion, and Marvel Studios deciding how to honor a man it was clearly ready to work with for years and years to come. Wakanda Forever is an effective, emotional farewell to T'Challa - a meditation on forging one's own future out of a painful past - but with a plot that has to introduce an entirely new nation and pave the way for a new wave of Marvel stories, it does struggle under the weight of all that expectation .Black Panther: Wakanda Forever wastes no time addressing Boseman's passing, with a chaotic and tense opening scene leaving Shuri (Letitia Wright) feeling responsible for her brother's death. The funeral procession that follows speaks to the incredibly fine line Wakanda Forever has to walk: even in their mourning, there's joyous dancing and celebration of what T'Challa brought to the nation, but Shuri's solemnity as she moves through holding T'Challa's Panther helmet is a strong reminder of the conflicting emotions she and the movie at large have to balance .I liked shuri's arc in this movie both her and namor are the two that carried the movie. Riri williams is a great addition to the movie and i cant't wait to see her in her own series iron heart. Talokan people were great too. Martin Freeman and another outstanding performance. Ludwig Goransson with another great score that diserves an oscar too.What i didn't like about this movie is its runtime and sometimes i felt lost in the middle. Namor motives were weak for me. Other than that well crafted movie by coogler.Coogler pulls off an incredible feat, despite some story stumbles, creating a superhero film that is emotionally affecting, politically and culturally urgent, and that pays loving tribute not just to T'Challa but Chadwick Boseman too.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Namor was a nice yet wasted character his costume design was childish especially the jewellery he was wearing. There was no fight between the protagonist and the antagonist with both at their primes and at their full potential. Riri Williams (IRON HEART) is a disgrace to Tony Stark (IRON MAN). Even though it was such a long film they just ended it hastily. They should've simply recasted Michael B. Jordan as BLACK PANTHER or should've used Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa through deepfake technology. The only good things were some of the dialogues, the music's, and the water grenades. I don't have a problem with Black people. I have many Black friends but there are so many physically amazing and good looking Black people, MARVEL should've simply recasted T'Challa and kept a male leading character and the movie would've been way better. Or atleast Okoye should've been BLACK PANTHER since she has experience and battle IQ. I wasted 165 minutes of my life last night. The funniest part is that the director Ryan Coogler said that this film was gonna be like AVENGERS : ENDGAME, once in a lifetime movie 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. He'd must've been wasted before the interview and the critics say that it was better than BLACK ADAM 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.

I don't know if Marvel decides to make limited series about Namor and Talokan or not but if they do, I'll be very interested. They didnt explore enough.

T'Challa should have been recast as Chadwick Bozeman and his family desired. Namor should have been the Avenging Son, The Savage Sub-Mariner, Prince Namor of Atlantis. But instead he was Cuckoo Khan or whatever. Chadwick's tributes were touching but too many and crossing the border from tribute to exploitation. Martin Freedman was usless and wasted. Angela Bassett was a highlight, and in my mind would have been a better Black Panther than a 90lb girl. The fights were not engaging and Namor's motivations were just dumb.

Sure, it has a lot of potential which was set up quite nicely in the film. But I feel like the conclusion and the entire third act to be quite weak, especially the CGI (which we now know isn't the VFX studio's fault). But like I said I did enjoy the worldbuilding and the overall tone. Just that I feel it suffers from the usual fate like all the other MCU films did; great set up but a lame execution.Fast forward to this film, I was intrigued when I saw the trailer because it seems like a good set up. But I do wonder how they were going to tackle the issue of the main protagonist. On the whole set up, it is rather quite good for the most part. I enjoyed the part where Talokan and the whole sea people were introduced. I even liked the horror elements they implemented. You should be afraid of something that is unknown. I also liked the decision to change Atlantis into Talokan, and have it basically have ancient Aztec myths behind it. Very fresh and very smart to differentiate him from Aquaman. But I feel like that's about it in terms of good things that I enjoy in the film.I feel like the inclusion of Riri Williams is probably the most pointless addition to the plot. She's there basically just to promote her upcoming Disney+ series, and nothing else. Yes, she's an integral part of the plot, but by the end I feel like they could have just used Shuri for that. It's also the same problem I find in other Disney+ series (like how the ending of Falcon & Winter Soldier doesn't further the plot of the start, which makes it feel just like filler episodes).Also there tons of decisions that are pretty stupid from characters that are supposed to be very experienced (or basically immortal). And as always with MCU films, I find the third act to be rather dull and underwhelming. It set up quite nicely, only to disappoint me a bit in the end. The fights are pretty tame and lame too, compared to say the bridge scene. But hey, at least the CGI is better than the first film. The emotional scenes also failed to tug at my heartstrings, if compared to No Way Home for instance. It doesn't deserveOverall, I actually prefer this film rather than the first film. And I actually like this film's overall tone rather than other MCU films which can be almost insufferable with their one-liners and jokes at every other minute. But in the end, it still suffers the same fate as other MCU films. And that's just sad.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

His fellow actors' loss and raw emotion was transparent in the aforementioned scenes. The Black Panther legacy has direction and purpose even after the devastating loss of their intended future.The introduction of Namor and his people was brilliantly done. Slow build intro, to an immersive look into the land and people, to epic fight scenes with a ton of beautiful sequences. Coogler is 2 for 2 on creating a believable, strong antagonist who has a legitimized reason for being mad.I don't mean to spoil or add anything else really.

A tribute of sorts to the late Chadwick Boseman. And the characters in the story have suffered a similar loss of Tchalla. So you instantly connect and relate to the characters. And the movie is great when it focuses on that grief. Letitia Wright and Angela Basset are great at portraying that loss masterfully with perhaps the best performance from Angela Basset in comic book medium this year.Anyone who kept up with Chadwick's work will get instantly teary eyed the moment that 1st scene opens. But if you have no such history and only wanted to watch a fun superhero movie.. This will probably not be for you. It has that MCU humor sometimes and sparse action sprinkled in but they never exceed their welcome. So younger audience might even find this movie kind of boring.The film also seems to not know when to end or which character to focus on. Especially during the 2nd act where the lack of a main character is felt the most. There is also a weird subplot with Martin Freeman which just feels like Marvel going ""hey check out his cool thing that MIGHT happen next in the MCU"" which I felt wasn't really needed along with like 20 or so minutes towards the end.Cons aside, the film is still pretty good. The action is pretty on point, VFX is definitely better than the 1st one most of the time and the performances are extremely great and effective. A great watch for anyone who keeps up with the MCU. And I would certainly recommend it. I still think Batman is the best comic movie this year but BP2 certainly comes close.Overall still a pretty solid movie.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

With the huge shoes that need to be filled in mind, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever really did do a great job. It still suffers from Marvel formulitis and the new trend of over explaining character motivations (i.e. Flash backs during the final standoff) which do cripple it a fair bit. Ultimately, it does the seemingly impossible of taking the tragic loss of Chadwick Boseman and building a compelling story around it without ever seeming like the movie exists to make a quick buck off of his passing.I feel like a broken record and even slightly mysoginistic whenever I say this, but I feel like it must be pointed out whenever possible: This is female empowerment done right. The lead actresses are fantastic and the characters they play are strong on their own terms without having to condescend constantly to men to prove their superiority. So many ""empowerment"" moments or whole films today focus soley on showing how the female protagonist is better than the guys, rather than just showing that she is awesome in general.","7 out of 21 found this helpful.

From the opening scene it gives you gut wrenching performances from the actors that feel real pain from his loss. We lost an icon when we lost Chadwick Boseman and they did him justice.Shuri (Letita Wright) owns her role in this movie. She has raw and powerful emotions that come to us when we lose people. Namor is pretty cool. This plot suffered a bit imo from predictable twists toward the end. The action is great throughout the movie but the final fight was just okay.

Doctor Strange was a missed opportunity, Shang Chi lacked stakes, Eternals was a mess, and Thor was an unmitigated disaster.While I would love to have seen Chadwick Boseman don the Black Panther suit once more, sometimes a tragedy can lead to something beautiful. And that is certainly the case with Wakanda Forever.The loss of Boseman can be felt in every single scene but that only adds to the drama of a country adrift by the loss of its king, protector, and veil of secrecy.Now very much in the public eye, the nation must decide who it is and what kind of influence it will have on world events.In a lot of ways, this is another origin story, and although the Panther only appears very late in the film's epic runtime, it feels wholly earned and meaningful.There's plenty of action and spectacle for those who like a good blockbuster but the movie's real power of comes from its heart and the journey of the characters and the all important question of whether they can reclaim what has been lost before they lose themselves.I haven't enjoyed a Marvel movie this much since Infinity War and End Game.Wakanda Forever!","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

This is done in a good way, adding a lot of emotional depth to certain scenes. I was quite emotional watching this movie, knowing that the sorrow portrayed on screen is in fact real.The cast is very good, and Angela Bassett provides a powerful performance in particular. Letitia Wright also does a good job at the forefront of the plot. The story also introduces some new characters that are interesting, but feel somewhat rushed. There was at least one character I felt was thrown into the story without being properly established, which weakens the impact of the plot.Tenoch Huerta provides a good portrayal of Namor, and the character is fleshed out to enrich the story. It's sad that we'll never see him on screen with T'Challa.The soundtrack is great, and so is the sets and costumes. It really portrays Wakanda as a genuine culture with a rich history. The underwater city of Talocan looks good. However, the movie relies a lot on CGI which is painfully evident in certain scenes. It sometimes feels like visual ""noise"" and becomes tedious at times.Overall, the movie provides a good and deeply emotional story, though it is burdened by an unstable plot. It works hard to fill the gap left by Boseman, and it partially succeeds in this. The lack of a strong, established lead makes the movie seem to lack a direction at times. Still, it deals with some tough issues and further builds on the story of Wakanda and the characters.A decent addition to the MCU.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It is nearly 3 hours long.We found the story a bit confusing & convoluted as there are a lot of characters introduced, with their side plots but it all seemed to work - kinda.Lots of action MCU action with some dodgy CGI but forgivable.We recommend watching it at cinema as it is a big movie.6/10.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

All of the acting was top notch and it was visually great, I'm not sure was it my cinema or the movie but many shots were out of focus hurting my eyes a little.There is not loads of action but it doesn't feel like the movie needs loads, it's a character driven story and it does it quite well.Many things happen that I was truly shocked about, my stand out character's are Okoye, Shuri, Namor.The movie started FANTASTIC, I got winter solider vibes but it did slowly fade from that tone. All of the suits are a bit much, iron heart I wasn't too keen on even Okoye later on, without spoilers the style did bother me.The ending did bother me a lot, it lost many marks in my opinion for the movie, I feel like with the outcome everything could have been avoided over an hour into the movie, not impressed but I don't want that to take away from how good the start and middle are, it's a solid movie, a good sequel and I can see myself watching it again just not too soon.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

But Wakanda Forever was always going to deliver significant change with a new Black Panther. I think all these alterations are perfectly fine and provides a stepping stone for a bigger Marvel story to unfold as cinematic franchise. The plot is decent and mature dialogue, and back by very good diversity of old and new characters twine into each others lives. Its a visual and emotionally beautiful journey from start to end.","10 out of 35 found this helpful.

While the film has a talented cast and visually stunning landscapes, it falls short in terms of delivering a compelling story.The film tries to honor the legacy of the original by incorporating elements from the comic book source material, but unfortunately, it lacks the cohesiveness and emotional depth that made ""Black Panther"" so special. The characters, who were once well-defined and dynamic, now seem to be mere caricatures of themselves, lacking any real motivation or development.Furthermore, the film's pacing is slow and uneven, with several long and dull action scenes that fail to capture the excitement and energy of the first film. The film also tries to juggle too many subplots, making it difficult to focus on any one in particular.In conclusion, ""Wakanda Forever"" is a disappointing follow-up to ""Black Panther"" that fails to live up to its predecessor's standards. While it may appeal to fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it fails to deliver the same impact and excitement as the first film.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's is well written to tie it into the future events and the past marvel movies, it definitely lacks the big moments marvel films are known for and rightly so - because this movie is all about loss and coming to terms with it. It is melodrama with an attached superhero connotation. That doesn't mean it is not entertaining, but it is definitely gonna disappoint if you walk in expecting a typical marvel film.Ryan Coogler handled the transition from what was wakanda with Chadwick Boseman, to what it is going it be. The characters were well written, well developed and every actor did their best on screen doing justice to their roles.Tenoch Huerta's Namor is not your average marvel anti hero. There is a lot of depth to his character and I hope it is developed well as the movies go further. I especially loved the fact that they did not make the character inherently evil, which would mean the sense of urgency would hurt the soul of what this movie is trying to be.Wakanda Forever is a necessary film for both the fans and the people of wakanda in the marvel universe. Overall a movie well done.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

This sequel is again directed and written in part by Ryan Coogler, who also directed the first part.In the film, the people of Wakanda honor their lost King T'Challa after his tragic death. This leaves Wakanda without their title of warrior Black Panther, making them appear weaker in the eyes of enemy forces. These try to make use of the vibranium, the precious raw material for which the country has become known.Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright) must now join forces with the Dora Milaje led by General Okoye (Danai Gurira) to protect their land. Wakanda is now under attack by a new unknown enemy, who come from the secret underwater world Talokan and are led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta).With this film, Ryan Coogler has made a worthy sequel, but has had a hard time with this. After the tragic death of actor Chadwick Boseman, who played T'Challa and the Black Panther in the first film, they have had to adapt the entire film and the ideas they had for it. Thus, the film conveys well what it can be like to lose a beloved colleague and friend. They also show how hard this can make life because of the enormous emptiness that can arise.With the first Black Panther film, Ryan Coogler successfully introduced a whole new world of fiction into the Marvel film world, reflecting different elements of African cultures. With this film he shows more how African cultures deal with something like the death of a beloved leader. In addition to this culture, in this sequel he now also introduces the underwater world of Talokan. This world reflects some of the Mexican Mayan culture. Unfortunately, this world doesn't come out as clearly as the world of Wakanda in the first film, but as a viewer you understand how most things work here. This world is somewhat reminiscent of the underwater world from the Aquaman film from 2018, but luckily it manages to create a world of its own.Talokan is located in the depths of the ocean and for a more realistic effect Ryan Coogler has also darkened this world much like the real deep environments of the ocean. The film is sometimes a bit too dark so you can't always follow exactly what is happening. The visual effects look good, but sometimes you can still see how they put things with CGI like explosions or the underwater world with a green screen in the film. Also, some characters come across more like they're from an anime or live-action kids TV show like Power Rangers.The acting is well portrayed in the film. Most of the actors who play characters from Wakanda convey well how hard the loss of their king and true friend Chadwick Boseman is. They provide realistic emotional moments. This is especially evident in Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett. Furthermore, Tenoch Huerta also knows how to introduce the character of Namor in the Marvel film world. It is special to see this character for the first time in a live-action film, because this was one of the first original heroes from the Marvel comic book world.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

But somehow director Ryan Coogler managed to overcome the Impossible by crafting a solid follow-up thanks in part to it's stellar cast.Right from the get-go we watch as the nation of wakanda is mourning the loss of its king. Grief plays a strong role in the story and we see how T'Challa's death impacts everyone he knew closely. From a mother, to a sister, to a lover, and even a rival turned friend. T'Challa's spirit no doubt hovers over this film & makes for some emotional and heartfelt moments. I cant imagine the difficult task going from supporting to main focus that Letitia Wright had to go up against. But she wonderfully plays Shuri again this time as not just a funny sidekick but now a righteous fighter struggling to carry her family's Legacy forward. It may be hard to see her as the new forefront of the franchise right now but only time will tell if it sticks. The standout performance was no doubt Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda. You really believe this woman lost her son where it's hard to tell if she's grieving for T'Challa, or Boseman, or even both. All the Supporting Cast do excellent jobs growing as their characters and the addition of Dominique Thorne's Riri Williams/Ironheart makes for a very appealing new face to the MCU. Among this great tragedy is the coming of an underwater tribe called the Talokan led by the dominating Namor. Although he may not be as compelling as Eric killmonger from the last film he makes for a solid antagonist that's both ruthless and sympathetic.The movie has its hiccups. For the first 2 acts the movie feels like it really struggles to find its main character. Shuri seems to be made out as the lead but she goes in and out through the story and doesn't become much of the focus until the third act. Also while most the supporting cast worked for me the subplot with Martin Freeman's Agent Ross didn't seem to serve much purpose and couldve easily saved the movie's bloated runtime an extra 20 minutes.Black Panther Wakanda Forever was never gonna be as impactful as its first outing. But thanks to a strong cast, beautifully crafted visuals, fun action sequences, and of course the emotional weight of our lost hero, it makes for a worthy follow up that worked better than It had any right to.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The film is shot beautifully with its gorgeous cinematography and color palette being far more noticeable than most other Marvel projects. The regality of the Wakanda regime, from landscapes to the CGI technology to the costuming, the visuals are even better in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever than the original 2018 film. The storyline is fluid, engaging, and constantly moving - one of the best scripts from Marvel. The movie has the muscle and heft of a comic-book blockbuster, but it also reflects profoundly on the human resonance of ancestry, remembering and moving on.

The big secret was spoiled before the film ever hit theaters, and of course, I won't reveal anything here for those who have managed to avoid the leaks. We do learn the identity of the new Black Panther, complete with action sequences. What really stands out in this sequel to the 2018 original, is that writer-director Ryan Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole return with less action, and more focus on grief, the transition of power, and the introduction of yet another society that has lived undetected for generations.The film opens with the death of King T'Challa from a mysterious illness. We see his mother, Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) and the whole of Wakanda attending his funeral in a sea of white. Ms. Bassett kicks into dominant Queen Mother mode, while butting heads at times with Shuri in a collision of tradition vs. Science. A couple of sequences make sure we understand that Vibranium remains the most valuable and sought-after natural resource on the globe. Wakanda will stop at nothing to protect their way of life and their corner on the Vibranium market. However, it turns out, it's not a corner they control, but rather one they share with a previously unknown society.The CIA is involved ... in a botched mission of greed, of course ... and this means Agent Everett K Ross (Martin Freeman) continues his communication relationship with Wakanda, which drags the agency director and his ex-wife (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) into the fray. The story has many tentacles and bounces around the globe, mostly to appear complicated and important. Other familiar characters are back, including the fierce Okoye (Danai Gurira, a standout in the first film), M""Baku (Winston Duke, given little to do this time), and super spy Nakia (Lupita N'yongo) who now runs a school in Haiti.New to the proceedings are Dominique Thorne, who plays 19-year-old MIT science and technology whiz, Riri Williams, and especially Tenoch Huerta as Namor, the ruler of the underwater kingdom of Talokan. Not back are Daniel Kaluuya (scheduling conflicts?) and, of course, the late Chadwick Boseman, who passed away in 2020. Director Coogler includes a tribute to Boseman over the opening credits, and another near the film's end.The film is two hours and forty-one minutes long, and definitely drags at times. Still, the attempt at in-depth storytelling is commendable in the Marvel universe, though on a couple of occasions, the interjection of songs are distracting and recall 1980's filmmaking. The underwater segments look somewhat realistic rather than cartoonish, and the reveal of the new Black Panther probably won't surprise many - although the high-profile cameo might. Everything about the movie seems to set the stage for more sequels, all quite likely despite this one not reaching the unattainable level of the original.Opens wide in theaters beginning November 11, 2022.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

In the name of comparison DC did a better job than Marvel. In regards to the new Black Panther, Letitia Wright is not the strongest actor to play a superhero.

The Black Panther film was decent, but except for it being a breakthrough film with a unique cast, was just okay, in my opinion. This one is so inundated with complex elements it's hard to follow who's who and what's what. The science is confusing enough. Like many movies with superheroes, the world in which the characters move has to be grounded in something. This one is grounded in confusion. I'm sure the box office will put out yet another film with this milieu, but the Marvel and DC universes have so oversaturated us that coming up with anything fresh in this genre is really hard. Go ahead and see the movie. I just couldn't find much new or interesting.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

"One of the best MCU movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8668977/?ref_=tt_urv","Jithindurden","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46647047/?ref_=tt_urv","11 November 2022","The first Black Panther was very different for a Marvel movie. It felt fresh and was one of the best solo movies of MCU. But even with everything great in it, there were some aspects of it that were designed clearly to be on the safe side of the primary target audience of the MCU. With Wakanda Forever, they surpassed the first part in my opinion and became one of the best movies in MCU. Still, by the end of it, even this doesn't stray too far from a point which is not just for the target audience but also probably for the production company itself.Wakanda Forever is excellent in all aspects of it portraying the imperialistic nature of not just the past but the present superpowers and how that primarily drives the violence ensuing in places where they don't even have to approach directly. At the same time, the film is a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman and his character. There were a few pleasant surprises in there too which I was very glad to see. By the beginning of the third act, I was convinced this is probably THE best MCU film depending on how they chose to end it. But even though the third act wasn't bad per se, it showed how the makers are still in the trappings of the studio system where the blame is passed around through individual failings and an invisible system rather than the enablers and the idealogues of the system. This is still one of the best MCU films and I love how the MCUness relatively limited in this film.","10 out of 36 found this helpful.

"A good sequel that honors Boseman's legacy and that of T'Challa and Black Panther","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8668066/?ref_=tt_urv","nscoby93","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39717569/?ref_=tt_urv","11 November 2022","Before going into Wakanda Forever I made sure to avoid IMDb and Letterboxd so as to not see reviews and ratings. I wanted to truly give this film a chance. A complete unaffected, unbiased opinion so that I maybe open minded to whatever they do in this sequel. To further emphasize on how much I wanted to give this film it's honest chance I was even willing to put on blinders to the trash Disney/Marvel has produced in recent months.With all that said Wakanda Forever is a solid sequel and entry into the MCU. This film had a lot of great moments that made me very happy. The acting was great, the cinematography was beautiful, the cgi while at times weak was mostly well done definitely better than recent Disney/Marvel productions looking at you She Hulk. The score was great, I loved when they incorporated some music from the first film with some of the new. Making things better it's pretty apparent Disney stayed out of the way and kept their crap agenda mostly out.Before going further I must mention while Chadwick Boseman's absence is apparent his spirit is in this film. They pay tremendous homages to T'Challa. But what I appreciated the most about this film was how different it felt, not your standard superhero affair. They chose to put a lot of focus on how Wakanda and these characters are affected without King T'Chala. They also spent a lot of time developing the character who would pick up the mantle of Black Panther, and the ending I think honored T'Challa very well. Although while I enjoyed this aspect of the film I think it may not sit well with audience members seeking said standard superhero affair. Especially with the consideration Black Panther is only in this film for like 30 or 20 minutes.But with all this good there is still a rain cloud, the story while interesting didn't really captivate me for the entire runtime. Which will lead me to my next issue, this film is unnecessarily long at 2 hours and 41 minutes and due to minor pacing issues it felt closer to 3 hours. Then of course the cgi, as I said before it does hold up for the most part but there are multiple scenes where the background is obviously cgi causing the immersion to be broken. Normally it wouldn't be such a big deal to me but with the amount of money Disney puts in these films and even how the last Black Panther had better cgi in this regard there's no excuse.Overall while I did enjoy this film and it's clear that Ryan Coogler and company set out to make a worthy sequel that would honor Chadwick Boseman's legacy it unfortunately just doesn't quite live up to it's predecessor. The final score is one I struggled to come to because as much as I wanted to push it to an 8 it's those issues that bogged things down for me.IMDb: 7/10

Condolences to his family.From the much less important perspective of a movie fan, I thought he was a perfect casting choice for the role. He brought a likeability that had you constantly rooting for him. Always on his side. Makes you want to say, ""I'm with you til the end of the line."" I'll forever wonder what could have been with him helming this franchise. And I had no idea what could be done to save it.The easy answer: just make a great movie. A movie that hits on every aspect, fires on all cylinders. Of course we need a bunch of cool action scenes. Include some clear fight scenes without shaky cam. Add a fantastic musical score and bring it to the forefront (MCU is learning!). Throw in some beautiful cinematography......You already have a bunch of awesome characters played by a great cast, so show off those acting skills (and wow, they really do). Then introduce a BEASTLY villain. And don't skimp on his development (important!)......And the cherry on top? Don't do the typical ""insert joke here"" that the MCU has had a problem with for a while. Have specific scenes for comedy, at the right moments. And allow the serious stuff to be serious. Let us feel it without undercutting it.I'm so impressed with how they pulled this off. The route they took is significantly better than what I assumed they would do. But it's all about execution. Any movie can be good if done right. After the disappointing Thor 4, this is a huge bounce-back.

And none of that is a bad thing in itself. Put altogether, though? A lot to take in after just one viewing.The story flowed along at such a pace I didn't even go to the toilet throughout the two hours and forty minutes of the silver screen spectacle!New characters, new gadgets, new villians and/or antiheroes, new locations and a different beat to tell the obligatory dark Part Two of the trilogy playbook. There's a lot to unpack. And emotions need to stabilize before delving any deeper.A more emotional film than an action one. Bigger action without the fear of losing a favourite character, as this film introduces different sides of previously seen characters, and brand new ones, without the depth and scope previous origin movies gave certain heroes. An altogether enjoyable experience, if only we left expectation at the door!","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

It was a tribute to an incredible actor and someone who you could truly feel made an impact on all of the actors in this film lives while also still creating a beautiful way to continue the story in a very tasteful wayI personally found the plot of the first black panther movie to be a little dull at times but I felt that this one was super effective in establishing a story arch that allowed for development and growth of the characters and the story. It also did what every Marvel movie should do and that's extend the overall arch of the story and push into the next movie of the phase.Plot:1.5/2There are some truly incredible acting performances in this film and it is heavily driven by the female leads who are so exceptional in their roles. From Wright to Basset to everybody else, the women in this film were allowed to shine and they did so in an absolutely incredible way that brought out the best in these characters and truly made you feel all the emotions they were undertaking
Acting:1.5/2This is such a heartbreaking story at times to tell and a story that should have not to have been told but because of the unfortunate passing of Boseman; they were forced to tell the story of his end and it was done in such a beautiful and poignant way but also incredibly effective for the overall storytelling of the MCU. They used this tragedy to teach us about grief as well as how to live your life pass the death of a loved one and that is a lesson I believe we can all take from this film
Storytelling:1.75/2This film had much more creativeness than the original as I thought the original followed the typical superhero story troph to close. This one however kept aspects of that apart of it whiles also brining unique elements that I believed helped elevate the film and make it a much enjoyable experience to watch
Creativity:1.5/2As one would expect this movie is gorgeous and is shot so incredibly well from start to finish. Being able to completely immerse yourself in the world of Wakanda and the wonders that it brings. The soundtrack is also amazing as well and heightens certain scenes doing exactly what music is supposed to do in movies like this and bring out the best in it.Other Factors:2/2I think rightfully so many people were worried about how Marvel was going to do with the Black Panther saga post the death of Chadwick Boseman but I think what has been proven is that this story was able to done incredibly well and they were able to create a movie that I believe Chadwick would have been incredibly proud of and one that holds its own in MCU lore.Overall:8.25/10.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Shuri, Okoye, Nakia and Ramonda have wonderful storylines. I liked the introduction of Riri and look forward to her future. The costumes, sets and scenery were what we would expect from the great nation of Wakanda. The backstory for Namor and his people was brilliant and Talokan was beautiful.Saying that there were some things for me that could have been done better, the music was uninspiring. I wish there had been improvement in M'Baku's storyline and the lack of other important male characters was troubling for me as were some of the fight scenes that went on forever.I also had the same problem with this movie as I had with the original. The villain is really not a villain. Namor and Killmonger are opposites with the same goals and to see the Waukandans flight them wasn't pleasant. I do get the point, but I wish they had circled back to the real villian. But I guess that will happen in other movies.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

The respect and love paid to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman were heartfelt, meaningful, and sincere. The movie wisely grappled with the aftermath of T'Challa's passing on his family and nation. This subject matter created excellent opportunities to dive deeper into characters like Shuri, Nakia, and even M'Baku. Instead, Wakanda Forever primarily served as a vehicle to introduce Namor and Talokan. The film rightfully embraced a more somber tone as it dealt with themes of loss and legacy, but the mournful spirit caused the plot to sag and drag along throughout most of the runtime. Winston Duke offers the little levity the movie had. The cast delivered exceptionally, with Angela Bassett's performance as the true standout. I liked the movie, but the melancholy approach made it more difficult to really enjoy, and the introduction of Namor and his threat to Wakanda chewed up so much of the story that it was difficult to bring closure to characters struggling with loss and heartbreak satisfyingly.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's not bad, and it's not good too. They're just showing what's going on in the Marvel Universe after T'Challa's death. But it's only the first part of the movie, the beginning. They're showing what's Wakanda doing after their lost, and how are they communicating with other countries of world, which are wanting to get their own piece of vibranium. And after this first part of the movie, there appears Nemor. And I wanna say that he is really a great villain, one of my favorite Marvel villains now (okay, but his wings on his feet looks really weird). I liked the water army, with their warrior whales, water bombs and other. And I liked how Riri Williams appears in the plot, I thought she will be just a side character for fanservice and as a teaser of the Iron Heart series, but no. She was really an important character for the plot. Also I liked that the Marvel logo in the beginnig starts with Chadwick Boseman's scenes. And ends with it. Rest in piece legend...
So now I wanna talk about things I didn't liked in the movie. For the first - The world under the ocean. They showed it only visually, and it was beautiful. But they didn't show how works it, they didn't show how live there the people of there, what are they doing, where are they studying or work. I don't know, it was really good movie, but it was kinda... boring? I don't know, there were a lot of great action scenes, but sometimes i really wanted to sleep. Well, i recomend this movie, especially if you aren't marvel fans, but you want cotinue follow this universe. This had his own interesting plot, but there weren't an intrigue, had his interesting new places and locations, fantastic visual, and few nice fanservice scenes. This was good movie, but without Chadwick and Michael B Jordan (there was his mini cameo but it was too short) as main characters it wasn't so good, so I think 2 hours and 40 minutes too much for this. But i like it. I will rewatch it with subtitles, but I don't think that Im gonna rewatching this every year. 7/10.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

"T'Challa's Legacy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8679703/?ref_=tt_urv","alekspredator87","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52780913/?ref_=tt_urv","17 November 2022","The notorious fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has already managed to acquire a bunch of unflattering reviews. A lot of projects that affect a lot of heroes, the lack of a clear narrative line, which the previous three phases of the franchise were famous for, just a huge number of second-rate and uninteresting heroes and an impressive number of inconsistencies - all this is imputed to the creators, led by the chief executive Kevin Feige from a loving and not very viewer. And against this background, the last film of the phase comes out, which should translate the Cinematic Universe into a new fifth. The name of the project is ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"".Frankly speaking, I was impressed with the trailer, hoping that the epic shown in it would move into the picture itself. And I wasn't disappointed. The scale of the film is present. There are a lot of beautiful scenes and locations in the picture. However, with all the danger indicated, which threatens a huge war between many countries, the film feels like it remains somehow local or something. Despite the potential conflict between continents and the ocean, I never managed to feel all the power that other projects with a large number of superheroes possessed.The visual component turned out to be cool. The picture, as before, pleases the eye. Marvel knows how to make his worlds convincing. However, I didn't really like the implementation of the Black Panther itself. The artists obviously messed up with her. The level of graphics and detail is clearly not up to the level of a Marvel blockbuster. The very first films even then looked much more realistic in terms of painted superhero armor. On the other hand, the even more open world of high-tech Wakanda and the new underwater world is very impressive. I pay tribute to the creators. They are able to surprise with detailed fantastic equipment, weapons, smart devices, equipment of heroes. Well, the countries themselves look great on the screen. These are whole new worlds that, it seems, could well exist in reality. However, you catch yourself thinking that the further the development of the Cinematic Universe moves, the more fantastic the worlds become, already noticeably different from the real one in which we live. If the first films still tried to somehow fit into the existing laws of physics, then the latest projects hit concrete fiction, where excessive loads on the human body at high altitudes and during deep dives can no longer do much harm to a person.There are a lot of heroes in the picture. The screenwriters quite successfully intertwine their destinies, thereby subordinating their characters to the events taking place. And these events lead to a global war. However, only residents of Wakanda, a small handful of people and residents of the underwater world will have to figure it out. Although the conflict will be spectacular, it will still be perceived as something not so essential, as if sterile, existing outside the general Marvel universe.The actors cope with the tasks. I would have noted the performance of Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett and Tenoch Huerta. Their brothers-in-law, Ramonda and Namor, respectively, were good and convincing. But here the whole point, as I think, is in the script, which devotes much more time to these characters, leaving everyone else in the background. The events unfolding reveal the motivation of the main male character of the picture. Namor is quite convincing in his monologues. He has seen a lot, so he makes preventive decisions to protect his world. Shuri will have to figure out how to treat the new realities that Namor puts her in front of.Another important point of the picture is Shuri's search for herself. After the death of her brother, she does not find a place for herself, and subsequent events make her lose faith altogether. In order to get together and accept everything that is happening, she will need to go through a series of tests inside herself, where unexpected meetings are waiting for her.The new heroine, Riri Williams, who according to the comics was a follower of Iron Man Tony Stark, seems to have been introduced here simply because it had to be done at least in some project. This character turned out to be of little interest to me personally. And it didn't work out to reveal it to the viewer. There were also problems with the balance of power between the rivals. If at first the antagonists appear as something very dangerous and inflexible, then, as if overnight, then everything abruptly turns over, extolling the opponents' strength. It doesn't look very convincing, but we have to accept that in an already protracted 2.5-hour film it was necessary to somehow approach the finale.The picture and the creators say goodbye in the film to both the hero T'Challa and the 43-year-old actor Chadwick Bozeman who left us. These are essentially two goodbyes. And if the first one passes (for me personally) without emotion, then the second such farewell turns out to be in place. Actress Letitia Wright, as if for everyone, from the film crew to the ordinary viewer, fills the frame with drama, with her tears she says how everyone grieves for Bozeman who left us. Touching.""Wakanda Forever"" turned out to be a good movie. This is a controversial project in many ways, which I personally quite liked. Not a bad picture with a lot of good jokes, by the way. Marvel again successfully manages to insert humor into its projects, thereby diluting a seemingly serious scenario. The picture will find both its supporters and haters. Someone will see the notorious agenda, someone good humor, someone beautiful visual, and someone illogical scenario.

Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira, Tenoch Huerta, and Winston Dukes give A-list performances that bring the movie script to life. Ryan Coogler's directorial and writing skills are second to none. Namor is a complex character whose motivations make real-world sense. This movie will make you laugh, cry and shout for joy. The action scenes were intense and well done. The movie's running time is no problem because you are constantly entertained. Marvel movies have become stale, however Black Panther stands out because of the real-life issues that it addresses.

He is sorely missed in this sequel which is a notch lower because the screenplay is not exactly gripping. The story starts off with the death of King T'Challa despite desperate efforts by his sister ( An AI expert busy all the time in her R and D lab). The mantle falls on mother Queen Ramoda to protect the kingdom of Wakanda from foreign interference and to ensure supremacy among the top nations. The focus is then on palace intrigues leading to incidents of family loss and the following agony. An in the case of the oppression of natives to get unobtanium in Avatar, here something similar is taking place where other nations are planning to snatch the reserves of vibranium. ( I hope I have got the names right).Director Ryan Coogler has ensured that the movie has enough of drama, action and special effects to keep the audience hooked. We have scenes of an epic sea battle followed by exciting hand to hand combat which should please fans. The movie has high class production design and costumes. There are scenes of an underwater kingdom which are worth seeing. The director is helped by some very effective acting by Angela Basset and Lupita Nyongo. The former may pick up an Oscar after a few weeks. The end credits has the tuneful Rihanna song "" Lift me up"" which might pick up an Oscar. A short scene post the credits is very well done and is a nice surprise.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

Wakanda Forever's long runtime certainly ebbs and flows, stuttering at times but ultimately building to a thoroughly enjoyable climax. Wright deserves absolute credit for picking up the lead role in the same (previously supporting) character.The plot explains changes seamlessly, without being perfect. The opening 'tribute' scenes aren't too befitting and seem off, but once the introduction of foes come into play, the environment allows recognition of the King's passing as context without withholding the plot from advancing.Namor is a very exciting character to introduce into the MCU, and Huerta grows into the role as the film progresses. Having 'Atlantis' scrapped and replaced by Talokan for fears of confusion with the likes of DC's Aquaman appears weak on Marvel's part though. The appearance of its inhabitants are a little underwhelming too, one of Marvel Comic's first heroes certainly deserved a greater introduction and appearance.Furthermore, Marvel now seemingly jump to a super suit of armour at every opportunity, which adds nothing interesting to the story, and this is the case here. Ironheart does not contribute positively to the plot, the suit itself looks poor due to the MCU's slipping CGI standards, and having just anyone with the ability to create advanced weapons in the style of Iron Man not only piggybacks, but also lessens, the quality of one of the universe's most popular character, Tony Stark.Choreography is impressive, chemistry between characters works well, dialogue solid and overall is more enjoyable than its predecessor.","1 out of 11 found this helpful.

There's some amazing worldbuilding and powerhouse performances here, the story is enthralling, and the antagonist is about as perfect as you can get in the way he was developed and the role he served. The score by Ludwig Goransson was once again on-point, the realisation of Talokan was fantastic, and every reverence to Chadwick Boseman was respectful and heartbreaking in equal measure. This is a movie that really cared about the legacy of its late star, and was aware of the love and admiration he had earned. But unfortunately, also like the first movie, there was a bunch about Wakanda Forever that I wasn't as much of a fun of. It was too long, filled with too much faff, it was so badly lit certain scenes were almost unwatchable, and they put their bets on the wrong leading actor going ahead. And yet I'm eager to see the effect this movie has on the wider MCU going forward. It did lay the groundwork for a lot of upcoming projects, even if it was to the film's overall detriment. And if you ignore all of that the core elements of the film are essential viewing for any Marvel fan. Wakanda Forever somehow managed to simultaneously be one of the MCU's highest peaks, as well as one of its lowest ditches. And for that I fall on an entertaining 7/10 that remains an improvement on the first film. Huerta and Bassett may be enough on their own to earn an 8 though. I guess time and rewatches may tell.QyrosMovies.","1 out of 11 found this helpful.

All actors are good and are more or less able to inhabit their characters with a touch of realism when all other aspects of the movie are shouting fake all the time. Only Martin Freeman and Julia Louis Dreyfus are looking lost, however it's not their acting that's at fault but just the fact that the scenes they appear in are just untethered from the main story line and thereby lost, uninteresting and just confusing.First the poor quality of the VFX is becoming a true issue. It does feel like watching a videogame most of the time when they are involved. At no point do they convey any sense of realism.Then the settings are so poor it's laughable. Both Wakanda and Namor's palace end up looking for what they are : sound stages with polystyrene and plywood constructs.The whole ideas and concept that are shown are just plain stupid. For instance, the big Wakandan battle ship is so poorly designed that you end up thinking it's a massive bathtub.There are many deaths due to fights all along the story and they are just brushed off as if they never happened. Only the main characters are mourned the rest of the plebe is obviously canon fodder.This last point is a perfect illustration of why ultimately, I think this movie is coarse. Basically it advocates that the very best political system in the world are monarchies and tyrannies. Wakanda which is supposed to be one the most advanced country in the world is just led with an iron grip by one family. This is after all quite normal since they are the only smart and tough people in the land. In this technologically advanced kingdom, there are no universities, no researchers, almost no scientists. All innovations are made by the 20-something year old sister of the king. The only true challenge to the family's power is a brute in the guise of M'baku who seems unable to utter a sentence without retorting to violence afterward when contradicted. All the guards, palace officials, priests and so forth are cowering servants to the royal bloodline. And to top it all the movie presents two democracies (yes, they are flawed still democracies) as the ultimate bad guys : France and the USA. C'mon man let's be serious two seconds.The whole experience smacks of deep rooted longing for fascists states that would be lead by conducators that are either muscular boors (Namor) or conflicted mad scientists (Shuri).","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Chadwick is gone and that void cannot be filled. Also, the wonder of first visiting Wakanda is gone. I felt the first movie was an 8.5/10 but its impact was way beyond what I could nitpick critically. That movie reverberated for me as a member of the Black diaspora in a way that I doubt those outside of it could understand, even if they appreciated it. It dealt with things we're dealing with on a daily basis and connected us with our past/history using a fictional nation.Wakanda Forever doesn't have this, even if it's great to revisit Wakanda. It does have a bonafide newcomer in Namor (Tenoch Huerta) and Talokan. I LOVED seeing their nation and can only imagine what it meant for Latinx/indigenous representation, even if it wasn't quite immersive and setup as Wakanda. Will we get a Namor solo movie? Curious about what that story what would like but I digress. It is a very welcome and central part of this sequel.RiRi Williams/Ironheart is another good addition, though it feels a bit 'off' for some reason. Don't want to give any spoilers but her inclusion in the plot doesn't quite make sense, though I enjoyed her. Shuri (Letitia Wright) can't quite handle the weight of what she's given which I feel is partly intentional and partly her shortcomings as an actor. Other than that, everyone gives great performances.The CGI leaves much to be desired in a few instances but not bad overall. This movie doesn't need to rely on spectacle that much and at times, I feel that is lost on them a bit. But that's the machine right?? I mean, this IS a Marvel movie still. The costume design and music can probably repeat as Oscar winners depending on the competition.There are many poignant emotional moments in the movie as it deals with grief/loss and the question of where do we go from here? There are no easy answers and I don't think Ryan Coogler tries to answer them. He does his best to deal with the loss of Chadwick and deliver something worthy of a tribute and a sequel to one of the MCU's best movies.Yes, it could've been shorter by about 15-20 minutes. Yes, the plot is a bit meandering/convoluted/unresolved. No doubt, it is a flawed film but still a must-see for fans of the first and those grieving Chadwick. Like grief, it doesn't unfold perfectly but we need to get through it and move on. It will be interesting to see where the next Black Panther goes but I'm sure it will be quite some time before we revisit Wakanda.Not a disappointment but not quite up to the hype the initial trailer gave me. Like pallbearers, the cast support the weight of the huge loss of Chadwick Boseman to the best of their ability with mostly satisfactory results. 8/10.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Black Panther 2 without the Black Panther is Disney Marvel's biggest folly yet. Delay and recast were the way to go with this sequel. Way too long running time to sit through a plot so boring and incoherent. So focused on current day and forgot to put the brakes on the director and writers throwing everything up the wall and using what sticks. The Namor character was so far removed from the classic origins of the old Marvel comics, he just came across as the weakest antagonist in the MCU with a poor backstory. The Shuri character is less annoying in this one than she was in the 1st Black Panther film but nevertheless, unable to carry the weight of the film. Angela Bassett was ok as the Queen. A fantastic actress that was given a poor plot and reasoning to go against the wishes of Namor that sparked the tensions and war. The Dora Milaje female warriors were even more insufferable this time round than ever before, quite frankly on this evidence, they'd beat the old Avengers and Thanos in one afternoon the way the director has amped them up with nothing more than carry shields and extendable staffs. The worst character in the film - Riri Williams aka ""Ironheart"", the teenage 19-year-old genius from the age of 3 first built her own powered Iron suit??? In this film she yet another Disney heroine with a sulky bad attitude that knows everything, a well-used and tired Disney trope at this point. The two scenes dedicated to the late great star Chadwick Boseman were exploitive at best. Of course, I understand the cast and crew wishing to pay tribute to their former cast member, but what was served just didn't hit me in the feels the way the film wishes it did. Everyone has said it already, they should've recast the Black Panther role instead of replacing him. Now the franchise has ruined itself behind the glaring fact that T'Challa is no more, again a choice that just didn't work. A very poor and disappointing film. Black Panther 2 is a mess of a film that ultimately dishonours the late star.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Visually stunning in terms of special effects, Wakanda forever is a true upgrade visually because it had to be. The story took the initiative in taking on cultural conflicts using Wakanda and Tolokan as metaphorical representatives of present cultures.

I fell asleep 3 times, and that's not good.Great Directors are not always good Writers and they should accept that. The script of trite, childish and weak, and it didn't have to be. The premise was solid enough, but the treatment of the subject lacked any kind of depth. The result was a lot of moving parts that accomplished very little. It was lightweight, no strong underlying reasons for any of the action, just a bunch of movement, floating in the air. Bad script, vey bad.While some of the music was great, that Finnish, ridiculous techno-pop that ran under too much of the action was annoying and will date this film forever. As well as they did with Black Panther with the music, they went in the complete opposite direction and did equally poorly with this soundtrack. They should have listened to the otherwise timeless 1985 film Ladyhawke with Michelle Pfeiffer and Rutger Hauer to know how thoroughly a dated, annoying, repetitive soundtrack can limit the life of a film, whereas a timeless soundtrack can help a film be bought and played for decades to come.This wasn't horrible, just boring.

Film that closes Phase 4 of Marvel and is also the first without Chadwick Boseman. Overall it is one of the best films of its stage. We had been promised by the director, producers and cast a solemn film in memory of the real Black Panther ... and so it was. The real protagonist of this film? Wakanda. The villain of this movie? There is not. Yes, because Namor is not that. Let's start right from the new entry. Basically I didn't mind at all how this character was reinvented due to the many similarities with Aquaman. The interpretation, on the other hand, is nothing in particular that can be remembered. The soundtrack department chosen for the city of Namor, on the other hand, I adored to madness. But let's come to the surface, more precisely to Wakanda. All the traditions staged are very beautiful .... but Shuri's narrative development is so hateful and flat that I ""rooted"" against her (but for Namor). The most successful character on dry land and who steals the show from everyone is undoubtedly Mbaku (yes hell!!). The new...ah no new Iron Man (Riri Wiliam/Iron Heart) has just been introduced, so let's skip it.In conclusion, the tones, soundtrack / music and the character of Namor are good. The duration of the film could be reduced (perhaps by removing the new Iron Man). Ah yes I don't agree with the choice of who will take the role of Black Panther alas.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

That being said, the standard set by films such as Thor: Love and Thunder and Doctor Strange 2 is very low, so it did not take much for Wakanda Forever walk over the incredibly low bar. Barring Spider-man: No Way Home, this is definitely the strongest film in Phase 4 of the MCU. But it's not without its problems.On the side of good, the acting is great. All the actors are giving it their all, especially Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda. She gives one of the strongest performances in the MCU to date. The action is pretty good for a phase 4 MCU film and the CGI is nowhere near as bad as recent MCU outings. This film also gives touching tributes to Chadwick Boseman that are definitely moving.Now, for the bad. The film is too long. There is a lot of unnecessary stuff in this film that could've been cut. Returning characters from Black Panther 1, such as Everett Ross, feel completely wasted here and have absolutely nothing to do. New character Riri Williams/Ironheart is introduced and she is just as pointless. While initially the objective of the plot, after she is introduced she gets very little to do and simply acts as a bargain-bin Iron Man. Namor as an antagonist is pretty cool, and he's given a lot more depth than previous phase 4 villains. However, he has a sudden shift in character where he suddenly wants to wage war on the surface world. This comes out of nowhere and simply exists to heighten the stakes to worldwide rather than just Wakanda. The ending also feels rushed as if the writers weren't sure how to wrap the film up and so simply end it on an anti-climactic note.Overall, Wakanda Forever, while fun and definitely stronger than most phase 4 entries, is bogged down by pointless characters, muddled motivations and weak pacing. The acting really does carry this film and while the action is fun, the film doesn't do enough to justify its own existence and runtime.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is attempting to be many things and it succeeds at being them for the most part. At once a superhero film, a sequel, a tribute, a comic adaptation and a chapter in the beloved MCU this film had the nearly impossible task of making a sequel to a cultural cornerstone of a movie and moving forward without that films lead. What we get in the end is a remarkable story about the inevitability of loss, but the onset of understanding that comes with grief and ultimately acceptance.The film is well made in every regard. This particular corner of the MCU bears a regality and a standard of production that puts many others to shame. That remains the case, with the costume design, music, visuals, and shot composition all being top notch and pristine. But where it truly shines is its ensemble cast. Everyone brings their best, and you can tell that the actors were passionate about making this film the best it could be. Bassett, a known powerhouse delivers an Oscar worthy performance as Ramonda. Danai Guriria is a unique and stalwart presence in this franchise and shines yet again. Tenoch Huerta delivers a menacing, calculating performance that will have Americans wondering why this guy isn't a huge star already. But the real star it the show is Letitia Wright. Her character shuri goes through so much on screen and has to carry the emotional weight of the film on her shoulders. The happy go lucky girl from the first film is no more. Letitia steps up to the plate and achieves greatness. Her acting is simply fantastic in this movie and you feel every emotion she feels throughout in a performance that is at times haunting and visceral, especially in act 3.As a superhero film it also delivers thrilling high octane action and amazing visual scenes such as the introduction of Talokan backed with gorgeous music by Ludwig Goransson. It is a film to be watched with an audience, an experience to be shared with loved ones.At its core it is a tribute and send-off for the late great Chadwick Boseman whos life was tragically cut short 2 years ago. Within the confines of this film can be found thenes of loss, suffering, faith and the legacy that our loved ones leave behind in death. Do their wants and desires for us matter? Do they define who we are and who we are to become? Should they?All of these make for some amazing storytelling bears that culminates in a bittersweet finale that is beautiful in its restraint.I could go on and on about this film and what it accomplished. But it will suffice to say thus is one of the best CBMs of all time in my book. It will be remembered for a long time to come, and you dont even have to be a superhero fan to enjoy it. The only flaw I will consider is involving a certain subplot that is set up for future films, but it is hardly bad... just less resolved than I'd like.The film is immaculate. Give it a watch and bring tissues.","7 out of 24 found this helpful.

The movie also takes place in several different locations as well.I really wish I could say this sequel was absolutely amazing. But unfortunately for me, the first hour and 30 minutes or so was boring, confusing and seemed to drag. I wasn't feeling anything for the characters, it didn't seem to know what direction it was going and all I was watching was a bunch of action, (which was cool by the way). I thought it took too long until it finally got somewhere. The main villain was ok I guess. Basically an Aquaman knock-off. The last hour or so was really good though!While the this sequel is obviously not as good as the first one, it doesn't deserve to be bashed down below a 5 at all. At that point, people are just being disrespectful about it, saying because Chadwick Boseman wasn't it or because ""it focused too much on him and his death."" or because people are just looking for the attention.

"Very powerful action film.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8786305/?ref_=tt_urv","xianslad","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur136096497/?ref_=tt_urv","8 January 2023","""Black Panther Wakanda Forever"" directed by Ryan Coogler. It's an action and adventure movie. The film was outstanding because it had elements, such as the performers' excellent acting, that Shuir showed in the movie. At the film's beginning, Wakanda expresses their thoughts over how they miss ""Black Panther"" star ""Chadwick Boseman"" and Ryan Coogler utilizes the movie to memorialize him. The script, written by Joe Robert, was lengthy and exciting. This movie set was in the 2020s but used technology far more sophisticated than ours. The plot explains how Shuri transforms into the new Black Panther and teams up with other characters to defeat Namor. The actors performed well and were talented, especially Shuri, as the new Black Panther. She will have a lot of responsibility for the forthcoming movies. The music score was sad when Black Panther died at the movie's opening. The film was filled with funny moments that make you laugh, yet the most impactful parts show how important they are becoming. I had goosebumps at the end credit, which created an exciting future for Marvel. This movie is a must-see since the pivotal point in the film made me cry, and I advise you to see it.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was ready for a subpar sequel to a film I think is ridiculously overhyped. What I did not expect was a Cinematic Masterpiece.From start to finish Wakanda Forever gives you everything you could ask for in its 2 hour & 41 minute runtime. Action scenes will have you on the edge of your seat. The Climax will have you emotional. This movie did a great job on making it feel like the viewer is apart of whatever is happening.Cinematography is 10/10. Wakanda is always beautiful on screen but additional locations especially the one hosting the antagonist stole the show for me.Letitia Wright led the way with her recurring role and made every scene count. Flawless performance from her & the supporting cast consisting of Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett, Danai Gurira & more. The way they took real life issues and portrayed them in the film really made the story hit close to home although it's being held in a fantasy universe. Tenoch Huerta's role as Namor could be the #2 MCU villain so far with Thanos still claiming the #1 spot. You were able to reason with his decisions and fully understand his point of view rather than the traditional ""Over the top"" villains that just act based on their strength level.The plot was perfect. With the passing of Chadwick Boseman (RIP) This movie was able to exist with no flaws even with his absence. I could honestly say the movie may not have been as great if he were in it. And that's because he wouldn't have fit. They handled his passing in the movie in a way that set the tone & passed the torch to the rest of the cast to finish what they originally started.Overall...Best movie I've seen all year. #1 MCU movie so far. Could arguably be in the top 10 movies of all time.","11 out of 44 found this helpful.

Many of the stunt sequences could have been completely reused from other movies but with new CG body doubles dropped on top, and the entire thing is held back by Disney's need to make the movie as bland and palatable to a wide audience as possible. The fight scenes felt like they wanted to show death and destruction, but wouldn't show anyone so much as getting a cut - it was extremely jarring to see a bloodless battle between dozens of people in two armies using entirely melee weaponry.The new protagonists were clearly an attempt at setting up new television series or further movies, and simultaneously a way to get an Iron Man-type and a Black Panther-type character back into the MCU. It gets boring when the current thing is mostly about the next thing instead of attempting to be good on its own.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

She feels pointless and annoying but is EXACTLY like Iron Man despite no connection whatever. Her ""humor"" was cringey. There is nothing particularly interesting about her. She should have been given her own origin story, then her appearance here would have the energy of a crossover.The new costumes for side characters are awful.I thought the tone of this film similar to Eternals, but Eternals did it better.

I was very curious to see how the people at Marvel as well as the actors were going to tackle the sudden loss of our beloved Chadwick Boseman, may he rest in peace. I'm happy to say they did a phenomenal job to honor both Chadwick Boseman as King T'challa.From a story point of view, I loved this movie even more then the first. Though Chadwick Boseman leaves behind a hole in the heart of the story, he's still there with us. His legacy, both that of him as his character - as well as his presence is constantly felt throughout the movie. I truly believe that this is the way Chadwick would've wanted this movie to be as well.Letitia Wright did a phenomenal job despite the sad circumstances. She managed to take her emotions and blend that into an incredible acting performance, which felt real because it was real. Just like it is for 'Shuri', the events that have happened are upsetting, depressing and unbelievable - just like what has happened to Boseman. But just like it did for her in the movie, this story really helped me truly accept the losses of an awesome character and an incredible human being.All of the other cast members managed to really up their game as well, leaving us with only pristine performances. I was very satisfied with Tenoch Huerta's portrayal of 'Namor', our antagonist. He was quite intidimating and his presence/power was felt throughout the movie, since it has been so strongly established that Wakanda is the most powerful nation in the world - and he managed to make them have a run for their money. The concept of their two powerful nations colliding because of the mistakes of others, is meaningful and suspenseful to watch.I adored the music, both Ludwig Göransson's score as well as the features. It captures the right emotion or vibe (loss, action, evil, hope, vengeance, ...) just perfectly well to bring us even closer to that moment. Ryan Coogler crushed it once more as well as director and lead writer of the story. I hope he gets recognized more and proceeds to make many more amazing projects.The cinematography and world building was, once again, incredible. The sight of Wakanda will never get old. Namor's city also looked incredibly unique, though it reminded me of Atlantis but that was to be expected.It was an emotional rollercoaster with gut wrenching action sequences, powerful emotional moments and a way for us to heal. I will forever miss Chadwick as ""The Black Panther"", as he will remain that forever in my heart. I like to think that if he could see this film from above, he would be smiling. Just as I and all the other fans that were sitting besides me in the theater and all across the world.","8 out of 30 found this helpful.

In that regard, this movie was such a beautiful tribute to such a beautiful soul that it was hard to have enough tissues on hand. Ryan Coogler truly made an ever-lasting and truly heartfelt memorial for Boseman in this film that was respectful, endearing, and genuine. This cannot be overstated.The plot itself was a bit inconsistent. First, it's nearly impossible to make an underwater movie look good. Even the backing of the MCU couldn't achieve this, but honestly, it's because it's not possible. Every single live action movie set underwater looks like trash. It's one of the reasons it's so rarely done. This movie was no exception. The strange scenes of underwater grottos achieved the same exact effect of every other movie with a similar setting- it was, undeniably, silly and cinematically cringey. The holes in the consistency of the plot are glaring and it often moves at a bit of a glacial pace.All of that being said, the cast of this movie cannot be praised enough. The performances were nothing short of breathtaking from a cast that is mostly black, female, and commanding. To say it was refreshing to watch is the understatement of the century. These women delivered such nuanced performances that anything less than an Oscar for each would be a slap in the face.As is par for the MCU, the cinematography was devine and the graphics unparalleled (save the underwater scenes). What has really stuck with me is the acting. It was so well done that the plot holes and inconsistencies were merely background noise.I cannot laud this cast enough. And, while I am sure I cannot imagine what filming without Boseman must have been like, I feel certain his legacy will thrive because these women persevered to give us the closure we all still needed.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Emotions over substance","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8877889/?ref_=tt_urv","sujanfaster","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur35235050/?ref_=tt_urv","18 February 2023","It is safe to say MARVEL's content has been pretty underwhelming recently on both big screen and OTTs. I don't have the same energy to hit the theaters anymore when MARVEL's new movie releases. I had my doubts with respect to Wakanda Forever as well, but after hearing about its great tribute to Chadwick Boseman, I went to the cinemas to watch it anyway.The trailer pretty much gives away where the plot is going and also who would be the new Black Panther. The initial T'challa tribute scenes are very heartwarming and also brilliantly shot. The sound design for those scenes is top notch. The plot continues to go around the obvious Vibranium arc afterwards. Despite the ""coming together"" events in Avengers: Endgame, we go back to square 1 where Wakanda is again distancing itself from the power and resource hungry world leaders. The introduction of the antagonist Namor and his tribe brings back the energy up to a certain level. However the film doesn't really justify the acts of Namor and also the battle in the end doesn't really intrigue as much,The characters in this movie carry heavy emotions and they do deliver well especially tying it to T'challa's death. I still believe there could have been something more added to that part of the story. Letitia Wright as Shuri carries herself with ease along with Angela Basset as Ramonda. But I personally feel that Ramonda's role isn't significant enough to grant Basset an oscar nomination for this movie. Tenoch Huerta's intense performance as Namor is definitely a standout and a great introduction for the actor. However, the other characters are not so impactful mainly because of them working with new supporting characters who are introduced in the movie. Although the movie is long, it doesn't provide enough substance to roles of Okoye, M'Baku, Oyo and Namora. Less I said about RiRi is better as I feel it was a very forced and poorly written character. I know that there's future for RiRi's role in the MARVEL universe and will wait to see how it pans out.Wakanda Forever is a weird movie to judge. It has a great tribute to Chadwick, but I don't think the movie itself is one. It is a decent watch for the Black Panther fans but quite a tiresome for the rest.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

If Wakanda Forever gets anything right it is being respectful to the late great actor. From the intro Marvel title sequence montage of his greatest moments, to the commemoration at the end. They treated his legacy with care and consideration, and especially no CGI resurrections (cough *Star Wars reboots*).About an hour of the film is setup and retcons, which is when I fell asleep. The second act is primarily character development and world building, primarily led by the amazingly talented Angela Basset. Unfortunately, Queen Ramonda doesn't get as much screen time as the much less interesting Shuri, played by Letitia Wright. Wright is a fine actor, but as a protagonist Shuri doesn't have nearly enough depth to carry a whole film. Her struggle involves revenge and grief, generic conflicts even reused from the prior film.Shuri's character arc feels very redundant by the end, but hey, at least the CGI was awesome. The last third is almost all flashy greenscreen action scenes, directed well enough. Just don't go into it expecting memorable set-pieces, unique characters, or a revolutionary story. IF you want that, rewatch the original film and treat this as a feature length tribute.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"A little too long, but a pleasant surprise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8668691/?ref_=tt_urv","Prisszm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16221399/?ref_=tt_urv","11 November 2022","I came into this movie with low expectations given the passing of Chadwick, and the general weakness MCU has been putting out since Endgame. I was pleasantly surprised with the output. The movie still had your touches of classic MCU cliches and humors, but they were much more tame than in recent years past. From the start, this movie begins with a very serious and emotional tone and holds onto it through the end, only giving way for a few slight comedic relief moments. I loved that this movie was able to not add a new main lead and instead relied on stronger performances of the previous cast, who delivered outstanding follow-up products.Namor was one of the better villains the MCU has put out, as Namor's depiction was somewhat similar to Thanos - someone with a passion to fulfill their mission, with some questionable character reasoning that adds to the plot dilemma. Credit to the effort Tenoch Huerta put in for this role and his portrayal of secretive living.To no surprise, the MacGuffin of this MCU film is the mantle of the Black Panther. I thought Coogler and team did an amazing job of telling this story with the absence of this figure, and allowing the characters to explore the majority of the movie to fill the void. The classic ""MCU moments"" definitely start creeping in the last 45 minutes of the film, when things started to become MCU-predictable, but I did feel Coogler was allowed a majority of the creative freedom he desired for the first ~2 hours of the film - and it paid off.Finally a job very well done by Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and especially Letitia Wright - who helmeted the lead role beautifully in the departure of her character's brother. Was unsure of how Wright would be in the lead role, but she left no doubts she is a star.From a critique standpoint, this movie easily could have cut off several minutes of ""fat"" from the final product. My least favorite moment of the movie was easily led by one returning character who did not fit in with the rest of the movie's theme. It didn't feel like the moment fit, but as always with the MCU- there's probably a reason for it.Overall well worth the watch, and I am looking forward to viewing again on D+ to give a closer look to more details.","6 out of 21 found this helpful.

While it may not quite reach the same heights, it is still an incredibly powerful and emotional film that is sure to delight many fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The performances in this film are very good, particularly from lead actor Letitia Wright. Her portrayal of Shuri is both powerful and heartfelt, and she truly embodies the strength and resilience of the Wakandan people. The supporting cast is also exceptional, with familiar faces like Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira delivering strong performances once again.Angela Bassett once again delivers a standout performance in Black Panther 2, bringing strength and gravitas to her role as Queen Mother.And of course, the late Chadwick Boseman is honored in a touching and respectful way that is sure to resonate with fans of the series.The film also does an good job of tackling difficult themes and issues, such as grief and loss. The passing of Boseman's character, T'Challa, is handled with the utmost care and sensitivity, and the way the film addresses this loss is both poignant and thought-provoking.However, the film does have its flaws.The film can feel slow at times. There are also a few plot points that feel underdeveloped or rushed, leaving the audience with unanswered questions. Additionally, while the film's villain, Namor, is a formidable foe, he doesn't quite live up to the standard set by previous MCU villains like Thanos or Loki.In comparison to the original Black Panther film, Wakanda Forever falls just short of the same level of excellence. While the performances and themes are just as strong, the pacing and plot issues hold it back from being a true masterpiece. Nonetheless, it is still an incredibly well-crafted and emotionally resonant.One of the biggest challenges facing the MCU is how to continue the high quality of its first few phases of films. While Wakanda Forever is certainly a strong entry in the series, it is clear that the franchise is struggling to recapture the magic of its earlier films. Whether this is due to the changing landscape of superhero films or simply the difficulty of sustaining a long-running franchise, it remains to be seen.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a powerful and moving film that honors the legacy of Chadwick Boseman and the world of Wakanda. While it may not quite reach the same heights as its predecessor, it is still an excellent entry in the MCU that is sure to leave a lasting impact on audiences. The performances are exceptional, the themes are thought-provoking, and the film is a fitting tribute to the late, great Chadwick Boseman.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Sometimes, one needs to be able to just sit back and enjoy films, and that's what I find myself doing with a lot of Marvel films, including the first Black Panther film. Wakanda Forever is different. It's slower paced, has much fewer action scenes, less comedy, and more of a focus on the emotions of the characters. I think that for some, these differences will turn them off, but I absolutely loved it. I was captivated from start to finish and loved the greater depth and the character evolution.Recent Marvel films have been a bit of a mixed bag, some still really great, but several lacking the spark that made earlier films so good.

Although the start is not a place I would have thought Shuri would have been emotionally considering how she was after her fathers death.There was some logical inconsistencies with the start of the plot but it was small enough for me to gloss over, especially since Marvel generally don't let you dwell on those type of things.A lot of the character arcs were satisfying and I did not feel the run time.

But it is also, another celebration for the African community.It accentuates the identity of Ryan Cooper as a director that wants to show the African essence in the story of the Black Panther.

Additionally, capturing new traits of the people, and introducing new stories around the Vibranium ramifications, such as Riri Williams, which was presented accordingly.In my opinion the only thing that slips, on this film, is the pace of the third act, which disassociates the screenplay, and ""tries to explain many things on a short period of time"". This creates a little bit of doubt, concerning the future of Wakanda, and all the tension evoked by the events presented, throughout the World.However, overall, it's another great experience, that need to be celebrated and cherished by all.","8 out of 31 found this helpful.

For the idea behind the comics themselves is smart and underrated. It is sometimes dismissed as just a token diversity attempt, a lazy attempt at inclusion. The same way they make a supergirl for superman and such. However, the Wakanda setting is well thought of and adds a sociopolitical commentary that is philosophical rich. In the context of postcolonialism it uses it's fantastical world as a thought experiment. Asking the question of what would have happened if there was a secret African nation hidden from the world that is more advanced technologically and socially than any Western power. Should they use this power to unite disenfranchised and marginalized Africans around the world making a new world power? Should they share their technology and resources with the rest of the world given the history of colonization and imperialism. However, the most prominent question is the matter of vengeance, if these hidden nations had the power to destroy and subjugate the previous imperial powers, should they exact this revenge?In this movie, however, it just feels like nothing is particularly added in terms of concept, but only a new kind of Wakanda based on a hidden Mayan civilization rather than an African one. This Mayan civilization is hidden in an Atlantis like fashion with the inhabitants taking a transhuman form that is more fitting with their new aquatic lives. The leader of this civilization wants to exact vengeance on the entire world of surface dwellers and wants Wakanda as an ally rather than as an enemy. The plot itself is filled with cliches and still very much feels like a superhero blockbuster.What really carries the movie is the costume design, aesthetic elements, architecture, etc. The movie is filled with beautiful scenes and is really rich in terms of trying to capture the cultures and historical heritage it is trying to present through this fictional hidden civilization.In terms of entertainment the movie is not as funny and the action not as captivating as the first movie. Some of the battles are unrealistic and feel unnatural. I would still recommend this movie to lovers of the Marvel Universe and the superhero genre in general.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Its very emotional and stays true to the legacy of Black Panther. I won't spoil anything, but its definetly worth a watch if you are one of those who has been getting bored of recent Marvel releases.Global struggle, conflicts among main characters, healing and good-feel music throughout the movie was itself worth 10 stars, if not more. This is truly one of those movies you could have a 2nd or 3rd watch without getting boring. It has action, suspense, drama, altough comedy was a bit lacking in this one, but it is not anything you're going to miss. Everything else felt nice phased, no drag-out scenes, it keeps you addicted to the big screen. Without spoiling it - I'm just going to say the best part about the movie is the END :) Have a great watch - good job to creators of this movie and RIP Chadwick Boseman!","14 out of 64 found this helpful.

The Scene with Mbaku arm wrestling Shuri and the End bit when Ku-Kul-Khan and Shuri are on top of the spaceship together and the music blows those scenes through the roof.Things that They should of Changed -1. Either Recasting Tchalla or Anointing another character like a Young Man to Become the New Black Panther would of worked far better than Shuri.2. Riri Williams shouldn't be in this film, the War between Wakanda and Talokan should of been through the means of somebody Trespassing, Stealing or Killing either the Talokans or Vice Versa the Wakandans. That should of sparked the Diplomatic Issues Between the 2.3. Mbaku and his Men should of played a much bigger role in this Movie.4. If not Recasting Tchalla, than have Tchalla die on screen through a battle with the Talokans early on in the movie. It would of been far better and far more emotional. Not just quickly Killing him of screen. It was so Flat because of that.5. The Angela Bassett thing shouldn't of happened Period.6. Make the Talokan Underwater more Visually Appealing, it looked far inferior to Aquamans Atlantis.Parts I Liked -1. That Scene when Shuri descends from the Spaceship and the Might of Mbaku walks Down to Meet Her, and do the Arm Wrestling Test and that Music Blows the Roof Off! The Admiration was So High. What a Scene that was!2. The Story and Diplomatic Issues Between Wakanda and Talokan were Great Ideas.3. Actor That Played Namor Had a Great Monologue and Performance. At first, I thought KU-KUL-KHAN didn't look intimidating, but then I realised, I don't think they were going for a Physically Gigantic and Imposing Namor, but rather they were going For an unassuming look but he was Stone Cold Killer, It actually Worked and I get that now on the Second Watch.4. Attuma looked Great in Battle.5. The Okoye battle on the Bridge was So Damn Good.6. The Backstory of Namor was Great7. The Score was Super Strong. Ludwig Gorranson Really Created a Powerful Score for this Movie.8. The Hypnosis Scene From The Talokans was a Great Scene, was Definitely another Highlight of the Movie.9.

I'm not sure they had to kill T'Challa, but I do understand the difficulties of replacing the like of Chadwick Boseman who made the role his own. I'm not sure they had to present Namor the way they did, even though his character in the comics allows for this option, but it does limit what they can do with him in the future. And I don't like the fact they kill other leading characters almost as an easy way out.All that said, this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't disjointed as other reviewers here suggested - I spoke with a few that watched the movie with me - we had no problem following the plot. It was definitely a very slow action movie - as my title says - that's a result of the decision to focus on the characters, and this is a decision I do agree with. It did present us with a lot of superb acting performances with Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira topping the list, but with almost no false note in the entire cast. And when the roles are so well performed the slow pace of the movie doesn't make it any less riveting. Again, the role of Namor does leave a lot to be desired, though they did try to give him some depth, but I think they made him a bit too contradictory and so very hard to play and relate to.Bottom line, the moment they decided to make the new Black Panther a she, they were bound to face a lot of animosity on this site. It comes with the territory over here, and I know I'm going to pay with a lot of hate, here - I'm half expecting it by now. But I liked the way they dealt with the issue of grief and international politics. And even if the role of Riri was shoved into the movie for external reasons I don't think it hurt the movie in any way.","5 out of 17 found this helpful.

Apart from some pictures of course. But still, the whole phase seems to be not completely connected with each other. And all of it consists of more than ten pictures, including serials, but now is not about that. As you can see, quantity does not mean quality. And it also ""hooked"" the Black Panther, which, as for me, is just as slurred. A tribute to Chadwick Boseman is certainly the right thing to do (this is not a spoiler, it was clear in the trailers and so it was). But after the conflict already begins, which is not unambiguous, of course, everything starts to go sluggishly. Plus, with the introduction of a new ""hero"", it also somehow turned out chaotically. And most likely, they either did not try on the costume, or they did everything in a hurry (it looks like a plastic toy in fact). Shuri is the main character, and now she is the Black Panther, but ... there is one small plot, so to speak, a reserve for the future, which not everyone will like for one reason or another. ""Why so, and exactly so?"" I ask myself, it's not clear. But, as the completion of the fourth phase, it was possible to try a little or something. The first picture was somehow more harmonious, you felt Tchala as a new king, his formation. Here it looks different, and for the worse.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is this threat hanging with war but the logical errors are too big to make this setup believable. Despite some good dialogue. But I felt that the dialogue isn't reflecting the situation we are introduced and walked through.Namor was better than expected. Besides I really don't like his flappy feet. But the way they created the feeling for the way he moves rapidly like a hummingbird and builds up momentum was cool. Also his motivation is understandable. But then... Too fast with his actions.And then there is this very big logic hole in the first third.I also raised my eyebrows more than once with the CGI costumes/armors.

This show fell into that trap with humming bird wings that can propel a man supersonic to the stratosphere.

They did a very nice job of writing in a way that incorporates and honors his legacy. And the opening Marvel sequence was in very good taste.I was hopeful that this movie could keep the magic of Wakanda and the other characters alive. For me, it did that. While it would be so much better, a thousand times over, to have Chadwick in this film, the fact simply is that he couldn't be. And out of that was borne deeper dimensions to his family and chaisms and conflicts that pulled me in and kept my attention.I enjoyed the other elements of this film as well. I found the character of Namor to be well acted, written, and executed. I also enjoyed the complicated history behind him and his people, as well as how it overlapped with Wakanda. I felt invested in the outcomes of the conflicts.There are definitely things that could've been better. This wasn't a perfect film. But it's certainly better than any other recent installations in the MCU in 2022. It doesn't rely on so many gimmicks and overdone, unwelcome juvenile humor that Marvel/Disney seem dead set in making the cornerstone of a once story-rich franchise. ""Wakanda Forever"" is poised, pleasing, and emotional. Nice job to Ryan Coogler, crew, and cast!","6 out of 22 found this helpful.

Also, the ending was heartwarming and we got to see the main character Shuri get the closure that they were looking for, we got to see her journey on how she had to rediscover herself and work towards her goals. Unfortunately, there was no post-credit scene but I am looking forward to another Black Panther movie.Other details that I should mention: Very good action scenes (I'm not a professional) but they did look realistic and I like how they changed throughout the film. I really liked the characters and their development/growth was nice to watch, I especially loved the mother-daughter relationship because it didn't follow the ""typical"" media portrayal as toxic or tense but as a fun duo who look out for one another. Additionally, I loved the music and different portrayals of the diverse cultures, it shows that the universe in the movie is bigger than just the main characters. However, I did see an overuse of some special effects and once I noticed it was hard to look away. Also, I expected the ending, as soon as I saw the character I knew what was happening I personally don't like those storylines because I feel like it starts a cycle. But, overall it was a good movie and I'm happy that I finally got around to watching it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie has some positive highlights, including stunning world-building and visual style in the first half. However, in the third act, the film loses its visual flair, becoming comparable to a Saturday morning cartoon with goofy and awkward CGI animations.The central performances are fine, with Angela Basset standing out as she steals every scene she appears in. The plot is a little messy, with a couple of unnecessary side quests that didn't add much to the movie and felt like a set-up for future films that the studio forced in.The absence of T'challa is felt throughout the movie, and it's clear how much Chadwick Boseman brought to the first movie. He is truly missed, and may he rest in peace.Wakanda Forever is another average addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase Four.

The absence of Chadwick Boseman is deeply felt, and his talent is sorely missed.

Somehow, it worked. The sequel tries to do something even harder. Actually, it tries to do a lot of things. Coogler attempts to pay tribute to the late great Chadwick Boseman, to make another story about giant ideas (faith, grief, colonialism), to make a superhero movie without the hero, to elevate a ton of new characters, and to advance the MCU along in the process. It is a lot. Maybe that is why it ended up 2 hours and 40 minutes long. The good news is I was genuinely both entertained and moved at points. The bad news is I also spent too much time either wishing we could move things along, rolling eyes at the over the top technology, or wondering if this was an Avatar crossover event. Basically, some things worked and some things didn't. It was better than the most recent MCU movies I think (and the highs are higher), which says something given everything it tried to do. It was also worse than any other Coogler movie to date, which makes me hope he can do something less franchisey next time around.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

However Tenoch Huerta as ""Namor"" has got a balanced attitude because he's got a giant chip on each shoulder plus mutant abilities (including an Achilles heel literally).This dude can fly and breathe underwater and is one of the main reasons this North Queenslander took up diving and snorkelling as an aquatic hobby.In the past ""Namor"" has worked with the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men and others, but they don't get a look in during this origins storyline leaving the door wide open to expand this chapter of the MCU.Just one question: What's with the water bombs?It was like a kids birthday party every time Namors people exploded one.What I liked about ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"": The wonderful minutes silence for the original ""Black Panther"" actor Chadwick Boseman who would have loved this movie no doubt.African-American Ryan Coogler returns to direct this sequel and felt right at home in the big chair again with a huge budget of hundreds of millions of greenbacks to play with.Rhianna even wrote a new hit song just for this movie, ""Lift Me Up"" plays during the closing titles.Watch out for: The costumes, sets, the pageantry, the fight scenes and the bonus revealing end credits plus a marvellous eye watering tribute to the memory of Boseman.Plus Angela Bassett delivers an academy award award winning speech and performance in her reprised role as as ""Queen Ramonda"".3.5/5*","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

""Black Panther"" (2018) was a Best Picture Nominee. The introduction of Wakanda was a visual spectacle. Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan both give transcendent performances in the film. So, what do you do for the sequel? How can you recapture the magic of seeing Wakanda for the first time? And most importantly, how do you make a Black Panther movie, when Black Panther died? The tragic death of Chadwick Boseman undoubtably threw a wrench into the original planned sequel. The world may have lost an all-time great actor, Ryan Coogler lost a good friend. The question became, would making a Black Panther 2 be in poor taste. To the movie's credit, they did a solid job playing tribute to the late great Panther. Certainly much better than they did in the other Panther film, ""Trail of the Pink Panther"" (1982). There they just had someone stumble around with bandages around the face claiming to be Peter Sellar's Clouseau. Yeah...they don't do that in this film.Outside of how they play tribute to Boseman, how is the movie itself. It is good, but not great. The underwater city of the Ubuntu isn't as visually appealing as Wakanda. Like water levels in most video games, the underwater parts naturally seem to slow down the pace of the movie.The movie also has elements that feel like the producers added into the story in order to set things up for future Marvel properties. The storyline of Martin Freeman and Elaine feels tacked on and doesn't add much to the story. Characters like IronHeart, are added in here, and I'm sure in future movies might be important, but here they are more of an afterthought. It may be unfair to compare, but Namor isn't as compelling a villain as Killmonger. They show Namor's backstory, and it's fine, but he lacks any personal connection with the hero. His powerset is vague enough that action scenes with him lack much impact.The parts dealing with Wakanda and the political intrigue of different diplomatic decisions is where I feel this movie is at its best. Angela Basset rightfully earned her ""Best Supporting Actress"" nomination, her character goes through so much, and she plays each scene pitch perfect.The action scenes in the movie is a mixed bag. When the movie is doing a smaller action set piece it is well done. The larger action scenes fall short. The car chase, sneak in scenes and fight scenes are all shot and choregraphed well. But, when the movie does larger battle scenes, it has a bit too much going on to keep track of all it needs to.Not Marvel's best movie, but I give credit that Coogler and those involved were able to make it as good as it is.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So went into this one with expectations that it would be just a little better than the awful Love and Thunder or the average Multiverse of madness.Well what i got was unexpected, an actual serious tone and very strong Marvel Film! It's been so long in a sea of Disney + tripe and bang average marathon of films, Chang Chi , Black Widow, Eternals, Thor etc etc etc.Firstly there's some Oscar quality stuff being shown by the heavyweights , Angela Basset and Lupita Nyongo show that they are levels above in this film having been criminally underused last time.Latisha wright also shows shes very talented now not relegated to light comic relief. Not watched Narcos Mexico but Tenoch Huerta also very impressive, again refreshing to have a proper antagonist rather than a paper thin villian.Much better grounded end battle thank Odin also, rather than just a messy CGI fight.The only thing that rankled me a little was Riri Willaims., not because i hate the character like a lot of the internet. Far from it, i always kinda liked someone being super inspired by Tony Stark and becoming IRON-HEART as tribute (though they kinda gave that role to spiderman in the MCU)Just in this film that aspect of Ironheart just doesn't exist, I know he's dead but he might aswell have never existed here also. Very quick almost unnoticeable mention that she is using stark tech but then never mentioned again, and Stark is not brought up again.Its the equivalent of Captain American Sam Wilson just turning up but never mentioning Steve, Maybe in her own likely poor to average Disney show.Ultimately i'd say you probably wont like this movie and give it a low score if you get upset/triggered by a handful of mentions that White Europeans Once colonized poorer nations and in this instance enslaved native South Americans OR want your Marvel films to have lots of trademark comedy or a Guardians of the Galaxy/IronMan?spiderman type lightness and fun.Its more on the side of ""Film"" rather than a ""Movie"" and if that sounds pretentious and dull then yes it may not be what you're after.

A fireside chat late one night doesn't quite go to plan though, when they are introduced to an interloper. ""Namor"" (Tenoch Huerta) arrives to ask their help to thwart the Americans who nave managed to design a machine that can trace vibranium, and this has put his hitherto unknown population of underwater, Mesoamerican, people at risk. Either they help him to track down the scientist who created this or there could be war. The Princess and her general head to Massachusetts where they track down a college student who is almost as much of a whizz-kid as ""Shuri"". The FBI are on soon their trail and skedaddle they must, straight into the arms of the waiting ""Talokan"" who take them to their beautiful watery homeland where we learn just how they evolved. Somewhat narked, the Queen wants her daughter back and that action sows the seeds for a conflict between the two nations that, well, you can guess the rest. Sadly, that's the problem here. Despite a really strong and vibrant performance from Wright and some very fine production values, there is precious little story here. It is far, far, too long to sustain the thin plot and the conflict engineered between the two races is flawed in more ways than an US Congressional election. The pace is really slow, the combat scenes could have been choreographed by Sir Matthew Bourne - or by a Wakandan cheerleader at their equivalent of the ""Superbowl"" - and the supporting characters aren't on screen long enough to give Miss Wright enough help to wade through the frequent tedium. I wasn't helped by Huerta's very thick accent which made his dialogue nigh-on impossible to comprehend at times and the denouement screamed sequel so loudly that I forgot that I'd long given up on any jeopardy at the end two hours ago. There is a bit of character tragedy, character loyalty and thankfully Martin Freeman's (""Ross"" - why does he need an American accent?) appears but sparingly as we go along but Marvel must stop taking the audience for granted. They have to realise that their gorgeous Avatar-esque visual effects and technical wizardry are not going to entertain us indefinitely if the stories continue to deliver so weakly. Great to look at, a few power-ballads from the soundtrack and Wright is certainly a stylish and classy star - otherwise, this is a film nobody will remember in two years time, I'll bet!","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movies aren't focused on a message or direction, and Disney+ is encouraging an orgy of hints, nods, and character setups. The MCU world seems to become ever more unreal and disconnected from reality as the plots grow and diverge.Wakanda Forever is bloated by all of the above. Ironheart is a needless diversion to avoid an origin movie, and setup a Disney+ show. Off tone, badly timed, and adds nothing to the movie. There are diversions to create more suited characters, again unnecessary. Another CIA scary person is set up for another movie probably. All pointless detours, eating up the minutes.This is really disappointing because the movie is good in spite of this. It could have been great if Marvel focused on making just this one movie.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"Surprising and Powerful","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8682217/?ref_=tt_urv","mikedud-81751","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur157810725/?ref_=tt_urv","18 November 2022","I was not such a huge fan of the first Black Panther film. Though culturally impactful, the film did not resonate with me as much as others. Black Panther: Wakanda Forvever does, as it explores the themes of grief, lose and acceptance very well.The film had an almost impossible task, filling the shoes of the late Chadwick Boseman. His presence is dearly missed in the film, but it is expressed by each of the characters partaking in it. Leita Wrights character Shuri, takes the mantle not only as the titular character, but as the heart and soul of this movie. Her character was very fundamental throughout the whole film. Her development from quirky tech savvy teen to an emotionally complex and layered leader is very well done.The main villain of the film Namor The Sub Mariner, is a big standout character. A very powerful sympathetic leader, who is trying to protect his hidden nation from the impending threat of the outside world. Many parallels are drawn between his kingdom and Wakanda, along with his character and Shuri's.My only real gripe with this film is how they over saturate the side characters with unnecessary subplots and upgrades. The runtime would have been shorter if not for the focus put in on elements that did not add much to the story.Overall Wakanda Forever is a great tribute to T'Challa/Chadwick Boseman, great storytelling and much better action sequences then the first film. Ryan Coogler really made this movie standout on its own compared to other MCU projects.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

2.5 hours of tribute that is important but not that long, a bad villain with a story that doesn't work reminds a little of aquaman, a black panther that doesn't stand out, marvel still has a long way to go to return to a line of stories at the level of the previous phases, which catch the viewers, there are good interpretations but there are also things that remain empty and with the duration of the film, better ideas would have been developed. Besides, if you stay for the post-credits, you're going to waste your time... a scene that doesn't say much and another that doesn't exist.It was great for marvel to make good movies, and it's not for heroes because this choice of thor4 is a fiasco.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"A wonderful film marred with odd character motivations","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8686663/?ref_=tt_urv","tjosephubert","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39416308/?ref_=tt_urv","21 November 2022","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It managed to deliver spectacle while interweaving organic sadness into the core of the film. With that said, it had a sombre (yet somewhat inconsistent) tone. From the first images of the film, you notice that care has gone into making this film a tribute to the late portrayer of the Black Panther, Chadwick Bozeman. They deliver homage in a way that makes the continuation of the Black Panther feel okay - something I wasn't expecting. Before actually watching the film, I had half heartedly believed they should have just retired the character out of respect. I'm glad they took a different approach. Instead, characters deliver amazing raw performances (no doubt drawing from the death of their friend and former costar).One of the greatest parts of this film is spectacle, to which it delivers copious amounts. Although that is commonplace for Marvel movies, the cinematography and effects were well done in this entry - more so than some of their other recent projects. The vistas, namely the futuristic city of Wakanda, look more beautiful than ever. Additionally, there is also a new dazzling location, but I will leave that unnamed to avoid spoilers. The movie is, for lack of a better term, eye candy.Like all Marvel movies, the action sequences are the main attraction. While they are not as abundant as other Marvel movies, they do pack a nice punch - pun intended. They serve as a good break to the relatively slow pace of the film, with the climax rewarding viewers with a great payoff.For the most part, it is a great film. It does struggle with is character motivations and character driven plot points. In my opinion, they are the most poorly constructed parts of the movie. Characters go back on their word, change their mind on the fly, and show little organic character growth. That's not to say they do not grow. On the contrary, the growth feels contrived; decisions made simply to drive the narrative's conflict. There were a few instances where I asked, ""Why doesn't the character just do this?"" Or, ""Why didn't they do that?"" And, each time, the answer was, ""Because then the movie would be over.""In conclusion, I believe this is a great film. Although my rating is officially a 9 in my review, I would say the film is more an 8.5. It is a solid entry... But, with more polishing around its characters, their actions and motivations, the film could have been much improved. Regardless, it has enough going for it that any viewer can find something to enjoy. Overall, it is a stunning movie filled with cutting edge effects, great set pieces, costumes, action sequences, and a perfectly curated, often times bombastic, soundtrack. If you enjoy blockbusters and Marvel movies in general, you won't leave disappointed.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

This film, the new Thor film, and the new Doctor Strange film all provided a somewhat entertaining 2+ hours but all basically failed to connect to the overall ""plan"" of the MCU, other than showcasing a new character or giving us a cameo from a B list Marvel celebrity.I think it is a bit arrogant that Marvel continues to lean on its superior special effects, forsaking plot and character development to create the film equivalent of one-and-done roller coaster rides. They market the hell out of these movies and get everyone excited for the new chapter of an established character's journey, only to establish new characters without connecting their stories back to the MCU. Obviously, they are going to continue doing this because of the money, but it would be nice to give the fans a semblance of a vision, rather than making us tune in for a new adventure from one of 30 newly-established characters.This movie was more emotional than most Marvel movies because of the passing of Chadwick Boseman, but overall I thought it was a bit long and a bit unconvincing (other than a great performance from Angela Basset). I think the bottom line is that if you want, you can skip this movie and not feel bad about being out of the loop for future Marvel projects.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

What was good about the film was the introduction to new cities/landscapes, the new and unique character designs (particularly from Namor's people), and the battle scenes were also quite unique, especially the final battle. Namor was a memorable villain, with a fairly believable backstory, although not quite as good as Killmonger from the previous film.The movie's biggest weakness was the pacing, and some aspects of the movie felt a little too long. The movie would have benefitted from being 10-15 minutes shorter, and particularly if they cut out scenes which were not essential to the plot.In a nutshell, Black Panther 2 is a decent movie with good world-building, but struggles with poor pacing from time to time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm speechless!!... Now, don't get me wrong, Chadwick Boseman is in a COMPLETELY different league, and would have made this film (possibly) the best MCU outing, but Letitia still did her thing, despite not having nearly enough experience to carry such a film as the lead.I was apprehensive to watch, when I'd learned that our hero had passed away, and knew that it'd be a completely different movie without him.I was extremely doubtful that it'd work as an ensemble movie, as opposed to a one-man led film. However, I felt that it worked out fine, due to the expert vision of Ryan.The film was super long, which was my only gripe with this movie; the cinema seats were VERY uncomfortable, and I suffer with excruciating back pain, which is amped right up, when seated too long in the wrong chairs.Although the film was long, it was full of action, damned-near from start to finish.Namor (Tanoch Huerta) did a FANTASTIC job as the villain. He was very Killmonger-esque in his motivation, but he just didn't let up, AT ALL!! He was the leader of his race, but he's also a soldier and master tactician. WOW!! This is a perfect movie, regardless of the excessive runtime.Chadwick Boseman was honoured greatly here, which, when you think about it, had Chadwick not passed away, the film would have been AT LEAST 60 minutes shorter; alot of this movie is a tribute to him, explaining and dealing with his death, whilst also being a vehicle to set up a new all-powerful ""villain"", his underwater city and world-build, which explains and justifies the lengthy runtime.If the length of the movie is all that's wrong with it, I'd say that this is a perfect movie.RIP Chadwick Boseman: you will be sorely missed, brother.","10 out of 45 found this helpful.

Dir. Ryan Coogler
Rating: 7/10When I found out that Ryan Coogler had finished the script of this installment before Chadwick Boseman died, I respected him even more. I can't comprehend the struggle of rewriting the story because the protagonist, sadly, passed away. When you watched 'Wakanda Forever,' you can see that Coogler pays a loving tribute not just to T'Challa but to Chadwick too. The amount of respect and honor they showed to Chadwick in this movie translates to the audience. The opening scene alone is probably the most heartbreaking scene in the MCU franchise, and I love how they did not try to mask the death of Chadwick, instead, they opened the film with characters struggling with the loss of T'Challa that they did not expect and fully understand, and we can relate to that as an audience because his death was a shock for us as well. They did the best thing they could to address something so unfortunate.'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' tried to venture into the ""slow-burn"" genre where they take a deep dive into the characters' stories and it felt overstuffed. There are a lot of stories to follow up, and the constant flashbacks are jarring and overdone. It felt like spoon-feeding too much. Namor's story is explored very well, but I really did not connect with it. There are a lot of flashbacks and I never really felt the pain that the writer wanted me to feel, considering that Namor is being set up as the antagonist, it did not feel vital compared to Killmonger's story. The thing is, it was somehow addressed in the last part of the film, but it did not have that much depth to it.For me, it was the excellent performances that carried this movie throughout. Angela Bassett gave us an Oscar-worthy performance, she was terrific and heartbreaking. Lupita Nyong'o, as always, is phenomenal. But, Letitia Wright as Shuri, is a revelation. It is hard to fill in the shoes of Chadwick Boseman, but she did not do it in a way that is disrespectful to the character, she has done it on her own and she shines in this film.'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' is far from perfect, but they have served their purpose and Coogler has finished this film with flying colors despite the sudden changes in the writing after the death of Chadwick. This is a thoughtful and mature exploration of collaborative grief and loss. Also, 'Wakanda Forever' has better CGI effects than the first film. 'Wakanda Forever' tightens the impossible by paying tribute and giving emotional importance to the loss of the great, Chadwick Boseman, while confidently giving an unexpected path to the future of the franchise. The film is 2 hours and 41 minutes long, and it felt overstuffed and overloaded with stories, but 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' is MCU's most emotional and mature film.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Trying to ride the previous movie which was not the best but had a story and was in the range of OK. This one however,seriously one of the worst movies I saw in past few years. Save yourself time and skip this one.","20 out of 37 found this helpful.

The casting just seemed off. I would've expected Namor to be more physically imposing. And why the heck did he have a bone through his nose? Maybe I'm nit picking, but that just seemed nonsensical and a poor film representation of the character. Did I miss something with later revisions of Submariner?I certainly agree with other reviewer's about the ""Iron Man"" reference. The movie picks up after all the character establishment, much of which seemed a bit unnecessary. Basically, another marvel movie that I was glad to watch from home, especially because of the length!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I appreciate how difficult it was to make a sequel without Chadwick Boseman and in that regard they did an excellent job. The various ways they gave homage throughout the movie were tasteful and heartfelt. Action sequences and CGI are Marvel-level polish we are used to, although the ultra slick transformer style suits make me yearn for early Iron Man movies ""raw"" look and feel. I don't know how I feel about replacing Atlantis with Talokan as I welcome diversity on the one hand but on the other I'm a bit sad as a long time Marvel comics purist. My biggest issue though is with the uneven acting, with fantastic Angela Basset, sub par Letitia Wright, and everything in between. I'll still watch all Marvel movies but they're definitely on a declining trend in quality at this point.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I thought the effects were a whole lot better than the first one, and I did enjoy the fight scenes a little bit more. Lastly the negatives of the film for me would be that, I didn't get invested into the villain as I did with Michael B. Jordan, and I felt the soundtrack wasn't as great as the first film.

Ryan Coogler made this movie with care, empathy and patience. I liked the character developments in the movie. Nowadays, I don't expect that much depth in an MCU movie but Black Panther: Wakanda Forever did not disappoint me.The CGI/VFX was bland in some places. Overall, it was very good.

The idea of the Avatar style water world was executed quite well on screen, while the movie paid a good amount of respect to the original.But a few flaws did stand out.Firstly, the emphasis on the ""American scientist"" kid was really heavy, like the queen would shield her with her own body? That the princess would not leave without her, risking herself, the hier? Yes I understand this is the nature of Wakanda but this just was a tad excessive given that this girl had nothing to do with Wakanda, except for the fact that she's a political asset since she can make Vibranium detecting machines.Secondly, the runtime was a little excessive. Nearly three hours, when so many scenes could have been cut? Pretty slow pacing throughout.Thirdly, the final fight scene was a little disappointing. Complete lack of air and underwater combat. Any fighting that could be physically intense occurred on a rectangular surface, on top of the ship, not to mention that the only purpose of the ship was to serve as a rectangle of land. There wasn't even a single shot of the inside of the ship, or it cracking or leaking. It was a literal, unrealistic brick.Fourthly, there were some pretty bad scene cuts, and the movie was pretty inconsistent at times. From an incredibly emotional scene to a 10 minute drag of a conversation to a pretty unintense fight scene.Again, it was a pretty good movie overall. Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I watch it again? Probably not.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The film excels exploring these themes, but falters a bit with the Ironheart and CIA stuff. Much of this could have been cut to trim down on the massive runtime. Namor's story is another triumph as well. He's a sympathetic villain that will hopefully have big things to do in the future. I am a bit underwhelmed with the person chosen as the new BP, but it makes sense within the story they're telling.Regardless of any story faults, there is an element of artfulness and maturity that Coogler brings which most MCU films lack. The visuals are unmatched in the MCU and the underwater city in particular is a marvel to behold. Ludwig has crafted another Oscar worthy score and the music is great as well. There are several surprises sprinkled throughout. The action is fine, if not terribly impressive. It seems like they just made a less arresting version of the car chase from the first film.Wakanda Forever is largely successful in what it sets out to do, that being grieving over Boseman's death and setting up the future of the franchise.","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

I don't think so.Calling this movie Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is like renaming The Force Awakens to Luke Skywalker returns. Black Panther, such as they are, isn't in this movie enough to put the Black Panther name on it. We know why they named it that, but it still doesn't work.This movie was ponderous. I mean really, really slow. A 2:41 minute runtime. Exposition dump after exposition dump. Improbable occurrence after improbable occurrence. Absolutely dumb (and I do mean dumb) dialogue. I won't even mention the fact that it's a Marvel Super Hero movie and not a single person hit the gym to prepare for their role. Normal people are throwing (not just a foot or two) people 30 feet. Remember, the Black Panther is the only Wakandan with powers, not the Doro Milaji (sp).What really sealed the deal and when I think about it should have given this movie lower than 4 stars was the absolute ripoff of the ICONIC scene in Iron Man when Tony takes the Mark II for its first flight.

This is not about replacing him. About maintaining a stride despite his tragic death. It is about honoring the legacy of him, and his performance as T'Challa. We find the fictional people who were closest to him torn apart by mourning. Each grieving in their own way. It is handled in a mature, intelligent way.As has been the case recently, the MCU continues to use sequels to not only follow up on the story and characters set up earlier in the series and overall franchise, but also introduce new ones. Your mileage may vary, but I was personally extremely impressed by how well it integrated all of them. This shows respect for, and shines a spotlight on, Mayan culture and history, the way that the original did for the African continent. I am very happy that they changed the location from the fictional Atlantis. Like Wakanda, Talocan genuinely feels like a place where people live and work. It's not just a cool setting that feels like a stage. Namor(Huerta, by turns charismatic and intense) is as fascinating and complex as in the comics, and there's no end to the narratives that they can explore now that he is part of this universe.This features sci-fi violence and a little moderate to strong language. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10.","12 out of 57 found this helpful.

Didn't think he could do it but wow, I am completely wowed. I believe what made Wakanda Forever great is because the story it presented. We are served with amazing character growth, meaty plot, great pacing, beautiful score, briliant action sequences and wonderful introduction of the underwater people. My eyes were entirely glued to the screen, I am thoroughly engaged with the whole experience that is Wakanda Forever. Our beloved Chadwick Boseman would be very proud and pleased with how the story continued to go forward and honoring his legacy. What will always make a movie work, no matter what the genre, is the story. A great solid story from beginning to end will always work. He outdid himself, my standing ovation to you Mr. Coogler!

Despite a strong cast and some impressive action sequences, the film feels disjointed and fails to live up to the potential of its source material.The plot picks up shortly after the death of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), with Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett), Shuri (Letitia Wright), M'Baku (Winston Duke), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and the Dora Milaje fighting to protect Wakanda from intervening world powers. As the Wakandans strive to embrace their next chapter, the heroes must band together with the help of War Dog Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) and Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) to forge a new path for the kingdom.While there are some well-choreographed action sequences, lots of diversity in the cast, and the different worlds are spectacular, they are not enough to make up for the film's other shortcomings. The plot is disjointed and predictable, and the film fails to explore the rich world of Wakanda instead opting for fast-paced action that feels empty.The movie includes a couple of respectful references to Chadwick Boseman who died after the filming of the previous movie. None of them feels gratuitous or out of place.BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER is a missed opportunity that fails to live up to the potential of its source material.WAKANDA FOREVER is moderately entertaining but disappoints. Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe may want to check it out, but everyone else can skip it.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

A lot of the soundtrack used in scenes were ridiculous.The action sequences were VERY minimal, boring and mediocre. Zuri automatically knowing how to fight was really stupid... When did she suddenly have training? Nakia was in the movie like for a total of seven minutes. Mbaku for like five. It didn't feel like an adventure. I wasn't thrilled. Iron hearts role was useless. Even Namors henchmen had no personality...The only thing I liked about the movie was the first 20 minutes.

It had action, emotion, and strong character growth. However, my only complaint is it's a little bit too long. With a run time of 2 hours and 41 minutes it is probably better to wait until it hits Disney plus sometime in January or February. I saw this opening night and I enjoyed it. However, I also had the feeling ""when is this thing going to be over?"" There were many unnecessary scenes and with the extended runtime I expected tMarvel to do more with certain characters. In the first Black Panther, Agent Ross (Martin Freeman) had a purpose in the film. In the new one, he is simply there to give information and is given a few unnecessary scenes.As for the villian, Namor is a pretty standard villain. As usual, the plot gives time for an origin story and at least some development. However, when you are watching the movie for the first 2 hours you are just wondering when black panther is going to show up. The writers decide to wait about the whole movie to put someone into the suit. (I'm trying to make this spoiler free so I won't say who).This movie is not top 10 Marvel. It struggles with plot consistency and a blander villain than the first. Marvel did keep their promise about this film having heart and good action. They honored Chadwick Boseman and did their job. This movie tugs at your heartstrings. It is the best fully Marvel produced movie since endgame. (I'm saying fully produced because NWH was Sony produced as well)","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

"There was somebody cutting onions that's why I was crying","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8671904/?ref_=tt_urv","Benslie","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur69664646/?ref_=tt_urv","13 November 2022","With the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, the story for this movie needed to find a way to pass on the torch and honour him and this story does all of that to a certain extent. The story for this movie is unlike any other Marvel movie we've seen so far. There's so much raw emotion in this movie that will make everybody say either I'm not crying, you're crying or someone's cutting onions in here. But for the most part that's only the first part of this movie. The story of this movie is split into three different parts and they try to connect them seamlessly but it doesn't always work. The only parts of this movie's story that connect seamlessly are the second and third parts. I will give the movie this they tried to connect the first part into the third part and it did work. But honestly, nothing could save the second part of this movie's story from not being the slowest part of this movie. This movie is 2 hours and 41 minutes long and honestly, it didn't need to be that long. There's a lot of filler in this movie that easily could've been removed and nothing would've been missed. But at the end of the day, this movie just didn't feel like an MCU movie. There weren't that many jokes being shoved down your throat constantly or some slapstick just because. This movie just felt like a movie honouring a man who was lost way too early. This all can be traced back to one man who's Ryan Coogler, the writer and director. Ryan Coogler understood that once Chadwick Boseman had passed this movie had to honour him and his impact and did that flawlessly. Those who saw this movie either having not seen a previous Marvel movie with Black Panther in it could still understand the impact Chadwick Boseman had on those around him. (Continued in Comments)He wrote this movie so beautifully and I would love to read what the original script was. It wasn't just his writing that made this movie but also his directing of it. He brings the same passion he had for the first movie to this one as well. He knew exactly how to get some kind of emotional reaction out of the audience or how to just keep their attention throughout this movie. It's due to Ryan Coogler's wonderful story and directing that all of the acting performances in this movie feel so raw. You could easily tell that every actor in this movie wanted to make this movie as great of a movie as can be to honour Chadwick Boseman. Due to this, it's hard to tell if this is the character's grief or the actors but no matter what it brings the audience to tears as well. There are so many amazing performances in this movie that it's hard to pick a favourite but I have to say that Letitia Wright really stood out. This movie mainly follows her and her journey of accepting that her brother is dead. She brought so much to this character that you really feel for her character and what she's going through. She goes on this emotional rollercoaster that anyone who has lost a close loved one can relate to her. But Shuri wasn't the only one to go through an emotional rollercoaster but Queen Ramonda, played by Angela Bassett, also goes on one and it's amazing. Obviously, the biggest difference between Shuri and Queen Ramonda is the fact she lost her son and Angela Bassett shows that so well. She has so many emotional moments and all of them hit so hard that it leaves the audience on the verge of tears. Whenever she was on the screen she held the audience's attention with every single word she said. She shows how much Queen Ramonda cares for her family and how this loss has affected her in more ways than one. This movie also introduced the audience to two new characters in the MCU and I can't wait to see more of them. The first one we got to meet is Riri, played by Dominique Thorne, and I can't wait for her solo show. Dominique Thorne played her in such a way that she knows she's smart but doesn't brag about it. (Continued below)She's this sympathetic character who just wants to do the right thing. I also love how down-to-earth she plays Riri. She reminds us that despite being a child prodigy she is just a kid who gets excited over things no matter how small. We don't get to see much of her in this movie so I can't wait to see how she'll expand the character in her own show. The other character we meet is Namor and I really hope we get to see more of him. Namor is easily one of the best MCU villains and that's all thanks to Tenoch Huerta's performance. He plays Namor in such a way you don't know whether he's a villain or not. He's this sympathetic guy that you can kind of understand where he's coming from. Unfortunately, we don't get to fully experience why exactly he's doing this but no matter what, Tenoch Huerta does a memorable job and I can't wait to see him in more MCU movies to come. A trademark of Marvel recently has been the bad CGI and for me personally, the CGI here wasn't bad at all. The CGI looked pretty good and helped the audience really feel like they were there in this underwater civilization. This also could be due to the darkness but I want to give them some credit okay. The last thing I'll mention is the music in this movie, composed by Ludwig Göransson. The music in this movie was incredible and really helped the scenes they were accompanying. Whether the scene was a sad one or one of tension the music matched perfectly to it. It wasn't just the musical score either but the regular music as well that helped this movie out. Through the actor's performances and the background music, the audience could easily figure out what exactly is going on and how to feel. In the end, Black Panther Wakanda Forever might not be the most perfect movie but you can feel how much emotion was put into making it. Definitely a good send-off to both phase 4 of the MCU and Chadwick Boseman.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

I guess they didn't have a choice but she could've took some acting lessons. Just talking quietly doesn't make a mourning sister. But acting everywhere was bad. Worse than Star Wars prequels. Yes, that bad.All attempts at humor failed miserably. All emotional scenes were outright boring. Action scenes were ridiculous.

"Wakanda Forever takes characters on personal Journeys of Perseverance.... with depth & Poignancy.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8684233/?ref_=tt_urv","Ed-from-HI","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur49279086/?ref_=tt_urv","19 November 2022","Before seeing Wakanda Forever, it seemed like an impossible task to match the success of the first Black Panther film from 2018....... how could anyone adequately fill Chadwick Boseman's shoes or ever revitalize and re-energize the Black Panther legend? Some viewers probably went into theaters this time with some skepticism but Ryan Coogler (director and co-writer) generated a small miracle going in different, unexpected directions. The acting Team including Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o all brought genuinely heartfelt performances containing extra dimensions of poignancy that took the audience to emotionally resonant realms rarely seen in Marvel films (or any big-budget action movies for that matter). I was really surprised by the intensity of authentic emotions throughout... each character was forced to overcome nearly insurmountable grief and adversity in order to step-up and transform thru shear perseverance to fulfil a unique personal journey.And the addition of 'Namor' Tenoch Huerta as primary adversary seemed like a genuine stroke of genius! Namor (aka Sub-Mariner) of the original comics (one of Marvel's very first created characters in 1939) was always rebellious, short-tempered, arrogant.... but also a masterful tactician creating 'expedient' tenuous alliances sometimes with heroes (like the Fantastic Four) but also villains like Doctor Doom, always believing that Land-dwellers could never be trusted and would eventually bring calamity & destruction to his underwater Utopia. The original Marvel comics featuring Sub-Mariner were always interesting but 'Wakanda Forever' again seemed to bring added dimensions to Namor with even more complex motivations and a point-of -view that audiences could at least partially sympathize with (Namor's origin scene harkening back to 1500's when conquistadors bring disease & destruction, ravaging a peaceful Mayan village, was brief but indelibly chilling). The Best and most interesting adversaries in films & stories are never pure mindless 'villains' but those who have a complex moral code that traverses the spectrum of good & evil and are unpredictable in dispensing mercy and retribution.Overall, I really liked Wakanda Forever but it was not what I was expecting.... the vibe is much different than the original Black Panther (and other heroic endeavors) with scenes that run the gamut of meditative, intense, heartfelt, conflicted, reflective & revealing but always with an undercurrent of poignancy.... ensuring that Wakanda's Legend is certainly secure and deserves to live on thru the far-future.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

There's not much to the story, either. Lupita does a great job, not sure why she didn't get nominated an Oscar over Bassett. Personally I think it's suspect that the Black Panther films are the only superhero films getting major nominations, but we all know why that is. Either way, Bassett's performance was weak, she basically floated through the film on autopilot. The Black Panther films are the weakest of the Marvel world, though I haven't seen the Eternals, heard that was unwatchable.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

Yet somehow Coogler has delivered the most satisfying project of Phase 4.Like its matching Phase 4 bookend, Wandavision, this is a nuanced study of grief. It's an MCU film, so of course it's also filled with humour and action. This could easily have veered into cheesy territory, but they managed to avoid that and deliver a great film. I actually enjoyed this more than the first one; the 2 hrs 41 min runtime just flew by.I do have a minor complaint about the 3D: whereas it was used to great effect in Avatar, Star Wars Ep7, and most recently Shang Chi (all were 10/10 3D), 3D doesn't work well at all in the dark, and even the well lit scenes were a random grab bag of ineffectual and just ok. Scenes where the 3d worked were generally trivial as well. Overall theatrical 3D for this film is sadly 3.0/10. For once I'm advocating watching in 2D.But the film itself is
9.5/10, A almost A+This actually makes the juvenile humour of Love & Thunder make sense: Marvel wouldn't want 2 emotionally charged films back to back, BPWF would've lost its impact. As JJ Abrams once said: sometimes you have to swing the pendulum one way in order to swing back hard the other way.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

"Extremely emotional and powerful film about grief; best Marvel movie since Endgame","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8671319/?ref_=tt_urv","parksiet","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur73501762/?ref_=tt_urv","13 November 2022","""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a beautiful and poignant film about grief made by grieving people. I adored this film, not just for how well it honours and continues the legacy of the great Chadwick Boseman, but also how it truly felt like a natural progression from the first film. Ryan Coogler really had his work cut out for him with this film, and frankly was put in quite the impossible situation with the passing of Boseman. I am blown away at how skillfully he overcame these challenges and pivoted the story to a place that is obviously different from what we would all expect coming out of the first ""Black Panther"", and yet feels like a very natural and logical next step at the same time. Not only that, but this also feels like a return to form for the MCU after so long; this is the type of Marvel movie I fell in love with. Don't get me wrong, I have still liked (and in some cases, loved) most of Phase 4, but this film is easily the best Marvel has been since ""Endgame"". While my personal favourite of phase 4 still remains ""No Way Home"", this is a very close second to that. Films like ""Endgame"" and ""No Way Home"" were absolute triumphs, but Wakanda Forever is MCU's most beautiful, meaningful and soulful movie. It is on the level of the first ""Black Panther"" for me, and while it may not be as culturally significant, it only enhances my enjoyment and appreciation of that first film.This movie is an extremely moving and impactful experience. As I said, it is a film about grief and coming to terms with loss, even partially dealing with themes of faith. The movie is really about Shuri's emotional journey of coming to terms with the loss of T'Challa and I found that the focus on grief through the eyes of Shuri was portrayed beautifully. The denial, the anger, and finally the acceptance, was a powerful emotional journey that was needed not only by the characters of the film, but also the audience as well. It is a very emotional watch right from the opening scene. As soon as the film began it caught me off guard with the wave of emotions it made me feel, I definitely cried multiple times throughout this movie. And so did the rest of the audience. People always talk about the memorable theatre moments in these Marvel movies where people clap and cheer. But there were two bookends of absolute, respectful, beautiful silence during this movie that will always define my memory of seeing this for the first time. This silence was unlike anything I have ever witnessed in a theatre, and it really speaks to the powerful way that the film dealt with the loss of Chadwick and T'Challa. The tribute it pays to Chadwick is wonderful and made me feel a lot, but luckily that isn't where the emotions stop. The whole film is emotionally rich, with some tragic undertones throughout the film, so prepare yourself! I love films like this that tell a good story and really make you feel the emotion of it all, it speaks to how well the film works and connects with its audience.""Wakanda Forever"" is easily the best directed and most emotionally rich film in the MCU, possibly even the most cinematic film in the MCU. In terms of directorial voice and style, this is easily the most tactile, soulful, and well-crafted MCU movie since ""Black Panther"". From the costumes to the score, everything is stunningly well crafted, and it handles its themes and tribute to Chadwick flawlessly. One of the things I appreciated most about it was that despite the movies (and tragedies) in between, it does feel like a direct continuation of Coogler's first ""Black Panther"" movie and the characters, themes, and aesthetics he developed in it. It still feels insular. Despite all the real life complications and a plot filled with new characters and world building, it still feels cohesive. The movie feels like it was written and directed by a storyteller not a committee. There are a few issues with the script, it can be clunky at times and there are points that you can tell it was hastily re-written, albeit re-written with love. This isn't Coogler's fault, the tragedy of Chadwick's passing really complicated this movie's production, and Coogler being able to pull off the pivot he did is nothing short of a miracle. So really, a few script issues aside, this film is masterful.Story-wise I loved so many of the choices Coogler made, from the way he weaved in history and politics in relation to Wakanda and its resources on a global stage, to the handling of the Black Panther, to the introduction of Namor and Talokan. I loved the way he mirrored T'Challa's arc in ""Civil War"" for Shuri here, it felt very poetic. She has one of the best emotional character arcs in the MCU in this film! The continuation of Shuri's journey felt very natural, I loved what he did with Queen Ramonda, the return of Nakia is very gratifying, and even the return of Martin Freeman's Everett Ross gave this a strong continuity with the first film and within the MCU. The newer elements, like Riri Williams and Namor, both of which I loved, are also added in a way that feels very organic. I was afraid that much of the movie would feel like Phase 5 pandering and inserted green screen reshoots with cameos, but thank god, the whole thing feels like a singular vision. This is a Ryan Coogler movie through and through! Namor especially stole the show for me, the depiction of Namor is so excellent it hurts. The movie treats him like a mythic icon and a terrifying foe, making me really wish ""Love and Thunder"" did more of this with Gorr. I loved how Coogler established Talokan and Namor's backstory, it was richly written and even sublimely tackled the effects of colonialism we still see in the world today. The movie truly nailed Namor's introduction, his arc is clear, his motivations are clear and most importantly understandable and he has instantly become one of the best MCU villains to date.I think it's probably completely natural for ""Wakanda Forever"" to hit people differently. The movie deserves a lot of credit for executing a great cinematic experience, and what is most important is that it is sure of itself, and feels so carefully crafted to accomplish what it wants to. As much as I want to see Coogler working outside the MCU, I really hope he makes one more ""Black Panther"" movie to round out the trilogy. These two films flow like a singular vision made with passion and care. I'd love to see a conclusive third film from Coogler and his team!The technical side of this film is complete perfection, and when it comes back to it this movie is likely one of the best from a technical filmmaking standpoint in the MCU, much like the first one also was. First off, what really struck me was the incredible costume design from Ruth Carter. She did a wonderful job with the Afro-futuristic styles in the first film to establish the world of Wakanda, and brings them back in fresh but familiar ways here! For ""Wakanda Forever"" she wonderfully borrowed styles from Meso-American cultures to help create the world of Talokan. The production design by Hannah Beachler was also really well done in fleshing out these worlds, I really have to say some of the strongest features about the two ""Black Panther"" films are this artistry on display in terms of costumes, sets, hair, makeup, and everything else that really makes the world of Wakanda feel so much more tangible. The movie looks and sounds great. There's a grandeur to the imagery matched with intimacy behind the camera that makes it feel so real and raw. Coogler upped his game significantly in the visuals and it's amazing what happens when they give VFX a proper timetable, because for the most part the CGI looks great! And I loved the look of the action scenes, especially Namor's attack on Wakanda as well as the 3rd act climax, which I thought really felt like it tread some new ground for Marvel! It has big CGI action, but also some great story beats and character moments to it!What was my favourite aspect of the movie though? Of course it has to be Ludwig Goransson's score! He brought back old themes, created new ones, and once again proves he is one of the most interesting composers today! I loved the musical continuity between this and the first film, it is likely the best example of it in the MCU, and I would even say these two films have the best musical scores in the MCU save for maybe the ""Avengers"" films. The sound mix was incredible and I loved the creative ways Ludwig was able to use his music in the film; it really took my breath away! Also while on the topic of sound, I thought the way they handled subtitles was quite clever! The film has lots of languages and the fact that they use different fonts and colours to distinguish them (and some moments use the difference between languages as a dramatic beat) is something that I just find really neat and cool!Continuing my praise of this film, the acting on display is pitch perfect, and really elevates everything off of the pages of the script! Tenoch Huerta was flawless as Namor, he embodied the character perfectly and especially since this is one of his first major Hollywood films, proves he has the capability to be a great talent in the industry going forward. Letitia Wright was asked to do a lot more in this film over her role in the first, taking on the leading role, and she actually gave a brilliant performance. I was so impressed with the emotions on display, as well as her ability to get the audience to back her character! She really proved she can be a leading actress, especially impressive after being thrown into it so quickly! Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke were both fantastic also, but I just wish they had more to do, and Dominique Thorne was instantly likable as Riri Williams! The true standout of the movie for me, however, was of course Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda. She commanded the screen in all of her scenes, showcasing waves of emotion in her powerful performance.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

The first thing to say is that Tchalla's tribute was so perfect, and the entire audience went silent. As a sequel, this is an awesome story, the way its characters have been balanced is so cool. The character building of Shuri felt Wow like the way Peter Parker's character in Spider-man No Way Home. It was completely brought up to Chadwick's level. I absolutely love the way the character's build-up was shown in those few hours. Ironheart doesn't have a big character build-up, maybe they put it in the upcoming Ironheart series because I saw footage of Riri Williams in the first Ironhard costume. After that, if you take Namor's character, he is the best villain in this phase 4. Namor's back story has changed when looking at the comic, But they have worked hard to show Namor in the same way in the comic. It can be said that one of the best villains built up in the MCU, more epic than Gorr the God Butcher seen in Thor: Love and Thunder. Almost everyone had good screen time and Ryan Coogler balaced everything. Feminism, LGBTQ, and jokes were balanced throughout the film. More emotional than action. Also, there was a good plot for the story, again the MCU seems to be on the right track. Namor is a badass guy. The people who play Namor and Shuri are obsessed with those characters. The next thing to remember is Music. It's crazy. BGM is so dope in many places. The best music and visuals are seen in phase 4. The visuals of Talokan are so great. Although there were minor glitches in the CG VFX, there were no major glitches in the overall film. Also, to make the plot stronger, they could have increased the running time of the story with vibranium. Based on vibranium and contains something like a good fight. But in comparison, this is a better film than the films that have come so far.Ryan Cougar is one of the best to direct Avengers Secret War. Unless the Russo brothers direct another Avengers film, Ryan is Marvel's best trump card.The only thing left to say after everything
Rest in Peace Chadwick Boseman. We really miss you.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Now, I'm not exactly the type to go see a movie based on its ""film-quality,"" I'm more of a ""was it entertaining?"" kind of gal. For me, this movie was very entertaining.It addresses loss and grief in such a real way that it was easy to empathize with T'Challa's family. It was also a touching tribute to Chadwick Boseman.The storyline seemed a little fractured, but I think people have to remember that when the first phase of the MCU started coming out there were a lot of things that didn't make sense either. They only make sense now that you've seen all of the movies and have gone back to watch them again.Don't get me wrong, this isn't the best film in the MCU or even in phase four, but it's still a good movie. Marvel set the bar very high for its fans with Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, so I think it will just take time for viewers to readjust expectations and for the creators to adjust their views as well. They need time to take a step back and stop trying to outdo the final two Avengers films and get back to just making good, cohesive movies.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Way, way, WAYYYY too long. I believe it clocks in at almost 2 hours and 50 minutes, which is over an hour too long. Whoever was editing this for release needs to be fired and then find work in some other field. Just because something was filmed doesn't necessarily mean it belongs on the screen.Secondly, it's very boring. BORING! The movie is basically just a CGI-fest where not much interesting or entertaining story really seems to happen from one minute to the next. Yeah, there's story, but not really that much of it and it just doesn't elicit any more contemplation on my part that a commercial for cat litter would. And it's so very predictable.Have I mentioned yet that I can barely even remember the plot of the movie because it was just such a tedious chore to get through? I watched this absolute snoozer followed by ""You People"" and really don't remember much from that entire evening as my brain was rejecting the low-quality fare and seems to have been on strike from forcing 2 really bad movies in a row on it.I'd rather have my almost 3 wasted hours back than retain any memories of this pointless movie. I feel 2 stars is generous.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Apart from Shuri being the most annoying character in the entire MCU, her self absorbed wallowing in self pity doesn't make for an interesting plot, hopefully she will meet a grisly end soon leaving the way open for her nephew to step up eventually. The only redeeming factor was this new weird Namor character, who is so unrecognizable from the true Sub-Mariner character as to leave Namor McKenzie untarnished. This film would never have been allowed if Stan Lee were still around, the bastardization of the first Marvel super hero must have him spinning in his grave. Shame on all involved for being scared that you couldn't improve on DC's Aquaman, especially when the character material had so much depth to draw on. This film fails on every level, with some of the dodgiest CGI since James Bond went parachute surfing in ""Die another day"" I think this film has pretty much killed off everything that was interesting about Wakanda, good job.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Queen, M'Baku, Shuri, Nakia, Ross, dora milaje, and each character is so powerful to the story. Not some background characters. This is not seen in other MCU films. The first half of this film was so powerful, it really means what Chadwick means to all of the cast and crew. Loved that. Good story but was disappointed with Namor and the ending fight in ocean. Marvel visual studios need to do better. You are earning a ton load of money, invest them on people who do the work. Visuals could have been far better. The acting and also the emotional connection with that... so strong. You wouldn't believe. She shows why she is the queen mother. Angella Bassett nails this performance as an actor, mother and queen. Loved the emotions portrayed in this film. Maybe the ending should have been kept open without the last fight and continue this in next part. This should have been a superhero film about grief, with no actions fights. They serve no purpose to what they were trying to achieve. But nonetheless a wonderful goodbye to Chadwick.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

Really liked Shuri's journey. Really liked how we see more of Wakanda as a city. The moments of humor in the movie were not forced, but well integrated with the script.Whenever the action takes place, it is choreographed well.

Very much a cash in of the Marvel name and the fact that its Wakanda so will appeal.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

"Has nothing about it to justify an almost 3 hour run time","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8867039/?ref_=tt_urv","jtindahouse","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3793011/?ref_=tt_urv","12 February 2023","What defines a superhero movie? When you try to recall a particular Batman movie, do you try and think back on what Batman's arc was in that film? Of course not, you think back to who the villain was. The biggest problem I had in 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' (and in a lot of MCU movies) is that the villains are so forgettable. They never have interesting traits or much to make them unique. They're just the same villain copy and pasted time and time again.I struggled with this film. It's unnecessarily long at 2 hours 41 minutes. To justify a run time like that you have to have incredible pacing and some truly great action sequences. This film had neither of those. There's a lot of talking, none of it interesting, and I can't remember a single action scene from the movie that was notable.There's not much good here at all. The film doesn't have a superhero (or at least it doesn't feel like it does), the story isn't interesting and the villain is style over substance and straight from the cookie cutter. This was not an enjoyable watch. A generous 3/10.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

The movie is by far the best Phase 4 Movie visually , it had great set design and visual effects it was beautifully done .The movie is so emotional prepare yourself you are going to cry . The story is good well done .

They were great. The script had long drawn-out conversation that didn't add to the story line. Story timing was off in a few places where one thing was built in two months but another more highly developed thing was built in three days. No developing scenes for some new characters that seemed thrown into the story. Some of the green screen shots reminded me of the superhero movies from the 80's. At one point I felt that I was watching a foreign film because of all the sub-titles, which didn't allow me to actually watch the film. My girl and I have agreed to stop watching Marvel movies in the theaters until they pull themselves out of their nosedive by finding better writers and directors.","14 out of 26 found this helpful.

Also the CGI was amazing, there was this bit where a car and a motorbike were flying in the air and it actually looked so cool. Also the guy from the Vodaphone advertisements was one of the best characters and he looked like a proper secret agent who is really cool. The Shuri person was also dead cool as the character was doing cool fight scenes and stunts. Also the acting was mad cool, it actually looked like the actors where real and they were actually fighting the avatar people.In conclusion I think this film is 10/10 and Steven Spielberg would be impressed.","5 out of 20 found this helpful.

They also talk about the fact that Wakanda is the most technologically advanced country, but that is not clear because of the use of spears and daggers. Also, all the talk about the military strength of Wakanda is just talk. All we see is a group of ships. The idea that a county can develop technology just because they have natural resources is absurd; the most important thing is human resources (the natural resource curse theory). There are also plot holes in the story. Also, the underwater scenes are very bad; they could have done a better job. But the most important thing is the absence of the charisma that Chadwick Boseman had on screen. Chadwick was the best thing about the Black Panther, and his absence will never be overcome; the man was something else, and he will be forever missed.","14 out of 26 found this helpful.

I loved the raw emotions it inspired as I watched it. The cast from the first film were back to lead us into the world without King T'Challa, it was a beautiful tribute to the late AMAZING Chadwick Boseman.The leaders of this incredible movie were the ladies, with amazing performances from, Letitia, Lupita, Danai, Angela and Domanique truly inspiring. With amazing cameos from Mikaela and Florence.Winston Duke, Tenoch Huerta, Martin Freeman, were great support and the film for me went at a good pace, to explain and show the world in a new way with the introduction of a great new 'people'. I believe Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a triumph, and the best Marvel film of this phase 4, which has been a little too flippant and lost its way. But then it has amazingly large shoes to fill. Wish they hadn't 'retired' certain characters because the backbone of the entire Marvel Universe was ripped out following the Phase 3 conclusion. I genuinely hope they look back on those movies and remember what got them here. Whoever writes the new assemble movies, please don't let it be
Taika Waititi. Sorry but the two Thor films since the original, and sequel have been wanting in my view.","5 out of 20 found this helpful.

"A Fantastic, Emotional, Spectaculae Mature Marvel Film and The Amazing Marvel Legacy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8677479/?ref_=tt_urv","razvanciobo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur85186054/?ref_=tt_urv","16 November 2022","Picking up six years after the events of Black Panther (in accordance to the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame), this film focuses heavily on the loss of T'Challa and how the country can move forward without their leader. With the emergence of Namor and the underwater city of Talokan threatening all of Wakanda, the remaining characters must band together and protect their country. Shuri (Letitia Wright) is easily the one with the most screentime here and the burden of carrying this franchise is on her shoulders the whole time. This must have been a daunting task, but she pulled it off. Her character, along with her mother, portrayed incredibly well once again by Angela Basset, are the beating hearts of this film. The emotional aspect of this film got me on a few occasions.One year after the untimely death of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the African kingdom of Wakanda is still in mourning as they struggle without their beloved monarch to lead them. T'Challa's younger sister, Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), feels the immense pressure to take over as ruler but believes she cannot handle such a huge responsibility all by herself. Not long after, the inhabitants of the underwater civilisation of Talokan, led by King Namor (Tenoch Huerta), emerge to wage a war against the surface world. With limited time remaining, the citizens of Wakanda must quickly overcome their grief to put a stop to the Talokan threat before everything is destroyed.Given the unexpected turn of events surrounding the death of its main star, this film works surprisingly well with its remaining cast members and a more interesting look at Wakanda's place in the MCU. This is a movie to see on the big screen, without a doubt this is the best film the MCU has delivered in the Phase 4. The fact that they incorporated his passing into the story beautifully was so important & crucial. Ryan Coogler is probably the best director working for Marvel right now and I'm very excited to see what he does next after this big win.Wakanda Forever"" is MCU's 30-th movie and is phenomenal! The most powerful project of Phase 4.Immensely powerful story of forging forward-shattering at times, but also beautifully cathartic and heartening, still cannot get over how well the film earns that title.If Chadwick could see this movie, he'll be proud as much as I am right now!Namor is a great villain and Shuris arc in the course of this movie was amazing and some of marvels best character arc. Seeing wakanda vs Tolkan l was thrilling and both sides had really good points and arguments. The performances across the board were perfect and riri made a great addition to the movie. I do have some issues with the movie however the action at points can be a bit generic and in the third act there's a montage used to try and get the characters ready for the final battle and feels a bit lazy. But aside from that this has to be one of the better marvel movies and worthy successor to the original black panther.","6 out of 26 found this helpful.

Good MCU film, I was skeptical about it but was good, Coogler is one of the best directors for the MCU his staging and camera work is creative enough to have a wide appeal but not too out of the box to scare the masses, also the MASSIVE work to re work the entire film due Chadwick's passing is herculean.Costume design was great, there's also good score specially one ""mermaid - esque"" song and Angela Basset, steals the scenes. Is NOT a perfect film but definetly MUCH better than phase 4 average MCU entries. Love how gray Shuri is in the film, she is more of an antihero. Also they fixed Riri Williams who I didn't like in the comics, I'm curious to watch her show now to expand on her story. The changes of Namor (which I didn't like from the trailers) feel really organic and makes sense. The downsides, they kinda mistreated Okoye and the Dora Millage, the CGI was not polished in certain shots (but incredible in some others) and the 3rd act feels a bit rushed.They managed Chadwick's passing respectfully and paid good homage.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

This movie perfectly memorializes Chadwick Boseman and allows his memory to live on. It is a true testament to his character and his hard work and perseverance, and you can really see how much he affected the set, tone, and cast of this movie. It really is the silence that hits the emotions the most and just seeing his presence on the screen knowing that he isn't here physically anymore. This movie truly did him justice and I commend each and every person who worked on this movie as this is one of the few movies I have actually clapped for at the end. Speaking of the end, there is a nice little surprise for everyone! I hope that certain people understand the meaning of this movie and we'll see it as the true masterpiece it is, as it covers so many different bases and emotions. It is quite possibly the only superhero movie that truly humanizes the characters and shows The human experience of morning, grief, moving on, and overcoming suffering and a need for vengeance. It is awesome to see namor finally make his big screen appearance as well, the first mutant is finally here and I can't wait to see what his future is like in the MCU.I will say that people who are used to super showy superhero films where everybody has powers and such will be a little disappointed if you cannot sit through a movie that has great emotional depth and storytelling. This movie should be at the next Oscars.Chadwick Boseman is still greatly missed over 3 years since his untimely passing. I truly hope he is getting the rest he deserves and that we see him again someday. Thank you Ryan coogler and company for your tremendous work on this beautiful film.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

There are several majestic things here and there (settings, costumes and overall photography radiate poetry and sheer beauty), but the movie really and definitely takes off for good when it reaches its half, then it becomes extremely catchy pretty much all the time and intense in-depth... Undoubtedly mesmerizing ; emotionally, visually-wise and action-wise of course.Gorgeous/Stunning visuals all along (even breathtaking at times), the music, the adventure as a whole, and the new characters introduced are all true strengths of the movie (alongside with the mind-blowing costume design which might very much be a no-brainer upcoming Oscar winner)...Most definitely a slow burn (for story/lore and characters development's sake) with elongated storylines/scenes in the first half (aside from a couple of scenes), but in fact it plants many seeds and it very well pays off down the line... You are invested with pretty much every important character, which is a nice feeling obviously. And yes, again, the second half of the movie is a pure blast, in particular the last hour which is masterfully orchestrated and shines high-in-color before our very eyes !In the end, it leaves you a very pleasant taste.

Yea, I understand the frustration from marvel/Disney lately, but some viewers rush to make critical opinions. Sure this movie had more females in the cast but was it objectively targeted at girls? NO. I don't understand the dislike towards Riri. Did her character feel a little forced into the script? Yea. Did the final iron suit look strange-also, yea. But the actress who played Riri gave a strong performance and blended well into the cast. I feel like many guys are bitter because the character is female. The movie had strong performances from male actors like Jordan and Winston. Overall I enjoyed the film as it provides a deep sense of how Shuri dealt with grief. Maybe it could have been shorter, and some moments might have been predictable, but this movie held my attention all the way through. Talokan is an intriguing new destination in the MCU, and Namor plays a great villain even if some people do not consider him one. Suppose I could change anything about the ending; I wanted Shuri to force Namor into revealing the underwater vibranium. I have higher hope now for the iron heart series. See the movie and make your own opinion, or you could miss this gem.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

The reason being? It was fantastic!As someone who isn't normally a fan of Marvel or simple action movies, I thought this was a really well done film. So much detail went into creating an alternative world, taking a lot from African cultures before they were devastated by European c0lonialism. The costumes were also well researched, culturally relevant, innovative, and beautiful.I also really appreciated the detail that went into the Talokan tribe, with many references from Mayan art and attire. My only issue with them was that after so many years of living underwater, the people could have at least evolved webbed feet and fingers by then. It didn't pull away from the movie though - that's just my sci fi nerd nitpicking.The cast was great! I like how this movie focused more on strong black women - hardly any movies do this. They produced some great fight scenes and provided some humour woven throughout the story. There were some deeper meanings behind a lot of the scenes, especially as they relate to historic and contemporary parallels of wh*te supremacy (loved it when they made the European c0lonizers kneel - great parallel to Kaepernick's activism in real life).Overall, I was never bored and enjoyed watching this movie. Action, comedy, and heartbreak were all wrapped into one cohesive film. I'm excited to see the next chapter!","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

Acting was mediocre at best, story was extremely predictable and uninspired, and last but not least most characters lacked proper character development, motivations and backstories. Beyond the overall low quality of the movie, it goes on to stain and degrade the legacy of other popular and established heroes such as Ironman and Black Panther. As an example, in my humble opinion you cannot replace a popular super hero like Ironman with a character that was just introduced moments earlier. The original Ironman from the Marvel cinematic universe had many challenges, character arcs and a backstory that spanned over 3 standalone movies not including the Avenger movies. The story told in said movies helped facilitate a connection with the character and a deep understanding for the characters thoughts/motivations that led to each decision made. To simplify, we understood the character and why they did what they did. Good storytelling and character development creates a unique understanding where you could imagine how a character would react with in any situation. Oppositely, the same cannot be said about 90 percent of the characters in Wakanda Forever. This is especially true for the new super hero chosen to take the mantle of Ironman in this movie. That being said, most of the characters suffered from this same issue. Even the new Black Panther character suffered from this lack of story although it is important to note an attempt was at least made when it came to her portrayal of Black Panther. The movie felt like a cash grab opposed to an interesting and well thought out story that should have and/or could have been entertaining. It seemed like a jumbled over utilization of video effects lacking crucial movie elements. Very disappointing. Lastly, I would be curious to see the unedited version of Wakanda Forever looks like.... Perhaps the cut scenes added to each characters development the same way the Snyder's Cut did to Justice League?","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

7.5/10I liked it more than I thought I would. The Chadwick Boseman tribute was really nice and the end had a great twist not seen at all in the trailers. The movie was two hours and forty minutes but didn't feel like it actually. The villain was meh and Ironheart was meh for me as well but I really liked Shuri in this, it was her time to shine and she really had some fantastic character development. Okoye too. Angela Bassett (the mother) could literally be nominated for an Oscar for this role and I wouldn't be surprised. Best acting in the film and one of the best actors the MCU has. A cool cameo was added in as well! A few remarks and moments seemed a little politically motivated by Hollywood but other than that the movie was nice!","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Some of the actors are acting really good others are just boring to watch and don't actually fit their role. The CGI was really good and fun to watch.

Ryan Coogler, his team, and the movie's cast have pulled it off admirably, and fortunately without any silly MCU jokes (of which I had been afraid since I watched the travesty that was Thor: Love and Thunder).The movie is a welcome return to form by Marvel after, I'll say it again, the horror show which was Thor: Love and Thunder (easily the MCU's worst offering since The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2).It has its lighter moments where necessary but nowhere are comedy and humour overdone, and for the most part, the movie hits all the right notes. The direction, acting, cinematography, and writing are all excellent, and the film score is absolutely breathtaking.Letitia Wright (Shuri) and Danai Gurira (Okoye) are exceptional here, and supported brilliantly by Angela Bassett (Queen Ramonda), Lupita Nyong'o (Nakia), and Winston Duke (M'Baku).Tenoch Huerta's debut as Namor is exquisite in its portrayal, and the folks over at DC should take notes on how to properly and effectively portray an underwater kingdom and its super-powered king.(I spent most of the movie wishing we could have had the joy of watching Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa share the screen with Huerta. It would have made for some legendary scenes).Dominique Thorn's debut as Riri, I felt, fell slightly short of the mark, and she might perhaps have been better introduced in a movie which did not have so much else going on. Still, I look forward to seeing more of her in Iron Heart and other MCU projects.Martin Freeman's Everett Ross, Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Val, and Michaela Coel's Aneka are little more than footnotes here but they do set up some interesting ideas for future MCU projects, including 'The Thunderbolts'.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Thankfully I managed to avoid all spoilers, though had heard the name Namor bandied about online so that's all I knew coming into it.Speaking of Namor, I'm a fan. He makes for a cool new character to the universe, as does Talokan as a whole, with Tenoch Huerta a welcomed addition to the cast - first time I recall seeing him in something, and I'm impressed. The star of this 2022 flick, however, is Letitia Wright. I don't really remember her standing out in the original much, at least to me, but here Wright is excellent.Angela Bassett is very good also, there's one emotion-filled speech scene in particular that stands out in my memory. Danai Gurira is always a joy to watch, while Winston Duke and Lupita Nyong'o are the best of the rest - though, the whole cast are good; even Martin Freeman, who I'm not always convinced by.The film handles Boseman's absence nicely, there are some very touching moments in there. I'd say they went the correct way with the character of T'Challa, no-one would've been able to even closely replicate Boseman. The music, meanwhile, is pleasant.I do think this has some relatively minor pacing issues, mainly around the midway point, but other than that I felt more than satisified with what I had just watched when leaving the cinema. Phase Five, see you soon!","4 out of 16 found this helpful.

The visuals in this movie are a work of art, period. The tone for the different settings, complemented by the choice of actors for the characters, helped produce the right atmosphere and feel for the movie. The movie starts off interesting and continues so throughout that its long runtime is never a burden on viewers. The main characters are deep each in its own right and develop nicely as the events, yet still without the need for a shrink-level analysis or reading too much into them for them to be understandable and hence appreciated in context. Tenoch Huerta's performance really shined, I believe, and casting him for the role was spot-on. I enjoyed the showing so much I thought to myself I could watch it again and this time go for the IMAX 3D version - that one should prove a treat with this movie.

BP beat you to the punch.WOW, talk about Redemption. As much as I missed the incredible Chadwick Boseman in the title role, this sequel is 10x the movie the first one was. The first Black Panther solo project was good and had incredible performances all around, but the story was so vastly meh and unoriginal. While the story wasn't perfect in BP2, it was much more compelling and engaging.NO SPOILER, but since Chadwick Boseman died in real-life, his iconic Black Panther character, aka T'Challa of Wakanda, also died. The movie deals with his loss and the vulnerable and scattered kingdom he left behind. In comes a previously unknown underwater kingdom to pose a threat to both Wakanda and the remaining population of Earth. Will a hero rise from the ashes of T'Challa?I hate all trailers. They spoil way too much, usually on purpose. The only time I see them, is when I'm practically held hostage before a movie theatre experience and even then, I rarely pay attention or look away. At anything else. Especially for movies I want to see. I wasn't at all excited to see BP2, so I didn't mind seeing the trailer and WOW. That had to be the most depressing trailer I've ever seen. Sure, Chadwick died and that was tragic, but when I see a Superhero trailer, I prefer to be amazed and in awe...not left miserable. Mercifully, the trailer is just the beginning of the feature presentation and they do move on swiftly. (Though, they still manage to spoil some great scenes.)I was grateful for that. The movie, while playing really hard with the passing of the king, did move on and into the story of the aftermath. And while no discredit to Chadwick, he did have an enormous amount of charisma in the original and stole every scene he was in. BP2 REALLY allowed all the other great actors from Part 1 to shine. And Bright.Especially Letitia Wright as Shuri and the ALWAYS MAGNIFICENT Angela Bassett as the Queen. That's not to say there weren't other great performances, including the ""antagonist,"" Tenoch Huerta as Namor, also known as the Sub-Mariner. (Helps he was gorgeous and shirtless the whole time, but that's neither here nor there.)I even loved how separated this movie was from the MCU. The references to other MCU movies were minimal at best and this was VASTLY welcomed. If I have to hear about Thanos and his snap one more time...I digress. This movie looked great and even though it was super long, for the most part, it wasn't felt. I will say I did have a huge problem with the editing and scene transitions - of which there were none. Scenes just abruptly stopped and we're suddenly somewhere else which led me to think ""Oh, I guess we're here now."" That and how the last half wasn't anywhere as good as the first half made me rate this movie not too high, but high enough to show I really did enjoy myself from beginning to end.The MCU has NOT been hitting the same homeruns since before Endgame, but it does have its charms. Spider-Man: No Way Home is my personal 2nd favorite MCU movie and I did even enjoy Thor: Love & Thunder (#9) and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (#10.) But, the rest of the post-endgame films, excluding this one, are mediocre at best.I'm proud to admit, of all MCU movies so far, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is now the 8th best. Not bad for a 30-deep mega-series.***Final Thoughts: THANK GOD this handled Chadwick's real death as part of the storyline here. Not to mention gracefully and respectfully. One of the biggest problems I had with both the Fast & Furious and Star Wars franchises was how they treated their major stars' real-life deaths. They DIDN'T. How they're writing out/around the character of Brian (played by the late Paul Walker) is absolutely ridiculous and disrespectful. (The CGI-Walker was creepy af, to boot.) And the late Carrie Fisher's Leia had a fantastic out for her onscreen death, but instead they made her into a cartoon, gave her a soap opera coma and wrongfully and cartoonishly kept her story going until they finally did conclude her saga. (The CGI-Fisher was creepy af, to boot.) BP2 finally did the right thing...even without the crappy CGI.","4 out of 16 found this helpful.

While the story seems interesting, and acting is great -from what little I can see and mostly hear, but Cinematography is absolutely abysmal.

And that is 100% correct. Current generation of filmmakers have forgotten about suspension of disbelief, they want everything on screen to be described or explained as If its real. Cinematic Realism is a concept which allows us audience to remove any need to ask for explanations on things which in realism might not make sense. What i'm trying to say is, THIS FILM IS TERRIBLY LIT! I'm not watching a documentary. Im watching a Marvel Pop corn Movie. Light the damn characters!

While it had the usual ""Marvel humour"", the plot weaved around personal loss, despair, family bond, overcoming depression, and women empowerment. Truly unlike Marvel, the movie was subtle in emotions, and often tugged at our heartstrings reminding of what could have been, and what kind of loss we are experiencing by the untimely death of the previous Black Panther (and actor Chadwick Boseman). There were about five or six times where I genuinely shed tears.That being said, this is a superhero movie after all. So, we do have the tech-wizard Shuri along with another genius building up superhero costumes in no time. We have a great anti-hero as Namor, truly questioning whether he is right or wrong. We have our CGI fights which are very well done again (as opposed to the Avatar-like costumes the Not-Atlantic people were wearing).I know that Namor was introduced first in the comic book world, before Aquaman, and that Namor is not exactly a hero, but he did reminded me a lot of Aquaman, but in a more realistic way than the latter ever did.Most importantly, I should mention Angela Bassett's portrayal of Queen Ramonda, who, in my opinion gave an Oscar-worthy performance. The rest of the cast were impressive as well.Overall, this is a must watch movie and the best in Marvel Phase 4 after all, if not the best movie of Marvel, save it for Iron Man 1.","5 out of 22 found this helpful.

The script draws on the history of Wakanda from an African perspective as seen before and adds the world of Namor with a Mexican perspective from its Mayan period, mixing mythology and futuristic fictional technology in a successful way. The evolution of Shuri's character is deep and the introduction of Namor's character is interesting, but the script is not exempt from being repetitive and making the film unnecessarily long. The CGI special effects feature elements that are well done and others that look quite fake. The editing work is very good and emphasizes the central theme already mentioned above, the loss of a loved one. The cinematography is excellent in the underwater scenes, but in the scenes above the water it becomes ordinary. Letitia Wright's performance is powerful, while Tenoch Huerta proves to be a good actor and Lupita Nyong'o fails to fully convince her character. A film with some remarkable technical elements, but a script that takes a good theme and overflows until it becomes tiresome.","17 out of 36 found this helpful.

Having written the entire script, then having to mourn the untimely death of your lead character is probably the most painful experience as a director. That being said he did an excellent job with the film and paying his respects to Chadwick Boseman.The first thing that I'd like to touch on is the story itself specifically how they dealt with Bosemans tragic passing. Cooglers method of handling it made sense throughout and created a lot of great emotion. The emotion throughout the film was top notch and it wasn't just the emotion involving T'Challa, there were plenty of elements that allowed the cast to showcase their talent and give quality performances.The acting across the board is fantastic. Letitia Weight did an incredible job stepping up to the leading role and I can't praise her enough. Angela Basset was phenomenal in this film and gave her all in every scene. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong's were both excellent in their respective roles.The rest of plot for the most part hit it's mark, but there was a subplot involving Martin Freeman's character that I felt didn't need to be there at all. Removing that element probably would've cut a good chunk of that 2 hours and 40 minute run time.Now the thing that I was most concerned about going into this film was Namor. The MCU has a history of poorly handling their villains so I had my doubts going in. In my opinion Namor is one of the best MCU villains to date. They actually gave him proper development and a motivation that makes sense.Although Namor was great his nation as an entirety was not as threatening. I didn't get the feeling that they were this all powerful nation that they kept describing them as. To me Namor was the threat and there were very few times where I felt that his nation had the upper hand to Wakanda.The final thing I'll touch on is Ironheart, on a surface level I like her character, obviously this isn't her film so she doesn't get that much development but at face value her character is cool. That being said if they were to take another look at the script I think they would've been able to write her out or reduce her involvement fairly easily. She has a crucial role at the beginning of the film but after that she is very much a tag along character and was only used as a comic relief. She does get some extra attention towards the end but nothing that really justified her involvement throughout. This isn't a big issue considering I did like her character, just something to note.Overall this is a great film. The emotional impact of Bosemans death and the development of our core characters is handled with grace, and the addition of Namor is extremely well done.8.5/10

I'm not sure if we saw the same movie? Because what I saw is a great movie that is character driven, world building (the introduction of Talokan) and the backbone of it all the coping after the loss of someone.There's reviews saying Chad was being praised too much and has been the center of it all. Chad did passed away and as his character King T'Challa (black panther) also passes away with an unknown illness. Wakanda is left grieving their King and been left without a protector. That's the plotline so i dont get why other people thinks its a weak plot when its done masterfully and with great respect not only to Chadwick but with everyone involved.Letitia Wright. What an actress. Did you notice that she embodied Chadwick??? All his mannerism and gestures she incorporated it in her character. When you watched the previous films she acts differently like a baby sister who adores his brother but Shuri is weighed down by responsibility as next in line and filling the void his brother has left. Her being the next black panther for me it was a smart move. You could definitely see in her that she did her homework and brought back pieces of Chadwick in her black panther and it was amazing.Angela Basset was truly a regal Queen ✨The soundtrack was phenomenal it was soooo good!!!So all those who disliked this movie you all got covid and lost your sense of taste 🙃","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Black Panther 2 is similar, except this time it's actually a drama.Not everyone likes that, I get that, but for me it was excellent. The drama is deep and powerful and left me incredibly reflective and somber (in a good way). The music is absolutely masterful although it jumps genres maybe a bit too much. I think it could have been better if it wasn't just a catalogue of international music but rather something a bit more focused. But the music that was on showcase was excellent.The hand-to-hand combat scenes were piss poor, I took off half a point for that. And they introduce yet another hero and want us to care about them without giving us a single reason to care. Why does Disney keep writing garbage like this? I took off another half a point for that because she's not actually that major of a character in the movie (or it would have been a whole point).But I did take off a whole point for the overly dark night scenes. There where a lot of them and they were all so dark that it was almost impossible to make out what was going on, let alone see any details. There is no excuse for such bad editing in a Disney production.But those criticisms where completely forgotten by the end of the film. I was riveted and in tears and applauding and I totally fell in love with Angela Basset. Maybe the script didn't shine as much as it could have, but this cast made it shine. Every single performance was excellent.Thanks for salvaging phase four for me, Disney. Seriously, I have hated everything else in this phase and I didn't even both watching Thor. But if you can do more of this caliber, I will return to watching them 2 or 3 times in the theaters like I used to in the golden days of phases 1-3.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

It is that boring!","26 out of 60 found this helpful.

All of the bad reviews are people who wasn't looking at the big picture. This movie was about the different impact of grief and process of healing. This isn't just another superhero movie. This speaks to what we are dealing with right now. The movie is showing use that everyone has a way of processing grief and that your feelings are valid but don't let it consume you. All though in this movie we were saying farewell to Chadwick, this movie allowed me to be at peace with the love ones I had to say farewell too as well. I lost my Tia to breast cancer and my grandma passed a few years after I graduated college. I understood what Shuri went through feeling helpless that you couldn't save the ones you love and wishing you had more time to spare with them but knowing they are always there with you. This is a movie we needed. Teaching the next generation to allow yourself to process your grief.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Recent movies tend to over extend fight with a lot of effects but here this correct. The life under water is a great idea and the visual in this movie are insane.The recent marvel movies are coming with too much jokes but here gain we have only few scenes with it.In overall that's a great movie with good balance between jokes, fights, story.

The first one was so good. Unfortunately I found it incredibly slow. Most of the characters lacked the charisma of Mr Bozeman, and struggled to carry the movie. Namor was an ok character, but his acting felt flat. The movie lacked a lot of the action and thrills that you would expect from a Marvel movie, and the fun time felt about 20 minutes too long. Angela Basset played her character very well, and did bring a sense of gravitas to the movie. Hopefully, if any are given, she will receive a nomination for her part.It does feel that Marvel is aiming at a younger audience, bringing in Iron Heart and other similar characters. I'm not sure they are able to hold the more mature audiences attention overall.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

I think Marvel giving Ryan Coogler the helm allowed this to be brought to the big screen the way it was meant to be. Such a solid tribute to Chad and the Balck Pamther character. Action sets that were awesome, and sets that were beautiful. Angela Bassett needs her Academy Award, she is a revelation. The other characters do play a significant part in the plot development as well. Denia Gurira also gives a fierce performance. The weight of the film lies on Letitia Wright's shoulders as we travel with her through her grieve and struggles she does an outstanding job balancing all these emotions. This was not my favorite Marvel movie but is up there for story development and emotional depth.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

"A Disgrace to the Memory of Chadwick Boseman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8856779/?ref_=tt_urv","kearl-50301","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur84974089/?ref_=tt_urv","6 February 2023","I finally saw BP:WF on Disney+ (the trailers just didn't get me excited to see it in theaters). And I am so glad I didn't waste my money on tickets. This movie was terrible. I rank it near the bottom of MCU movies (only above Eternals--the absolute worst MCU film). This movie suffered from so many issues:1. Lack of Black Panther: Granted, they lost Chadwick Boseman, but it shows they made the worst decision to not recast T'Challa or have the mantle taken up by M'Baku. To have Shuri take over as the Panther was a terrible choice. She does not have the presence to lead this franchise. And I didn't buy her abilities when she was Black Panther. They should have just left her in her lab. Heck, I would have taken a CGI T'Challa over Shuri.2. Editing: I rarely notice editing in a movie. However, it was so bad in this film that I couldn't help but notice how choppy and jarring it was--that's how bad it is. There were fight scenes where the motion of swing would get cut short to switch to another angle which would also get cut short. It completely took away from the energy of the action. And then, during the climax, it would jump back and forth between the two fights in such a jarring way as to completely undercut both fights. And, of course, there is no excuse for a movie like this to have a run time of 2:41:00. It is way too long. I was just so bored. I checked the time a few times, and I couldn't believe how much was still left. We watched it over two days, and it still felt like it dragged on forever.3. Lighting: It was just too dark. I could hardly see what was going on in the night scenes. And I heard this same complaint from people who saw it in theaters, so I know it wasn't just me watching it at home.4. Music: The song choices were terrible. And they just did not fit into the scenes they were placed over. It was like they just chose music they liked and plopped it in random scenes. Again, when music pulls you out of the movie, you know you've failed. The score itself was nothing to write home about. Very bland.5. Acting/Characters: Angela Bassett was fine. Everyone is talking her up for awards, but I don't feel it was at that level. To me, she can just get loud and angry. Letitia Wright went from playing an annoying little sister in the first one to just being uninteresting in this one. Dominique Thorne (Riri) was bland and annoying (her use in this movie was clearly to prop up her character for her upcoming Disney+ series). It only made me not want to watch it completely. But the worst performance, hands down, was Tenoch Huerta as Namor. His delivery was just abysmal. There were times I couldn't even understand him (thankfully, we had subtitles). He has now taken the top rank as the worst MCU villain of all time.6. CGI/Design: Not great. Some of the composite shots were just embarrassing. And the design of the tech suits was laughable. When your characters mention how bad things look, that doesn't endear the audience--it just points out how bad it really is, and how you felt it was too hard to make it look good, so you just make a joke about it. The MCU has done better.7. Plot: Totally illogical. This felt like a 1st draft. I know that they had to redo things when Chadwick passed. But this is what they came up with? There are just many problems with the story that it would take too long to list.I know there are many people who like this movie. Could for them. They talk about how emotional it was. I didn't get choked up once. It was just bland, boring, annoying, empty-calorie tribble. I doubt I will ever watch this movie again. What a disgrace to the memory of Chadwick Boseman. He never got a movie of his own that lived up to his level. If only they could have achieved what the Russo Brothers did for him in Civil War. Oh, how far we have fallen. Just another example of how Phase 4 is the worst MCU phase of all.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

And as almost everyone is tired of superhero movies being released almost monthly, my expectations were kind of low, I think I wouldn't watch this film in a theatre if Angela Bassett was not at the predictions for best supporting actress. And if she's nominated it won't be an absurd.But the main girl here is Letitia Wright. I disagree with her thoughts, but I have no antipathy for here due to them. She's incredible here, I felt all her emotions, her self-guilt, her constant mourn, she is devasted. Her arc is incredible, and she is, BY FAR, the best female protagonist in the MCU. I liked Dominique Thorne but her best is still to come; Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o are back again, both as imposing as usual; and Winston Duke is, again, as funny as usual.Duke is funny, but the film in general is not, and this is not a critic. I loved to see a more serious film in a universe where some movies have drowned in jokes badly placed. Ryan Coogler, as Jon Watts did in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", allows the sad moments to breathe, they're never interrupted by a joke or something, the audience can feel the importance of those moments.Tenoch Huerta is excellent, not at the same level as Michael B. Jordan in the first movie (again, it's quite impossible), but threatening. His people, Talokan, in a first moment reminded me of Avatar, but they have their own design, they're not generic, Marvel is not trying to copy James Cameron or Aquaman. Namor's motivations and decisions, both make sense, he's by far MCU's best villain since Thanos.The only problem I had was the notorious use of the chroma key, because there's a considerable number of times when the characters are on the first plan and the second plan is totally unfocused, accusing the use of the green screen. That's when you see how much this project was affected by the pandemic.Not only by the pandemic, but mainly by the loss of its star. Chadwick Boseman would be proud of what his fellow colleagues did to him here. They knew the strength of his character, they were respectful with him the whole time, and they knew exactly how to move on. Every time he's mentioned I had goosebumps, and there's a specific moment that can be top 5 of the entire Marvel history (if you watch you'll know).""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" should be taken as an example on how to make a tribute film. It celebrates the person who has gone but doesn't anchor itself to her. It's courageous, ambitious, and made with heart.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Not surprising for most, the film includes many references to King T'Challa's death and the impact it has on the Royal family, Wakanda and globally.There is a great amount of depth within the characters because so much of the film is surrounding the death of the Black Panther; this bodes well for the character development of many of the more secondary characters from the original film.The introduction of the underwater world, Talocan, was done extremely well. Not only was Talocan visually stunning, the story behind the city wasn't rushed and tied into Mesoamerica and Aztec culture similarly the introduction of Wakana in the original film. The costume and production design succeeded in what other underwater worlds were unable to do (cough Aquaman)! Shout out to Ruth E. Carter and Hannah Beachler for their outstanding work!The stand out in this movie for me is Tenoch Huerta whom plays Namor, the ruler of the underwater kingdom. In my opinion, Namor's story would have been a great stand alone film for MCU.Not quite at the same level as the original Black Panther, but Wakanda Forever delivers for fans in a major way.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The story was building up untill the second half of the movie, where i just was a bit curious of how they would connect the dots. Again, it was an enjoyable movie. Liked it more than the last marvel project with Thor. Rest in peace Chadwick.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

For much of the runtime, there isn't really even a superhero. Of course Black Panther does return, but it is deserved and built up to. The story is mostly about various characters, even nations navigating a world now aware of Wakanda and vibranium. Sure, there is a giant cgi battle at the end (Marvel couldn't end it any other way), but the conflict is more nuanced than BP1. If the villain isn't as interesting or original as Killmonger, he is more sympathetic. His motivation is the survival of his people - not unlike Shuri. The movie is well-shot and has many creative sequences done practically (Shuri at one point seems to emerge from water completely dry; all they had to do was film her entering the water and reverse the footage). This isn't an ugly 3D-animated mess: there are people behind the camera and in front of the camera too. The cherry on top is that it pays tribute to Chadwick Boseman without objectifying his death. The movie stands on its own and yet sets up a third BP movie to be excited about, with larger stakes and flesh and blood, allegorical villains. Not another cartoon monster.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The addition of namor was the best decision the mcu has made in a long time. I'm glad to see where all the characters go after this.

For this to be the only movie I won't watch from the mcu twice says great deals because I give plenty of films the benefit of a doubt and even a second chance but this movie is not it I'd go back and watch the first two Thor films again before I was this very big let down from marvel since Chadwick had such a big impact on so many myself included.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

It's long (2:45) and it does have a couple of sub-plots that don't do much except use up screen time (see below), but there's lots here that's really good. Most of all, this one is showing definite signs that the MCU is maturing into handling serious stuff in a way that is getting closer to mainstream, good movies. The pace is relaxed, the obligatory action sequences don't go on endlessly, and there is actual dialog and characterization that are given enough time to breathe.In other words, maybe the MCU is growing up. I think there were already good signs that this was coming in Shang-Chi (2021) and in Spider-Man No Way Home (2021), to be fair. These movies and Wakanda Forever have a richness of texture and a deliberate pace that I really liked.Probably the reasons for this are clear enough. Their main Black Panther star, Chadwick Boseman, sadly is now gone, so they had to decide how to work around it. As we see on screen, they confronted it head-on: T'Challa is said to have died of an unspecified illness and now the rest of the kingdom has to move on. For the storyline, this turns out to free up a whole lot of space for the other main characters (Shuri, Nakia, Okoye, Raimonda, M'Baku) to work, and they do a great job. It's like we're meeting them for the first time. They were all there in the first Black Panther, but of course they were all playing second fiddle for the Big Guy.Which leads me to say that because of all this, Wakanda Forever is now just the second (or maybe third at a stretch) female-led MCU movie! (and Black women at that). To some extent it's an ensemble piece, but ultimately this is Letitia Wright's movie to make or break, and as Shuri she continues to be excellent.The side plot with agent Ross (Martin Freeman) was sort of a fun distraction but seemed to be entirely disposable, frankly. Same for the young Riri Williams (Dominque Thorne), who seems to be brought in just to fill in the blank of ""which new character shall we introduce this time?"" But it was an interesting choice to make the main 'villains', Namor and his people (he's actually one of the very oldest Marvel comics characters), into Mayan-ancestry figures, and I guess it works about as well as any other option. True to form, all MCU antagonists are given extensive backstories, and Namor is important enough to get an even bigger than average treatment. Still, the pairing of Wakanda and the submarine Talokan is really an odd one. In places it just doesn't quite work.Enough. If you haven't seen it, ignore the reviews that say it's 'slow' or 'too dialogy' and go take it in. Maybe Marvel really is moving on from Avengers-style wall-to-wall action.","5 out of 23 found this helpful.

First of all, Chadwick Bosman was given a lot of respect in the movie. Action scenes are so great. Like the Thor LAT, it didn't mess with the gong jokes (but it's not that there weren't any jokes. The old Marvel vibe was there). Filmography was used beautifully throughout the movie. There were some emotional moments in between. Shuri's entrance as Black Panther had a good vibe. The most special thing to say is that this music album is amazing. There are some very beautiful soundtracks.(Personally, I like the song that plays when Namor and Shuri are taken to Talocan)
I think forever was able to give a good ending to phase 4.","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

I went into the theater knowing that this film would touch on Chadwick Bosemans death, but I had no idea how in depth it would go. The characters mourn the death of their king, whilst also having to fight off a new threat. In the moments between how the characters process their emotions was done amazingly. The 5 stages of grief were present, and the emotion was there and it felt like you were grieving with them. Praise needs to be given to Angela, Letitia and Danai! They have amazing performances. There was a twist in the film that I will not be spoiling that caught me off guard and saw black panther raise the stakes. The pacing of the film at times was drawn out but made up for by the multiple fast paced action scenes. I honestly can't wait to see what they do with black panther 3. The film genuinely was one of the best MCU films, the acting, the plot, the cinematography, the cgi were on point. I would highly recommend this film.","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

That task would be how to make a sequel without your main star. With the unfortunate passing of Chadwick Bosermen the early stages of the movie was in shambles. But Ryan Coogler came out with a fantastic story. Wakanda Forever did something that a few films made me do that is to make you feel like death is really hitting you. The emotion that people went through watching this was unbelievable. How can you add so much emotions in one film? The story wise was great. When you have to deal with a passing of your one lead. It's groundbreaking. The film main villain Namor (Tenoch Huerta) was a really refreshing take. The past few MCU flims was lacking a really good villain but in this one it was redeemed back again. Now there is a majority of elements of story that I agree with but with its runtime of 2hr 41min. There was something's that could've been left out. Angela Bassett (Ramonda) was spectacular. She took what she could make and made it ten times more better. One of the best acting performances I seen in the MCU. Dominique Thorne (Iron heart) was very much enjoyable. When you have a film that deals with so much grief. You need a character to break the ice with and she did exactly that. Can't wait to see her in Disney+ iron heart. The one and only new Black Panther Letitia Wright Aka (Shuri). Gave a incredible performance. I could only imagine the news that shoud got explaining that she would have to be the new Black Panther and a short amount of Time. She was great she took what she can and what she experienced with Chadwick Bosermen Black Panther and made it her own. Well done. So at the end everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job. Thanks you Kevin Feige and Ryan Coogler for the great film it was a great way to end Phase 4 of the MCU. You guys did an impossible task....","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

It was amazing. To be honest, it is the best movie marvel has ever made with No-way-home sharing the spot.Thank you marvel for such a wonderful experience. Great acting, great directing, great writing... Great everything.I didn't want it to end.Thank you marvel .This year started off rough with a lot of projects not living up to my expectations, rushed shows and half backed plots, but this movie checks every single box and more. I was honestly worried about how they would introduce namor, how they are gonna explain T'chala's death but everything just went smoothly. The execution, action sequence, Cgi, everything perfect.Anyone who hates or doesn't like this movie is mad crazy.To those who haven't watched it, my advice to you : forget about politics, forget about woke culture, forget about everything in the media. Go watch the movie and enjoy the experience.","6 out of 30 found this helpful.

Her ""tusk"" earrings are not warthog shaped, they are not antelope shape, they are not hippo or crocodile shaped... What are they?

The funeral had in some parts elements from seemingly all over the place. The drumming is ok, the Xhosa is OK. It feels like a mockery of our African traditions.The jokes are seriously not amusing and it feels forced.I cant say that i finished watching - the more I watched the angrier I became at how stupid it all seems.

It is certainly true that Chadwick Boseman is missed, and the film is certainly overlong, but at its heart it's a relatively serious film (compare this to the very silly Love and Thunder.)The story is much better this time around, and although I'm certainly not familiar with this version of Namor compared to the character I knew from the comics the film does capture the essence of the character rather well.This is another very well acted movie following on from the original. Angela Basset is superb, Letitia Wright does well in filling some very difficult shoes and Danai Gurira is again excellent. This also boasts splendid special effects (compare this to the dreadful CGI hair of Aquaman) and a really good score. Marvel may be struggling of late but this a fine exception for me.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Compared to Captain America, & Iron Man films it fell short in all areas despite the really good presence and acting by. Chadwick Boseman. With a not so good presented story and weak secondary characters it left a lot to be desired. But Wakanda Forever is truly truly abysmal like Namor's home world. Male characters appear dumb as hell while female characters all powerful. Wouldn't have a problem with the above if the movie had what it was supposed to. Action and unfortunately it is seriously lacking in this big time. Can't but wonder to whom these new Marvel phase 5 movies are directed. Because it's definitely not comics or action fans. If you like films were the dominant characters are always women. Were movies are filled with desperate moments of leading characters mourning (probably their poor acting skills) then definitely that's the film for you. Otherwise for fans of previous Marvel movies keep hoping that something good will come in the future especially if all these managers get into their thick head to include once again all the elements that made Marvel super hero films what they were to begin with.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

After Doctor Strange 2 and Thor 4 I felt kind of checked out with Marvel for this year, but this movie brought me right back in. This film is a beautiful tribute to Chadwick Boseman and his legacy as the Black Panther. Letting the actors use their real grief made this movie feel so genuine and very emotional. Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett give performances that gave me chills at some points and left me in tears at other points. The movie is also so well directed and Ryan Coogler gave us some of the best looking shots I have ever seen. The costume and set design teams also gave it their all and the movie is so immersive because of that. Shuri's character arc is one of the best in Marvel history, and the soundtrack is great. If I had some complaints it would be that the CGI is a little hit or miss and some plots could have been shortened to keep the film more focused. Overall I think Wakanda Forever is a beautiful emotional roller coaster. 8/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie had high expectations, but unfortunately, it was a complete disappointment. The plot was unoriginal and lacked depth. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any real personality. The dialogue was clunky and forced, making it difficult to connect with the characters on any level.The special effects were underwhelming and at times seemed like they were done on a shoestring budget. The pacing of the movie was slow and dull, which made it a real struggle to sit through the entire thing. The soundtrack was uninspiring and forgettable, adding nothing to the overall experience of the movie.The acting was subpar, with most of the actors delivering wooden performances that failed to bring any life to their characters. The casting was also a problem, with actors who seemed miscast for their roles, making it even more difficult to become invested in the story.Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It was a waste of time and money and failed to deliver on almost every level. I was greatly disappointed by the movie and feel that it was a major letdown compared to other films in the same genre. If you're looking for a good movie experience, I would suggest skipping this one and finding something else to watch.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

It was exciting. It was something everyone loves. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever changed that whole perspective.The first Black Panther is great, perhaps one of my favourite Marvel films. It's great to see Chadwick Boseman and a black man as the star of a superhero film. This definitely helps give confidence to black people. Wakanda Forever does better at this, all the leads are black however, specifically empowering black women which I know many people would appreciate including myself.To start with, the music is my favourite aspect of the film. Every single song is good from orchestrated arrangements to pop songs. The diegetic and the non diegetic sounds gives the film a good feeling and is fun to listen to. The cinematography is also well planned out, the shots and some sequences are surprising especially for a marvel film.The film as a whole seems like a money making project; it did not seem whole. For example, although they portray black women as powerful throughout the film it seems as though that is the purpose of the film, to encourage more viewers in order to make more money. It did not seem genuine they cared about expressing the empowerment the women had.Another massive weakness of the film is the plot. It was empty. It seemed as though nothing really happened. It felt like a massive circle; everything seemed pointless. The whole film had been building up for this final dilemma for it to go to nothing. It just felt like a filler for another story and another film to come out from the idea.Although the plot may have seemed aimless, it did not lack excitement or adrenaline. There are a fair number of fight scenes. It gives it a much more energetic feeling; after all, that's what marvel seems to be good at. That's what makes it fun, that and the comedy, two aspects that always work together in a marvel film.A feature that definitely stands out to me is the acting, it is passionate, not like any marvel film I had seen before. It left me slightly surprised but the acting just put more emphasis on the emotions of the film and how the characters felt, contrasting from the comedy. It is able to explore different feelings giving the viewer a more dramatic experience.Overall, the first film definitely is worth your time. With the second one, unless you are a die hard marvel fan don't bother wasting your time.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Full of surprises. I didn't expect anything but this new movie was Amazing!Sadly, the death of Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther Actor) followed by the death of his char which is happening in this movie. This is dedicated to him. Let him Rest In Peace. Then, the story begins, sorry no spoiler.Visually, I really love this movie because the Wakanda world is very rich in culture & modern tech. BUT, there is greater visual than Wakanda World! A new world! Sorry, no spoiler. Besides, their people and world give us goosebumps sensations such as we live in an ethnic tribe. Their costume, rituals, and voices are unique which I love it!More satisfaction comes from their music and new story plot. This is unexpected for normal moviegoers like me (not a Marvel geek). Since the movie started, I keep wondering about what is gonna happen and how it's gonna end in this movie. Lastly, my current fav's rock song is well-delivered in this movie, lol. They launched a new album this year, sorry tidbits.However, this movie is too long, almost 3 hrs. Looks like Marvel has a new tendency to create long movies since Avengers Trilogy. But, it is no prob, I already dealt with it with took caffeine intake before the cinema!Long story short, don't miss it! Great superhero movie and everything is amazing! Moral values? Proper and not too much. There are also 2 mid-credit scenes on the beach which implied that the black panther would return.8/10.","4 out of 18 found this helpful.

I'll go see a Marvel movie if the trailer for that particular movie really catches my attention or if a friend/girlfriend really wants to go see it. In this case it was the latter as I had a couple friends who were excited about it and wanted to see it so we all went.Now this wasn't a terrible movie by any means. In fact is was pretty solid as far as your typical big Hollywood action movies go. It had a solid plot that wasn't too all over the place (even though I felt they were trying to have too many different plots going for one movie, but they all tracked pretty well), the action parts were pretty entertaining and the acting was really very solid.So why only 4 stars? Because even though this wasn't a bad movie, I still walked out of the theater very disappointed. With all the hype around this movie I guess I was just expecting a lot more. It just felt like more of the same old Marvel type movie to me. It had the same old retreaded plot style, the same old style of character arcs, and the same old quips and hero bravado you get with any generic super hero movie. At the end of the day it was just another super hero movie to throw into the pile of all the other super hero movies out there. In fact, on my drive home just 20 minutes after the movie let out, I realized that there were large portions of the movie that I flat out couldn't even remember because they were just so generic or basic ""same old, same old"" type of stuff I've seen in any other Marvel movie. At the end of the day, Wakanda Forever is just another basic Marvel movie that everyone is excited about now, but will be completely forgotten and fade into obscurity 6 months down the road when the next one comes out.It was just not a memorable or outstanding movie.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

That being MUCH taller, and having longer curly/wavy hair. Beyond that, the constant reference of her being the 'scientist' also doesn't feel right. I mean Riri is an engineer and intellectual, not a scientist! Who calls a college student a 'scientist' anyhow?!?!?!?I'll also mention that the CGI in 'Wakanda Forever' looks more like SyFy channel style. Some of it looks great but overall it looked like people floating in air, not in water. I can only assume they had multiple studios working on different parts, which is why some looks awesome and other scenes look VERY low budget.An honorable mention to Winston Duke's M'Baku. IMHO he was the star of the film. He had the best lines and stage presence.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

(Namor, Wakanda forever). This quote was taken from the science fiction movie ""Wakanda forever"" which was released as a synopsis in July 2022 by Marvel Studios. The movie was released on November 11, 2022, and produced by Marvel Studios.The movie was the masterpiece ever created by Marvel studios. The movie represented how a woman can be powerful with Angela Basset's role in the movie as Queen Ramonda, she showed a powerhouse performance even though there were Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o and these roles were so regal that it could encourage many audiences' attention. Nevertheless, this movie would motivate other marvel characters when they work together with the most challenging parts.Generally, in ""Black Panther"" and ""Wakanda Forever"" the main characters of movies were black people who were humiliated. This film shows the elements of racism and discrimination. For example, heads of all countries gathered around and held a meeting where Queen Ramonda of Wakanda Forever also participated at the same time while she was in the meeting, the soldiers of France wanted to conquer the land of Wakanda. They thought the land of Wakanda is weak because of the death of Black Panther and as all Wakanda was ruled by a black woman who was considered as weak but her soldiers catches enemy soldiers
To conclude, If you are a fan of Marvel then you should watch this movie. It was one of the most powerful acting movies. Even from the technical side, the sound, the scenes, and the characters were perfectly set. The film received positive reviews and became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2022.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

One super technically evolved race of almost super humans going up against another civilization of even More powerful beings! Thats gonna make for some mindblowing conflict on a huge scale...As far as the new Black Panther?I have to say that I would have preferred
that it be played by a male only because of the physicality of the role. While a female in this case is Enhanced far beyond her own limitations to levels of great strength, it just seemed less believeable especially in the fight scenes
requiring her to go up against, not just men, but superhuman men...That said, the actress does an excellent job ...Gender swapping of established roles seems to be the Thing these days and here ,its no exception..How anyone would not be thoroughly entertained and frankly, blown away by this movie is beyond me...It stands head and shoulders above most of the super hero movies from DC and Marvel that have come out recently..This one is a keeper for me and thats rare these days..Its one of my all time favorites that I look forward to watching again. Lastly this movie was very respectful in regards to Chadwick's passing and I felt it was expressed beautifully...I'll bet he would be proud of it.","5 out of 25 found this helpful.

Unfortunately since the passing of Chadwick Boseman, the cinematic elephant in the room before the film's release was how're they going to handle his passing since a recasting of the role was going to be considered an affront to Boseman's memory so dealing w/his character's passing, a sudden ailment which his sister Letitia Wright's brilliant scientist can't solve proves an ample subplot for her to deal w/his death since Wakanda needs a Panther & the flowers which create the hero were destroyed by Killmonger, Michael B. Jordan, in the last entry putting us in a place where scientific might may not trump tradition. Adding to the drama is the world's attempts to usurp Wakanda's hold on vibranium, the appearance of the mutant Namor (masterfully now rooted in Aztec mythology) who fears land dwellers will come to his kingdom seeking the powerful ore & also ReRe Williams, Dominque Thorne, a young genius following in the footsteps of Tony Stark, who's constructed a vibranium detector which has been co-opted by the American government which puts her on a death list penned by Namor. All of this climaxes on a troop barge where the seemingly insurmountable ocean dwellers are spurred back from the remaining Wakandan forces (after a flooding decimates the nation) where a Black Panther stands tall once again to not only right some wrongs but keep the world in their respective corners. Ryan Coogler again proves himself to be the biggest kid on the cinematic block by weaving a nearly 3 hour narrative into something thoughtful, inspiring & ultimately soul searching as viewers grapple w/the multitude of emotions being explored here.","4 out of 19 found this helpful.

And threatens Wakanda on a brink of war. But my thoughts are who will be the next Black Panther? 2 hours and a half, we are introduced to the new Black Panther. It was great seeing the other side of the new side characters along with Namor's world underwater. But it's a bit annoying to wait for the new Black Panther to get screen time.

The story, characters, and care taken with the first movie was absolutely thrown out the window for the second. Apart from one performance, all characters felt flat and cardboard like - with clunky dialogue and unnecessary storylines crowing an already long film. I wanted to connect and really feel for our main protagonists, however the sheer amount of jumping around, and a lack of story beats truly made it hard for the emotional moments to really hit home. Where the previous film was praised for the way it presented the different tribes and celebrated culture, this film (aside from the opening sequences) pushed it far far to the side, and felt very superficial in its treatment of that previous sentiment (for both known and new peoples). The fight scenes were busy and not impactful, with far too much jumping around, characters mysteriously gained and lost strength depending on who they were fighting, and it seemed like the most dangerous thing in the movie was a water grenade in varying numbers. I would like to say the sound design was good (the last films was excellent) but there was so much abrupt licensed music that killed the mood, that I would struggle even saying that.If I had one redeeming thing to say, it would be that occasionally there was a shot that looked pretty. If you want to see a good black panther movie, I would suggest rewatching the first one.","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

For those saying that this is not as good as the first movie, understand that this movie isn't trying to be the first movie but rather an extension of a complex story due to real life tragedy.Obviously Chadwick Boseman's loss effected the franchise and it's future installments. Due to this fact, I appreciate how the movie tackles this head in. As many have said, it is a great homage to his legacy but as real-life teaches us, despite loss, life goes on. This is what I like most about the movie. It takes itself seriously and deals with the emotions behind loss and grief. For anyone that has ever lost a loved one, this movie may surely help navigate you through the grieving process.To be frank, I love the action scenes and overt CGI as much as the next person, but it was a breathe of fresh air to get something new from a studio that rehashes the same story over and over and over... and over again.Go into the movie with an open mind and see it as an extension as opposed to a continuation and I promise you will be please.Peace and blessings,Dee.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Guys, it's so bad. I think Angela Bassett deserved two oscars not one, not for her acting, but just for reading what must be some of the worst lines in the history of film! The movie is so bad that you often need to remind yourself this is not Aquaman. Aren't Marvel movies becoming worse with every new one that comes out?Here's the one interesting thing in the entire movie, which seems to be pulled directly from the comic books. The bad guy is named Namor, which he explains as being short for ""Sin Amor"", ""Without Love"" in Spanish. Well, yes, that's a really cheesy origin for the name, and in his place, I might have also tried to hide it into Namor. But what's interesting is that beyond that tacky story, Namor is an anagram for Roman. Which the name of Ramonda, Queen of Wakanda, almost is also. In a film focused on portraying minorities, the mixing of characters names with the ultimate symbol of European descent (the Roman empire), as well as between heroes and villains, certainly leaves you thinking. That alone is the only intriguing, thought-provoking element of Wakanda Forever.I am probably late for most, but if you haven't seen it, you're on time to add almost three hours back to your life.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

"Entertaining and slightly goofy sequel to Black Panther","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8741121/?ref_=tt_urv","PotassiumMan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3564718/?ref_=tt_urv","17 December 2022","The sequel to Black Panther has the daunting task of renewing that film's magic and wonder without Chadwick Boseman. In the end, it does a pretty admirable job, all things considered. It cannot live up to the original's achievement but still does a creditable follow-up. But the film combines a sensitive approach to mourning with the presence of mind of governing a nation in times of crisis.While mourning the loss of her brother T'Challa, Princess Shuri faces the direct challenge from the Talokan, an aggressive underwater tribe with formidable powers, as it starts to wage war against the western nations and then prepares for aggression against Wakanda itself. What follows is a cross-fire of international tensions and imperiled alliances. A delicate truce between Wakanda and the rest of the world is sorely tested. Leticia Wright is superb as the film's center of gravity. Tenoch Huerta makes an impression as a menacing but also funny antagonist, as king of the underwater rogue nation. Angela Bassett is a commanding presence as the Sovereign Queen Mother. Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke are given meager screentime, but both still make their presence felt with smallish roles. Dominique Thorne is down to earth and likeable as the brilliant MIT student whose craft falls into the wrong hands. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has an amusingly glib turn as the new CIA director.Although this film probably could have shed some of its running time, in the end, it makes for an engaging Marvel experience. A tighter film probably would have spent less time in the science lab but the more deliberate pace can be forgiven because the climax is so intense and well-executed. A globetrotting epic fight for world domination in the sea and on land never felt so brisk and sunny. Recommended to those looking for a wild adventure.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

That feeling lasted minutes after the beginning of the movie and changed into excitement. The direction that was made by Ryan Coogler was very difficult but also very good and I believe that he succeeded on connecting the previous events with this movie. The interpretations of Letitia Wright who played as Shuri, Lupita Nyong'o who played as Nakia and Danai Gurira who played as Okoye were absolutely magnificent. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Tenoch Huerta's who played as Namor and he was simply outstanding. Lastly, I have to say that ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

The way the writers go about tackling this loss is indeed commendable & the actors too in those scenes make it quite memorable as the lines feels connected to the actor than the character he played. Post the demise of their King, the Wakanda is in the mourning state but they are aware of the dangers ahead with respect to greedy nations planning to get their hands on the Vibranium. As they struggle to come into terms with the loss as well as protecting their country, they are unaware of the magnitude of the danger that lies ahead. Enter Namor (for his enemies), King of Talokan. He is someone Wakanda is just not ready to face.Unlike the first movie, the cultural aspects are limited in this one. I for one wanted more intro to Talokan & it's people, culturally to connect with them. Anyways the writers opted for the easy route with a flashback to establish Namor's character. There was too much to unburden when it came to the key Wakandan characters balancing between handling the loss of their King & expanding the story.Once the reveal of the antagonist happens, the story moved unconvincingly. It tried to play to the gallery while attempting to portray a serious plot. Somehow, it didn't deliver on both ends. The action at best was average especially that prolonged sea battle sequence with few underwhelming vfx shots. Wakanda Forever definitely started strongly with that first act effectively showcasing how Ramonda & Shuri are handling their grief. As tame the introduction of Riri was, the following action scene worked well. But thereafter, the movie lost it's direction.With the charm of the first part missing, Wakanda Forever doesn't really hit the same high as it's predecessor. Through mourning for T'challa, the actors get to mourn for the actor and so do we. When it is not resorting to pointless exposition, it definitely had it's moments and indeed there was a better Black Panther movie which got subdued due to the immense pressure of handling the unavoidable circumstances and the need to match the blockbuster expectations.","17 out of 40 found this helpful.

There are a few flaws here and there which is partly due to Boseman's sudden passing but as far as Phase 4 is concerned, we think that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a great closing film.Synopsis:

And superhero movies also tend to be movies where you just switch off the brain, lean back and munch on a snack while watching the action, something that is required to unwind from time to time.I found the 2018 ""Black Panther"" movie to be adequately entertaining, so of course I also opted to watch the 2022 sequel ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" as I had the opportunity. Though such a movie is hardly worth a cinema admission ticket in my opinion.""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was not as entertaining as the 2018 predecessor. The narrative in ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was simply too montonous, slow paced and dragged on for a long time whilst setting up the stage for a showdown between Wakanda and Namor. Lots of talking and character building going on for about two-thirds of the movie, and the showdown was the final third act of the movie. While the action and fighting was fun to watch, it didn't make up for the long two-thirds that laid before it.It was becoming a struggle to keep focus on the screen and keep being interested in the narrative here, at least for me, since there wasn't enough of any action in the first two-thirds of the movie. I was expecting a Marvel superhero movie with lots of action and punches being thrown, and I wasn't in the mindset for a political drama with a lot of character building and setting the stage.The acting performances in the movie were good, but the movie was suffering from not having Chadwick Boseman in the role as the Black Panther. It should be noted, though, that the cast ensemble was good and they had a lot of talented actors and actresses on the cast list.Visually then ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was good, as Marvel superhero movie usually are. So at least tyou're in for a visual treat. But visuals can only do so much for lifting up a lacking narrative.Running at 2 hours and 41 minutes, and without a properly entertaining script, then ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was a long and somewhat monotonous affair to sit through. So I guess the 'forever' part of the title was a hint at the narrative as well.""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a movie for the fans of the superhero genre, no doubt about it. And for us casual viewers, it was somewhat of a stale foray into the ""Black Panther"" franchise.My rating of director Ryan Coogler's 2022 movie ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" lands on a five out of ten stars.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Take the family, young and old to see this one. From the moment the movie begins as well as the ending you can feel the emotional and touching tribute to the late great Chadwick Boseman. Watching the incredible cast each going through their own personal journey of dealing with the loss of their King and the Black Panther and also dealing with a new threat from the awesome beautifully depicted underwater kingdom of Talokan led by the imposing Namor the sub mariner. Watching Shuri dealing with the loss of her brother and the stages of grief was truly gut wrenching at times as you can feel her pain and anger. Angela Bassett provided an academy award performance in the strong powerful her portrayal of Queen Ramonda. All the supporting cast have their moments to shine during the movie as the runtime is the 2nd longest in the MCU after Avenger's Endgame. The new characters were a welcomed treat and I can't wait to see more of them on future Disney + series. As a Marvel fan, you will be taken on an incredibly personal journey of loss and also a loving tribute of the beloved Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of this character and all he meant to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

"Bloated and Unfocused Mess","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8894903/?ref_=tt_urv","PartTimeCritic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur162720103/?ref_=tt_urv","26 February 2023","THE BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER (C-) is a bloated film hobbled and rendered relatively inert by trying to serve far too many ends. First and foremost, Ryan Coogler wants this to be a serious and high-minded superhero film: it plays with heavy themes of imperialism & vengeance, includes plenty of long sit down talks about those themes, and checks off almost every desire for a diverse cast. Second, the film tries to be a sequel to ""Black Panther"" despite the hole left by the deceased Chadwick Boseman. Lastly, the film tries to be part of the wider MCU, introducing new kingdoms and characters to the ongoing MCU story. The three never fully mesh and often act against each other. The high minded part of the film thankfully gives us some beautiful and imaginative art direction as well as a great musical score, but it unfortunately just feels like a rehash of the same questions the first one brought up. It bloats the film and cuts off any of the fun spectacle that the second two goals were trying to accomplish. On that second goal, the film is just not able to replace the charisma that Boseman brought. Shuri is a nice secondary character, but whether its due to the writing/direction/performance, she just isn't as compelling, decisive, or believable as a main. Lastly, having to conform to the formula of an MCU film often led to those serious sequences being undercut by a dumb and subpar, but mandatory as an MCU film, action sequence. I'd be a bit more forgiving of the attempt to be serious if there was much interesting in what the film was trying to says. In one example, we have a serious moment between the Queen and Shuri (who is a strong scientist) where Shuri doubts her mother's belief that the passed away T'Challa is in the wind like she is experiencing. I thought, maybe the film will be an interesting discussion of science vs. Faith that will have ramifications for the MCU...but Shuri eventually takes the same ""protector liquid"" that takes people to the ancestral plane and is just proved wrong. No thoughtful discussions here - the decision to keep the MCU intact wins out. Another example, but going the other way is a moment where Shuri has her new strength (from the protector liquid) and puts on the Black Panther suit and like a strong main character she is dropped right into the middle of the discussion of whether to go to war with Namor and his tribe. This conversation feels like it goes on and on and gets bogged down with the seriousness and moral ambiguity the director wants for the film. This should have been an easy decision in the MCU direction - you partner Shuri's first appearance with the black panther suit with a triumphant black and white ""I'm the new blank panther moment"" audience cheer, not with a drawn-out ambiguous war discussion. But that didn't happen because Coogler wants Shuri to be wrong here - driven by vengeance and the real problem is not with the misunderstandings between the two noble oppressed groups, but with the devious American imperializers. Think about this encapsulation of the film, we essentially get the female reboot of Iron Man in this film and it's this throw away storyline that the film really doesn't care about and is so generic that I literally could write, ""black female college student that is high tech smarter than others"" and you'd know pretty much everything about her the film wants to tell us. I wasn't a big fan of the first Black Panther film, but at least that one was more focused and anchored with by Bosewick's moral integrity. This one is a mess.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

For instance, Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow and Eternals, and the ugly and pointless (Thor 4, which is easily the worst MCU movie so far).If this movie had been bad, it would not have got all the love on Twitter it deserves.If you're expecting Black Panther 2 to be like Black Panther 1, you might be disappointed.

In case it is unclear: Black Panther Forever as in Best Friends Forever. You very likely have heard of the latter - I made up the former. And while it may feel like I am sort of answering the main question here ... I really am not. The title is even going that extra mile to avoid the question ... of the successor.Now I do assume you have seen the first movie ... and while this of course is playing in the MCU and it makes sense to know all the other entries in that world too ... the one that is most important is the first Black Panther movie. As you may or may not know, Chadwick Boseman passed away (apparently no one knew he was ill while he was out there filming as much things as he could).That leaves quite the big shadow (or shoes) to fill. And the question is if anyone is going to ... and if so ... who that person is going to be. I think you will be able to determine to answer those questions for yourself ... way before the movie is over.That all being said and while this is not the first anything (something that the marketing department was adamant to stress out while the first movie was released), the impact this is having for POC and their perception and how they feel about movies and superheroes is probably something that cannot be measured. Kudos to the Ryan and all involved for making this.It may not further a lot of other things in the MCU (I am surprised this is bookmarked as end of phase 4), but it is quite focused on its story. Having a lot and enough shockers to keep you on the edge of your seat. The action choreography is good, some slow motion may feel weird I reckon ... but it works wonders overall.This is being released in November with Avatar 2 coming out in December - both featuring water a lot ... and ""blue (wo)men"". Not sure if there are even more connections ... well both being released by Disney and having fantastical elements to them of course.This has a strong female component to it. Way more than the first had, which already was filled with it. Great acting too - and a new enemy/friend buried deep and therefor never seen before ... on shore (more puns you say?).The 160 minutes went by like nothing. Not that everything felt like it went smoothly or without any hiccups, but if you suspend your disbelief or have drank the kool-aid like I did ... well you will like it. For a friend of mine who watched this with me (Imax 3D no less), this was the best one after the Spiderman movie in this phase. I have not thought too much about it, but there might be some common ground I share with him on that.Technically looking good and the CGI works overall (although in shots from farther away you can still see when character move way too fast and ""unnatural"") ... I doubt it will be able to hold a candle to Avatar 2 ... the preview alone made me feel like this will set new bars that no one will be able to reach (the first one still is the best 3D movie out there ... 14 years later!) ... Black and Blue Panther ... with enough jokes, drama and action to keep you interested all the time.","5 out of 31 found this helpful.

It is one of the best MCU movies right next to No Way Home or Shang Chi but it has something more important than the atmosphere itself .. It is natural .. each character in the film plays his part as much as possible .. knowing that it is a tribute to Chadwick < 3The movie itself did not seem to be as long as everyone was saying .. you know, it has some moments that make it silly for some people .. in my opinion there was one moment in the film itself that could have been shown in a different way ..The plot itself .. interestingly led .. there are no big plot twists .. the main goal was to show the loss of the main character, how to handle it .. and I do not go deeper because spoilers;)CGI .. has a problem with himself at certain points .. and you can see that they are trying to cover some of the shortcomings, creating a blur of the area .. besides .. a really beautiful movie !!!Music .. Brilliant, does all the job .. especially the accompanying song #Liftmeup in the background of the movie <3At the end of this review, a movie worth recommending and watching, worthy of paying tribute to Chadwick .. incredibly addictive and touching .. 9/10 WAKANDA FOREVER !!!!!!!!!!!!","3 out of 15 found this helpful.

As the Film opens up with an excellent yet emotional start the story sets a tone for a movie. It's promising. Wakanda Forever is definitely the best phase four movie for its screenplay.The film takes time to set up the characters and their motivations throughout the journey.It has good buildup. Every single character especially Shur has good character development throughout the movie.The first act of the movie is the best part. It shows you how the characters are so promising and promising for their coming decisions. The tone of the film is a bit dark yet engaging. We all get engaged in what's happening, even the conversation scenes between the characters are impressive.The movie holds you till the last minute. This is one of those movies where you care for the protagonist because the antagonist of the movie is so strong and clear about what he wants. You listen to him so carefully for what he speaks.The second act is a bit slow but not boring. And the final act is not up to the mark but definitely a good closure for the film.Direction: Directed by Ryan Coogler. The direction is so impressive. I love how the director introduced each character. The pacing of the story fits the script. It evolves like magic.Good direction.Writing: Writing by Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole is superb. It gets justice to the project. Especially screenplay. The screenplay is so perfect. I loved it. Well-written characters, engaging events, and dialogues. So good arcs for all characters.Perfect.Cinematography: Cinematography by Autumn Durald Arkapaw is good for underwater sequences. It felt real, raw, and also so magical. I love the way they showcased underwater nature. Not so colorful and vibrant, but real. Good take.Music and sound design: Created by Ludwig Göransson, Music is always so amazing and catchy. The background score has done super work throughout the movie. . Songs between sequences just merge so perfectly.Thank You.","3 out of 15 found this helpful.

Honestly if he wants to tackle more in the MCU than Black Panther and Wakanda they should have him do anything he wants to. He clearly has a gift for storytelling, character development, and pacing out a movie.For a 2 hour and 40 minute movie it does not have any dead air and you do not feel as if anything drags.Not everything is perfect, but considering everything that had to be juggled the end result is a great achievement.","3 out of 15 found this helpful.

I was unsure how good it would be, but they reassured me it was amazing. I was relieved (because I did not think it would be that good honestly) and went to see it by myself. I ended up being greatly disappointed.This movie is mediocre at best, with roughly 2/3 of the runtime taken up by dialogue. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't need a Michael Bay ""explosion every minute and a half"" in order to be interested in a movie. But this second installment of Black Panther was just plain boring to me. A well-done, well-casted, well-scripted movie? Sure. The plot was simply lackluster in my opinion. There is one medium-sized reveal at the very end that (almost) makes it worth watching, but honestly, I could tell you the entire movie's plot in 10 seconds or less. There were too many main characters and a very forgettable ""bad guy"", which made for a very meh movie.I'm hoping whatever the next Marvel installment is more attention-grabbing than Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Watching the early part of the movie she looks emaciated with no muscle on her arms whatsoever, which is completely against any logic of a superhero - all the male leads have way more muscle and an athletic physique that is way beyond the average man, which adds credibility to their strength and capabilities.Since Disney took over the Marvel Universe, they have dumbed down the storylines and trashed what made these heroes and the Universe great in the first place.Poor Stan Lee must be turning in his grave at this corruption of his legacy.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

She owns the role and has raw and powerful emotion. The overall plot was overshadowed by the respect being shown and I believe it suffered a tad bit.

That was a bit annoying. The storyline wasn't thought through well enough. It lacked imagination and the characters and races were very simple. They lost a chance to make a good movie. I've seen all the marvel movies and the black panther ones are my least favourite. I've rated the movie a 2 because what I did was look at all marvel movies in sequence and then this movie is the second worst. Maybe next movie can be more diverse with better actors. Add the Hulk and then it will be at least cool. Hope my review helps people. Just trying to share my love :)","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

"Best of Phase 4","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8765979/?ref_=tt_urv","ThereelscoopwithKK","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur153803309/?ref_=tt_urv","29 December 2022","If any sequel in phase 4 had an excuse to flop it was this one and yet it might have been the only one that exceeded my expectations. Filling the shoes of Chadwick Boseman is pretty impossible. The secondary actors and actresses stepped up pretty well here in my opinion to deliver a story that had my interest throughout.One of the best parts I thought was how the action scenes were more creative than what Marvel has been delivering as of late. The violent scenes were also used appropriately instead of just fighting for fighting sake which is often the case in many others.The villain wasn't super flashy or charismatic but I think he worked very well for this story. He has some unique skills and isn't a prototypical villain. It will be interesting to see how they use him in the future.The mid credit scene certainly opens up future storyline options and there's a couple different ways it could go. This may also be the movies weakness in that although it had sort of a forced reset with the tragic death of Boseman , this movie did not definitively set a course for where the Black Panther franchise is headed.A solid conclusion to phase 4, but I really hope phase 5 is much better.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

It was obvious that Marvel was going to struggles after the twin brilliance of Infinity War (especially) and Endgame, and struggle they have, releasing a mish mash of the poor, the ill-conceived and the downright hateable (hello, Thor).Wakanda Forever feels a fitting end to the run, delivering boredom, poor cinematography, eye-rolling silliness and a lack of gravity in equal measure. Oh, and it is way, way, way too long. In truth it would probably have been a passable 6/10 if it was two hours; something to catch and then quickly forget ever existed. At two hours-forty it is actually painful. I couldn't have cared less what happens to any of the characters by the end. Letitia Wright can act but she absolutely does not have the chops to carry a movie like this. Any scene at night was so dim I could barely make out what was going on. Namor and his underwater kingdom? Meh. It was pants. A waste of time.I'm done with Marvel now. Adios, and thanks for the good times.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It will literally bring tears in your eyes. It's hard to see a movie or a man who is no more but story is about him , on the name of his character which he played brilliantly. A big thanks to MARVEL . Also they handle this situation very carefully. Apart from that , other characters like shuri ,okoye , shuri's mother , namor and riri William did well ... Not about others but i really liked them apart from iron hearts suit which was no upto my expectations. The action scenes were good but the end fight was not heart touching to remember for years like Black panther 1 or endgame or infinity war. At the end the ending was too emotional for a Marvel fan who followed them even from just 5-6 years. They can relate their emotions with this movie .

Ryan Coogler Direct Masterpiece, Academy Awards Are Coming... Music, Direct, Crew And etc. Everything Are Perfect. WAKANDA FOREVER. I Rally Enjoyed It. The death of T'Challa - and actor Chadwick Boseman - weighs heavy on Wakanda Forever, with the fictional nation struggling to replace both their monarch and their champion, and Marvel Studios deciding how to honor a man it was clearly ready to work with for years and years to come. Wakanda Forever is an effective, emotional farewell to T'Challa - a meditation on forging one's own future out of a painful past - but with a plot that has to introduce an entirely new nation and pave the way for a new wave of Marvel stories, it does struggle under the weight of all that expectation. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is at its most effective when paying tribute to its fallen king, and strong performances from the returning cast keep it afloat through its occasionally choppy plot.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

I'll be honest here it was the least movie from marvel studios I was anticipating for until I saw the trailer then I got a really good feeling. Thor was a disappointment and Dr. Strange struggled due to new writings, but Wakanda Forever mastered its problems in the best possible way. You can feel the spirit of T'Challa during the entire movie, not overused or forced just authentic &worthy. Me as the audience I got swept into the movie and literally share the loss and grief.Wakanda is in the middle of the story. Since T'Challa revealed its country and resources other countries try to steal them and it adds a very scary and realistic political vibe to it. I like the narrative a lot. The problem is for me Riri Williams some times the character interrupts the atmosphere of the movie and makes it feel like Marvel needs to introduce the character to tease for the future. Don't get me wrong the character of her is not the problem, it's just the wrong movie and time to be introduced. Her chemistry with Shuri and the Queen was there, but as I said if they cut the character out it would shorten the movie and make it even better.Ramonda played by Angela Bassett delivers the most for me. Her performance was amazing and gave me goosebumps. While Shuri deals with the loss of her brother in hiding behind her tools and technology, Ramonda has to stand up for Wakanda and go public and defend it. She has a strong and tough personality.Namor is an exceptional character which I enjoyed. Finally another decent villain with a good background and interesting colony under water. Great abilities, design and persona. Thank God, Marvel didn't waste his Potential by killing him off. I was actually rooting for him at some point and his motives were understandable. I'm pretty sure we're going to see much more and learn more from him and his folks.The director did an unreal job here and probs to the writers as well. I can barely imagine how difficult it was to create a movie when you know the main characters actor Chadwick has passed. They deserve all the love and appreciation from the audience it can get.Shout out to the crew for creating thrilling action sequences, amazing design & costumes and the CGI looks great. The music was also perfect. I remember the under water town and when that music started I was totally flashed.The minor reasons why I rate it 9/10 is due to the unnecessary introduction of Riri Williams and the length of the movie. A great movie to end Phase 4 and I'll never forget Chadwick Boseman, RIP !","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

I'm sure die hard fans are annoyed but this is way more interesting than I expected, just like The Eternals. For one: showing the complexity of colonization with two uncolonized nations and having people trying to get at their resources is compelling enough. Then, we also have the grief plot tying in really well via the critical thinking between nation states being fallible with the spectre of colonization over them, driving the fear. The resolution and accountability involved was perfect too.On top of that you have another gorgeous production, fantastic acting, and wonderful colour palette. There's not that many fantastic Marvel movies. Most of them are fun, but a bit dumb. This is intelligent and and fun, a rare thing in super hero flicks. Or is this new phase ending pandering and going for a much more interesting direction? Hope so!The only thing I actually didn't like was the comedy relief with Freeman and Elaine from Seinfeld.

It's bloated runtime makes it a painful watch that barely holds your attention. The lack of a strong central personality to provide cohesion and direction rather than what feels like a revolving door of ancillary characters in mourning slowing the plot to a crawl. New addition Riri Williams as Ironheart was a big miss for the film. When introduced she is arrogant and unlikeable, but quickly she becomes a flat and boring macguffin. Her final costume design is also laughably bad when compared to how great all the other costume and design choices were in the film. Perhaps, in my opinion, the biggest missed opportunity is Namor and his people. Making them a derivative of a native Mexican culture rather than being true to the source material or creating a new and novel civilization comes across as a forced agenda driven decision rather than a true artistic endeavor. The choice was clearly made to have exposition on the evils of colonialism. This exposition is lost on or moot for much of the target audience. Agenda as a plot device has become tiresome and exceedingly shallow at this point particularly when it detracts from the quality of the end product as I feel it did here. I firmly believe that faithfulness to the comic Namor or had they broke new ground would have served the film tremendously. Aside from that personal quibble I did like Tenoch Huerta in the role. He very much grabbed my attention when he was oncscreen, but not as much as M'baku(Winston Duke) who is a scene stealer. It really hurt the film that he has so much more screen presence than Shuri(Letitia Wright) or the Queen Romonda(Angela Bassett). Queen Romonda does have a few strong moments on her own to be fair. Now the problem of the final act. It is beyond lackluster. It has no honest drama to pull you in. It just does not do a good job making you believe that there is much riding on this final confrontation. I also lacks a lot of the fun eye candy in which Marvel films tend to excel. Finally, the worst issue for this film is nothing with it per se, but more the presence of who is not there. The loss of Chadwick Boseman was awful, and I truly wish he could have reprised his role as T'Challa. His memory haunts this film terribly. There are many moments of reflection and questioning how to go forward without him causing characters throughout to be directionless and unmotivated. Loss is a major point of the film's message, but unfortunately it puts a nearly insurmountable hurdle in the way of the story. Without Chadwick Boseman I fear that the Black Panther franchise may be irrevocably wounded without his strong endearing screen presence.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Even if you have never seen a marvel or superhero movie before you would still like it because of the beauty of it. This movie makes me excited for the future of marvel. Not gonna lie, it was going downhill for a bit... but it's like, Marvel's back. If you were wondering whether or not to see it, the answer is yes. Left me in awe. So refreshing to see a great move again. Honestly favorite movie of 2022 (2nd to everything everywhere all at once). Anyways, yeah it's good.

Movie starts with a beautiful tribute of T'Challa aka Chadwick Boseman. And from the start itself you'll emotionally attached with the film. The pace of the movie is slow as compare to other marvel movies but still you can watch further for the engaging climax. Visuals are outstanding the way director has shown WAKANDA as well as TALOKAN is watch worthy. Well as NAMOR stands namor is one of the coolest villains in the MCU. But his story doesn't excite much as it should be though it has great ability to stay in the MCU for long-term but let's see where he goes after this film. Acting & Cast are the soul of this movie. Specially Shuru, Queen Ramonda & Okoye just nailed their roles in every scene of this film. Movie goes from start to end on a serious and emotional mode. There is alosyone character that I like to talk is RIRI WILLIAMS her performance also does justice to the character but she doesn't have much to do and the lack of the story. Drawback of this movie is it's STORYLINE & PACE. Otherwise you can easily give a try for Visualls, Actioy & the emotional connect with the character BLACK PANTHER...","3 out of 17 found this helpful.

It mourns the loss of the main star Chadwick Boseman, of whom played T'Challa. With that, they decided to kill the character as well rather than recasting and made this sequel about his sister Shuri. That really spearheaded a real emotional story about Shuri finding her place in Wakanda. I can see why they made T'Challa die as Boseman's death was so sudden and he really nailed the role. I'm also not a big fan of recasting, more for live action and after a couple appearances of a particular character.This movie does introduce Namor. It does paint Namor more as a Mayan character. It does make it were Namor's people and the Wakandans could relate to each other more.Besides the emotional story, Wakanda Forever has brilliant visuals. It does an excellent job at encapsulating this Namor's Atlantis.Overall, I enjoyed this movie and I liked it as much as I did the first.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The biggest strength of this movie is the characters and their motivations. The outline of the story looks like a throne fight between two brothers but inside it is more than you think.Chadwick stars as the titular character and fits that role perfectly. As a king, he chooses what is best for his people and also the world but he is the same king as previous kings in Wakanda. Everything changes when the killmonger arrives.Both Hero and villain journey are more than interesting. The film respects African people and their culture, history. This is one of the MCU movies with a lot of female characters and justifies them. Black Panther is a triumph of universal appeal and demographic specificity.The film is comparatively light on action, and the pacing occasionally stumbles in the back half, but the sharp character work and rich production design make up for nitpicks here and there. And when the action does arrive, it is brutal and to the point, with a second-act car chase combining real-world action with Wakandian technology that I could watch on a loop for hours on end.The first act is dedicated to setting up the world of Wakanda (an isolated nation shielded from the outside world and powered by otherworldly technology and arguably a What if Africa had never been colonized fantasy) and T'Challa's from prince to king coronation process.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Chadwick starred as Black Panther in the original film and was set to return. Upon his death, the entire script had to be rewritten. The result is a mess of a film.The film pays tribute to Chadwick Boseman and the beginning explains his absence from this sequel. I understand the need to pay tribute to him, but they do this for the entire movie. No offence and with all due respect, it does become tiresome hearing the cast constantly talking about ""mourning their loss"".Ok, with that out the way, 2022 saw the release of two films featuring blue people living in the ocean: this movie, and 'Avatar: The Way of Water'. Yup, there are blue people in 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever'. Vibranium can be used to make weapons that can go undetected through metal detectors. Vibranium comes from a meteorite that crashed to Earth, and the reason it can only be found in Wakanda. The Wakandans will do everything in their power to protect it, and wants to keep it from the rest of the world.But now antagonist Namor (Tenoch Huerta) also wants the vibranium, or he will launch a war on Wakanda. He comes from the undersea kingdom of Talokan, and he is a powerful entity. His back story is told, but this villain was so uninteresting that I didn't care much. (He does look good in those green undies, though). Oh, and there's a 19-year old scientist named Riri who built a vibranium detector - as part of a school project!! (Allow me to compose myself while I try to stop laughing!!). Oh wait, this 19-year old girl also built an Iron man suit!!! (oh, there I go laughing again shaking my head in disbelief at the stupidity!!) So, we have an Iron Man wannabe, an Aquaman wannabe, and blue Avatar look-alikes in ONE film...But there's no Black Panther in the Black Panther film!!! Hell, wait, the bad acting princess Shuri (Letitia Wright) takes a shot at becoming Black Panther towards the end... What a joke!Man, this was a silly, silly, silly script! All attempts at humour failed miserably, and were ever so annoying! And what silly dialogue! Hell, everything about this movie was just silly. I didn't like the first film, and I think I liked this one even less. (Is that possible, since I disliked BOTH?).Some of the visual effects were good, but some were cartoonish. Many of the gadgets and magic in the film were downright laughably stupid! I literally sat there thinking what the bloody hell! The best effects and visuals by far were the water grenades; they were awesome! What else did I like here? The costumes! The costume design was fantastic and worthy of an Oscar. As for the film, I hated it. It was overlong, uninteresting, and boring. I'm so done with Black Panther!","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

First of all talking about visuals. This movie was beautifully shot, close-ups as well as wide shots were a treat to the eye. It almost always felt right, keeping in touch with vibrant, Marvel-Movie-Type colours.I absolutely loved the score, which especially contributed to specific and truly unforgettable scenes. Ludwig Goransson´s work has an incredible impact on this film, bringing back what he created for the first Black Panther and adding new scores to the sequel.Letitia Wright as Shuri moved the audience with her astonishing performance. As this film was paying tribute to Chadwick Boseman in various ways, she seemed to be the perfect vessel for it. Not surprisingly, Angela Bassett did amazingly well as Ramonda once again. The overall performances of the cast were impressive, acting out their own strong arcs and bringing their characters to life.The film did have a slight downside with the newly introduced character Riri. The story seemed to revolve around her, although she as a person was never fully introduced. Riri felt more like a quick acquaintance almost without a real character arc. This could have been due to her limited screen time or lack of presence overall.Although this last aspect was a bit unfortunate, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is definitely worth a watch!","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Chadwick as a brilliant fit for the part, he was T'Challa, and made the movie for me. But I really don't think they did enough with the character.So that being said, his absence was obtusely noticeable in this movie, I had a hard time relating to, or even liking the remaining characters. Winston Duke as M'Baku, and Martin Freeman as Ross were the only two that I really cared about.Marvel movies have always been known for the humour they manage to include, and excel at that fine balance between drama and comedy, with the possible exception of Thor Love & Thunder, which at times felt like it was played purely for laughs. But's that a whole other review.Frankly this mostly bored me. There were only 3 or 4 action scenes, with a lot of, mostly depressing dialogue in between. The shadow of Chadwick Boseman hung heavy over this. There were constant references to him throughout, and don't get me wrong, there should absolute have been a tribute in the movie, but at times it threatened to take over the story.Having been raised on Marvel Comics in the '70s and '80s, I also struggled with portrayal of Namor. In the comics he was depicted with almost oriental features, skinny, but built, and regal. In the movie he had more Indian / South American appearance, and just lacked that air of nobility. But that is probably nit picking from a comic book fan. Putting that aside, if you were not aware of Namor before seeing this, Tenoch Huerta made a good job as the villain.My daughter said, as we were walking out the cinema, ""That just didn't feel like a Marvel movie."" And I think that pretty much sums it up.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Hope they reallly come up with more engaging content soon. Quickly forget Wakanda and on to the next,","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Letitia Wright and Winston Duke delivered some fantastic performances among many and it felt like much of the cast were all determined to make this a film to remember.In many ways the new villain, while appropriate for our heroes, felt more like a subplot. This film did its best when it swayed away from the heavy effects and focused on the emotions of their actors.It is a shame this is coming out the same year as an Avatar film as their underwater shots featured some fantastic practical visuals that will feel underserviced or lower quality than if they had fully CG'd the film. That said it was nice to get into the utopian settings of two hidden kingdoms.I very much enjoyed this and look forward to repeat viewings.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

From beginning to end I felt the heart that went through this film. There is so much love that is shown and makes the film emotional throughout. The action was very well done throughout. The acting was also quite solid. I think the one thing is that the film does somewhat drag. Some scenes I felt weren't super necessary to the plot as well. I did like Ironheart though, although she could've been left out of the film and it wouldn't have mattered, she was still cool. They do need to explain some stuff about Ironheart though. Overall I thought this was a nice, bitter sweet, action packed film that was quite good. It was by far the best thing Marvel has put out this year.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

Within this movie, I found the most beautiful, thoughtful, and well-weaved tribute I can recall in any form of media. The remembrance of Chadwick Boseman was felt throughout, and the grief for his character T'challa came across as more genuine and human than most emotional content in the franchise.The plot itself was, in my opinion, a vast improvement on the fare Marvel has been giving us of late. The cultures that came to life in the movie felt vibrant and in particular as someone born and raised in Mexico I felt gratified to see my culture represented in such a respectful if not truly deep way.Overall I can recommend to any fan to go and watch this movie, something I could not have said for the MCU in some time.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

(Which wasn't a superior film IMHO) They grabbed up a little known, seldom used, Marvel comics character and butchered his back story. Added a few random characters to fill in an exceedingly thin story, and a bunch of stuff blowing up. Racial stereotyping is prevalent throughout. Caucasians are the world's evil-doers, while black or brown (or blue) skin equates to mistreatment, victim-hood and oppression. The actors speak both the Wakandan language and English with an east Philly accent. There is no serious linkage to any other MCU characters or plot lines. How did this become a 2.5+ hour epic blockbuster? All the ratings that have pushed this to a score of better than seven must be left by folks involved with the film or looking to further some social justice agenda.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

The horrible fight scenes (especially at the end) looks like a school project in choreography and cinematography.The editing and dialog is pretty weird as well throughout the film.There's a few new characters that are too, born geniuses and lack any new personality traits compare to what we have gotten the last... 10 years.Cliche.

He is not a sleeping villain, with no real motivation or stakes; he has a clear goal and knows why he is doing it. Shuri's character development is really good throughout the movie, and the side characters such as Okeye and Riri really add up to the story.The cinematography and directing of Wakanda Forever is amazing: breathtaking shots and good, tho short action scenes. Furthermore, the color palette and costumes are beautiful; and the score by Ludwig Göransson is for me one of the best in the entire MCU.Overall, this movie is an amazing masterpiece if you isolate if from the MCU-genre.Black Panther: Wakanda forever is a meaningful, emotional and respectful tribute to Chadwick Boseman; must watch in theaters.","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

After the tragic loss of King T'Challa, the Wakandans must do everything to protect their home from world powers looking to capitalize on the death of their king & protector, the Black Panther.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a mind-blowing film. Director Ryan Coogler has made sure that the movie is a beautiful & moving tribute to Chadwick Boseman, while simultaneously taking the story forward seamlessly. There are several emotional scenes that will make you tear up as we the fans & the people of Wakanda, come to terms with the huge loss of King T'Challa/Chadwick Boseman. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The visual effects are phenomenal. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The costume design by Ruth E. Carter & the production design by Hannah Beachler are impeccable. Letitia Wright is spectacular as Shuri. Wright captures the immense pain that her character is going through, with ease & panache. Lupita Nyong'o is fantastic as Nakia. Danai Gurira is brilliant as Okoye. Winston Duke is superb as M'Baku. Angela Bassett is excellent as Ramonda. Bassett delivers an extremely emotional & powerful performance as the grieving Queen Ramonda. Tenoch Huerta is outstanding as Namor. Huerta steals the show in every scene he's in & I can't wait to see his character's next appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Martin Freeman is awesome as Everett Ross. Dominique Thorne is amazing as Riri Williams. The supporting cast is perfect. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans & fans of Black Panther(2018). It will surpass your high expectations. Go & witness this emotional rollercoaster ride!","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

This movie just progresses so slowly, it is a mess. I really think that freddy fazbear is a much more interesting character.Freddy Fazbear is one of the four original animatronics of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and the titular antagonist of the Five Nights at Freddy's series. Freddy is an animatronic bear and the mascot of the original Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. He takes the role as lead singer of the band, standing in the center of the stage. Undisclosed to Fazbear Entertainment, Inc. And to the public, Freddy and the other original animatronics are possessed by children murdered by a man named William Afton. Due to this, he and the others are now seeking revenge against their killer by attacking any adults in the pizzeria after-hours in blind rage.He was the mascot when the first Freddy Fazbear's Pizza was opened in 1983. In 1987, he and the original animatronics had fallen into severe disrepair, and Freddy was replaced by his newer counterpart for the ""improved"" Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, Toy Freddy. After the pizzeria's closing, he and the original animatronics were refurbished for the new pizzeria, as of the events of the first game. However, after the closure of the new pizzeria, he and the animatronics got dismantled by their killer, William Afton. His soul, along with the others, were presumably set free, as evidenced by the good ending.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I cried five times in this movie and I haven't cried that much in a while. The themes in this movie of grief, revenge, legacy, and family were astounding and handled very well. Letitia Wright was phenomenal in this movie and brought so much emotion and force to the character of Shuri. The Dora Milaje were badass and exceptional at fighting as usual. Dominique Thorne did a fabulous job introducing us to the new energetic character that is Riri Williams. However, the main standout acting came Angela Bassett as the passionate, powerful, and moving Queen Ramonda; she stole almost every scene she was in with an electric presence. The main strength of this movie for me was the way they handled Chadwick Boseman's passing and the amazing amount of respect they gave him and his character of T'Challa. Now, getting into the more technical stuff the cinematography was incredible along with the costume design and soundtrack. The CGI was really well done and only had a few slight moments where I noticed problems. All in all, this was a great film and is now my favorite film of Phase 4 well making my top 10 in the MCU as a whole. I definitely recommend seeing this in theatres if you can, I know that I'm going to be making more trips back to see it a few more times. All I have to say now is - Rest in Peace Chadwick... your legacy will always be with us.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

In fact, I haven't seen any other Black Panther films is this supposed to be the 4th?So possibly.i have had the advantage of not having the other previous films to compare it to.I loved it. It was big, magnificent, colourful and beautifully costumed. The acting was really good, from everyone. I have to admit, that always hasn't been a strength in marvel movies. I have seen enough to be able to compare that!There have been complaints about the plot, but I generally immediately spot the gaffes and I didn't see any. Mind you, I hadn't seen the previous movies, so there might have been some inconsistencies to previous plots.We've been watching a lot of movies over this holiday season and this was by far one of the best.I wasn't bored, it didn't seem too long (although we did have a wee break in the middle).If I HAVE to complain about something, it wouldn't be about the film itself but the soundtrack. My hearing doesn't seem to be that great, and the voices in any films present a problem for me. Add to that the accents AND the speed at which the script was spoken, I had a real problem understanding any of it - oddly at places where there wasn't any background noise - only echoey places like the laboratory & empty garage. But my husband just repeated it all to me. This seems to be the case with a lot of movies, so it isn't a complaint about this film at allIt was just great. But yeah, a little far fetched the world desired machine was built as a high school science project. I have to agree with that!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

We the fans get the opportunity to have our moment of silence before we are brought back to Wakanda to mourn our fallen hero.Wakanda Forever allows us to pay tribute to Boseman by leaning into our real world loss. Letitia Wright is tasked with not only shouldering a massive franchise but also at the loss of her late costar. She's exceptional. Angela Bassett comes in as Queen Ramonda and delivers an Oscar worthy performance.Returning cast Nyong'o, Gurira, Freeman, and Duke get a chance to step up and get some great scenes. They help keep this all glued together and help Wright as she is passed the mantle.Dominique Thorne gets to have some good screen time to introduce us to Riri, we will see more of her soon. Tenoch Huerta gives us one of our new mutants, Namor. It could be said he equally had to shoulder the challenge of following up Jordan's Killmonger. Not an easy feat, but well executed.The film is grander, more vibrant, and beautifully orchestrated. Coogler did what many probably couldn't have. Wakanda Forever is a solid closure to Phase Four of the MCU.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Namor is awesome, great actor, great motivation for a villain. The Sea people is unique and intimidating. War between super advanced world? Yes! A goodbye movie like what Fast and Furious done for Paul Walker? Absolutely.But in the end, the movie fell flat. Too much talking and still I can not feel the motivation for the hero.The movie displays a story about conflict between nations. But, how the media acts, how a winner of a conflict acts, how logic of war should be, all is done wrong. Albeitedly, this is fictional, but it is still hard to emerge yourself in so much false info.Lastly, the fight scene between 2 mains is EXTREMELY Lacking. The first Black Panther has the same problem but this is the whole new level.In the end, 3 stars. The only reason it is not 1 star is because of Namor.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"A Lovely Tribute","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8669890/?ref_=tt_urv","ahmed-abou-hussein","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32792371/?ref_=tt_urv","12 November 2022","I think the movie dealt smartly and respectfully with the death of Chadwick Boseman. The first half of the movie is an intelligent and artistic display that makes you forget that it's a marvel movie. Ryan Coogler is probably the best director out there to touch the crowd's emotions without being exploitive.Angela Bassett gave a phenomenal performance. Her performance as a mother who is aching for the loss of her son and yet maintain the dignity and pride to lead a broken hearted nation and face a greedy colonial world was nothing short of imperious. Black Panther's villains are always very well developed as characters. Tenoch Huerta didn't disappoint. I was intrigued to see if he'd struggle succeeding MBJ's Killmonger but he doesn't. His performance conveyed an amazing emotional side and yet it had this menacing aspect to it. Danai Gurira is a giant in this movie. She just has this amazing spectrum where she can make you laugh or emotional without losing the dignified embodiment of the Wakandan general. Winston Duke is a fine actor and I loved his performance in this movie. The character also developed and matured. He shows you that while keeping it's sense of humour and flair.However, there was something missing in this movie and I am not sure if it's because of the circumstances or because Marvel is focusing too much on its ""formula"" which has been harming the franchise lately.Without going into too much details, the movie had a chance to show a very different type of Black Panther but it refrained from it. I think there was a golden opportunity for that with Letitia being different and having her own troubled character rather than a purist one. Letitia Wright has been an amazing Shuri. She nailed her role in this movie and delivered an amazing grieved sister who's trying to move on and doesn't know how to. However, I think transcending to the Black Panther role didn't feel like a natural fit. I think this is because in all previous movies her role focused more on the science aspect rather than the field aspect of Wakandan operations. I might be biased but I think Lupita Nyong'o's energy and kick ass character would have been more suitable. Lupita's charisma and the way her character has been displayed from day one as someone who's portrayed as an equal and a hero makes it an easier transition. I know that Chadwick Boseman and MBJ made it very difficult for anyone to wear that suit but I think Lupita would have been the perfect successor. I know that in the comics Shuri becomes the panther but there had already been deviations from the comics, so why not?The other missed opportunity was the last fighting scene. Without spoiling the movie, you don't expect that the two most advanced nations would have such a limited budget combat to be honest.Finally, the movie is great! It's Marvel's best in a long time. The performances are powerful. The music is amazing. The worlds imagined would make you wish they existed for real. The movie must be watched in a theatre experience. Loved it!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think this is probably the best they could have done with what they had and didn't have(R. I. P Chadwick Boseman). This film is a eulogy to T'Challa as well as Boseman. Long live the King! The villain has an intriguing arc which justifies his actions unlike most MCU films. However, he falls considerably short of the memorable Killmonger from the first film of the franchise. The cast did a commendable job especially Leticia Wright, Danai Gurira and Angela Bassett. Those who were merely supporting characters in BP were here elevated to main roles and they rose to the occasion. The background score was superb just like BP. One drawback was the subplot which was jarring. This film may not match its predecessor for impact but it certainly does(and arguably surpasses) it for sentiment.

What is also difficult is to give a tribute and telling a story at the same time.What Marvel succeeded with this movie was to tell a story. A story hard and gripping that leaves the audience spellbound. Unlike previous Black Panther movie which was one man show (I totally loved the first movie) the creators decided to put some focus on other characters as well. The queen, Nakia, Shuri, Okoye, Mbaku were well represented. There character were given enough time in the screen for audience to empathize with them. The movie also put a lot of focus on Black Panther being a symbol but not a person and how heavy is the mantle of Black Panther.Recent Marvel releases like Thor4 and Dr. Strange 2 failed to tell a story and to develop a character. Recent TV Series has been nothing less than shambolic. This is a saviour for Marvel which was able tell a story and build characters. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has one of the strongest performance by the cast that I have seen in Marvel. Every characters were given good story and every actor performed it beautifully.I would highly recommend people to watch it. This is one of those movies were a Hero goes through a arc that it deserves.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Marvel should stop pushing this film and find new characters to produce.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movie was just spectacular and the CGI this time was mind blowing. Easily comparable to endgame. Excellent storyline and screen play. Worth the wait and kept to the expectations. Be prepared to expect everything from this movie. It's an action packed movie filled with spectacular fight scenes. And Namor was just a perfect villain and matched up to our expectations. The background music selections was so good and gave goosebumps in certain scenes. A movie that should be watched only the theaters to a get a proper sense of the missing cast member who is Chadwick Boseman.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

With Chadwick's passing it changes the direction the film would've gone if he'd lived and the way Director Bryan Coogler vision was with this story line is fitting and also courageous because he got the blessing of Chadwick's wife and family to do this film the way he did, this is a must see movie.

Are there any good ones at all i may ask? While pb1 had nice action sequences and beautiful costumes and sets, a flawless soundtrack, really great acting with captivating characters and an almost interesting story this movie now is a total bust imo. It is beyond boring and i dont understand why its almost three hrs long?? I do enjoy epic stories and long runtimes when the story of the film requieres that but this movie could be definitely shorter and more exciting. But unfortunately its dull dialogue after dull dialoge, then some cringy >sad< scenes abt death + loss and sometimes some action sequences sprinkled in but they are so generic and dont save the film. AT ALL! And while most sets and fx were spectacular in bp 1 its seems for bp 2 the budget was cut bc some sets and most fx and action sequences look cheap. The underwater world looks very nice, though, and some of the costumes stand out (the beautiful blue ppls head pieces and tenoch huertas costume and jewellery). But while bp 1 was so creative and had somewhat of a soul this film is lacking in eeevery department.I should mention that letitia wright is a true hero because she carries the whole - bad - movie on her shoulders (why isnt it mentioned anywhere that she is the main character actually) and tenoch huerta is a great villain and wonderful talent (he was great in the last purge installment also). Both wright and huerta deserve more leading roles. They truly shine in this messy film.One point of critique: why did the even make a BLACK PANTER movie when there is NO BLACK PANTER!? Its ridiculous!Its time that hollywood finally starts making good movies again instead those silly franchise films.","11 out of 29 found this helpful.

This movie really pulls on your emotions. It's an amazing movie and a good finale for the MCUs Phase 4. Yes, it has, like most of the movies of Phase 4, a few flaws, for example at some points nothing really happens, the 2nd Act is mostly used to build up the Finale of the movie, but it's easy to surpass this flaw, since the movie is visually stunning. Not a single shot looks bad and the underwater scenes for Talokan just make me excited for the next Avatar movie. Speaking of Talokan, this movie perfectly sets up the nation of Talokan and I can't wait to see more of it in the future. Namor, a character I already was familiar with, because I read the comics that inspired this movie, was depicted wonderfully and he really is just bad ass. He is really dangerous and powerful and you see it in his first attack on Wakanda. Now I want to talk about wakanda itself. There is a reason why this movie is called Wakanda Forever. This movie isn't about Black Panther it is about the mourning of the sudden death of him and how Wakanda copes with the loss. And you really feel it everyone is at the top of their game, Angela Bassett gives an amazing Oscar worthy performance and Letitia Wright is the core of emotions. Yes it has the tipical Marvel jokes but finally the comedy is balanced perfectly with the drama in this movie. All in all I think this movie is amazing and its for sure the best of Phase4.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

But at least Thor 4 didn't take almost three hours to suck so badly.Letitia Wright, as Princess Shuri, was just fine playing a sidekick role and providing some comic relief in ""Black Panther,"" supporting Chadwick Boseman. But forced by his death to take over the lead, she just can't cut it, having neither the acting ability nor the screen presence to carry a movie, let alone the physicality to portray a believable super-hero. Angela Basset, normally an excellent actress of depth and gravitas, is relegated to petulant screaming and temper tantrums until she is mercifully allowed to be killed off. And while Dominique Thorne did well in her role as the black female Tony Stark, after being the driving character for the first act, she was simply forgotten for much of the rest of the movie, until debuting as Ironheart, in a suit that looked like a design rejected for the Power Rangers movie.Granted, the death of the starring actor left the producers in a bad situation, but writing out the character was the wrong answer. I can't help but think that simply recasting T'Challa would have been a better solution. It would have been difficult to replace Boseman, but if nothing else, maybe they could have attracted better writers.The cgi was adequate, but wasted on implausible scenes and badly-choreographed fight scenes, which came and went with no more lasting effect than a dance scene in a Baliwood musical. The dialog was bland, the plot was thin and unrealistic, and the villian was not only poorly-motivated and ultimately unthreatening, but frankly silly-looking (pigeon wings on his ankles, seriously?)I'm glad I didn't see this dumpster fire in the theater, but waited until it was streaming on Disney, so that I didn't waste $15; the bad news is that I wasted almost three hours of my life. Unfortunately, ""Wakanda Forever"" is just another example of how the Disney movie-by-committee format is bringing down yet another once-great franchise.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The action is good as all Marvel movies are but it just felt like it was thrown together. Pulling at people heartstrings doesn't make a good movie I'm afraid.The main protagonist is no longer with us which is a big loss. The remaining cast are okay, I mean okay. They do a job but there is no depth to any of them. The story is somewhat bloated. It's far too long and there are some real pacing issues. I found myself nodding off a few times during the movie because I had little interest on what was going on. If you are going to continue with a story without the main lead, you really need some character depth and direction. I didn't find it funny, sad or entertaining so what's to like? Given Marvels success in recent years, this should have been much better. I can't believe people are going this anything better than a 5/10. I've seems all 8.9 and 10/10 on here.

Somehow this is even worse then the first one, which I despise, love when plot armor some how gives every character the edge in every fight, even when the injuries should be fatal. All the action and characters are just awful, I kept checking to see how much longer I had to endure the torture, as it dragged on and on, as I watched it on Disney+. I can't believe that Angela Bassett thought she deserved to win best actor award at the 2022 Oscars, she is insufferable here no redeeming qualities. The young actress playing Riri Williams is annoying and unlikable, it's unfortunate for her because she probably tried her best, but the writers and director are again just terrible at their jobs, the character she plays was designed to be a girl boss from their inception in the comics, basically better then Tony Stark in everything, no respect given to what came before, there is no hope for the spinoff series, I expect it to bomb. The new Black Panther should have been M'Baku, not Shuri as she didn't want to become the savior of their people till the last of the 3rd act, and it was truly horrific to watch, no fault could be made as she was already perfect in combat, a training montage or something, no character development nothing earned. Namor is probably the only cool thing in the movie, designed was cool and fighting was good, poor delivery like I said, plot armor is bulls#%t. The entire film is a sob story on Chadwick Bozeman's death RIP sir, I'm not trying to be disrespectful.

The feel and pace is quite different from the first movie, it is slower, more time devoted to quiet interactions between characters. But this is unsurprising as the central theme is loss and our choice between being consumed by hate or accepting and feeling the pain. But if it is the action and gadgets your after, it is all there too. I commend this movie for the thought put into integrating these themes, rather than treating it as yet another cash cow. Although I felt it lacked the humour of the previous movie, the acting, the music, the special effects were on point.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"Pretty long, but packed with a little bit of everything","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8747833/?ref_=tt_urv","Bibliophile100","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur151113840/?ref_=tt_urv","20 December 2022","Phase 4 of the MCU has finished, with an emotional, action packed, and dramatic movie: Black Panther Wakanda Forever!With Chadwick Boseman dead, Tchalla is officially dead as well. All of Wakanda is struggling at the highest level to move forward in the wake of his passing, and struggling to protect their precious city from a new uprising tribe of people: the underwater kingdom of Talokan, led by Namor, ""The Feather Serpent God"".With 2:41:00 on the timer for this movie, and with built in movie intermissions a thing of the past, I'd highly suggest making your own intermissions when this movie leaves the theatres and comes to home media; I think I almost fell asleep at some points, but just managed to stay awake for it all! Phew! I was also able to follow along very well. All the chemistry between each of the main Wakandan's was very enjoyable, and the acting was splendid to see. I especially loved the performances of both Angela Bassett and Tenoch Huerta Mejia. Angela had such excellent lines to speak, and for my first time seeing Tenoch on screen, he did pretty good as Namor. Namor has a mysterious, mixed up personality, partially antiheroic, partially warm and welcoming; these personality traits seem to shift around whenever he doesn't have his way with things. It's amazing and surprising at how a little misunderstanding like the one presented here, can put Namor's people, and the Wakandan's at great odds with one another. Especially conflicted with everything that is happening is Shuri; with reality caving in on her, her own beliefs slowly being torn apart by Namor's stubborn demeanor, and with more and more of her closest loved ones sliding out of her life, we can see, with our breaths being held, that she is starting to lose hope...
With amazing action, tremendous performances, emotional weight, and a surprising, hopeful, and exciting twist ending in the mid-credit scene, Black Panther Wakanda Forever gives Phase 4 of the MCU a great and satisfying finish! Although other parts of Phase 4 slid downhill a little this time, I'm still cheering the creative staff of Marvel Studios on and telepathically sending my hope and praise to them, knowing that Phase 5 will be a brand new beginning, as we continue exploration of the bizarre and curious Multiverse (starting with Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania)!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Much of it is stupid - such as a Wakandan ship - and a single ship going after an entire race of vastly superior aquatics. The film was based on a bad concept from start to finish. Perhaps a sequel will get things back on track.

Queen Ramonda, Shuri, M'Baku, Okoye and the Dora Milaje fight to protect their nation from intervening world powers in the wake of King T'Challa's death. As the Wakandans strive to embrace their next chapter, the heroes must band together with Nakia and Everett Ross to forge a new path for their beloved kingdom.Black Panther:Wakanda Forever is one of the best movies Marvel have produced since Endgame. The action sequences are so good and super fun, the comedy is amazing, and the acting is phenomenal (Especially Angela Bassett). Also, the music score was so good that I believe it deserves the academy award for best original score.The film was so emotional from beginning to end as it really honors Chadwick Boseman's legacy. Additionally, the post is credit scene pretty emotional and fulfilling. However, the movie is quite long. With a 2 hours and 4 minutes run time, the movie gets a bit boring sometimes as some scenes are very prolonged and others are even unnecessary.To conclude, the sequel to the Black Panther movie, unlike most of the phase 4 movies, a very good film. However, it's not as good as the first one.Score:8.5/10.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It handles this tragedy tastefully, showing grief in a more mature way than what you'd expect from Marvel, and it feels more impactful and realistic than the collective grief we've been shown so far for Tony Stark. Visuals and CGI are MUCH better than the first one, and the way the plot and characters intertwine really hits home thanks to fantastic performances from the whole cast, especially Angela Basset. Namor is a great villain-not the best we've seen in this universe, but certainly superior to recent ones. We knew being Killmonger's succesor was a tall task, and the expected comparisons will inevitably make the king of Talocan less iconic; however, his character and the Talocan civilization help explore and develop Wakanda's (and its people) philosophy and relationship with the rest of the world.I believe the things that hurt the movie the most, and justifies a lot of people liking the first one more, is how it's more of a MCU movie than Black Panther. The parts that clearly set up future plot points and keep aspects of the movie from reaching their conclusion can make people less invested in it. Black Panther was, as Wakanda, more separated from the rest of the world. I also think the eeriness and scary factor shown in the first act faded during the movie, losing its suspense, which feels like wasted potential.Ultimately, this feels like a return to form from the MCU, and it shows that they can still make mature, even dark movies, and not just cheap comedic products.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

I heard too many negative reviews for this movie. Few were like, Fans were disappointed, too conversational, Not many action sequences and it goes on.. Well!! If you are someone who expects an out and out super hero movie with hard core action sequences with Damal Dumeel scenes out of nowhere then this movie is not for you!!! I loved every bit of what I watched on the screen.. It was about embracing pain when you have lost someone close to you, Not giving up with what's lost rather rebuilding a Kingdom with everything that's left with them. In today's world most of us are consumed by Vengeance. It's easy to harm someone who has caused us pain. You could be the strongest person in this world and you will have every valid person to Harm or even Kill the person standing in front of you for what he has done to you.. However, in spite of whatever he has done to you, if you have a heart to forgive him and give him another chance to realise his mistake.. that's where and when you become a better person and make this world a beautiful place for You and Others to live. It takes seconds to destroy something but it takes generations to build something. And these values shown by the characters is what made me fall in love with the movie.

The story could have been told in 30 minutes. Just another bad Marvel movie.Wakanda Forever"" falls short of the expectations. Despite the anticipation surrounding the sequel, the film struggles to find its footing, ultimately delivering a lackluster experience. The decision to elongate the runtime doesn't translate into a richer narrative, as the story could have been more effectively told in a shorter span.While the film pays homage to the legacy of Wakanda, it often feels like a forced attempt to capitalize on the success of the original. The pacing issues plague the movie, making it evident that a more concise approach could have preserved the essence of the Wakandan universe without dragging it into tedium.The narrative unfolds predictably, relying on familiar Marvel formulae that dampen the potential for innovation. This installment lacks the freshness and excitement that characterized the first film, leaving fans yearning for a more compelling continuation of the Wakandan saga.The emotional resonance is weakened by the movie's disjointed storytelling, preventing the characters from reaching their full potential. Despite the title's promise, ""Wakanda Forever"" struggles to capture the essence and cultural significance of Wakanda, reducing it to just another entry in the Marvel lineup.In conclusion, ""Wakanda Forever"" fails to live up to its title's grandeur, bogged down by an unnecessarily extended runtime and a narrative that lacks the depth and creativity of its predecessor. While the film has moments of spectacle, it ultimately falls short of delivering the immersive and impactful experience that fans were hoping for.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I walked into it knowing very well that there was no way it could be better than its predecessor, but I truly hoped that it would, and be a turning point for Marvel, but I was still disappointed. The biggest con is that the length isn't justifiable. There is no reason for this film to be just shy of 20 minutes. Namor wasn't written well, and just wasn't a good antagonist. And the cinematography, Autumn Durald moved the camera in every scene just to show that it moves. It gave me a really bad headache and I almost puked in a harkins bathroom. I was excited for this film since it was announced, hoping that it could outshine its predecessors, even if I knew that it couldn't.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They made the story feel as organic as it could on addressing his passing, and though he isn't there, his spirit is felt through the entire experience. It's one of the greatest tributes I could possibly imagine and it had me in tears more than once.Outside of all that, it's an incredibly fun ride. The entire cast crushes it, and I loved the focus on the women of Wakanda. Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, they carry the film beautifully. Tenoch Huerta as Namor is fantastic, one of my favorite MCU villains. His character is very well rounded and he feels quite genuine, as well as being an absolute savage.The film isn't perfect, there's maybe one or two sub plots that didn't fit quite as well, a few characters who were a bit superfluous on some levels, but that all feels moot compared to the emotional weight the film carries, and the reverence it has for it's fallen king. I was silent as I left the theater, reflecting on a film made much deeper by a real life tragedy, and how delicately and gracefully they handled it. Rest in peace Chadwick, and Wakanda Forever!","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The writing was top notch, the acting was way better than it has been in the past few releases, and the effects were great.

There were so many unbelievable moments that sent spears through my heart, and others that had me grinning from excitement. Letitia Wright as Shuri was so powerful and emotional. Angela Basset as Ramonda had so much energy and strength. Tenoch Huerta as Namor had me so happy to finally see the character on the big screen. His delivery of the character and his action scenes were amazing. I also really didn't know how to feel about Iron Heart being included in the MCU, but I'm now very excited for future projects with Dominique Thorne. I also loved the soundtrack.

There are also cheesy references to indigineous peoples' culture that got more laughs than sympathy. For example when an elder shows up with a lip plate--even ignoring the fact that it is a male elder and lip plates are generally used by female tribe members --the caricature caused laughs and groans from the audience. If the character said anything important, nobody heard it because nobody took him seriously.

It is that bad.Not quite as bad as WW'84, but still a total waste of everyone's time and money.If Marvel could possibly wrap any more tinsel around their product there wouldn't be any foil left for anyone else to roast a turkey.This should be, has to be, must be - the last turkey.It's so bad that even Patty Jenkins could've done a better job. And that's saying something.(OK - I seem to have fallen short of the 'character count' to post).What 'counts' for character in the MCU is just a tinsel facade of generic hero stereotypes - designed to fleece impressionable teenagers from their money.So now it's been demonstrated that anyone can arrogate/appropriate anyone else's culture - and prostitute those cultures for their own profit.This is exactly what Marvel does. They do not care - as long as it rakes in billions.(Hey - my 'minimum character limit' is met ! ).Can't be bothered with this MCU garbage anymore.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

"Wakanda, Forever Strong and Emotional, But Lacking Balance This Time","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8668223/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","11 November 2022","LIKES:The Acting: Don't worry, just because it is first does not mean the movie stinks. Quite opposite really, but I just found the other parts much better than the acting in this case. The second outing with Wakanda is loaded with spicy performance and every one of them is just as layered and complex as the characters they portray. Gurira is much more than the warrior in this film, she expanded the leader's role to so much more that her character had a more well-rounded tone to play well with the other character. Nyong'o rocks when she shows up, again adding more complexity to what was once two qualities and expanding her character to so much more than what we initially got in the first movie. Her usage was not only well-done, but the woman knows how to play these roles organically and just impose them onto herself to really bring a victory to the acting game. Wright though, wow did she crush the role. Shuri was once sort of the goofy brat of a sister with some harder tones during the less silly moment, but in this film, she really takes a whole new mantle. Wright portrays everything so well, not really straying into territory that is overacted or ridiculous to handle. A point to weigh anchors on, Wright hands down is my favorite of the cast for all that she brought to the character and the chemistry she had with everyone else.The Emotion Thanks to the acting, alongside music, cinematography, and planning, Wakanda forever accomplishes much in diving into the emotional ell. It's a much deeper reflection on real life than the other films, really focusing on the comic aspects of a character facing a hard time in their lives. As the movie progresses, that emotion just extends more, with connections, character arcs, and history that play to a number of audience members to potentially anchor themselves too. That relatability drives the point home, and I found myself going on the journey with them as they fought to face the demons from within, both figuratively and literally to some degree. Caution for those with younger audience members, because the movie is more for the adult audiences than the younger fans might appreciate.The Culture: Again like the first installment, Black Panther's focus on culture and story are always incredible for this reviewer in terms of the natural flow he visualizes them in. The events of this story really thrive on the understanding of so many cultural aspects of the kingdoms and even the world, trying to convey them without becoming too preachy. For the most part, they succeeded for me, really engaging in setting up all the future Marvel settings with a personality and spirit that serves as a foundation for the kingdoms. It pays respects to the real life influences, and makes it as much a character quirk as the characters themselves. This integration really spoke to me, and was again a strong game played by the director and visionary team.The Dramatic And Layered Story: As mentioned above, Wakanda forever is a very heavy story focused moment, with a story layered with drama and growth. It's a movie that takes all the emotion, and evolves it into something I find matching a few of the graphic novel plots I've read. There is connectivity, studying, and understanding of the world, trying to take the grief of a kingdom, and still try to fit into a world constantly on the hunt for power and control. Those themes of course stay, but yet blossom into something else as more and more strategic play occurs, crafting this board of characters for a much deeper story. The ups and downs with the emotional connection mentioned earlier only expands that layer, taking the movie into a more artistic Marvel film than other films have tried in the past.The Messages Are Classy: Given all the culture and politics in the movie, you might expect a lot of political agenda checking in play. To an extent there is, I won't lie at some of the heavy-handed elements that they are pushing. Yet, it's not the worst thing to come out of the Marvel Studio. Black Panther's messages are again presented well, classy and pertinent to the story whose messages extend past beating Thanos. When baked in as well as they were, I found myself really not getting too bogged down by many of the ""empowering"" messages, because they were balanced with the other aspects and helping progress the story. Thus, I give that a win in my book.The Character Development By far, the movie is really a great dive into the character psyche of a Marvel character and giving you a strong character story with it. Black Panther's group are really taken to levels that are rare to see in movies today. The anguish, the torture, and all the feelings are beautifully presented, giving you characters that far extend past the costumes they wear. Like a good soap opera, this movie really explores the facets of human society, providing a window to gaze into and do your own soul searching. And to tie the characters together in such amounts, well I couldn't help but be drawn into the stories these figure had and the journey they took to grow and become something stronger. That right there was perhaps the strongest element of this movie and certainly the lifeline most audience members will become enamored with.DISLIKES:The Pacing: For all the good this movie had though, the pacing was not my favorite in the grand scheme of Marvel movies. At nearly three hours, this movie's slowness could be felt at times, drawn out, a bit boring, and uneven to the point of requiring me to fight off sleep. Certainly the extra layers and character centric story are interesting and deep, but this movie lacks the action kick and props that other Marvel movies do so much better. So much build up and excitement for very exciting elements dwindled to inconsistent moments that felt off to me and sometimes dilated the time effect. It's by far more thrilling than say the Eternals, but, the movie is certainly slower than several other entries in Phase 4.The Action Is A Step Down For Me: One of my biggest disappointments, Black Panther 2 took a step back from the action the first movie brought. Certainly there are cool moves to watch, slow motion spectacles and few choreographed exchanges that I liked. And yet, the consistency and polish of these moments feels off for me in regards to the smoothness of their execution. Like a DC film, the elevated message bled into the fights and led to short lived moments and messy montages that felt hastily edited together in sort of a highlight real. These quick bouts ended abruptly, just did not give our characters the moment in the sun, and kind of felt sloppy or too elevated from what I wanted. All the buildup, the trailers, and the talk sort of died away and even the final fight felt like an afterthought when the drama was done so well.Was Okay With Riri's inclusion: Riri was a character that could have gone either way for me, but her inclusion was fine for the most part. And yet, I don't think it was necessary in the grand scheme of the story. She has potential for many crossover events and tie ins for the future, but in this film, it was another character that seemed somewhat an afterthought for the inclusion. The moments in the story are, okay, holding that empowering message, comedic moments and some other elements that look cool. However, I could also have gotten the meat of this movie without her there, envisioning a version with most of her scenes gone and potentially getting a better movie if they had replaced her with other characteristics.Too Much in One Movie: This is something that I think has become a big focus in Disney's world of franchise establishment. Black Panther's second film is all about introducing a lot of things, setting up a ton of the next phase in an attempt to lay the groundwork for the deluge of stuff coming in the next phase. While it's not quite as big of a springboard as say She-Hulk, it still put a lot of things into the nearly 3 hours, some of which could have waited for another movie or show to do without taking away from the other things. Again, Coogler make a loving movie, but at the same time could have minimized how much was put in so I could enjoy the effects to the fullest.The VERDICT:Did Black Panther 2 live up to the hype? On some levels, it very much did from what I expected of the movie. Coogler really did make an emotional masterpiece, this incredible film that is all about establishing worlds, cultures, and taking a look at the world's problems through a superhero lens. It handles a lot of things well, and integrate life's facets into a very good story that is character centric and relationship building to really evolve roles that were secondary in the first film. That chemistry, that relatability, and the manner to which they shot the film all point to next level story telling in regards to that drama themed story that ABC series do. If you like this, you're going to love this movie, but caution as the movie is a bit more adult paced than the usual movie, and so younger audiences may not like this one or be scared by this one a little. And in that regards, the movie is also not as balanced in terms of entertainment as the first film was in my opinion. Riri was great, but just didn't feel entirely needed, alongside several other components that got touched on. Meanwhile, the pace and the action suffered more for me in this movie and left me a bit more bored if I wasn't caught up in the emotional elements of the movie. I think it handled way too much in one film, and while most was handled beautifully, having all that stuff just did not accomplish the full balance for me. With all this in mind, the movie's scores for me are:Action/Adventure/Drama: 7.5-8.5 depending on the drama
Movie Overall: 7.0.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

Chad Boswick was great as Black Panther. The story however was lacking a bit, and so was the often cringy humor. The aesthetics made it watchable nonetheless.Wakanda Forever is an entirely different movie. I was hardly able to watch it. Why?1) The writing
The movie is flat out cheesy and full of platitudes. The weight of the story is very thin and doesn't fit a superhero movie. The forced humor doesn't do any character good and is even worse then the first BP movie.2) Acting
The acting overall is tiresome. Angela Basset does a great job, of course. Shuri on the other hand is still infantile and unwatchable. She's just not able to carry the movie.3) Music
The worst part about the movie. Get ready for some very cringy R&B. It's like watching a teen flick, with all the unnecessary melodramatic tones.If you're going to watch this movie with your 13 year old daughter, she'll probably have a decent time. Are you planning to watch this movie, because you want to stay connected to phase 4? Then skip it entirely. Most of the phase 4 movies haven't been very good. They did however somewhat of a story that fit the MCU. This movie, unfortunately does not.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

That curiosity may have affected my judgement.The movie is a tribute to the life lost. Boseman was the Black Panther and this movie was about losing the Black Panther and what that did to the nation of Wakanda, which got far more airtime in this movie. Wakanda felt more real here than it did in number one. Now I totally want to go there.Despite being a sequel, Boseman's death makes it feel like they have to start over, so it feels like an origin story. For superhero movies that can slow down the film and technically, the film is telling three at once, which slowed it down a lot. With T'challa making his first appearance in Captain America: Civil War not even Black Panther needed to do this much heavy lifting with the origins.The originally movie had an ensemble cast just like this one, but it's interesting how director Ryan Coogler seemed to film the movie with this notion of how much they needed King T'Challa to be their center piece which ironically made the same ensemble cast that was great in the first one very lackluster in this one. In addition, it is a little over stuff. I loved Julia Louis Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, but it does feel they could have cut her part to make the film shorter and it would not affect the story at all.Despite that, Wakanda Forever is able to stand alone as a movie, but as a fan of the Marvel Cinematic universe, I could have use more connections to the universe other than a few words here and there. Like I know very little about RiRi Williams but I thought it was strange that the character of Iron Heart did not refer to Iron man in any fashion, or maybe that is just me.I loved what they did with Namor in the film, but honestly, I can see why you would not. If you are a comic book fan you'll noticed that the jerk of an anti-hero screaming ""Imperius Rex!"" as he rightfully seeks vengeance on the surface world is exactly how Tenoch Huerta plays the part, but his background is vastly different than what I recognize from the comic. Change is good, but I have to get use to it so bare with me. Thankfully, it helps that he said those magic words that foreshadow a certain franchise to be integrated into the Marvel Cinematic universe.I feel like I tore this movie apart when I do not think it deserves that. I like it in all but it's not my favorite. Its not as epic as Black Panther.","1 out of 18 found this helpful.

I fall in the minority that likes the film but thinks it is mega overrated. I like the general direction and tone of the film but it has too many small problems that keep me from loving it as much as everyone else.With that said, I honestly loved this film. The visuals are haunting and epic, the score triumphant, and h the performance perfect. This sequel has a lot on its shoulders. It's a tribute to Chadwick Bosemen, on top of being a celebration of the character that he brought to life, while being a sequel to the film that brought him to life. And on all levels it's working phenomenally.Before I start gushing I had a few minor problems that keep me from giving it a perfect score. I think some of the story beats needed some more time to breathe, especially at the end of the final battle. The US politics feels like stuff marvel shoved in for a cameo and excuse for why Bilbo is in the movie. Riri Williams is also fun, but doesn't add to the story in a particularly major way. She functions most as a Macguffin that the Wakandans need to keep safe, but other than that she doesn't add to Shuri's arc beyond Riri also losing family members.The editing is also hit or miss. For the most part it's good but some shots needed to last a little longer for the impact they want. Some CGI shots were also a little iffy, but for the most part this is the most consistently great MCU movie for cgi.Now for the great stuff. The acting in this film is so damn good. There isn't a single actor not putting in their all for these roles. Even M'Baku who takes more of a back seat for comedy relief has some really good scenes with Shuri.Angela Basset is phenomenal in every scene she is in. Her performance is guttural and emotional beyond belief. There is not a scene she is in where you wonder what emotion she is going for. Tenoch Huerta is also a wonderful antagonist. Every word out of his mouth is dripping with emotion.The standout of the movie for me was Letitia Wright as Shuri. I was cautiously optimistic regarding her role in the movie, especially with the twitter controversy regarding Letitia's views on vaccines. However, she kills every scene she is in. Her performance is one of the best in recent marvel history.Visually the movie is easily the best looking Marvel movie. At this point, it's easy to point out the Marvel formula when it comes to visual design and cinematography. Many bland, grey shots with little interesting camera movement. The more recent tries at breaking this formula, notably Multiverse of Madness and Eternals, have ultimately doubled back and returned to the safe gray color palette for multiple, if not all, scenes.This film breaks every marvel cinematography rule. The lighting is dramatic and distinct, the camerawork excellently framed, and the direction phenomenal. Ryan Coogler and the d.p. Autumn Durald Arkapaw knocked it out of the park.I also want to give a special shoutout to the sound design. It would be incredibly easy to just go with the most generic sound effects, especially with the Atlantans. However, the sound design whenever a scene goes underwater is gorgeous. The artists behind every sound effect deserve all the awards.Another notable aspect was how toned down the Marvel brand of humor was. I found most of the humor in this one far better written and inserted than most Marvel movies. It also has the fewest overall amount of jokes in a Marvel movie that I've seen. Eternals comes close, but every joke in that movie felt like a Feigi mandated insert than a genuine natural attempt at humor.Overall I really love this movie. Even though I don't love the first, I can see clear signs of improvement here. If you can go see it in the theaters. It is definitely worth a watch.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I can see why you might not like it and I can understand your opinion. But there's one thing that doesn't make sense to me. I keep reading reviews that are like it's no good without Chadwick. Not the same without Chadwick. Of course it's not. But what are you gonna do about it. Nothing. It'd be different if marvel had fired him. But Chadwick died, rest in peace. So you have to watch the movie for what it is. It makes me sad that you can't watch the movie for what it is and instead are just grumpy about it because someone who's dead isn't in it. Honestly it's disrespectful. It's a really good movie, an amazing tribute to Chadwick, very emotional, and one of the best of phase 4.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Did I enjoy myself? Yeah, for the most part. I also appreciated what this film did in terms of cultural representation on another level, and looking at lingering impact of colonization from 2 different, yet shared perspectives.Now... did the film give that same hype and feeling as the first? No, it didn't for me.Depending on how you look at this film, you could walk away with 1 of 2 feelings: 1. If you see this as a sequel, it might feel a little underwhelming, but better than what you'd expect from a sequel; or 2. If you see this as an/another origin, it might actually feel pretty good and exciting (though oddly placed due to the death of Chadwick Boseman, but good nonetheless).Personally, I think not having a ""true villain"" in a superhero story is what slows this film down a bit for me. It's like watching these 2 genuinely good middle schoolers who are never in any dramas suddenly in the middle of a circle arguing/trying/being forced to fight in the cafeteria with no personal desires to want or need to fight, but have been somehow instigated to do so by a bully standing on the side VS seeing these 2 good people band together against the bully.OTHER THOUGHTS:
Highlights: The underwater visuals, the Talokanils, the opening scene at the UN, Angela Bassett's monologue, Toussaint, the ""water at the window"" scene, that LGBTQ representation, cultural representation, thematic followthrough, and Marvel Studios opening for Chadwick Boseman.Could've Been Better: The Black Panther suit, the conflict/tension, a villain, a little more background to Riri's character (to the point that I need her to have a Disney series to fill in some gaps), and the title (I remember when Michael Jackson came out with Invincible, and there was an article or conversation on TV about how naming projects in ways that can come off arrogant or too bold can lead to distaste).","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Though there definitely were good moments, overall the movie feels bland, formulaic, drawn, long, BORING.There are absolutely no stakes in these movies anymore and hence the actionscenes are just redundant. Though the characterwork is still better, but I feel like the Marvel movies are on a trajectory towards Transformers. Basically just colorfull fluff to fill the time when you happen to find yourself on a flight but nothing esential, even if you are a comicbook fan. I mean, bullets no longer pose a threat, not only when wearing the Black Panter costume but to the dora milaje either. One person receives a pretty much fatal wound and acts like it's nothing at all, just a fleshwound. If no-one is in any kind of danger, then why should I as a viewer be interested in anything that happens?","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

We're constantly reminded of the role of Black Panther and why Wakanda needs a new leader / a new black panther.In order to fill the original Black Panthers (Chadwick Boseman)'s shoes, the movie brought in Shuri as the new leader/Black Panther. Even though we UNDERSTAND why Shuri could be new Black Panther, her character development is just not there. Shuri is placed on the challenges in order for her to grow into a heroine, but she DOESN'T develop into it. Shuri is placed to the challenges but she doesn't overcome it herself. She is forced to accept, just like the viewers.We all know the new Phase is coming, but we need to be attached to the new heroes/heroines. The movie just puts a new young heroine and tells us to accept her as a new Black Panther. Just like the Iron Heart.The movie has a great PLOT and a fantastic villain (Namor). We UNDERSTAND Namor's reasoning and his actions. With Shuri and Iron heart, they are placed there to just fill in the old shoes (Black Panther and Iron Man).Overall, it's a fun Marvel movie. I enjoyed it.The antagonist, the new phase, the new Characters.It's exciting.But I wonder, if they'll ever fit into the original Black Panther and Iron Man?","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Everything was perfect after the first Black Panther and then the movie lost its main star. How do you continue a franchise after that? Somehow, Ryan Coogler manages to do it.While its main plot is good, the story in the movie is one of the weaker aspects, particularly the first hour. It covers a lot of ground very fast and doesn't always do the best job of explaining how they got from one scene to the next.For example, in one scene Riri is arguing with Shuri and Okoye about going with them to Wakanda and the next second the three of them are at Riri's workshop so she can grab some things before she leaves with them. How did we get to that point? When did she agree? There's a couple spots like that in the first hour that jump around and it makes the movie a little harder to follow. However as I mentioned, after probably the first hour (whenever the car chase happens) I would say that issue went away.Other than this, the story was great. I love how it takes it's time to show both sides of the dilemma, showing both the views of Wakanda and Talocan so you can understand both the hero and the villian, if Namor can even be called that.Without spoiling it, they do one thing with Okoye's character in this movie that I wasn't fond of, but maybe I'll get wanted up to it in her future MCU projects.The characters are easily the strongest aspect here. Every main character has a story and a reason for being in the movie. Namor gets so much detail that I was honestly suprised by it. Shuri grows as a character more in 1 movie than we see a lot of MCU characters grow in 3. She's no longer stuck in the ""smart black girl"" trope (even though they kind of threw Riri into it) and becomes her own. Nakia and M'Baku don't have much growth in this movie, but you can still feel the impact their presence has in it.The CGI was a mixed bag of good and bad. Visually everything looked good, Talocan was stunning and Wakanda remains beautiful. However, Ironheart's 2nd armor never looked good and the green screen during Talocan's attack on Wakanda was very noticeable. Some of the new Black Panther's CGI was off as well, but I think that was mainly due to the actions she has to pull off are unrealistic to begin with. Regardless of this, more often than not the CGI looked good, and even when it didn't hold up the visuals still pulled it through.The music was fantastic. I usually hate movies using songs with actual lyrics as their soundtrack because 90% of the time it doesnt fit the scene it's in and drags the emotions down. However, I felt the songs used in Wakanda Forever actually lifted the scenes up. The score by Ludwig was perfection, implementing Mayan and African vibes in such a melodic way.The action scenes were somewhat disappointing. They were very choppy so you couldn't easily keep track of what you were seeing. I dont think they even give you 1 good look at Riri's 1st Ironheart armor.I especially loved the ending scene. It does something I wish more MCU films would do which is ending the movie with raw emotion. As the stylized credits were rolling I was feeling my sadness and it was great.Overall, Wakanda Forever isn't better than the first Black Panther, but it does more than enough to live up to its legacy, even if there are a few flaws along the way.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The black panther's expectations were not met. Even the actors performance falls short of expectations, and I felt it was needless for them to create scenarios solely for our amusement. With unfortunately Chadwick Boseman gone, the movie really lost its center, and the way the plot develops feels like random items are thrown in for the aim of enthralling viewers-an endeavour that unquestionably fell short somewhat. Sometimes, the background music brings the movie to life since it is so distinctive and makes the moments tense.

It takes away the pace that was needed to keep my interest. Some of the backdrops and scenery were pretty but some of the CGI was absolutely dismal. You would think with the budget of these films that they would make the CGI a bit more convincing.

His mother Ramonda (Bassett) and his sister Shuri (Wright) grieve while trying to govern the kingdom effectively against outside threats ranging from general greed coming from surface nations wanting to find Vibranium and the submerged nation of Talokan who will do anything to protect their way of live. The leader of Talokan (Huerta) acts under the guise of self defense when his kingdom is breached by other surface world nations and will wage war on Wakanda unless they find the scientist responsible for the equipment used by the CIA.Putting the convoluted set up for the movie aside, this is a much more emotional ride for the MCU. Of course a large part of it comes from the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, and his portrayal of T'Challa will be missed but this allows the two Wakandan royals to give some of the most moving performances in the entire MCU. Bassett and Wright were given much more prominent roles in the film than in the first movie and they did not disappoint. I knew Bassett could deliver but I was initially worried that Wright's expanded role would not be effective because Shuri was a loveable breakout star that never had an emotional scene; but I was glad to be proven wrong.But of course this movie is not just gloom, in fact it is visually stunning especially the scenes in Talokan. And director Ryan Coogler proves he is still a thriving force behind the camera with beautifully choreographed action sequences that look like the characters know how to fight instead of just doing a dance. And while it is no where near as funny as the first movie, there are some scene stealing characters that lighten the mood, like Riri Williams (Thorne) and M'Baku (Duke), the former being a welcome addition to the world while the other makes the most of what little screen time he has. And the majority of fan favourites have returned like Okoye (Gurira), Nakia (Nyong'o), Chiot (Noah) and Ross (Freeman). However the expansion of the world makes it a little hard to give some characters well earned screen time and other characters may also lack character development.One of the biggest issues with the film is that it sets up a lot of great and impactful ideas and themes but just leaves them there. For example there are very clear parallels between the hidden Kingdom of Wakanda, and the hidden kingdom of Talokan. And both Namor and Shuri have been through similar trauma, not because of their kingdom's seclusion but because of the amount of loss they both underwent and how it turns someone into someone they're not. The themes of grief and mourning are explained well with Shuri's emotions manifesting throughout the movie, but Namor just seemed like that one kid who hated it when bullies entered his secret clubhouse without his permission. They had an opportunity to talk about the effects of colonialization and imperialism and how it would give rise to people like Namor, but just didn't.I do not want to compare this movie to the first one, mainly because I think it's unfair to Letitia Wright. But the themes of systemic racism and ambivalence of the heartland are so well represented in the character of Killmonger that the audience understood and sympathized with his upbringing. And while his actions were extreme and was very clearly the bad guy, they did not go ignored. The first Black Panther was impactful because the hero did not just settle for the status quo, T'Challa lost the moral high ground and decided to change Wakanda for the better, because of what Killmonger did. I was hoping we would get this level of nuance in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever since it was written and directed by the same man, but I don't know if he didn't because of Chadwick's death caused massive script re-writes or because he just didn't draw those lines for whatever reason. I do sympathize with the writing process, it's not easy to give people everything they were looking for, maybe I just expect more from Coogler. I don't expect the exploration of mature themes from movies like the Spiderman Home Trilogy or the Thor movies or even Black Widow, but Black Panther is different.In the end, Black Panther: Wakanda forever is one of the better installments of MCU's Phase Four. It has earned it's two hour and forty minute runtime. Ryan Coogler knows how to create visually stunning set pieces and emotionally coherent scenes, and those two things are actually improvements from the last movie. These is no shortage of likeable characters or funny moments but that is basically what we expect from a marvel movie. It is just an another marvel movie, if you were expecting another Best Picture Nominee, you might be disappointed. But if you were looking for a good end piece to the uneven quality of Phase Four, you'll be satisfied, and emotionally wrought.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Director Ryan Coogler and company carry on the good work they initiated in 2018, expanding the Black Panther subverse to include Meso-American culture and ethos in the best possible way, paying rich tribute to the memory of Chadwick Boseman in the process.We rejoin Shuri (Letitia Wright) and Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) in the techno-futuristic African country of Wakanda as they mourn the loss of Prince T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) after he dies of a mysterious ailment. As the country comes to grips with the loss of their charismatic leader, new threats start to emerge from the woodworks, chief among them a winged mer-man ""Namor"" (Tenoch Huerta) who seems to represent a hidden Meso-American tribe with access to ungodly amounts of Vibranium, who doesn't seem to have peaceful co-existence on his agenda. How Wakanda handles this disruptive change to the global power structure forms the rest of the story.Tenoch Huerta is an absolute revelation as ""Namor"", a winged mutant superhero based in the depths of the ocean, a Marvel Comics creation that came much before DC Comics' ""Aquaman"", in 1939, created by writer-artist Bill Everett. Kevin Feige and the think tanks at Marvel brilliantly reconned his origin story from Greek origins based in Atlantis to Meso-American heraldry that achieved the proverbial ""hitting two birds with one stone"" bullseye. Not only does it expand the universe to represent Latin American culture and sensibilities, but it also neatly avoids comparisons with DC's Jason Momoa-led ""Aquaman"" franchise.With stunning imagery, dance and musical numbers and moving farewell and tribute sequences, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" will be enshrined as a fitting farewell to Chadwick Boseman, who reflected everything expected of a true superhero even in his real life, by bravely fighting cancer. With the introduction of Dominque Thorne aka ""Iron Heart"" and the revelation of ""Namor"" as MCU's second mutant after ""Ms Marvel"", the film also serves up the promise of a mouth-watering upcoming Phase 5 as vaunted Phase 4 draws to a close. ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is now playing in a theatre near you and is highly recommended!","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

After T'Challa dies of a disease despite Shuri's (Letitia Wright) attempt to find a cure from some 'heart shaped herb' the world becomes interested in getting its hands on vibranium. An attempt to take vibranium by force fails but awakes an underwater group of super humans who hold Wakanda responsible and a battle between the 2 powers begins.There is quite a lot to admire in this spectacular sequel which though is delivered as a rather sad epitaph to T'Challa - there are very few laughs here. It is impressive, effects wise, although we are accustomed to that now and the performances particularly from Angels Bassett are solid. I also liked that like the first film there is a blurring around who is bad and who isn't and that this time the Americans are all shown as crazed republicans deciding vibranium must belong to them because they're American - a nice touch.However, there are things that I wasn't keen on, namely:

It's a new popular trend of 2022 that all superhero movies must be disappointing. Thus, Wakanda Forever is quite a refreshingly good experience albeit not perfect. First of all, let's address an elephant in a room - Massive Opportunity! In the world of grievance and discontent to have a strong emotional story about loss and healing is an instant money cow.Many already know the story of making this movie. First Black Panther movie was a major success, script was already done for the second one when Chad died and then Covid happened. What an opportunity! Since this movie already had dozens of millions of people emotionally connected why on earth one would add to already packed story additional story of search for cure, death, grievance, loss, and a need for a new hero without extending it to two movies?At the end - it is a good, emotional movie with a good message. A bit too packed, a bit too little time to develop and tell the story of all the different characters... But it is what it is... Afterall everyone involved in this project quite literally had to deal with as much drama as there in the actual movie.Even from financial perspective it would have been much better idea to shoot 2 movies back-to-back consuming only 15-20% more budget, and doubling the revenue! In hindsight - most MCU movies faced delays or had to be pushed due to Covid. If important character arcs had extra 5 mins to develop the story better, the first half of the story would have been an easy box office success in 2021. And the second event more in 2022. It quite literally had Avengers Infinity War & Endgame potential. Good movie, but a bit of a wasted opportunity.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Great acting from Tenoch, Letitia and Angela, great characters, great acting, but there are some flaws, such as not ending the secondary topic in the same movie to be used in the third part of the movie. Letitia's body doesn't feel like that of a superhero, so she has to work on some issues in the final scene. That's why I gave it a rating of 8 out of 10.

The highlight is the special effects, which are stronger than any Marvel film to date. Of course Chadwick Boseman is sadly missed, but that was outside of anyones control. Shuri's attempt to deal with her loss and grief, resonates with anyone who has lost a loved one. Her growth, and her decisions are both admirable and understandable. A triumphant return for Black Panther, and a formidable introduction for Namor. Wakanda remains strong and protected!","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

Even then with it not finishing phase 4 but as a stand alone movie it feels just good and that's it. There are some cool moments like when entering Talokan or Namor's back story (Namor was the best part, if you can't tell) however when spread across a 2hr 40min runtime there's some slow moments. But then I dont know what would be cut if the runtime had to be cut down so I'm sure if the runtime is justified.Everything else in the movie was good, that's it just good (except Ironheart girl who sucks and Namor who's great) I just loved Namor from his motive to how he moves like he's running through air with his winged feet. In the end it just a movie with a good villain with just good enough everything else.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

Tenoch Huerta played Namor as the antagonist in Wakanda Forever pretty good as he imposed a threat to Wakanda and the people of it.

We'll probably watch it again at home at some point in the future, maybe a second watch will keep my interest.All in all it was disappointing, maybe I was expecting too much?","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

To be honest they could of shortened a good chunk of the film. Scenes would drag on to the point where I almost fell asleep. HOWEVER there are more pros than cons. The tribute of Chadwick Boseman was excellent, however I wish that the tribute could of been a bit longer. The action was very intense and fun to watch, it could of had a bit more action tho. Letitia Wright played an excellent role in the film, and did a magnificent job as Black Panther. You will definitely go through many emotions watching the film. I would definitely recommend the film, it's a must watch!!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

If I didn't have the subtitles on I would have missed about 200 words or even entire phrases. It seemed that the movie was more about costume changes, make up, and different hair styles in almost every scene. Even that part was unbelievable! Also, the cameo with Anderson Cooper from CNN just about ruined it for me. Stick with super hero movies Marvel! This was not good at all. I'll watch every other Avenger movie at least 3 times, but I'll never watch this one again.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

And also Namor steals the show, I don't have a high expectations about Namor, but it in this movie Tenoch Huerta plays Namor incredibly. Some of the scene kinda actually boring but overall I really enjoy this movie. I love how the studios change the origin of Namor , this good decision make BP 2 become rich of culture. We can see the beautiful race between Wakanda and Talocan. I hope in the next Phase MCU focusing on writing their movie instead of fanservice.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I still would've recast it, but for what they chose to do it was done well. Namor was done well and I like the spotlight it gave on Ramonda. I think Ironheart was just thrown into the plot for the sake of the show that's coming up about her, for the sake of not having a 3-hour movie that whole part would be the part I'd cut. Overall an excellent way to cap off a mostly mediocre phase 4 of Marvel by throwing one last good movie into the mix.

"A big challenge that Ryan Coogler overcame!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8694023/?ref_=tt_urv","lugoshendra","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur159194323/?ref_=tt_urv","25 November 2022","A big challenge that Ryan Coogler overcame!I want to start by saying I haven't been the biggest fan of this Phase 4 by Marvel that started with Black Widow in 2020, it's been hit & miss for me so I was nervous for the sequel to Black Panther. I'm happy to report that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a success. I think Ryan Coogler and his team hit a home run with Wakanda Forever by paying tribute to Chadwick Boseman and moving the story forward respectfully.I won't go into spoilers, but the movie starts with an emotional bang. Wakanda Forever builds on the great fondation that was established in the first Black Panther, a visual feast with breathtaking production design, fantastic costumes and impressive action sequences. The music from Ludwig Goransson is once again phenomenal, he creates a signature to this film that gives us the iconic sound of Wakanda while incorporing new themes for this sequel.Similar to the first film with Wakanda, there's a lot of world-building with the newly introduced Namor and the underwater world. This allows director Ryan Coogler to let his vision shine on the screen, it's spectacular to look at and the way they filmed the underwater sequences was truly astonishing. Ironically, most of superhero movies depend on their villains in order to succeed, they nailed it with Killmonger and what they did here is just as good, if not better.I don't think it's a perfect film, with a hefty runtime of 161 minutes, there are some moments that were dragging in the middle for me, but I think it was necessary for this film to be a bit longer than usual. Every character has their shining moments, Shuri is at the heart of this movie but Nakia, Okoye, M'Baku and Queen Ramonda all get their shining moments and a solid story arc that is rewarding by the end, so I don't really have an issue with the movie being this long.I have some other nitpicks that are spoiler-y, so I cannot really discuss them at the time. Everyone's motivation is clear and the main story is so engaging that I didn't really care for Marvel doing their usual ""laying the ground for the future"" stuff with certain characters (without getting into details). However, I can say that Namor was a terrific character, I absolutely love what they did with him storywise and visually. He absolutely slays during the action sequences, Tenoch Huerta is a great actor that fits the role perfectly, no surprise with the spot-on Marvel casting there.This is a movie to see on the big screen, without a doubt this is the best film the MCU has delivered in the Phase 4. The scale is epic but the film feels very intimate and personal because of what happened with Chadwick. The fact that they incorporated his passing into the story beautifully was so important & crucial. Ryan Coogler is probably the best director working for Marvel right now and I'm very excited to see what he does next after this big win.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is coming from someone who thinks the first Black Panther was boring to the point of falling asleep. I think that Marvel has not produced a single good movie in a couple of years, and that all TV shows except for perhaps Ms Marvel have been abysmal failures.This however was on par with Marvel's middle works and this far outshines the first black panther.Not to say this movie does not have many issues. The CGi is still lacking. Marvel used to be the best in the business and if you go back watching the first Iron Man, that computer graphic still holds up today so we know they can do better -- so it highly annoys me that they cannot put in that effort with their latest movies. The female scientific team's sudden scientific solution creating a couple of super-women is very contrived. Speaking of; the over-focus on women is almost bordering on laughable. Everyone is a woman in this movie, except for Namor who also happens to be the best character of the movie... go figure... My final main complaint is the ending, which I am not going to spoil, but again a bit too contrived and a couple of too much moments. I do have a lot of minor complaints too, but nothing that really ruins the movie.With that said Namor is an excellent new character. Just as antagonistic, royal and painfully obnoxious as he is in the comics, although his background story is a bit changed here so a few might complain about that. The acting is great by all involved, and I was definitely not bored. This is mid-tier Marvel and as such I tentatively recommend it.I give the movie a 6/10 and although you can find things to complain about I have to say decent job Marvel, at least this was entertaining...let us hope your slump is now over.","9 out of 30 found this helpful.

The film surprises with great footage and a great villain. Namor is introduced in this film, he is a villain that suits the protagonist very much. His motivations are OK (nothing like Thanos' motivations in Infinity War). For our protagonist we have Shuri interpreted by Letitia Wright. Unfortunately for Chadwick Boseman's death, Letitia is put in place. By the exchange the film becomes of origin and a little confused in this matter. Shuri will never be better than King T'Challa.In conclusion, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a good movie but the confusion and lack of Chadwick make the movie worse. One of the best films of phase four.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Sadly, these problems are very noticeable in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.The movie itself seems to be a good tribute with great music and costumes. I remember the first movie got a lot positive comments about the visuals except the final battle. Here bad CGI is cover by a layer of dark colors. All CGI animals are dark and bland. The result of it is miserable because Wakanda is beautiful but not in BP2, and Namor's home is awful (Atlantis in Aquaman movie is full of colors - ironically, MCU is dark, not DC).Making an overlong movie wasn't a good decision because the story doesn't bring interesting things on the table. Many scenes area unnecessary or boring. The cast seems okay with Angela Bassett as the MVP. A man starring as Namor is good as well. However I don't see him as a better villain/anti-hero than Killmonger. His motivation seems childish or like a caveman. The script doesn't allow the cast to make them full - I find 3 characters are wasted and another 2 are here just to connect Wakanda to big Marvel lore which is empty. I want to say Riri Williams aka new Iron Man is introduced very badly because her presence makes unlikeable. I know some people like her because she is so cool etc but she killed cops and nothing happens.... Ryan Coogler wrote a bad script.The third act is very simple and doesn't land as something we all gonna remember. This mini review doesn't contain spoilers so I will describe it as cheap, lazy, naive and unsatisfying climax. There is one mid-credit scene which makes me sure to forget this movie and wait for Black Panther 3.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

But in this movie? All I wanted was for it to be over and move on.I'm not looking forward for the next black panther movie that's for sure.. As for phase 5 of mcu we'll see but it doesn't look great from this phase at least..","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

While most of the fibers in my body really dislike the direction Marvel are heading with there story telling and character progression, does that mean this is a bad film?Black Panther Wakanda Forever is definitely not a movie I would consider in the top bracket of the MCU franchise but neither does it sit at the bottom, there is definitely alot of tidying up to do before Marvel releases another banger. I wont hold my breath.Thumbs up for the tribute to the Chad.I cant dislike this film but I sure don't love it.5.5 out of 10.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The main problem as I see it was the length - more than 2 and a half hours. I think this suffered from too little editing. Cutting it maybe a half hour or 45minutes would have tightened up the story and hopefully eliminated the crap, and maybe left us a better movie. I was disappointed that the script was so weak. Angela Bassett was a stand out in all her scenes - no surprise there - but her fellow actors were kind of left in the dust. Unfortunately, the film makers tried to prop up the film with some CGI, but it fell flat. My opinion - best part of the film was the beginning memorial to Chadwick Boseman. Wakanda Forever suffered greatly from the lack of his presence. With Chadwick I believe this might have been a much more compelling film.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The Oscars are piling up to give awards for increasingly weak films. A too long and boring movie, honestly, not quite as bad as Black Adam, but close. Good CGI, cute costumes, silly story. Maybe a story that takes into account the realities as an accepted consequence of history, not as cheap propaganda, would really help movies like this. I, for one, am a bit bored. As I said, the story doesn't even help the cause, it just sometimes becomes annoyingly repetitive in promoting some political ideas that are absolutely out of step with reality. The fun part was stripped out, shadowed by propaganda.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It tries really hard to force many uninteresting stories !The lead actors were unable to really cary the story . It feels very much like an episode of a series where the lead actors are on vacation and the supporting cast steps in to tell the story - which is understandable due to the absence of Chadwick. The movie goes to great lengths to honour Chadwick , which is commendable ,but lingers a little too long , 3 ardeous hours too long. In my humble opinion , I feel a more appropriate way to honour the brillance of the man would simply have been to make a better movie . Sadly this just doesnt cut it and that is the REAL tragedy of this movie.The story drags and the action is a bit of a yawn to be honest. I dont understand how you can go from creating Avengers Endgame , possibly one of the greatest action flicks of recent times , to this half baked attempt ; possibly one of the worst movies of recent times . It is truly really puzzling!The final nail in the snoozefest cofin is the villain who is a merman Aztec from the deep sea for some reason ? Without giving away any spoilers , the action sequences which follow after the introduction of this character are truly laughable.All in all its long ,boring , unintersting , muddled, confusing and quite frankly a huge let down. The most interesting 5 minutes is when Michael B Jordon makes an appearance. His cahrisma and screen prescence instantly elevates the material , albeit briefly.In my opinion save yourself 3 hours of agony , honour Chadwick and go watch the first Black Panther to get your action fix !","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

All of the actors delivered strong performances, with Letitia Wright as Shuri standing out for her good humor and heart.However, the writing wasn't as strong as it could've been and the fight scenes were nothing really special. The CGI was also a bit underwhelming, to be completely honest.Overall, I'd say it's worth checking out for the strong performances from the cast, but don't go in expecting it to be as good as the first ""Black Panther.""

Nonsensical & difficult to follow; except the French are bad?I dunno. Was lost after a few minutes. I can understanding the opening tribute, but the real life loss of Chadwick has been allowed to affect the fantasy resulting in confusion. The script was tripping over itself to tie up loose ends & in doing so created more confusion.There is also the issue of agendas & accessibility. In my opinion, comic book fantasy adaptations shouldn't be geared for a specific race & the Black Panther films are. The Blade trilogy, for example, was about a lead black super hero, but at no time do these films alienate others. They weren't made primarily for an African American audience & the fact the Black Panther films have been is alarming & creepy; especially as they appropriate pseudo sub Saharan culture to do so. There's something off about that.Anyway. I'm sure a film adaptation of Black Panther could be done much better, with more warmth. You can't promote Western multiculturalism whilst inflating a story about a single race super country.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

My Rating 5/10I really enjoyed the original Black Panther and gave it a resounding 9/10 but as often happens with sequels , they usually fail . Especially sequels without its original charismatic hero in this case Chadwick Boseman who played King T'Challa.Of course if Chadwick Boseman had still been alive I'm certain that he would have repeated his famous role and the script would have been better for it.Wakanda Forever commences with the funeral and mourning for T'Challa and then descends into cliche after cliche and unlike the original lacks any originality in my opinion.We have the kidnapping T'Challa's sister Princess Shuri and heir to the throne of Wakanda by one of the most lacklustre villains I've seen in a while named Namor .Namor is an aquatic man who literally flys down the street with wings on his feet.Perhaps under the sea is a new wave in SciFi fantasy with Avatar The Way of Water due out this month I hope that sequel is better than this one.British actor Martin Freeman plays only stands out because he is one of the few caucasian white actors in the film not for his performance as Everett Ross he could have Zoomed his role in as it's just silly.I think just keep it to the 2 fantasy Kingdoms and leave Earth out of it as we're in such a mess of our own .Then of course there's the obligatory battle of two civilisations fighting for the ""precious "" in this case a valuable commodity called Vibranium so it's a no brainer why Vibranium is so valuable?I left before the ending of this 2 hour 41 minute mind numbing overlong saga without really being interested who won the war as not one character really interested me .You can have the best CGI technology and it's impressive in Black Panther Wakander Forever but if you don't have a great screenplay or characters that resonate with your audience it's not a pleasant viewing experience in my view.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think for most people, the attraction of the MCU has faded. It's not surprising after the over saturation of the content over the past few years. I think last year there were six tv shows and four movies. And honestly, I've never been a huge fan of the characters. But I have to admit that there are two things that Marvel does well...emotionally resonant scenes and big action. Wakanda Forever had both. It was far too long, and I think this was affected by the premature death of Chadwick Boseman. It was hard to balance an emotional story of farewell to that character with an absurd one of fish-people being angry with Wakanda. This leads me to my biggest problem with the portrayal of Wakanda, and the fish people in the MCU. Vibranium is supposed to give both countries this amazing technological advantage over the rest of the world to the extent that major powers like the US are afraid of Wakanda, and yet when they actually do fight-their warriors line up in ranks like it's 1435. Where are the tanks? The heavy guns? The missiles? They do have jet like things. It just seems like strategically, if the Wakandans every did go to war with a country like the US, it would be a massacre. And the fish people are even worse. They have no advanced technology whatsoever. And yet they are able to catch Wakanda by surprise. While it was an enjoyable watch, it was too long.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Many have spoken about the length of the movie - 2 hours and 47 minutes, including all the credits - that's just 40 minutes longer than it should have been.It was appropriate to have a part of the movie paying homage to a talented actor that had tragically passed away. He made the first movie the success it was. The weight of carrying such a heavy storyline was not handled well though - I think that the guy that played Abaku (sorry, spelling etc.) should have been given a bigger role in this movie. The focus moving to the sister was a mistake in my opinion. Then, the story line itself - just WOW. I'm not going to do spoilers in this review, but all I can say about the purpose of this story is that it was so thin that it was basically pointless. I can't say more than that. This movie was for die-hard fans of the franchise. It was not a story worth the time it took to tell. I'd have preferred if they just did a documentary out of the loss of an actor that is important to this franchise. The ending twist was a nice twist - I wish the entire movie was more about that - it would have had amazing potential. As it is, if you're looking for proper entertainment from a MCU movie - look elsewhere.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

He was the centre and focus for the original Black Panther movie. None of this cast have been able to fill that void. Angela Bassett tries her best but its just not enough. The token white guy also felt like he was included purely to put a checkmark on the old ""acceptance criteria"" and nothing more. He added absolutely nothing to the story beyond that. The painfully low budget was also in evidence throughout with weak CGI and one of the worst matte painting effects I've seen in recent years. A very weak movie in the franchise unfortunately.

Why are we making indigenous people out to be the (misguided) villains? It was painful to cheer for either side and everyone is just broken and sad. Total waste of a fantastic (mostly female) cast. I disagree with other reviews that Shuri couldn't hold the main character role. I instead think she suffered from bad writing and a lack of focus. Her development is an afterthought and happens solely through the lens of grief. The first movie did so much to uplift people.

I watched BP2 now on my laptop, scared how even more lame it would have been if I've had watched it at the movies. Acting, dialogs, scenery, cgi, music and overal white generated black legacy is beyond cringe. There's a meme going round saying all new Marvel movies look like Spy Kids movies and this one really proves it. Just wow. I'm not nostalgic over RDJ and early marvel and all that, but how convenient is the realisation that Endgame really was the end game. Nobody wants this conversation, but this one... Yes, very bad movie.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I hope they can find their footing again and make more memorable and amazing movies for us to all enjoy.

Slow in a lot of places and some over doing over the sentiment (which dominates the narrative). It's very touching but bogs down a story that isn't particularly interesting and is filled by characters who are oddly unlikable or well rounded given the amount of time the film seems to devote to character development. For an aspect of the marvel universe that was well established in previous phases I found myself not caring about the fate of Wakanda or the main characters.Another poor entry in this phase of the Marvel universe Which is falling far short of its prequel phases. There should be no Oscar/ award buzz linked to this film. It just isn't very good.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Its as if no one is willing to say the obvious, namely that this movie is just not that good (like almost all of Phase 4). Ultimately I think everyone at Marvel struggled to deal with Boseman's death and how to pay tribute without allowing his death to overshadow the entire movie. I would point to one user's comment that they should have waited longer but of course Marvel cant do that. My $0.03 (inflation you know) would be to pass it on by if you didnt like Phase 4.

When done well they give a natural immersion and make the experience more engaging. When done poorly you feel like an idiot who's paid to watch someones home movies.Depth perception can come from a number of cues. Parallax is the primary one that stereoscopic movies aim to achieve. Other cues can be given in 2D movies such as perspective, focus, shadow and texture.The videography of Wakanda Forever unfortunately used a camera with a very limited depth of field (likely to make heavy use of focus as a cue for depth). A short depth of field does not work with a stereoscopic film. When I watch a 3D movie, I want to be able to have my eyes freely roam the scene for visuals in both the near and far fields. In order to do this a long depth of field is necessary. The non-action scenes in Wakanda Forever felt like a constant battle between the stereographic videographers telling me to relax and enjoy and look around and the 2D videographers going ""Hey I can be 3D too, if you just look where I tell you.""
It was a technical debacle and I really wish someone could have explained things to the producer so that it didn't end up being a conflict between pet projects.Oh and I think it wasn't too bad a movie apart from that, but may have been too distracted too tell.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

This does not feel like a cohesive Marvel movie, screenplay was slow as well.However, acting was above par, action set pieces were well done however they were far in-between, post credit scene just fulfils the emotional connect required for the memorial to come full circle.The pacing is what is killed the movie otherwise it would have been a fitting tribute.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie is nominated for 5 awards, some more deserved than others in my opinion. The awards are; best supporting actress, visual effects, best original song, costume design and make-up and hairstyling.What a snore to get through. Wakanda Forever feels like one of the most forgettable movies I´ve seen in a while with what feels like no heart or soul put into it. I´ll give them one thing: it´s hard moving on when tragedy strikes. I think none of us expected Chadwick Boseman to lose his life so soon, and it can sadly throw off a lot of industry work and planning. Of course, respect, human life and mourning comes first, and this movie handles that aspect with some respect but clearly then had to fill out the rest of it´s runtime with mediocre things. Boseman will be missed. Also why is there two movies in the Oscars this year with blue people living underwater?In the wake of T´Challas passing. Everyone is mourning and the new leader of Wakanda is crowned. The rest of the world is looking to obtain vibrainium and they are finding sources outside of Wakanda. It´s guarded by a tribe of people, now going to war with the surface world. It´s up to Shuri to make peace in Wakanda again.The CGI is not great here. Some aspects look fine like cities and underwater stuff but some of the models to later robots look so bad. It was so obvious it was fake. The villain also moves in a very unnatural way. I don't know if they had him on wires, but he looked very wired in post.The editing is fine until the last half of the movie. It has to cut between different battle scenarios, and it does this in a very unsatisfying and jarring way. The final battle is really hard to follow. The action within the scenes are fine but my eyes could simply not follow what was going on. The funniest thing that happened was something that annoyed my eyes and then I noticed it. It thought something looked weird in the final battle and it´s because the aspect ratio is changing. It looks so unnatural, and the movie does not pull something like that off. It comes of as pretentious and too much. The color grading for the final fight also looks laudably cheap, like a fan film. The final fight of this movie is in general a big mess.There is a lot of songs used for this movie and at the end it felt extremely obnoxious. It came of as a beg for being nominated for best original song, just one of the 4 songs. While the songs are good and fits the movie, I would rather just have the incredible score. The songs really take over towards the end and to me, it really just came off as too much.The score in this movie is the best part of it. It sounds so unique and experimental. It feels like the movie has its own identity all of a sudden and the use of instruments not often heard is so good. I really loved this score to bits and vibed throughout the entire movie.The idea for the plot is fine, but it comes of as very uneventful, boring, and even a bit pointless. The entire conflict of this movie fells very stupid. It feels like a problem that doesn't need to be there and the villain and heroes' reasons to not solve the conflict and their ways of solving the conflict seem dumb and without reason.There are not really any characters that stand out to me. The two new main characters in this movie has no personality at all. Shuri fells like a really empty character and nothing like her prior incarnation. The new added girl character also really ads nothing but conflict and an empty performance. The acting overall is fine but nothing that I found noteworthy.The action seemed really mind numbing and without many stakes, highs, and lows. I felt very passive watching it and like no one was in real danger. In general, I felt very passive and like I tuned out of this movie. It felt like just flashing colors on the screen and I never really connected to the story at any time. While there was fun to be had and interesting things to see, it overall left me feeling nothing.I could not take the villain serious in this movie. They try to make him serious and cool, and his performance is good, but his design and powers made me laugh every time. It´s hard to translate a goofy character like this well, and to me they did not sell him to me.The costume design is so good here. Every character feels and looks distinct, and it carries over the tradition from its predecessor. It´s well detailed and amazing looking costumes.This could easily had been an incredible movie. It was all down to focus and even an obvious one right in front of you. This could have been a movie about mourning and finding your identity. It could have been a movie about traditions against innovations, but this movie plays it so safe it won't allow you to feel. The aspects mentioned are in the movie but on such a surface level it ends up meaning nothing.Now I was so afraid on how they would handle Boseman´s passing and every time the movie was about to do something that could have been a respectless disaster to me, I cringed in fear. Luckily the movie plays this safe, UNTIL THE AFTERCREDITS. You might not have taken offense to what happened, and I understand that but to me, it was incredibly cringe and me and my girlfriend sat in disbelieve.This was a movie I sat through not really registering what was being presented. It was boring and uninteresting and without any form of substance. I just tuned out and was never really moved or engaged throughout the entire runtime.Oscar predictions: So this movie is nominated in 5 categories and let´s take them one at a time. It can take costume design for me, but I think it has some tough competition from movies like Babylon and Elvis. I don´t want it to take makeup and hairstyling as I think 3 movies nominated in this category displays the use of prosthetics and makeup better, and The Whale and Batman is probably in the forefront there. Original song is very tough this year and I don´t know if Rihanna can take it over Gaga, the song was also fine, nothing too special. If Wakanda Forever wins best visual effects I would laugh, and it´s going to lose to Avatar. And my hottest take, I don´t see Angela Bassetts performance as anything special. It´s good, don't get me wrong but nothing that really touched me. Two speeches were good, and the rest was just there. I personally think Dania Gurira as Okoye did a better job in this movie. I know Bassett is in the lead right now, but I would rather have Stephanie Hsu win for Everything Everywhere all at Once for what I´ve seen of the nominated supporting actresses and I could imagen I would want either Hong Chau or Kerry Condon to win when I see their performances in the Whale and Banshees respectively.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

You didn't need to remember the back stories of half a dozen characters. You could sit in the cinema with your 11 year old and they wouldn't be telling you they're bored after 30 minutes. Remember when iron man went super high and froze up? There's a bit of that in wakanda Forever. Remember when Dr Strange met a teenager with a fantastic gift and had to protect her? There's a bit of that in wakanda Forever. Remember when Eddie Murphy came to New York with his chaperone? There's a bit of that in wakanda Forever. I half expected Eddie to pop up in a barber shop in heavy prosthetics. I get the need to address the passing of Chadwick Boseman he was a fantastic actor and perfect as the black panther, but the bit about death being a gateway between revenge and forgiveness is well overdone. It didn't feel like a 2h43 movie but considering the source material this is more for middle aged men to pick over than any previous Marvel outing to date. That being said I'm sure Ant-man Quantamania will be choc full of fan service.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

He was a wonderful actor and a great 'Black Panther'; I don't think anyone can replace him as the defacto idea of that character now. That being said: the film, due to his untimely death, had to be rewritten and had reshoots apparently left and right to complete. You can feel it in the writing and in the story of the film. Plot points that either don't make sense or don't go anywhere. There is an actual point in the film where characters argue about not having time to do something that could have stopped the entire final act of the film, but they spend more time arguing about NOT having time than just simply DOING the thing and moving on. It was utterly pointless and stupid. There's so much fluff in the film too. Little scenes and dialogue that isn't needed and so many scenes of a character simply so they can introduce her on her own show (and she's not even that likeable of a character; they could have done better on all fronts there).

While the costume design stands out, the film falls short in storytelling and execution.The plot, centered around Shuri taking up the Black Panther mantle, lacks the depth and gravitas expected from a Marvel installment. Instead of exploring the richness of Wakanda's culture, the narrative veers towards teenage drama, diluting the impact of the iconic superhero legacy.New characters, introduced with a Nickelodeon flair, feel more like caricatures than well-developed additions. The attempt at humor often falls flat, relying on juvenile gags that undermine the weight of the challenges faced by Wakanda. The film struggles to strike a balance between engaging a younger audience and delivering a compelling storyline.Visually, the attempt to infuse Wakanda with a vibrant Nickelodeon aesthetic clashes with the established tone of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The result is a jarring blend that fails to capture the essence of the original ""Black Panther"" film. The action sequences lack the sophistication expected, resembling more of a cartoonish spectacle than a superhero epic.The soundtrack, while lively, doesn't salvage the overall disappointment. The music feels disconnected from the narrative, failing to enhance emotional beats or elevate key moments. It becomes evident that the filmmakers prioritized style over substance, leaving audiences wanting more substance from a Marvel film.The saving grace lies in the costume department's commendable work. The outfits seamlessly blend tradition and modernity, offering a visual treat that remains consistent with the established Wakandan aesthetic. Unfortunately, the stunning costumes can only do so much to salvage a film that falls short in crucial storytelling aspects.In the end, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" feels like a missed opportunity to delve into the richness of Wakanda and uphold the legacy of its predecessor. The attempt to cater to a teenage audience with a Nickelodeon touch undermines the potential for a sophisticated exploration of themes and characters. While the costumes shine, they can't rescue a film that disappoints in delivering the depth and resonance expected from a Marvel cinematic experience.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I like the comic book character and think that he was a great addition to the marvel movies. This movie should have continued with the black panther despite the death of the lead character. His family even requested it and the studio should have agreed, because this movie was not any good. Story pelt weak and long and drawn out. The princess is a good character but not the lead, which is why they needed a black panther character. Not to say it needed to be a male role but just someone with a commanding presence. As for Wakanda itself, I have always had a problem why it had to be in Africa and not on some remote island, like Wonder Woman. To have a society that is superiors with technology, wealth, medical, and weapons be in a continent that has such a bad history of poverty and genocide just seems far from reality and selfish. It's not as if they discovered the metal, it was from an asteroid. Not sure they should continue this character now, even in Avenger movies as it lost a lot of credit from this mess.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The film, however, produced a war between two clear minorities. Is this to show that the white majorities are victims, safe, innocent? If so, it is disappointing.Perhaps Marvel wanted to portray the Mayans as savages, as the ones wanting to chase an American ""scientist"" because they wanted to destroy the world, sounds feasible.Yet the ""American"" (from the US) scientist is a teenager and a vulnerable person. Other than that, she plays no major role in the plot.The hero is a confused teenager as well. The heiress to a kingdom who can only find resolution via revenge. Revenge against a power that only wants to protect their own world.Whoever wrote the script for this did not deserve whatever money they got. The plot is absolutely hollow and pointless. There are no heroes, nor are there any villains.A complete waste of time and effort as a viewer. Marvel is really hitting rock bottom now.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is where the next problem rears it's head in that the film is an ungodly length, without truly the substance to sustain such a runtime. While the avengers films were long they had justified reasoning. Still, the actress for Shuri had much on her shoulders to helm the Black Panther moniker, and should be commended.

But progressively shifted in this aggressive Wakandan ego trip with the vilainization of a civilization, which, while going through same hurts and issues, is painted as less smart, more wild, and to be tamed population. Along that Shuri is almost becoming dictatorial, way past a vengeance storyline, becoming hard to even like. All making it feel like a very strange and uncomfortable to watch race war between these two nations. And Namor who is a prominent Marvel character becomes this unlikeable, weak-minded, and unsettling one that doesn't fit into the MCU, certainly not as an Avenger or Illuminati... And some characters should have gotten more of a development like MBaku.

Certainly feels like it.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9069609/?ref_=tt_urv","Pjtaylor-96-138044","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26820801/?ref_=tt_urv","21 May 2023","If it feels as though this has a gaping hole where its heart should be, that's because it does. The tragic real life death of Chadwick Boseman looms over every second of 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)', leaving an indelible mark on a story which was originally supposed to centre entirely around his iconic character. Director Ryan Coogler and co have, in the face of an almost impossible task, crafted an experience that's very much designed around his absence, one which directly tackles his death by inextricably tying it into its narrative. The filmmakers obviously had a massive challenge on their hands. They needed to not only craft a compelling experience that's both entertaining and emotionally resonant, but also respectfully provide a suitable replacement for Boseman who can take up the Black Panther mantle in future sequels. They had to do this this in a fairly tight timeframe, while also radically altering their initial plans and grappling with their own unexpected loss of a colleague and friend as they continued work on a film that he should have been a part of. Plus, they had to transpose their own pain onto the characters, be it from a writing or performance point of view, which can't have been an easy thing to do. This, of course, is an unenviable task, so I can't blame them too much for the perhaps unsurprising fact that they don't really succeed in doing what they set out to. The end result of their admirable effort is, sadly, underwhelming.Overlong and largely uninspired, this laboriously paced picture feels extremely flat. Picking up a year after King T'Challa's off-screen passing, it finds its characters struggling to contend with Wakanda's new place in the world while grieving the loss of their beloved Black Panther. Soon, a new threat emerges from the ocean: Namor, who hails from a watery Wakandan counterpart known as Talokan, flies up to the Queen on his little ankle wings and demands an alliance in his upcoming war with the surface, lest there be dire consequences. The narrative is mostly concerned with Shuri's attempts to maintain peace between the two kingdoms, while also protecting a young inventor who has been targeted by Talokan assassins for reasons I won't get into. It attempts to examine the moral complexities that come with ruling an entire country, while also constantly commenting on the grief that overshadows its plot's events and the ways in which it affects the core characters. However, the flick is generally thematically weak and it isn't even all that moving. There are some emotionally resonant moments, don't get me wrong, but the mournful, generally bleak tone doesn't lend itself to this sort of story, especially since it continues into the action sequences. The slower pace doesn't lead to introspection, it simply saps almost all the energy from the affair. To be honest, it's all just a bit dull. Some of its scripting is notably bad, too. The set-pieces aren't even all that exciting, with the climax being especially disappointing in that regard. There's no real charisma to any aspect of the production, even though a lot of it is undeniably well achieved, and the whole thing just leaves you feeling deflated.That's not the intention, either. This is primarily a movie about grief and processing loss, but it isn't intended to be a wholly downbeat experience. It has moments of hope and catharsis, as well as sadness and rage, and it often attempts to deliver the genre thrills expected of it. It seems to be juggling too many things, really, even though it isn't actually all that complex when you think in about it. It's not all bad, though. The performances, for example, are strong across the board, with some notable standouts certifiably commanding the screen on more than one occasion. The film also uses quite a lot of subtitled non-English (including Spanish, French, !Xhosa and Talokanin), which goes hand in hand with its excellent casting of minority actors and leads to a wonderfully inclusive experience. The set and costume design is intricate and vibrant, while the visual effects are mostly engaging (until they're really not). Having said that, the inevitable comparisons between this and 'Avatar: The Way Of Water (2022)' when it comes to their sea-dwelling, whale-riding blue people are certainly not going to be in this movie's favour. Heck, even 'Aquaman (2018)' manages to create a more colourful and compelling underwater world than this does, although the approach is purposefully more muted and, I suppose, realistic here.Overall, although this is an admirable effort, there's very little that truly works about the piece. It has its moments, but mostly it's too long, too bland and too underwhelming for its own good. You kind of get the sense that they should have just left it alone.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Some great characters like killmonger but not a patch on Thor Ragnarok so I can't say I was desperate for this one. Regardless of that I was keen to see this after the initial reviews but having now sat through it I honestly can't find anything about the film which makes it half decent. It's a whole lot of nothing story based around tributes (which I have no problem with) and poor matrix style slow motion action sequences which are over done and board line cheap. The film falls into the recent trend of being a whole lot of film about nothing, I'm personally calling this phase the Snap! Hoping for more with Ant-man as Marvel has started to become the emperors clothes.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

They used to be funny and interesting but they're just not anymore, and this movie just feels empty and lightweight without Chadwick boseman, and Disney knew that, but they didn't care. Otherwise they would have done something like a spinoff series on Disney+. But anyway, the story was uncaptivating and forgettable, like I said it feels empty without Chadwick boseman, and the writing wasn't very interesting to me. I loved the first black panther and wanted to love this one, but the only part I really enjoyed was the music. It was absolutely incredible but not incredible enough to save the movie.

It certainly didn't deserve a stand alone film in my opinion and could have been a 3 part tv show. For comparison, I would have said this was on par with the ms marvel show as that was too very meh.I don't know if it was the directing or just the fact that the female lead just didn't have that certain wow factor. I just personally think the male leads bring more action to the game and being a man that's what I like to see.I found captain marvel was very boring too.If we consider something like Resident evil movies, I found them to very enjoyable. So, it's definitely not the fact that I don't appreciate female lead movies. Perhaps, the chosen actors for leads in majority of marvel movies just don't cut it or the producers don't demand much from them and that's where it lacks; as I imagine they'd push male actors further and get more from them.Anyway, that's my opinion.

First and one of the most sad things was passing of a beloved actor. But i think creators could have come up with better story because story was the most boring part of ""Wakanda Forever"". Also I didn't care about any of characters in the movie, including kind of lackluster villain. Main heroes weren't just to interesting in a first place. Action scenes were generic and have been seen many times. And at running time 2 h 45 min this movie was way to long for the story it wanted to tell - pacing wasn't good either.Overall, ""Wakanda Forever"" was a big disappointment for me.

Yet to ensure the continuation of the kingdom, a successor was required to continue the Black Panther's legacy. In this quest, Shuri's ascent as a young princess and warrior served as the key to the crown. The epic story of Wakanda Forever unfolds before our eyes as Shuri's character grows, revealing her highs and lows along the way. She displays her inner turmoil, her pleasures and sufferings, her worries and concerns as she tries to wear the crown.The movie's finale truly puts a spotlight on Shuri's character development. Our emotions are thrown into a loop as she mulls about the great power that may be hers after consuming the Heart-Shaped Herb. She might have given in to the desire to exact retribution for her brother's passing, but instead she decides to stand up for her people. A success of originality is the scriptwriters' deft treatment of Shuri's story arc as a deep and nuanced portrayal of a young woman's path to self-discovery. Ultimately, the new Black Panther, who has shown herself to be a superb option to accede to the Wakandan kingdom, leaves the audience in wonder and respect.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

The Wakandan experience is so vibrant and full of life, making one only wonder of the amazing possibilities that could exist if we observed life tbe same way as the Wakandan people.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Should this franchise have died with Boseman?That's not meant to be disrespectful, quite the opposite, actually. Boseman was the Panther and beyond just playing the roll, he brought something to it that made it resonate with people. Without him... I just don't think this movie works. There's good stuff here, they doubled down on the cultural significance, which is fantastic. The action and cinematography is better. The music is solid. But I am so often just wishing Boseman was in these scenes, anchoring them and making me care.Its also hard to ignore the strangely pervasive Iron Man influence here. As an Iron Man fan, I should be happy about that, but in reality I found myself asking, ""Seriously? Is this just a requirement now? Anyone with significant tech shows that by building an Iron Man-esque suit?"" Again, I didn't hate this movie but it felt like every time I was starting to enjoy something, there would come a counterweight. That's never more obvious than it is in our primary antagonist, a character I very much like yet, while I appreciate what they were trying to do, I just could not get on board with this interpretation.Ultimately, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever seems like a cast of decent supporting characters desperately seeking a lead. These actors are solid, I know they can do great work, but these characters were seemingly never designed to stand on their own two feet. They were only ever meant to be set dressing, accents and facilitators to the main character's journey. Its clear that Shuri is meant to fill that role, but she doesn't and no amount of quips, one liners or robo-pals will fix that.I'd still say this one is worth a watch, but I really don't see myself going back to it again.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

In 2022's 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,' we see what was likely the best attempt that Ryan Coogler could make to try to redirect the still young franchise in a way that both honored the late star and passed the torch to the next generation.Despite the numerous sentimental homages to the original superhero throughout 'Forever,' the film suffers from 'late-era Marvel-itis' - which is nothing new for the recent crop of movies from the MCU. It's bloated, runs forever and lacks a compelling story. There are too many characters competing for screentime, and the last ~45 minutes feel like they belong in an 'Avatar' sequel (or maybe it's just all the blue people...).Letitia Wright does her best to command the story, but she does not yet have the chops to carry a film of this size on her own. Angela Bassett's spectacular performance overshadows Wright's, and despite some respectable supporting roles from Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o, 'Forever' does not have the same gravitas that its predecessor carried.While it's nowhere near the worst thing Marvel has churned out in the Disney era, 'Wakanda Forever' will be viewed at best as a transitional movie that hopefully sets up events for a more exciting third act.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

So much is included ""because we can"" not because it adds to the story. Spend more time and effort developing characters you can care about. This was so predictable you saw the end after about ten minutes. The only reason I have this a five was the way they dealt with the loss of Chadwick.

I went into 'Wakanda Forever' with no preconceived notion that this movie would be as good as the original, it's not. I really enjoyed 'Black Panther' and when it was nominated I wasn't surprised. There are some incredible actors, Angela(she should have won best sorry Jamie Lee)Bassett, however Chadwick Boseman's presence was sorry missed. It seems to me that they tried to hard to make us accept the fact that he was missing. However I wasn't really fond of Shazam or the last Spider-Man movie. In my opinion the best comic book based movie was Zach Snyder's directors cut of 'Justice League' I haven't seen the new 'Shazam' or the last 'Ant-Man' movie. I guess I am looking for something that isn't being offered in Hollywood anymore, something original.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

While I've always believed the original black panther movie was overrated (mostly because the last 1/4 falls apart) it didn't deserve to be followed up by this money tug at people's hearts.As many other reviews stated it's like the editing department took a vacation on this one.

The mourning that takes place and the segment of the film devoted to, as I see it, the past (T'Challa) is beautiful, well done, and moving.My issue, however, is with everything about the film that ""looks forward"" to the future of Wakanda. Riri Williams is half introduced and then sort of forgotten for a while. Okoye's story starts out fine but then take a bizarre turn that really upset me.Then there's Shuri. Her arc in this movie is IDENTICAL to T'Challa's in Civil War and it's not a good rehash in anyway. They make no effort to build her into a good choice for BP, all they do is make her the only choice.I think Marvel missed a HUGE opportunity to make Ramonda the new Black Panther. She has the fighting skills as a former Dora, she's intelligent, compelling--and how incredible would it have been to see an older woman, a black woman at that, as one of the most badass superheroes in the world? Shurt could have been left to grow and develop a more 3D character to be BP later.... Alas....","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I don't know whether this was the fault of the sound track in the movie, or the particular theater where I watched it. But when there was background music, that seemed to be pretty much normal. So my message to all movie producers and theaters is this: just try to make human voices sound normal and understandable, and forget about trying to manipulate human voices in some way to make them sound more impressive or exciting--it ain't gonna work.

Perhaps it would have been better to scrap it alltogether. On one hand, movies are a business, and after the stellar success of the first, the studio naturally wanted a sequel. An argument can also be made for working a eulogy into the movie an honoring the actor and character this way. On the other hand, working a real life death into a silly Marvel superhero action comedy is nearly impossible to pull off without feeling either tacked on or exploitative. To Marvel's credit, they avoided the latter. The tribute to Bosman felt respectful.It did, however, feel tacked on to a movie that never finds a tonal footing. We go from somber tragedy to silly over the top action and jokes to politics to cgi crapfest. Unlike the first film, which was tonally consistent except for the terribly made monorail fight, the sequel never knows what it wants to be. It feels like the studio was too afraid to do an actual serious, sombre Marvel movie, but also afraid of going too comedic, aka Thor Love and Thunder.They also left very little room for the antagonists, who remain not just underdeveloped but generally aren't very interesting or memorable. A superhero movie stands and falls with its villains, and Wakanda Forever's villains may be the worst ones yet in a Marvel film (yes, worse than Thor 2).Remember the days when Marvel would cast grizzled veteran actors as primary antagonists? Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke, Tim Roth, Kurt Russel, Guy Pierce, etc? They lent a certain level of gravitas to an otherwise forgettable villain. With these newer Marvel films, it's more about giant cartoon physics fights between CGI armies.It's predictable and underwhelming. To date, Marvel Phase 4 hasn't had a good film. They're heading straight for the same ice berg that sank Star Wars.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The film suffers from a number of problems, including a weak story, underdeveloped characters, and inconsistent tone.The film's story is a mess. It's hard to follow what's going on, and the motivations of the characters are unclear. The film also tries to do too much, and it ends up feeling bloated and overstuffed.The characters in the film are also underdeveloped. Letitia Wright's Shuri is the only character who gets any real development, and even her arc is unsatisfying. The rest of the characters are just there, and they don't really do anything.The tone of the film is also inconsistent. The film tries to be both serious and funny, but it doesn't really succeed at either. The serious moments feel forced, and the funny moments fall flat.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a disappointing sequel. It's a mess of a film with underdeveloped characters and an inconsistent tone. Even hardcore fans of the first film will be disappointed.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

It had way more nuance and better acting than the first. Beyond a shadow of a doubt if you put the two films side by side Wakanda is a more mature well developed film, less Marvel and in my mind that could only be a good thing.But it is still Marvel with a lot of silly stuff that does not appeal to me. Silly fight scenes, silly CGI. Actually if I was to take out the first 3 min and just start with the funeral and all those ridiculous fight scenes the film would be 8/10 based on character development, theme and how they handle Chads death. I read so many reviews prior to seeing it (and I was not going to see it) and none of the reviews were accurate. There were no issues with the exposure of the film, or anything else. And most of all I had no issue with the pace, it was not boring although a hair cut would have helped. It explored deeper political themes and minus that Iron Lady was okay. The music was not the best, I do not think the composer was the best. The costumes for Wakanda with the exception of the Queen were terrible. The costumes for the Mesoamericans were very nice.But on a political note it seems Wakanda will fight other oppressed Africans and now oppressed Brown people, everyone but a film where they just fight the real colonizers. That makes no sense, but it obviously has to be like that because the film is owned by White Americans and would be a flop if Wakanda had to fight America or france.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

Unfortunately the actual movie was a mess and I eventually passed out cold. When I woke up I was at best mildly entertained by the climax.What's wrong with the movie?Well, for one, there is no one in the cast who can come close to the screen presence and charisma of the original Black Panther protagonist. I'm sorry if it's inconsiderate, but I just found almost everyone in a major role a drag to watch and listen to. Just very wooden and unappealing.Not that the script gave them much help. Marvel let them almost completely rewrite the Namor character. Not that I particularly like Namor in comics, but this concept wasn't an improvement and like some other characters they seem to use for name recognition only, the concept wasn't an improvement.Not sure what else to say. I wish this had been fun but at best i take it as a warning to exercise caution about any sequels and spinoffs to this one. Not sire why they thought this needed to be over 2 1/2 hours.

Some of the Marvel movies, like Ant Man, Black Panther, and the last two Spiderman have been pretty badly written movies, but they all have a pace and great action that engages the audience. This movie, by the halfway point had a weak skirmish between over matched US Soldiers and Fish People, a weak skirmish between over matched French Soldiers and Spear People, and finally a really run of the mill by-the-numbers ""We have You surrounded!"" scene where three protagonists escape US Soldiers only to face the Fish People. There is one 5 out of 10 level action fight with spears that climaxes this scene. The rest of it...the car chases, the Junior Iron man suit, the drone crashing....all of this stuff was tired lame done better before action.For 90 minutes you watch Angela Bassett overact, Julia Dreyfus badly act, Martin Freeman do nothing. Florence Kasumba does as much as she can with her one dimensional character. Letitia Wright does a pretty good job though. Dominique Thorne I can not decide...did she suck or is the character so contrived, stupid and bad that there was nothing she could do. But it is mostly hokey and horrible. Tenoch Huerta (Prince Namor), good or bad? Competent enough, but the character simply is not Sub-Mariner.And I will say this. Michael B. Jordan's departed Kilmonger is brought back to do a scene in the movie. Watch that scene..it is an example of the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie. This guy literally read his lines about at the competence level of High School Drama production. He is stunningly horrible in this scene.Mainly this is just boring. An extended African send off for the late Chad Boseman, whose tragic death clearly crippled the Black Panther franchise, followed by UN Wakandaphobia, and then Sub Mariner taking Surhi down to Atlantis (10 mintues of floating through underwater Disneyland to bad music)...which isn't Atlantis now because of the horrible mistake of re-imagining one of the oldest best Marvel characters to fit Ryan Cooglers vision of non-white supremacy and conceding 'Atlantis' to DC's Aquaman. A lot of pointless chatter, scenes of people preparing for watever. A bunch of people do bad African accents. None of the dialogue is important and much of it is cliches. Part of the problem is Shuri's character doesn't have another character to bounce her conflicts off of. It probalby should have been Ironheart, but it could have been Namor. It's a miss because the true story is her emergence as the Black Panther and we just watch it...we don't really empathize with her.The second half of the movie comes down to an attempt to recreate the Avengers Age of Ultrom climax fight scene, right down to a bunch of slo-mo co-ordinated fight choreography with all the players 'working together'. I can give credit where it is due, it finally delivers the missing action that we expect from a Marvel epic. But at no point is this battle as good as the epic fights we have seen from the Wakandans in the Avenger Movies and Black Panther 1.I also believe this movie is a bellwether. It is the first time Marvel Studios has made a mistake that Sony and Warners keep making with their Marvel and DC stories. You took one of the best Silver Age characters...Sub Mariner and you rewrote the back story to fit your director's needs. Bad Move. Namor is 'Roman' backward. He wasn't a 'meso American'. The exact thing that made Iron Man and Captain America (and teh first X-Men) work so well was the idea that all you needed to do was follow the Silver Age story. Sony wasted Dr. Doom and Silver Surfer by changing them. DC has done the same with Flash, Atom, Hawkman.I expect this is the start of the decline of Marvel. Silver Age was 1 Million Unit / Month comic books. Those charactes are iconic. Black Panther was one of them. But when you start moving into the 1970s and post that...those comic book characters never had popularity. Nobody cares about 'The Marvels', nobody is going to run out to see Iron Heart with Dom Thorne; and Shuri as Black Panther, or Anthony Mackie as a new Captain America will not have the automatic audience that the original Silver Age characters had. And as we see more efforts by more diverse directors...we are going to get less popular characters being made into movies by people who are just doing a job...they are not particularly enamored of the Comic book genre. (To his credit, Jordan Peele turned down directing one of these movies for that reason, 'Comics are not really my thing')","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We don't know much about her and I frankly don't care. Namor's obsession for killing her make no sense. Destroy the factory that created it! Some company already build the machine so you gain nothing by killing its creator!The FBI agent subplot was a complete filler.

Tenoch Huerta's Namor really saved this movie in my view, being the most compelling character and involved in the best action sequences. I really enjoyed his performance. Letitia Wright was also solid as Shuri and gave a better performance than I expected. Okoye and Ramonda were also commanding. However where things started to get weird and unnecessary was the introduction of Riri Williams. It was utterly distracting and the character felt undeserving...and honestly, not very likeable. The story overall was fine. But that's the problem problem. It was fine and nothing more. Has the MCU magic started to run out? Or is it just a wrong direction that needs quickly course correcting?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The battle between the two countries can be said to be very poor on the screen. As the most powerful country in the world, why do they have to use the most primitive methods to fight a war? The film did show that Wakanda has fighter planes , grenades and other modern weapons, but they didn't use them very often. They said the use of guns is primitive, but isn't it more primitive to use spears and knives? The invention of guns and cannons represents a great progress in the militarization of a country. Fighting with spears does reflect the characteristics of African cultures, but it does not reflect the military modernization even if the spears are more scientific and technological. It combined African culture and high technology very well in other aspects of the film, but not in the war. What puzzles me most is that they couldn't defeat Talocan, which is more technologically backward. And their warships and fighter planes were basically useless. The army didn't have any tactics, just fought hard.Talocan's shape was even worse. They have a very strong military strength, but they just don't want to attack surface world like Ocean Master until Wakanda agrees to form an alliance. Talocan also owned vibranium, but why didn't they use this resource to develop the country's military strength, technology, economy and people's livelihood, but use them to create a huge light bulb? What's even more ridiculous is that Nakia could easily break into their territory and rescue Shuri and Williams. Don't they have patrols to prevent outsiders from sneaking in? I still believe the development of any country should conform to the law of modernization, even this country comes from a world full of superheroes.Namor and Shuri, the logic of their behavior is also very confused. I don't understand why Namor wanted to kill ironheart, vibranium detectors have been invented, which shows that the United States has mastered this technology, and it is useless to kill her. Shuri's mother was killed by Namor, but she chose to forgive him in the end. You gotta be kidding me, is there a man named Neil Druckmann among the screenwriters? Unlike Black Widow, Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman, Shuri is very thin and does not have the strong figure of a female superhero.As for ironheart, she is called a genius without any foreshadowing or portrayal. And I don't see her qualifications as the successor to Iron Man. Even if all the plots about her are deleted, it will not have any impact on the whole movie.Some people think that the film is good because it discusses the themes of colonization and anti-colonization, but there are many unreasonable aspects in the story, the presentation effect is very bad, and the drama is too long to disrupt the rhythm of the film.The reason why the film is bad is that Americans have a wrong understanding of African nations. They still can't jump out of the American way to depict African countries. That's why even though Wakanda is a powerful country, we can still see some backwardness.Wakanda's weapons should be high-tech, obvious characteristics. High quality of the army and high level of national defense. These contents are supposed to be basic settings, but they are presented so terrible.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I think he is an interesting guy. The life underwater was interesting too but i am not sure if it fit this movie and just the overall plot.Im not a fan of this riri williams being introduced this way. A teenage girl that just happen to build a perfectly functional vibranium detector that the goverment used and yet, she is still working in a garage and not in some official goverment labs.Tony did create his outfit in a cave but it was a prototype and it took him some time after to perfected it. And yet riri created this detector in just months? Sure... her appearance is the one that caused this conflict as well. Not sure if its a great introduction to the character. (Not a comic reader so i am oblivious but not sure if I want or need to know anyway).Anyway, the battle is lacklustre, the whole thing is just meh. I like okoye and the end with the flashback did bring me some tear but again, please, have better writer.I went to watch the earlier mcu after (long flight) and wow, I felt there was just this much different.

This film struggled to find its legs due in large part to the writing, which was all over the place when it should have been more focused. The characters themselves made dumb narrative decisions that completely undermined everything they were working towards.

It lacked charisma, spark, soul, or something and it seemed like the death of TaChalla, Black Panther held a pall over the entire production and no amount of CGI, costumes, performance, etc. Could help it.

The funeral scene was touching and Namor was a great villain though I felt this sequel did disservice to what was established. In the first movie, T'Challa promises the world to share their resources and Vibranium. In the sequel. It's like ""Sorry. We're taking back our Vibranium and keeping Wakanda hidden again"". Also, the movie didn't show how Queen Ramonda and Shuri ran Wakanda after T'Challa's passing. Instead, we get a typical comic book revenge story that doesn't go with what's established from the first movie. Ramonda's death had me almost walk out of the theater since she was just introduced. Using that to make Shuri to become Black Panther was not cool. She should have been inspired and motivated by either T'Challa or her father in the Ancestral Plane. Like what was Shuri's relationship with her father like? Even though he covered the story about his brother and Killmonger, he could have been redeemed to tell Shuri to not make the same mistake he did. Instead, we get Killmonger which I know that was out of fanservice to motivate Shuri to take down Namor. I mean didn't T'Challa tell Shuri that you should never vengeance consume you? In conclusion, there were good and bad choices in the movie. Also, no one applauded when I saw the movie three times. Not even when Shuri wore her Black Panther suit. Guess everyone feels the same way. When I first saw the first movie, I walked out overjoyed seeing a landmark film. With the sequel, I walked out saying ""Did we just lose?"" If this movie was to give us closure after Chadwick Boseman's passing, it midly succeeded. Not like how Endgame gave us closure after we lost our main heroes. I didn't feel healed after watching the movie. Shuri was barely healed and she should have closure after seeing her father or T'Challa in the Ancestral Plane. Then she would have been healed including the audience. I didn't feel lifted by Rhianna's song at the end. It felt like a funeral song. I felt Ryan Coogler messed up his characters and needed to rewrite the script more. He's one of my favorite storytellers but needed some help. Killing off the queen was wrong. You could have put her in a coma. Now, Shuri lost her whole family making the whole film depressing. Like in a way, Namor won. He wanted everything to fall even though he wants Wakanda to be his ally. So, yeah. This film is divisive. It's how I felt about Multiverse of Madness. I know most people didn't like Love and Thunder but at least the movie was fun, straight forward and got you pumped to see more. I walked out of that movie with a smile on my face. Definitely the MCU's finest movies in a while. With Wakanda Forever, I felt flabbergasted and not overjoyed. So, I give it 3 1/2 stars.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Chadwick Boseman dying was not something you could write away in any sort of manner and have the audience that respected and loved the character he brought brilliantly to life not feel cheated. Boseman brought charisma, presence, athleticism, and style to spare. He commanded every scene in all his appearances in the Marvel universe. This movie lacked that presence and they simply couldnt restore that. Danai Gurira is always a pleasure to watch, as is Angela Basset and Lupita Nyongo. But this movie missed the presence of the Black Panther that was Chadwick Boseman, and the effort to elevate Letitia Wright from a character who was previously a wisecracking comic relief to the new lead hero just didnt really feel like it worked? The Villain was poorly presented, the explanation felt cobbled and rushed. So much about it felt like they were trying to replace story with style, substance with simplification. They couldnt deal with the loss of Chadwick Boseman, so they sidestepped the problem via overemphasis till the audience wanted to move past it. And not a single appearance by an Avenger at the funeral seemed like a gaping hole?They had a mountain of issues to try and write away and overcome. And perhaps they did as well as any could. But perhaps no movie could have every fixed this? Sometimes, you do your best, and you live with what you can. Well done, Im glad I watched it once. As much to see how we move past Prince T'Challa and on to the future, and fittingly say our final goodbyes.But I will not own the DVD, I will not scroll through the list of streaming movies and pull this one again. It simply wasnt as good as it needed or wanted to be.And its time to move on.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I literally paused this movie 4 times, one part a day. I was dragging myself along, trying to give it a chance and thought I would get better. After the fourth time pausing it and seeing I still had an hour to watch I broke and just said "" Let it go"".And it was such a shame because it had a marvelous (no pun intended) opening and a beautiful hommage to Chadwick Boseman. The first dynamics were there and Danai Gurira as Okoye did a really good job.But as the movie progressed it had some great go's, as in ""we're getting some action"" only to fall back into a lengthy boring piece.Maybe I find the courage one day of finishing it, but so far... a hard pass.There are far better ways of spending 3 hours of your life. Like getting stuck on It's a small world with the music on repeat.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Marvel has now capitalized on it while at the same time writing him off by introducing the exact same character, but a younger version. Of course MCU could not kill the franchise forever by having Bozeman as the last and final Black Panther, and yes they pretended to offer a tribute to him, but it came off as cheap and shady. I felt dirty when they were all mourning the death of the character when IRL the actor had died.I cannot speak for people who knew Chad personally, their mourning is their own, but this cheap, hollow money grab felt like what it was and the few seemingly geniune moments had zero to do with T'Challa and everything to do with Bozeman.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Each one built on deeply fleshed out and defined characters that had story arcs. Recent offerings since the end of the the iron Man Era have been poor, the last decent film being the surprisingly excellent Black Widow and Spiderman 3. The series have been more interesting, such as Loki, Moon Knight and Wandavision. They have done something different and crafted interesting stories that are still true to the characters.How can you continue with the heroes defeat bad guys stick when it's been done time and time again across dozens of films and series?I don't think you can.Wakanda Forever doesn't have a really interesting character at its heart, the baddies aren't really defined, you don't really care about anything or anyone. Would it have been more interesting to go back and fill in timeline gaps rather than carrying on?This may have been a better way to deal with the sad death of Chadwick Boseman. He is sadly missed and carried the first film. But going back in the timeline, like Black Window or some of the excellent animated series in Star Wars, the Manalorian or the excellent Rogue One has been proven to work.These are stories that, if done well (Not you SOLO), work and add stories that engage and make sense. What if they had done the story of the previous Black Panther or go back even further to the origin of discovering Vibranium.Wakanda Forever feels tired, the universe has gone on too long. She Hulk, Dr Strange Into the Multiverse, 10 rings etc were all sub par.It's time for something new. But with Disney digging up ever more remakes and sequels in all of it's brands, they are in danger of forgetting what made all of these brands great in the first place.They were creative, unusual stories that did something new. They were created with passion and vision without an eye for merchandising or the ability to turn bits into games.I think Marvel need to go back to the comics and source material.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Director Ryan Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole return here and do a decent enough job paying tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman while trying to forge a path forward in the Black Panther saga.The main plot revolves around the world discovering that another nation has discovered a source of vibranium - previously the exclusive domain of Wakanda. The Talokan are a South American undersea community. Conflict ensues.It's not the most unworkable concept, but, Coogler and Cole drag out every turn in the story. Whenever a plot point is revealed, one can be assured that it will take at least 20 minutes to explain it. It is interesting that the U. S. and most of the rest of the world take a backseat to Wakanda and the Talokan. It does re-arrange one's mindset. Still, any viewer who has even read a review of a superhero film knows that it will all climax in a big battle.The overall production is good with solid tech credits all around particularly a stirring score by Ludwig Goransson who does all he can to make all those expository scenes seem exiting. The cast is strong, as well. There are some cogent takes on duty, revenge and honor, but, in the end, WAKANDA FOREVER is basically: Just another Marvel sequel.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Average When It Should Have Been Great","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9143875/?ref_=tt_urv","Picturesinflow","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur163451708/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2023","Black Panther: Wakanda Forever serves as the emotional farewell to its main character and actor, marking the end of Phase 4 in the MCU. However, as a superhero movie, it falls short. The film feels more like a memorial tribute disguised as a Marvel film, which could have worked given its lengthy runtime, but it ends up dragging on throughout. The CGI quality varies from scene to scene, the acting is great, the soundtrack is solid, the fight scenes are mediocre, and the standout aspect is the main villain.As many have already mentioned, the actors truly elevate their performances in this film, but not quite to Oscar-worthy levels. Notably, Tenoch Huerta shines as Namor, portraying a character with clearly defined morals and a willingness to do anything for the betterment of his people. His nuanced acting, especially through his expressive eyes, adds depth to his character, leaving audiences uncertain of his true intentions. Similar to the first Black Panther film, the villain outshines the hero.While the slower pace of the film works against it at times, the lack of substantial connections to the wider MCU is a disappointment. It becomes too focused on the tragedy of the passing of the main character, neglecting the fact that it should still be a Marvel film at its core. While the tragedy is understandable, it would have been more appropriate to explore it in a separate documentary or biography film rather than under the ""Marvel"" label.Once again, the film suffers from inconsistent CGI, although not to the extent of the final fight scene in the first movie. The standout element in terms of costumes is the hero attire, particularly the new and improved Dora Milaje costumes and the Ironheart suit, which appear disconnected from the overall visual style.In contrast to the underwhelming final fight, most of the other fight scenes are better, particularly the nighttime bridge scene. The absence of superpowers and flashy CGI allows for clear visibility and a better understanding of each hit. The bar fight scene in the first Black Panther film surpasses any fight scene in this sequel in terms of cinematography and choreography.One aspect where the film excels is its soundtrack, featuring a bombastic mix of new and old tracks to announce the entrance of each character. Some familiar songs from the previous film make a return with notable improvements. The mesmerizing song that accompanies the entrance to Namor's underground city and the new and improved Dora Milaje theme are particularly impressive.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has its merits and some debatable aspects. It can be an enjoyable cinematic experience and surpasses Love and Thunder (although the bar was set low). Managing expectations is crucial for a more satisfying viewing experience. Marvel has had a disappointing year for me, with both films and series lacking a clear vision, relying too heavily on comedic scenes, excusing heroes-turned-villains due to tragedy, and delivering underwhelming third acts. It's time for Marvel to regroup and reclaim the franchise's former glory, moving away from these disappointing failures.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
