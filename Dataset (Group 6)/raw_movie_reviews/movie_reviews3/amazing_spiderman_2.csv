"","","Better, bigger, more ambitious and emotionally heavier","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3000118/?ref_=tt_urv","santi-reis","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24138034/?ref_=tt_urv","18 April 2014","As the story unfolds, and all conspiracies behind Oscorp unwind, the life of our lovable web-swinger gets more adrenaline full and also more complicated. There is a bit of a sense of DeJa Vu, specially when Peter Parker is trying to balance his personal life and his super hero life. But the aspect in which this movie really shines (like his ancestor) is in the characters, however this time the emotional weight is much more present,and the scale of both the drama and action is much bigger. Andrew and Emma were just as great as in the previous movie, and the chemistry between them is fantastic. Jaime Fox also nailed it as Electro, even thou the character itself was not the best written character, but his performance was so great that i was able to overcome the writing. Dane DeHann was equally great as the Green Goblin, at first i didn't like the idea of Harry being the Green Goblin instead of Norman Osborn, but it was a good choice and it matched perfectly with the plot and tone of the movie.(Also Dane has a knack for playing psychopaths) As to be expected there are plenty CGI scenes but it really didn't bother me because the action sequences were done in a very creative way. The Score, composed by Hans Zimmer,is amazing and somewhat contemporary, so it fits the themes of each character and moment. Overall the movie was much more intense and heavier than the first installment, as our main character deals not only with supernatural challenges but also emotional dilemmas.","12 out of 16 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Spider-Man more on his plate than he can handle in this sequel","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3057760/?ref_=tt_urv","JohnnyPHreak","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0632863/?ref_=tt_urv","28 July 2014","I'm an unabashed die hard fan boy for Spider-Man. There I said it. You can call me a homer for anything Spider-Man. I wasn't a happy camper when I heard they were rebooting the films that I fell in love with. The first two Raimi films for me were great. The sequel still holding up today as one of the best superhero movies of all time. The first Amazing Spider-Man was a bit jarring for me. I walked out of the film not knowing what I thought about it. I enjoyed Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man but his Peter Parker didn't click with me. I also had some nit picky things about the film as a whole (Gwen instead of Mary Jane, lackluster villain). But watching the film a few more times I realized that I liked it.I do research on films that I'm excited for. This film came out weeks earlier in the UK and Europe. And the reviews were mixed which was sinking my high hopes. I didn't like the fact that there were three villains (More on that later). But it seemed like they were choosing the right actors for parts and surrounding the film in talent. After much heart and headache reading people thoughts and reviews for me, I'm okay with saying I liked much of this second Spider-Man film.Andrew Garfield is Spider-Man and it seems he's embraced the part much more this time than in the first film. His Spider-Man is having fun being the savior of the city. He's making the quips, the jokes and the all around energy of his Spider-Man feels directly out of the comic book. I am finally sold on his Peter Parker. Director Marc Webb finally lets the smart but dorky Parker shine in a few scenes that are hilarious and engaging.I'm still not an Emma Stone fan but she is a good counter to Garfield's Parker. They have excellent chemistry. You can tell that these may be Webb's favorite scenes to shoot. When they are on screen this huge summer tent pole film because a small drama about two people with a unique love story. The villains, there are three of them but not really. Let me explain. Rhino played basically as a cameo by Paul Giamatti is really only on screen to show Spider-Man in action at the beginning and end of the film. His main adversaries are Jamie Foxx's Electro who starts off as a man who is saved by Spider-Man. He then becomes a obsessed fan only to in perfect comic book fashion have a horrible accident that grants him superpowers. Foxx is okay, I wouldn't say he is awful. He has some good moments and contrary to what has been written I think he only has one cringe worthy line.Dane DeHaan is one of if not my favorite actor working this moment. His method style works so well in many of the films he's in and here it's perfect. His Harry Osborn is less cartoon-y than James Franco's from previous films. He's creepy, spoiled, arrogant but dealt with a lot of adversity. His chemistry with Garfield feels genuine. It doesn't feel forced like it could have been. They are long time friends who have been distant but because of new circumstances are forced back together.The action is fun, fast and so Spider-Man if that means anything. The way they use his spider sense was very cool. I want to see more of that. The small nods to the comic book are fantastic. There are nods here and there to the upcoming sinister six film which doesn't cloud the film. It's just there in the story that this is apart of a large story in the future. I was trying to count the nods to the comic books. The only issues I had with the film was Peter's search for what happen to his father was kind of just there to fill time. Also the great Sally Field as Aunt May got only a few scenes. She was great on screen but mostly wasted.Because this film is dividing fans I think I've pinpointed the problem. I'm a fan of the comic books and this film feel like a few issues of the comic books aka a mini-series. There are multiple stories, with multiple villains and a lot going on. I'm okay with the finally product and eager to see the film again. For Garfield's performance, the chemistry with Stone and the action scenes this film is a fun ride for any fan of the neighborhood web shooter.","58 out of 98 found this helpful.

"7","/10","""Let's go catch a spider.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3004499/?ref_=tt_urv","estebangonzalez10","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13566917/?ref_=tt_urv","25 April 2014","""Let's go catch a spider.""Marc Webb's first feature film, 500 Days of Summer, was a successful small indie romantic film with a lot of heart. He went from that to the huge production of the Spider-Man franchise which I thought didn't necessarily need a reboot so soon. However the film did work thanks to Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker. His natural charisma and confidence translated really well to the character and his sense of humor makes him the perfect candidate to play Spier-Man. I began my review by mentioning that Webb directed 500 Days of Summer because for me the heart and soul of this film is the love story between Gwen and Peter. I can't think of any other superhero film with such a great love story and believable chemistry than this one. Garfield and Emma Stone are incredible together and I loved their scenes. Webb knows a thing or two about young romance and it is the film's strongest asset. The sequel is entertaining and has some great action scenes, but I could've watched this film for the romance alone. The flaws are actually the villains in this film. They don't crowd the film like the trailers led me to believe, but they really don't seem to menacing until we reach the final third act. For a film that runs at 140 minutes it went by really quick and that is always a good sign. Spider-Man 2 might not be as good as this year's Captain America, but it does have its solid moments and clever one-liners. At times the CGI took me out of the film as it looked more like a video game, but there were some interesting shots as we got to follow Spider-Man swing across the New York City landscape. The film works better as a romantic comedy than an actual superhero movie but that was fine with me because it was a really good one. It makes most other recent rom-coms look ridiculous and unbelievable.After a short flashback where we see what happened with Peter's parents, the camera follows Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) swinging across NYC as he tries to stop a Russian mob criminal, Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti), who has stolen something from OsCorp. In the midst of all the action he receives a call from his girlfriend, Gwen (Emma Stone), who is reminding him that he's going to be late for their graduation. Somehow Spider-Man manages to take care of business and arrives in the nick of time to receive his degree as Peter Parker. His Aunt May (Sally Field) is the only family he has left, but she's there for him like she's always been. Peter however has been having visions of Gwen's father reminding him of the promise he made to not date his daughter in order to keep her out of danger. Apparently it has been a conflict they've dealt with over the last few months and Gwen decides it's time for the two to break up. Gwen continues to work at OsCorp which is now managed by Norman's son, Harry (Dane DeHaan), after his passing. Harry seems to suffer from the same degenerative disease of his father and wants to continue researching for a cure in OsCorp. Peter is glad to see his childhood friend back, but when he realizes what he's up to things get complicated. When an employee from OsCorp suffers a freak accident he becomes Electro (Jamie Foxx), a dangerous foe for Spider-Man and the city.The Amazing Spider-Man has some flaws but it still entertains thanks to the great chemistry between Stone and Garfield. They are perfect together. DeHaan is also great as Harry and he does look like a believable threat for Spider-Man. I had a problem with Foxx's clumsy performance as Max but once he becomes Electro he does look menacing. I didn't care too much about the villains or the action set pieces despite the fact that they were well crafted. The inner struggles that Peter Parker faces with his family drama and relationship with Gwen is at the heart of this film. The final act is more than just a gigantic action face-off, there is actually a lot of emotional elements at stake and that is what lifted this movie as it finished on a high note. There was a very emotional scene scene near the end of the film that left the entire theater in silence. The best thing about this sequel is that it was much more emotionally involving than the original and it banks its strength from Andrew Garfield's charismatic and spot on performance as Peter Parker.","51 out of 86 found this helpful.

On the other hand those who love comic spidey, loved, for all the stupid puns, the charisma and the of course the action. But the main complain is about the script, but understanding as a comic adaptation, it makes sense, the several sub-plots going on between each fight,the preface and Peter Parker/Spider-Man parallels objectives, it makes just like a regular comic (weekly or monthly) and less like a regular movie.But What can I say, I was expecting to see the real (mental image, again) Spider-Man on screen, the costume is really (a lot of emphasis here) beautiful, Andrew Garfield really is in the character, Emma Stone makes an active love interest, Dane DeHaan makes a 'realistic' Green Goblin and Paul Giamatti goes a over-the-top, more related to an usual Spider-Man Villain. The only big flaw is Jamie Foxx getting the spotlight just because Django, the character is lost in the movie, half-way between fun villain and real threat, shame because he is the main villain.Marc Webb got me, I'm gonna be the first in line for: The Amazing Spider-Man 3, Venom-Carnage, Sinister Six, maybe Spider-Woman (not confirmed yet), or any other release of a fun comic adaptation.","33 out of 55 found this helpful.

As storytelling goes I was very-pleasantly surprised to find a really strong grip: it never commits the Spider-Man 3 mistake of being over-crowded and maintains a brilliant balance on all the characters flowing naturally with a story that feels perfectly fine despite the pressure it had from Sony. It never tries to be over intricate but manages to pull of multiple inter-twining story lines in a magnificent way. Never does it leave loose ends and that is something I hadn't seen in a comic-book movie for a couple of years. Furthermore it isn't a banal plot, there of course are some clichéd moments but as much as they don't get me in 90% of movies they got me here (credit to director/actors for making those few feel very spontaneous), it has valid originality and keeps a core fidelity to the source material that deserves high praise. Just as good is the way in which this sequel builds on its predecessor tying up loose ends, proceeding with minor story lines of the first movie and adding great parts in it. As a director Webb proves to be amazing. The action scenes are complexly put together, with visual brilliance and continuity in them. Great improvement from the first movie. They really were breathtaking, nail-biting sequences that found me on the edge of my seat continuously. Another visual aspect that is stunning is the swinging sequences of Spider-Man: this is what I always wanted to see but never fully experienced with the other Spider-Man movies; the shots there were fantastic. Yet what I most admire Webb for is the talent he has for character development and coherence, we have seen this in his previous two movies and here it is firing once again in all cylinders. There just isn't one character in whom I did not believe, I never spotted the stereotypical comic-book person in here. Everybody had there chance to shine. Sure a couple of characters have minor short-comings and I understand if somebody doesn't believe in Electro's personality, but I found that it walked the line between movie acceptability and comic-book campyness in the perfect dose. To this I also have to give credit to the soundtrack which blew me totally away when Electro is introduced to the public: that was some serious use of music and sounds for storytelling, brilliant, intelligent! Adding to this is a really powerful score from Hans Zimmer, one of the better ones I have heard from him and generally in recent years. Our introduction to Harry Osborn/Green Goblin was positive on the character part (indeed there was no need for him to be green goblin in this one but I honestly did not mind him), yet from an acting point of view I think Dane Dehaan overacted in some scenes, nevertheless he was good enough. There have been many criticisms of this movie in regards to messy tone, unoriginality and rushed villains and as much as I see where people are coming from and I would indeed have appreciated a more untraditional villain(s) introduction and story I just never thought of that during the movie: there are many movies in which I simply cannot be taken in because of originality issues, but for some reason this one felt to me so fluent I never had any problems with this and actually felt it kept a consistent tone throughout. Yet I must address the fact that watching it twice I could feel the studio putting too much of its hand in the movie: they were way to manipulative of this and I think that by leaving Marc Webb just some more creative power this movie could have been enormously better. The CGI wasn't always seamless but great in many moments and anyways it never bothered me because the story was always the driving force behind it and what I was most interested in: this also speaks to the fact that the action was used to propel the plot so it never felt out of place, that is something really hard to pull off. There is lots of humor in the film and I can safely say that it actually is very funny and very faithful to who Spider-Man is and how he acts and to expand on this the humor fits both the tone of the movie and the storytelling, speaking again to the fact that, just like the action, it is used appropriately for the character development or the story, it is never gratuitous. I was excepting more fan service, but I can't really fault the movie for not satisfying my unsatisfiable thirst for it, that was nevertheless kept at bay. ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" truly was a comic book movie. It took the best aspects of the two world and combined them in what I always figured in my head when I read Spider-Man comics. Yet, I have been holding back this for all my review and here it is: what truly is the best part of the movie, the most riveting element, the thing that Webb does best in a really majestical way, the driving force behind this film, the main reason and thing that kept me most absorbed in the drama and what gives it honest emotional depth is the relationship between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker. honestly do not know how Webb is so amazingly good with romance and character interaction but what we have here (and in the previous movie) is something really special.","50 out of 88 found this helpful.

I did enjoy the first installment of this unnecessary reboot, almost anything seemed like a step up from ""Spiderman 3"", and Garfield felt way more natural than Maguire, and Emma Stone is always welcome. But after seeing the first trailer I thought it seemed like a total mess, and I wasn't convinced by Electro one bit. Unfortunately I was spot on, I hoped to at least get an enjoyable time at the cinema with my friends, but ended up feeling quite uncomfortable and laughing throughout most of the film. Garfield and Stone has their chemistry and does their best with the incredibly thin script and cheesy one-liners, but their potential quite beautiful scenes together gets lost in the over-full and messy plot. I can't buy an emotional scene that is interrupted by heavy dub-step and a blue electric guy.Oh Jamie Foxx, how did you go from Django to this? Before he goes all CGI-Electro he tries to play the nerdy unseen scientist (with a worse comb-over than Christian Bale's 'Hustle'-look). As Electro it's hard to say how much is his fault, and what can be blamed on the rest, I'd go with the rest. You don't sympathize with him nor do you believe how fast he becomes this super-villain. Everything that Dane DeHaan did so well in ""Chronicle"" just feels unnatural and (maybe not misplaced, but wrong) here. And his character development is way too rushed and quite unnecessary for this film, it just becomes another sub-plot standing in the way of what really matters. Sally Field does good work as Aunt May, but leaves no lasting mark. Paul Giamatti's Russian criminal is just in the way and only gives a couple of dreadful and laughable scenes. And then there's the mad German scientist named Kafka and I rest my case. The action and visuals isn't bad, but still doesn't make up for the low ""trying to be Marvel""-comedy and horrific soundtrack, a soundtrack that almost itself destroys the film throughout the exhausting 142 minutes. And sometimes it feels like the movie is taking us as an audience to be stupid, with pointers to what is going to happen. I would like to say that you might enjoy it if you just try and see it for what it is, but it's hard, but hopefully possible! It had an interesting start, with a glimpse inside the past and Peter's parents, but it's left underdeveloped, as is almost everything else, to make room for all its action and villains.It's amazing how the difference between two big-budget superhero-movies can be so huge, if you put this against ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", a great and, opposed to this one, original film. Oh how I wish that Marc Webb could have continued with a ""(500) Days of Summer""-esque movie instead, he could keep the sub-plots starring Garfield, Stone and DeHaan, and it could very well be a great film, and probably not such a waste of talent.","629 out of 1,024 found this helpful.

A satisfactory plot for a superhero movie.Talking about the performances, I like the new Peter Parker, humorous and entertainer. I've started to feel the original 'Peter Parker' was actually boring. Really good job by the actors here. And with that SuperVillian : 'Electro', the movie becomes one of the best SuperHero movies. Visual effects are quite good and the movie is perfectly entertaining.

Of course this isn't greatest movie of history, but as a comic book filming it is very entertaining. Spider-Man's leaps between skyscrapers are beautiful to watch especially in 3D experience is like sitting on a roller coaster. Andrew Garfield is great as a Spider-Man, Emma Stone succeed well as Spider-Man's girl friend despite the tragical end. Sally Field is always great actress. Only Jamie Foxx don't convince in his role as a nerd. Luckily he act nerd only half of the film and the rest of the movie he is digitally enhanced Electro. Story is entertaining and pretentious comic book adaption and that is the way it should been watch. Albeit the dialogue is quite childish at time to time it doesn't bother too much. Lots of popcorn and enough of soda is all you need to enjoy this movie. If you want to say something bad about the movie you could say it has been inflate to so big that it will be a hard to surpass on next movie. Movies massive budget (200 million dollars) is hard to cross over.

"5","/10","Impressive spectacle but overstuffed and empty","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3058535/?ref_=tt_urv","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","30 July 2014","Both Amazing Spider-Man films get a lot of hate, and while for me they weren't as bad as all that(if anything personally they were moderately enjoyable films) I do agree with a lot of the criticisms for both. Some say the sequel is better, personally the first while being very over-familiar and unevenly paced and with a severely underdeveloped villain the first was a little better but still fell far short. There are good things about the sequel. Once again it is very stylishly made and the special effects are better this time round, while the action sequences provide some thrills. The chemistry between Peter and Gwen is still sweet, Peter at the grave is actually quite moving and the closest the film ever gets to having any emotional impact and some of the acting is good. Andrew Garfield's performance is much better here, he doesn't ever quite capture Spider-Man's vulnerability but he is much less smug and tones down the quirkiness. Emma Stone is a charming and very likable Gwen, Sally Field gives seasoned support as Aunt May although she doesn't have much to do and Dane DeHaan does a great job showing Harry Osborn's slow descent into fear and loneliness. However, Jamie Foxx despite looking really cool doesn't do anything with Electro and looks lost and Paul Giamatti is completely wasted and gives a rare bad performance. The script and the way the characters are written don't help, the script is very thinly sketched and tries to balance comedy and pathos and does so awkwardly, to the extent the comedy feels overly-broad and out of place and the pathos apart from one part is non-existent literally. And the film does suffer from too many characters and most of them with little development, with the two leads the most interesting characters. There are two too many villains(the same problem that Spider-Man 3 had) and none of them developed very well, Osborn/Green Goblin just about musters due to DeHaan but his development still feels rushed and some of his actions out of the blue, the villain also deserved a much better resurrection which was cheaply done. Like Lizard in the first film Electro is very one-dimensional with no motivation, or shall we say no obvious one, and Rhino feels like a just-there-for-the-sake-of-it character. The story doesn't suffer from being over-familiar like the first Amazing Spider-Man but it does suffer from a very sprawling structure and a lot of it feels over-stuffed and plodding. The music has its moments and does fit better than James Horner's for the first Amazing Spider Man but it does lack pace and one of those pleasant-to-listen-to-but-easily-forgettable scores, three composers are credited and the score sometimes sounds like that is the case. All in all, moderately enjoyable and visually impressive, and Garfield is much more at ease here, but it does suffer from trying to do too much and feels empty and emotionally-lacking. 5/10 Bethany","48 out of 82 found this helpful.

People need that.The second Amazing Spider-Man movie, and it was pretty amazing for me. Electro is probably the best Spider-Man villain, not in terms of characterization, but in terms of coolness and power. That last fight scene was so dope with the electricity that made all the music. Blue is a great color for Electro. He is also very powerful, and he definitely could have done more than in the movie.Andrew Garfield again brought charisma to the our favorite local superhero. And just like in the first, Peter and Gwen had such amazing charm and chemistry, only because of the actors.My problem is although they revealed more about Peter's parents, it kinda led to nothing. I was quite disappointed in that. Then, Harry Osborn was pretty boring and just rushed.Overall, it was just slightly better than the other Spider-Man (of course not even close to Spider-Man 2) because of a cooler villain. 7.5/10.","12 out of 18 found this helpful.

This is by far the best Spiderman movie of the five. Right from the start you begin to realize how in this movie the action scenes are not executed in a dead-serious end of the world manner like the previous spider-man movies, which made me feel more connected to this movie than the others. This is how spider-man should have always been portrayed, unlike superman or batman. Andrew Garfield delivers the role in a very balanced and well done manner yet again. He had the chance to dive deeper into the role in this movie compared to the previous one. The chemistry between him and Emma stone on screen is one of the best aspects of this movie.Another thing I enjoyed about this movie were the villains, which surprisingly everyone seemed to dislike. The characters in the movie weren't too much in any way, certainly not as much as in the previous Spiderman 3.Even tho the movie didn't feel like it was something completely new, and doesn't seem to pull off something unexpected or revolutionary (In regards to film making, not Spiderman story-wise) I still felt like it was one of the most engaging and entertaining movies I have seen in a long time","26 out of 45 found this helpful.

The Sam Raimi trilogy for the most part revitalised the Superhero genre that was stuck in the mud with the abysmal Batman and Robin. The first Spidey outing changed the genre around and managed to get fans interested in the characters and the storyline once again. The sequel improved with a more complex villain and better character development. However, fans lost faith with the threequel and Spidey's future was stuck to one huge tangle of a web.Then along came Marc Webb, with The Amazing Spider-Man which was shrugged off by the critics and called a cash grab. However, whatever criticisms there have been of the previous four films this one seems devoid of all of them and gives fans what they have longed for; an exciting, mesmerising and pulse- pounding adventure one that stays true to the comics.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a jam packed film and every shot has been thoroughly examined and expertly directed by Marc Webb. The effects are the best that they have ever looked, the characters are fully developed and we care more than we ever have done about them all and the action and story threads are not all over the place. The beauty of TASM 2 lies in the fact that the origins of Spidey have been set up and he is free to roam this spectacularly created world.It is fair to say that there has not been much hype surrounding this superhero sequel and going in with high but not extreme expectations it blew them out of the park so effortlessly I was left gob-smacked. This leaves us with undoubtedly a Superhero for the ages and the best outing for any standalone character since The Dark Knight Rises.The score composed by Hans Zimmer shows off his mastery of the Superhero genre of music and his themes for Spidey, Electro and Goblin are always enthralling and only add to the burst of colour and energy that we receive on screen. Here's to hoping he can stay on as he proves himself a worthy heir to Danny Elfman's Spidey scores.Furthermore, the story threads are balanced with ease and that is not a small task to be had. There are three villains; Electro, the Green Goblin and the Rhino. The rhino played with a maniac twist by Paul Giamatti relishes the short screen time he gets and leaves us longing for more (which will come with TASM 3). The goblin (Dane DeHaan) gives a better performance than the campy version we got with Willem Dafoe in 2002. He brings menace and I was shaken up when we hear his manic cackle from afar off screen. His relationship with Peter is explored and his origin story is told well and most importantly of all his character motivations makes sense. Electro (Jamie Foxx) gives a career changing performance and matches if not exceeding Doc Ock in 2004. He is similar to this character as he is more of a tragic villain, striving to be noticed and changing by a terrible accident into the deformed and terrifying Electro. He changes so drastically throughout the film's runtime it leaves us with a Spidey villain for the ages.Gwen and Peter's relationship is given plenty of depth and is not (thankfully) lost in the plethora of set pieces and action scenes that frequently take place. The struggle of Peter's double life gives us many twists and turns. Andrew Garfield (who is by far the greatest Spidey and Peter Parker) and Emma Stone light up the screen with their meaningful and charismatic chemistry ensuring that sometimes two people talking can be just as exciting as watching the action unfold.The final end scene is heartfelt, surely bringing a tear to even the most cold-hearted of people and will definitely leave viewers overwhelmed by the direction this sequel takes, yet it is never clichéd, boring or predictable.This is a smart film and should be the template for Superhero sequels to follow in many years to come; it is a game changer one that breaks the mould and sets the bar as high as Spidey's web can reach. Webb will need to be on top form to exceed this rare thing; a Superhero Masterpiece.","139 out of 289 found this helpful.

Not this Spider-Man. All the characters struggle against the system that has perpetuated falsehoods. The main characteristic of the film is the gloomy atmosphere, emphasizing the desolate hopelessness. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is very effective. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them.

It was such a good movie, and I wasn't even expecting it to be!Of course, I could be biased here, since I'm a bit of a spiderman fan (always have been, always will be), but this is my new favourite superhero movie! (my last one was Thor...go fig!)The visuals were brilliant, and the cgi was absolutely fantastic! The scenes with Electro were so impressive, I almost couldn't believe my eyes! The script was pretty good, and as always, Marc Webb's direction was impeccable, so no complaints on that front.Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone were on top form once again, and their chemistry was just mind blowing! How cute! Jamie Foxx did VERY well as Max Dillon/Electro, making me feel sympathy for Max, and terrified of Electro! Chris Cooper...what can I say? His performance was short, sweet, and superb as always.Star player, however, simply has to go to Dane DeHann! He's been one of my favourite actors (along with Miles Teller, Jeremy Renner and Evan Peters) ever since I saw 'Lawless', and once again, he certainly didn't disappoint! His performance was my favourite aspect of the film! I don't mean to gush, but he played Harry with a mix of charming, funny, creepy and scary! Just...amazing!I laughed so much, I cried so hard, and I definitely wouldn't hesitate if asked to go see it again! Highly recommended.","17 out of 29 found this helpful.

A Movie I can't actually figure out whether I liked or not. Parts of it were actually amazing. While other parts were far from it.I Think the main problem with this second Spider-man movie (Or is it fifth Spider-man movie?) is that the film before it still feels like a re-run. Yes, as good as ""The Amazing Spider-man"" was. It still felt over-shadowed by three previous movies that didn't really deserve to get ignored. I left that one thinking ""Oh well, at least they've got the setting up out of the way, and can get on with doing something different in the next one."" Trouble is, they haven't. This one also spends most of its time setting up future movies. While other parts bring nothing new and feel like more repeats. I mean, wasn't that ""Washing machine"" gag done in the other ""Spider-man 2?"" The biggest mistake ""The Amazing Spider-man 2"" makes though. Is one that this series should already have learnt not to do. And that's under-using its villain. The main bad guy off this one is suppose to be Electro. A Bad-guy that was always going to be a tough sell, and they don't quite manage it. In the Cartoons he looks so ridiculous that they've had to entirely redesign him, which is cool. But the character is ruined after an amazing intro by being under-used yet over done.The ""Real"" main villain of the movie is Harry Osborne (Dane DeHann) and although this is one of the things that has been done before, he is arguably the best thing in the movie. The minute DeHann was cast I knew he would be great, and he is. His ""dual identity"" too, has been redesigned, but for the better. With a new take, that makes the future of the series at least look promising.But what about this movie? It likes building up future ideas, but there must be something else good about it by itself? Well, Andrew Garfield is still pleasing fans as Spider-man, and his chemistry with Emma Stone is still strong. Providing the movie with most of its laughs, charm, and in some parts, genuine tears. But we watch Spider-man for the action, right? And most of the action too, is still cool. Even if the series has far from reinvented itself, and is still spending a bit too much time on Spider-man's love life, than his crime fighting.","79 out of 168 found this helpful.

I feel that everyone who compares the new Amazing flicks to the Raimi trilogy misses the point of a reboot, its not supposed to be like the old movies, that's the idea.First off, its undeniable that Garfield far outshines McGuire as an actor, and as Spider-man. Not only that, but even without the comparison, he manages to play a likable and natural High-Schooler (Despite the fact that he looks like he's in college) Emma Stone, well, she almost makes the movie. Marc Webb can definitely write chemistry between characters well, and with Gwen and Peter, it really shines. I genuinely cared about the romance in both movies, which I could not say for the old films. The other actors are all solid, Jamie Foxx is a great actor, and while his part is not original, it is entertaining and well acted. Props also to Dane Dehaan, who is a great actor and a fantastic Harry Osbourne. Is this movie the mess of a plot everyone says it is? Not really. I was never confused or befuddled by the absurdity of the plot or situation at hand. However, the only thing I can honestly fault on the film can be Sony's marketing. Putting the Rhino in the trailers was idiotic considering he's in two scenes, and yes, the film feels like its fulfilling a quota of things to do with its plot, but here's the catch: its entertaining. The characters are fun to watch, the story keeps true to the Ultimate Spiderman mythos, and it genuinely makes you care for everyone you are supposed to care for. This, in my opinion is the best Spiderman movie we've had, its enjoyable, exciting, heartfelt, and a very well-written film, but Sony's meddling is very evident.","27 out of 48 found this helpful.

If I had one complaint, it would be that Harry Osborne's transition to the Green Goblin could have been done differently, it felt a bit rushed to me, but the rest of the movie makes up for it. Another highlight for me was the soundtrack and score of the movie. The music when Electro is in Times Square is amazingly well done.Overall I liked this movie a lot because it really felt like the Spider-Man I knew from the comics.

However the second film in the series managed to reassure me that their is stall hope in this franchise. Marc Webb seems to have a better hold on the story he's trying to tell in this film and the relationship between Gwen and Peter is tremendous. Andrew Garfield shows us his acting shops throughout this movie and blows Toby Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker completely away. However the film with all the amazing things it does stall has some flaws. The villain's such as electro and rhino are very cheesy and unconvincingly acted which is very strange due to the actors who are very skilled that portray them. But Dane Dehaan as Harry Osbourne does a brilliant job reassuring his acting ability in Hollywood as he brings a memorable performance to his character. The film also sets up future movies and spinoffs perfectly with a large amount of Easter eggs scattered throughout. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a much better film then the first amazing Spider-Man and packs a huge emotional punch however a stilted narrative and a few wooden characters hold it back from its true potential. Hopefully future spidey films in this universe will solidify Spider-Man as one of the greats.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

Jamie Foxx stands out first by being concise throughout the film. The other new member that deserves to be recognized is Dane DeHaan for his Harry Osborn / Green Goblin was at least perfect. The work that the actor did with what he was given, was phenomenal. Forget Willem Dafoe and James Franco, if ever there was a good Green Goblin was the DeHaan despite all the problems that caused the plot in character.The universe of Spider-man is very rich, and often more is worse and this movie was the case. If they had taken things more calmly could have taken the ideas of this film and have done two. What counts is what this is ultimately good save and make us accept his blunders.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

That's how you know it's good. Firstly, the chemistry between Peter and Gwen is really pure which is what makes the film interesting. I like the way Sony didn't focus the film on just action and CGI but they added another story to make you feel something within. No joke. The villains too were just amazing.The plot was very unpredictable which just made my day because the things that take place makes you unbelievably satisfied.Please check this film out because you are hurting yourself for not doing so.","28 out of 54 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Nice visuals, a great soundtrack and a solid Spider-Man movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4462939/?ref_=tt_urv","starcrowq3","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5455940/?ref_=tt_urv","16 November 2018","Since this movie was released I've seen it a couple of times. And I always come to the same conclusion, this wasent bad at all.
Garfield does a solid Spider-Man. It's not the same ""nerdish and a little shy like"" version as Tobey Maguire did, but instead it's a more straight forward Spider-Man/Peter Parker that feels a bit more modern at times. The old trilogy is classics already by all means, but this one felt more visual pleasing somehow.
The chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone is still there. Sure the story of one of the bad guys played by Jaime Foxx felt a bit too much to maybe make me sympathize with him turning over to the darkside. But then again with great powers comes maybe too much responsibility for some right? Some people just can't handle the power. We can still understand his motives so it doesnt take much away from the action. And this movie felt really great when it comes to visally upgrading the action scenes, making spidey more visually stunning with it's more colorfull visuals then maybe ever before.
I also think Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn felt alot better then the original trilogys version that felt flat and childish. This one had depth and his own motives and struggles.
The soundtrack is another great one from Hanz Zimmer that adds another level of the emotions felt by the characters and the scenes.
All in all i think this one did alot better then people give it credit for. And it feels like a missed oppertunity not making a 3rd one. They had alot of potential moving forward from this one, without going into spoilers. Instead we ended up with a new Spidey that doesn't do it bad either but feels a bit too childish for my taste. This one felt more like a middleground suited for all ages, like it should be.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

"4","/10","This Spider-Man is indeed amazing - But the web spun around it feels clumsy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3000510/?ref_=tt_urv","Jakestro","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur28401393/?ref_=tt_urv","18 April 2014","This Spider-Man is indeed amazing, but the web spun around the film is somewhat clumsy, with too many fuzzy strands to do the wall crawler justice.Okay, now that the obligatory Spidey metaphor is out of the way - Amazing Spider-Man 2 is in my opinion stronger than it's predecessor but falls far short of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 benchmark. Might not be a fair comparison though since I still contend that Raimi's Spider-Man 2 is in my top 5 comic book films of all time. Garfield is cutting the perfect figure as the web slinger and sharing an infectious on screen chemistry with Emma Sone as Gwen Stacey.But my beef with this films lays with two main problems - the writers and the director. Sure, there was some bad acting as well, but I believe that was due to the script the actors were handed.Let me say, I enjoyed this film, in fact I really enjoyed this film but I do have to talk about the parts that I didn't enjoy first so I can get to the good stuff later.Okay so problem number one, the writing in this film is bad, like blatantly bad. I mean, they nailed Spideys comic-book-perfect sarcasm but other than that.. nope not cutting it. I looked the writers up on IMDb to see the rest of credits... mystery solved! It's scripted by the same duo behind the Transformers franchise - suddenly it's shortcomings become more understandable. Kurtzman and Orci are masters of ''whizz-bang'' ''oohs'' and ''aahs'' shoehorned into a mechanical plot provided to advance the story but nothing more. All the baddie origins here make you wistful for the Sandman creation sequence in Spider-Man 3, which isn't something I thought I'd ever say. Electro is lumbered with a shockingly clichéd birth with Foxx struggling (and failing) to make him anything more than the film's time bomb to be diffused. The electric effects are great though if that makes up for anything, and his face-offs with Spidey really do pop.Problem number two is that of director Marc Webb - Webb struggles to maintain a coherent tone, often veering between hyper-real CGI mayhem and soft-focus Twilight-esque teen dreaminess. This is what really threw me off - one second you're watching this great spectacle of an action scene, and then within literally seconds the scene along with the dialogue turns to this really cheesy nonsensical Twilight-esque love scene but with Garfield in tights. I guess the best way to describe it would be like squinting to focus your eyes – all the elements are there but you just can't quite see them all at once. You could tell the film is designed to attract audiences of all demographics, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing - if only it didn't make everything feel shoehorned in. It basically struggles to be it's own thing, even if Raimi's incarnation weren't to your taste, the films did clearly have a defined style that made them distinctive.I feel kind of like saying more would spoil the film and it's still good enough to avoid doing that.Aaand finally we get to the things I liked about the film, credit where credit is due.This Spidey flick does go places that the previous incarnation shied away from and even tweaks the tear ducts ever so slightly at points. Comic-book fans will certainly be pleased to see some elements - Spidey's sarcasm - be more in line with the comic books.The film opens with public support growing in the web heads favor as Parker graduates high school and starts college. However, Spider-Man finds himself up against a new foe - Electro played by Jamie Foxx. Meanwhile the return of his childhood friend Harry Osborn played by Dane DeHaan threatens to throw his life into even further chaos. As to be expected, cue plenty of plot twists that anyone with half a brain could see coming from a mile away and mayhem on a city-wide scale. You certainly can't fault it for its scope.People have been so scared of the amount of villains in the film, pretty much everyone I know was expecting another Spider-Man 3 fiasco – but I have to say, the clutter of villains is actually more about setting up spin-offs and further sequels than overcrowding. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the villains work though – they are hampered by mechanical plotting which of course leads back to the writing that also holds Webb's film back from really hitting the heights it could've. At least Webb and the writers do wrap up and tie a bow on the somewhat irritating parents-as-spy-scientists story thread, thankfully not robbing Peter of his ''ordinary Joe'' back story as the first film threatened to do. With the past dealt with, you realize how much time has been spent on it and with the middle of the film getting dangerously close to being boring. This is especially frustrating when we're rushed into the final reel, ruing the lack of time for stronger character work that could have made the ensuing drama even more impactive.As the credits roll, the exciting action and Spidey's comic-book-perfect sarcasm stay longest in the mind, just winning the day, along with Garfield and Stone's genuinely effective relationship. It's just a shame they're not better served by a film that isn't the sum of its often- inspired parts.But here's the big question - If you find yourself standing at your cinema with a choice between The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Captain America 2, Marvel still triumphs in my opinion. Spidey is always worth watching though and admittedly did leave me with a desire to see more.If you want more reviews please visit www.themoviecorner.net, thanks for reading!","20 out of 35 found this helpful.

The supporting cast notably Jamie Foxx as Max/ Electro, Dane Dehaan as Harry Osborne and also Sally Field and Aunt May are excellent in their respective roles – and also much more fleshed out then usual. Amazing Spiderman 2 manages to slow down the pace and tell a human story while leaving plenty of time for action. While the first Amazing Spiderman was an origin story and more grounded in action scenes Amazing Spiderman 2 pulls out all the stops and looks absolutely fantastic. The strength and chemistry of the lead two characters is the real gem here though striking an emotional chord while the action climaxes in an epic and unforgettable finale. Amazing Spiderman 2 is a rousing success, topping the first in this series and leaving us wanting more.

"7","/10","Fun, well done and well acted, but with script problems, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 has great chances of repeating the success of the previous film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5627173/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","10 April 2020","Despite some criticisms, the previous film received several positive reviews, in addition to a good result at the box office worldwide, thus guaranteeing a sequel. Again directed by Marc Webb and scripted by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner and James Vanderbilt based on the characters created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, we see the return of Andrew Garfield as our hero, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, as well as Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Paul Giamatti in the roles of the main antagonists.In this sequence, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) loves to be Spider-Man, even though being the arachnid hero puts him in very complicated situations, especially with his girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and aunt May (Sally Field). Despite this, he balances his various facets as well as he can. At the moment, Peter is more concerned with the ghost of the promise made to Gwen's father, that he would walk away from her to protect her. At the same time he has to deal with the return of an old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), and the emergence of a powerful villain: Electro (Jamie Foxx).""Spectacular Spider-Man 2"" continues several plots presented in the previous film, showing Peter who remains Spider-Man and helping to save New York City and who also works as a photographer for the Daily Bugle. In love, he continued the relationship with Gwen Stacy, but he lives tormented by the promise made to the father of his love, which ends up wanting to cause a series of conflicts in the relationship and distancing him from Gwen even with the two loving each other. This plot is interesting and makes the relationship evolve, bringing new questions, such as the proposal for Gwen - who continues to work at Oscorp Industries - to study in Oxford, England amid the separation of the couple, which leads them to question whether they should or not to follow different paths in life. Would the couple's love be enough to forget past promises and move on, respecting each other's choice? Once again the chemistry of the couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone - who at the time were also a couple in real life - is genuine and engaging. The pair of great actors manage to pass all the complicity and love to overcome the barriers in their relationship. They understand each other in looks, in conversations, in small teasing with each other. By the way, Gwen has a much greater importance than it already had in the previous feature.The character Mary Jane Watson would have a small appearance in this film and would certainly assume the role of Peter's love interest in an eventual conclusion of this second trilogy of the character, especially after the events of the last act of this second part. Mary Jane would be played by Shailene Woodley, who even filmed some scenes like the character in the film, however, months before the premiere, it was announced that Mary Jane was cut from the film. Director Marc Webb later said the cut was ""a creative decision to simplify the story and focus only on Peter and Gwen and their relationship"".
Another plot that has new developments is the past of Peter's parents and how he continues to influence the hero in his decisions. The script shows us more of what happened to the parents just before the plane crash that killed them, the connection between Peter's father, Richard Parker, with Norman Osborne and why he had to abandon his son in the care of his uncles Ben and May, as much as they didn't want to. Finally, Peter - and the audience, of course - has many of the answers to the mysteries he has always sought to unravel since he was a child. Her relationship with Aunt May (Sally Field) is also more interesting, with her aunt wanting to protect the boy from the events of the past concerning Peter's parents, whom she believes to be the truth about what had happened. This unbridled desire for Peter to know the truth about his parents' past also causes jealousy in May, who does not want to see his boy suffer.However, the way of approaching the villains was once again the major narrative problem. Even though he has been on the production team since the first trilogy led by Sam Raimi, it seems that Avi Arad and Kevin Feige did not learn much from the initial trilogy. Again, the producers and director Marc Webb try to put several villains and interconnect them in a single story, but just as in ""Spider-Man 3"" - which brought together Areia Sand, the new Green Goblin and Venom - the script does not convince and tries to get just an excuse to join the greatest number of threats possible in a single film, without developing any of the characters.Theoretically being the main villain of the film - which even gives the film its name - Max Dillon (Electro does not pass the image of a great threat until near the end. Played by Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, the character is presented as a brilliant scientist, who developed a plant alone for Oscorp, but who is a rejected person, without friends and who has always been invisible to everyone and who puts on a pedestal anyone who gives him a little more attention or who makes him feel special. Living like that alone made him an extremely unstable person. The point is that Electro's motivations are not credible. The fact that Spider-Man paying attention to him has already made him venerate the hero, even when the Spider doesn't recognize him anymore transformed after the genetic alteration he had suffered after the accident at Oscorp, it is enough for him to become his enemy. Not to mention that he is easily defeated in the fight in the middle of Times S quare and only reappears in the final act when allying with another character.Harry Osborne appears after studying at a boarding school at the age of 11. Rejected by his father and destined to suffer from the same genetic inheritance as his family, the heir of Oscorp Industries returns to see his father Norman (Chris Cooper) practically on his deathbed and starts trying to get the blood of Spider-Man, who could use to search for a cure for your degenerative disease and save your own life. Harry is presented as arrogant, ambitious and doubtful. His father's abandonment and rejection shaped that boy into what he became. Peter's old childhood friend and having helped him when the boy had lost his parents in the past, the two meet again and resume the friendship relationship. The two support each other, as they consider themselves as two rejected, abandoned by their parents. This relationship could have been much better developed, but Harry's vindictive attitudes occur extremely quickly, as well as his transformation into the Green Goblin - with a much better look than that presented in the first trilogy. The villain appears out of nowhere, attacks the hero out of nowhere, loses easily and then disappears, to resurface in the end allied to the mysterious Mr. Fear, in another moment of pure confusion. Despite the good performance of Dane DeHaan, the abrupt form of changes that occurred with the character, are negative points. DeHaan's Green Goblin would deserve an entire film as the main character, so that it could be fully explored.To make matters worse, they still managed to fit in a third villain, Rino (Paul Giamatti), who appears in the first and last scene of the film. The great visual surprise of the film has mere seconds to show its best shape. The character only served to show the audience fans of the comics, what the villain's look would be like in real life. Giamatti, who is an excellent actor, does not have any space to develop the villain.The director Marc Webb bets again on the direction of actors and proved to be competent again both in the action scenes with his camera always very well positioned to bring the best angle to the audience, especially when she passes for the heroes of the arachnid. Despite very well constructed scenes, the feeling we have is that more impactful scenes were lacking. Highlight for the fight sequence between Electro and Spider-Man in Times Square - the electrocuted handrail with the highlight - and the entire final sequence at the Oscorp plant between Spider-Man and the two villains. As in the previous film, the visual effects are incredible. We can also notice a greater number of comedy scenes. In addition to the chemistry with Emma Stone, Garfield is even more comfortable with the character. The Spider looks like he's out of the comics. The attitudes of the Friend of the Neighborhood are perfect. In the fight against villains we have the playful Spider, practically dancing with the enemies.The soundtrack was composed this time by Hans Zimmer, replacing James Horner, the composer of the first film. Marc Webb and Zimmer formed a supergroup with Williams, Johnny Marr, Mike Einziger and Eurythmics, David A. Stewart, to create the music for the sequel. Eventually, Stewart did not participate in the film's music, and the supergroup, credited as The Magnificent Six (in reference to the Sinister Sextet) helped Zimmer in the compositions.However, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 is again a lesser adventure than it could be. It lacked the old lesson of ""less is more"" to guarantee a feature film in its total efficiency and with fewer questions that invalidate its potential. In the face of this gigantism and the poor choice in the subplots to be addressed, The Spectacular Spider-Man 2 is stuck for much of its narrative. The film only thrills once and for all in the beginning and also in the final stretch, when it gains apotheotic airs. It's time for the special effects show, the exciting battles and a good dose of courage, to the delight of those who know the story of the arachnid hero in the comics. Fun, well done and well acted, but with script problems, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 has great chances of repeating the success of the previous film.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is of course love interest but this added to the story and I actually bought into it and found myself caring for the characters, no mean feat for a cynic like me. Thankfully it didn't come across all teen/twilighty which seems to be the norm these days.The villains are very good, Dane DeHaan in particular is exceptional (is it me or does he remind you of a young Leo di Caprio?) and gives a fantastically unnerving performance - big things beckon for him no mistake.If you liked the previous Spiderman movies you'll still love this, If you didn't put any misgivings aside and give it a whirl (as i did). Either way definitely go and see this film, words I never thought I'd utter about a Spiderman movie. You Won't be disappointed.As I said - no plot details and no spoilers, just an honest opinion of my film experience.","338 out of 625 found this helpful.

Director Marc Webb's follow-up to the 2012 franchise reboot capably picks up the pieces. Andrew Garfield excels at conveying fragility without losing all of his machismo at once. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is both messy and persistently thrilling. I said this movie it's the franchise's best entry and its least humane, despite struggles to the contrary.The film has a beating heart trapped in the vast machine of the Hollywood entertainment complex. Webb has completed two multimillion dollar superhero movies in the five years since his first feature. Webb continues to show some of the tender sensibilities on display in his debut, 2009's ""(500) Days of Summer"". The movie's smaller moments rank as its strongest, for once turning Spider-Man into the flustered young man. ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" has moments of levity, but no leverage over the boundaries of its formula. The film shows the capacity for a master showman to spin Hollywood elements in fresh ways.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Now two years later we have a sequel and boy does it get better. First off let's talk cast; Andrew is still fantastic as Peter Parker, he also has great chemistry with Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey. Jamie Fox as Electro was an amazing thing to watch too along with the other great cast members who all do a fantastic job (even Stan Lee with his cameo). The characters in this film were actually really interesting to watch, a lot of the story focuses on Electro and his origin which is fascinating, plausible (sci-fi wise) and downright creepy, I mean creepy; this film goes to places I wasn't expecting; some of the scenes were real freaky to watch, especially Electro and certainly the Green Goblin who was nightmarish to say the least. What added to the creepy and tension had to be the music, the music in this film is phenomenal; there are so many good parts where the music goes perfectly with the beautiful shots that the movie gives you. Talking about the score itself, whenever Electro does his thing and fires electric bolts and everything they go real heavy on the dubstep, a lot, I think that adds to film though in some way, I enjoyed it. The story itself I really liked as well, the ways they went surprised me a few times but were definitely fun to watch, (I didn't see it in 3D but from the scenes I saw at the cinema it would definitely be worth it). The only negative thing I would say about the film is that there are one or unrealistic scenes where I thought ""That wouldn't happen"", It doesn't ruin the movie but does take you out of it for a few seconds. I would say the ending will surprise a lot, and for more than just one reason. In conclusion I want to say The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the best Spider-Man film to date and is absolutely AWESOMENESS.","26 out of 56 found this helpful.

He delivers again the second time around as a relatable teenager who is just graduating from high school and is having problems with his love interest Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone as he is concerned for her safety. As the film opens we see that he is back to his usual of fighting crime, and the city itself have accepted spider-man as a hero . Peter Parker has a lot on his plate in this one as he discovers the mystery behind his parents abrupt disappearance from his life as a young boy where he delves further into the truth. He is also challenged by the antagonist Electro played by Jamie fox as a man who seeks to be noticed by others. Among the new characters is also Harry Osborne Peter Parkers childhood friend from the past who has come back to New York city where he learns a terrible truth about Oscorp and the Osborne family curse, as he tries to seeks out spider-mans help. As a whole this is a very enjoyable film that has many flaws but are excused by the very well done action scenes that have very impressive CGI, especially the New York central scene with Electro. The relationship between Peter and Gwen is well done as that is director Mark Webbs strongest points to making a movie that involve the relationships between the key characters. The acting is fine by the main actors which also includes the likes of sally field who plays Peters Aunt may and newcomer to the series Jamie Foxx is okay too as Electro.The gripes that I have about the film is that it is all a bit clustered, with too much going on, which brought me back to the terrible spider man 3 but definitely no where near that bad. I think that Harry Osborn could have been fleshed out more as a character and also cast more appropriately. Electro was an exceptional villain from the film as we see the problems he suffers through in life. Overall many fans of the series and genre and genre will enjoy this experience. The film has great acting and the movie is worth it for the entertainment value with awesome CGI, but the movie strives to hard to be bigger than it should be, and expands too much as the film runs overlong by the two hour mark. Mark Webb did an excellent job putting this film together but their is much too that can be improved on for 'The Amazing Spiderman 3' which I'm sure will be very successful as well as this film when it opens world wide. Solid 7/10","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

"","","Amazing? No... But In terms of a No. 2 - Spot On!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3509470/?ref_=tt_urv","jordan-maxwell","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27587172/?ref_=tt_urv","22 July 2016","It was a cold February evening back in 2010. I was walking my dogs in the rangers and it was quite a frosty day FYI so the ground was quite damp and wet. Now as I was walking I slipped and as I did I fell into a pile of dog crap. This wasn't some Poodle's doing were talking about, I'm talking Great Dane business. Maybe it was the frost but it was also quite soggy itself. So not a pleasant experience and I had to walk back home smelling of this dog dung, with my dignity and humility gone. Amazing Spiderman 2 makes that dog crap seem like a Thornton's Chocolate Layer Cake. I mean that with 100% absolute honesty. I just want to say I remember seeing the first Amazing Spiderman thinking this really is as bad as it gets. But boy oh boy did they prove me wrong. You know how you look at things and think how in God's name did you get there. I call this 'the Trump effect'. Amazing Spiderman 2 epitomises this effect - as I was watching the film I was thinking, how did they manage to raise $200 million dollars to finance this film project and that was the result. $200 million! 200 MILLION! Let that sink in for a moment. that's real money right there spent on the film you have watched. (I would hit myself but I'm saving it for something worthwhile later). And like Trump, while I sat and watched this film shocked at its absurdity I had to sit there and think this is so ridiculous its sadly become enjoyable. I mean when you jump of a building onto a bicycle with no seat, you can either a) Experience the pain and agony or b) Think 'you know what this is a pretty funny situation.' Perhaps I should start with the beginning.1)We meet Jamie fox's character. A troubled individual with poor social skills who only wants to be recognised by his Hero Spiderman (I'll give the writers originality points for that). Spiderman saves Jamie and they have a cute bonding session for his birthday. Now we saw the trailer so I know he becomes this 'Electro' character and I was wondering how they were going to pull him off. So I was awe when I realised that the character become Electro by falling into a pool of eels. Now I don't know about you but I know a middle finger when I see one, and Jamie Fox falling into an Eel tank takes the cake. Electro then goes on a mini rampage and Spiderman comes to the rescue but forgets Jamie's character's name. The most obvious human reaction to this event would of course be for Electro to start destroying Time Square with electrical currents and suddenly turning on Spiderman who used to be his long life hero. So lesson number 1, if you ever meet someone emotionally unstable who has accidentally fallen into an eel tank giving the person super human abilities to supply and take in electrical currents. dear god remember their name. 2)Next the side plot Airplane collision scene. The clever writers of this film in their storyboard room decided 'you know what this film needs, a completely unrelated incident were two airplanes are about to collide during Spiderman's big battle with Electro – because you know what we can'. Slaps forehead*. 3)And now Andrew Garfield. Very fitting name for someone who has the acting capability in this film to that of an orange cat. I mean the kid makes me root for the two planes to crash. Also, the actor has as much charisma as a Lidl's Weetabix and the fact he landed this role really sums up the experience. Lesson number 2/ You apparently don't need to act in an acting role. I could go on ladies and gents but frankly I don't have the time. But in short is the Amazing Spiderman 2 worthwhile? Let me sum that up with a quote from the film.'No'.No one wanted a new Spiderman reboot. We got one. No one wanted a second sequel of that reboot. We got one. At least now we can know that hopefully the producers have learnt their lesson to maybe leave a longer gap between the original films and a new reboot. I mean what are they going to do know? Reboot a Reboot? It makes me chuckle just thinking of the ideaoh wait.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

First off I would like to congratulate Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield's on-screen chemistry. It was to say the least adorable and true, which is what made this movie a great romance flick rather than an action film that we all paid to see.Garfield's portrayal of the loud mouthed web head we all know and love was a huge step up from the first of the series (which is saying a lot as I'm a sucker for origin stories). The perfect balance of cocky script writing and believable teenage actions made for a great portrayal of Peter Parker and allowed for a fun movie experience. I loved the new suit which paid homage to the old comics which was a nice treat for all you spiderfans out there and ultimately it made the fight scenes seem almost 'too comic' but who's to say that's a bad thing anyway. As for the new 'Baddies', they where good, but not great. I will run through each of them and give my opinions on each;Electro~~ The CGI was fantastic! Despite the original worry that they cast a black actor to play an originally white character Jamie Foxx pulled it and played a very convincing villain. I say villain because his portrayal of the innocent Max Dillon was strange, but kind of good in retrospect.Harry Osborne~~ Although my first impressions of the pictures released where negative, after watching his portrayal of the conflicted and isolated millionaire kid I would say his performance was on par to that of Garfield himself. He made me think, he made me worry and at one point he even made me hate the web-slinger.Rhino~~ For me, Rhino was just there rather than part of the 'enemies unite' team. His character lacked development and in terms of story he just jumped from one to another without really any backingFor a fan of Spider-man in both mediums of comic and cinema this movie was not perfect but it did not disappoint either, it's 100% worth the watch and is the best of the spider-man movies yet. 8.4 stars out of 10","16 out of 33 found this helpful.

It's a good thing that I didn't pay to see it. Because of the film's marketing campaign and the trailers I was, for some time, looking forward to seeing this sequel. But what I saw was almost as bland and unengaging as The Amazing Spider-Man (2012). As was the case with the first film, the trailers for the sequel made it seem much better than it actually is. It's a cheat in a way. One of the three supervillains in the trailers isn't even an important character in the film. All the action scenes in the film were featured in the trailers. Yes, there's a shortage of action. The actions scenes are few and far between. There's also nothing particularly impressive about them. Director Sam Raimi did the same thing a decade earlier and he did it much better. In addition he made the action scenes lengthy, something that Webb still isn't capable of doing. But Webb's inexperience (or is it a lack of talent?) is evident not only in the action. It's evident in the way he directs actors. We've heard enough about Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone being a couple. But does this make a difference in the film? It makes little difference really. The featured romance is typical for a superhero film. It makes you feel little for the couple, something that becomes much too obvious during an important scene. The screenplay by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Jeff Pinkner doesn't impress. At times it's poorly written. It doesn't help the romance or the proceedings. It doesn't make the characters interesting. It's formulaic. It contains unnecessary parts. These parts are a burden on the film's running time, which is 2 hours and 22 minutes. Yet we still get two underdeveloped and unmemorable supervillains. We get to know their motivations but we don't really get to know anything else about them. This is a fault of the screenplay. Jamie Foxx (Electro) and Dane DeHaan (Green Goblin) don't provide good performances with Webb's direction. In fact, the performances and even the film itself seem cartoonish at times. Also, for a film with such a large budget ($255 million), the CGI looks surprisingly underdeveloped in some scenes. There's just a lack of style in these Spider-Man movies by Marc Webb. If it wasn't for Andrew Garfield playing Peter Parker it would have been a chore to sit through this film. It's not all bad though. Sometimes the actors manage to brighten up a scene. There are some genuinely funny audience-friendly bits. A good electronic score by Hans Zimmer & The Magnificent Six is a bit of an improvement over James Horner's orchestral score for the first film. But at a time when Marvel and Disney are releasing one solid superhero film after another this aimless Spider-Man reboot by Columbia seems primitive. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is only a minor improvement over the first film. Take my advice and don't see it in a movie theater. Don't get duped for a second time.","15 out of 31 found this helpful.

The first film came under some criticism especially by lovers of Raimi's trilogy, but I felt it took the necessary steps to redefine the character and it gives the sequel a solid platform to build on.The casting and performances of both Andrew Garfield as Spider-man and Dane Dahaan as Harry Osbourne are particular triumphs of this instalment. I also think Emma Stone does a good job. The Action sequences are exciting and are visually spectacular where they particularly succeed in showcasing Spiderman's powers.I've read some reviews complaining how this film is too much of a romantic flick, but ultimately the relationship between Peter and Gwen is key to the story and adds a much needed dimension to the standard Superhero movie. In fact these interactions between the two characters stand out as some of the best acting performances throughout film.So overall this is a good watch and I'd definitely recommend anyone to go check it out, my only real problem with it was some of the creative choices surrounding Jamie Foxx's character, especially in his characters normal form.But other than that go see it!","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Not only was the VFX extremely good, but the plot was also awesome and detailed. They show you that; spiderman is a human, he can't save everyone, without making enemies. Everyone was good in this movie, even police officers were good in this movie. I feel that Marc Webb (the director) has learned from his mistakes, no more wannabe spidey, no more trying to funny! And finally, finally, we learn more about his parents. The story is realistic, if you think about it in a superhero movie perspective. They show you the sad part of spiderman's story, they show you the phycology of spidey and almost all the enemies. The vfx are really impressing too, I even think there could might be a Oscar nomination for it.The ending was too fast though, they had the chance to stop it at the right time.

The character's dialogue was pretty good most of the time, witty, sharp - 7 but when it failed it was a 2, and it failed at critical times. The dialogue (and acting) really fell short during the dramatic emotional scenes. A lot of close-ups and teary-eyed emotional scenes that hit the same note and seemed trite. The characters said exactly what they thought, spilling their guts with no subtlety -- dialogue was too head on. The characters ultimately came off as shallow. The story got long and seemed to wander at the end becoming as much about setting up the next movie as satisfying it's potential. More time could have been spent making the characters compelling.

Marc Webb should've done a lot better with this movie because he's a good director, but for whatever reason, he was just sleeping through this terrible movie. I didn't care of the first Amazing Spider-Man but wow, this film makes that film look like The Dark Knight! Everything about this film is wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. The is no plot to this movie, just like 9 ministries cobbled together randomly and none of them intertwine or mesh at all. The tone constantly goes back and fourth between loltastic comedy and dark drama/thriller, and it makes no sense. The performances are all dreadful, starting with Jaimie Foxx (yah, a buff black guy as a dweeby nerdy scientist, I bet Vin Diesel was their second choice) and then Dane Dehaan and then Andrew Garfield himself. The music is so damn grating, like whose bright idea was it to put dialog in the musical score...WHILE the characters in the film are talking? There are moments where both the musical score is talking and the characters are talking and they overlap each other. It's awful! Electro is a dumb villain with a dumb motive that isn't even really clear (so, he's made that Spider-Man forgot his name? Now he wants to destroy the world? WHAT?) Rhino is completely wasted (also, Paul Giamatti as a gangster is hilariously bad) and Oscorp has no meaning in the film. The dialogue is horrendous too; half of the lines are said twice in a row for some reason (""I'm going to work, I'm going to work!"") and one of the worst lines ever is when Emma Stone says ""I break up with you"" like a caveman. Spider-Man himself is also extremely annoying. Like the minute long sequence of him arguing with his aunt about...laundry? Oh, and don't forget, this is the ""dark"" and ""serious"" Spider-Man, which is why we have scenes with Parker arguing about laundry or Spider-Man pulling down Rhino's pants...oh yeah, that's dark and gritty all right! Man this movie is awful. Marc Webb is a good director but this movie is completely awful, like he just slept through this film. Please don't see this film.","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The BEST Spider-Man so far","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3008560/?ref_=tt_urv","jtakhirov","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22782715/?ref_=tt_urv","2 May 2014","After re-watching this film, I have lowered my rating from 10 to 7. I believe I was caught up in the hype and now that I have rewatched, its not that great lol. My original review below. I watched the movie in 3D on opening night. I was not sure what to expect as some of the critic reviews I had read were not so flattering. However, within the first 10 minutes of the movie I was hooked.Visually, this is the most realistic and fluid Spider-Man film yet. All of the movements and actions are exactly as if you would imagine if you ever read any of the comics or watched the CLASSIC Spider-Man cartoon in the 90's. I was especially glad that the web swinging was realistically designed, as you were shown which buildings the web is sticking to and how it affects Spider-Mans trajectory as he swings through the air.The Acting was top notch. I think Andrew Garfield is the best version of Peter Parker we will ever see. He is a perfect fit for the character and his chemistry with Emma Stone is amazing. The only character that really annoyed me was Norman Osborn. He was, how can I best put it, a Wanksta!The Story was more about Spidey and Gwen Stacy, rather than the villains. I understand that this may have not appealed to some fans. However, this is exactly what Spider-Man is about. Spider-Man is about a regular guy with regular guy problems, which cause him just about as much pain as his work as a superhero. In fact, Spider-Man is more comfortable with fighting super villains on a daily basis than dealing with his past and relationships. Unlike other superheros, what makes Spider-Man so unique is that he is a regular guy who nobody knows about. He ,akes ends meat as a photographer, lives at home with his aunt and has to support her, has a complicated relationship with his friends/girlfriend and has to juggle all this while fighting crime on a daily basis. Spider-Man provides a unique experience from both the view of a civilian as well as a hero.","22 out of 50 found this helpful.

When Marvel do a movie with their list of characters they do it with a reverence to their comic based history. Marvel do so with a respect to the product, they care. Happily this reverence for them has made money.Sony, well they are in it for the money. Spider-Man 2 is the movie for the Suits. If Marvel had allowed the Hollywood Executives (the Suits) control to their library you would get the super hero genre dead after 2 movies.You can compare Captain America Winter Soldier with The Amazing Spider-Man 2.CAWS, was an intelligently written high intense super hero action movie. TASM2, was a romantic, lets talk about our feelings super hero action movie.I can imagine the Suits all sitting around at the Spider-Man 2 pitch. ""Marvel is doing so well, our answer is the super hero movie with the emotionally challenged lead character with some kick ass action!"" The suits would look at the movie Pitcher and say ""WHAT?"" ""It's Spider-Man meets the Twilight Saga, that is sure to make money Yeah""Give me a break. These are the guys that ruin things. Do not get me started on J.J. Abrams and what they did to Star Trek and what they are going to do to Star Wars.Sony give Spider-Man back to Marvel, they can and do a lot better than your clichéd attempts.","26 out of 61 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Pacing Issues, Unbalanced and off.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3004777/?ref_=tt_urv","itsjoshykho","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47458493/?ref_=tt_urv","25 April 2014","I went into this film with high expectations. I enjoyed the first one more than I thought I would have, as well as the trailers for this movie really had my attention going. Sadly, this movie is no where near as good as the first film and felt like it was directed by someone completely different.The worst thing about this film is the pacing. Something about the flow of the movie was just wrong and off. Some scenes went on for way too long, I'm talking about 20 minutes of just straight up chatter of non related topics that do not contribute to the film's storyline at all. The next scene would then be a 30 second clip of something interesting, and then it would cut back to scenes that actually bored me. Even the action scenes were paced so poorly. I can't find the exact word for it, but the only word I can think of is weird when it comes to the action. Don't get me wrong, the visual effects look great and the cinematography is great also (way more colorful and bright than the first film) but nothing in the action feels natural. I was never on the edge of my seat on any of the action sequences. Even the last action that was supposed to be the final climax action set piece had me feeling empty. The structure of this movie was just messy and all over the place, and on some parts, very boring to watch.Andrew Garfield I felt was not as strong in this film as he was in the first film. Its not so much his acting, but the script he was given. All he does is cry or look like he's about to cry, and the dialog scenes that he has with anyone (even Gwen) is super dooper cheesy and un-natural. Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborne was good, but not as spectacular as everyone says he is. He was particularly strong towards the final act of the film. Jamie Foxx was a weird one for me. I couldn't tell if his acting was poor, or if what he was told to do was poor. Before he became Electro, his scenes were off as hell. Too rushed, too many quick cuts and just unbalanced (which as I said before is pretty much the entire film). The reason of why he suddenly becomes a villain I found was just stupid. One second he's totally obsessed with spider-man and the next he wants to kill him... Ummmm...huh? One of the few things that was good about Electro (or Max Dillon) is that you sympathise for him at first and you feel sorry for him because he gets treated like horse crap. But all that connection is lost as soon as the times square showdown sequence happens. The best performance is still Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy). She's always good, but as I said before, the dialog in this movie is off, which does affect her performance on a small scale. Another big thing that ruined the movie for me was the music. The trailers made it seem like this truly was spider-man's ultimate battle because of the music (especially the music towards the end of the final trailer). What do we get instead? Dubstep, party music (Project X stuff) and music that seems like it would belong on the Disney channel. Whenever there's an action sequence, the music completely ruins the tone of the fight making it so much more less intense than it should have been. And since Hans Zimmer was composing the score, I expected it to be intense orchestral hybrid pieces. If he were to compose a score that would sound something like inception's, then I could see that capturing the tone of the film (particularly the action sequences). A few things I actually like about the film: The opening scene was amazing. I thought that by watching the opening scene, this movie would top all of the other Spiderman movies. Sadly I was wrong. The action as I said before is cool to watch. Everything is very colorful, and the visual effects aren't the realistic type in lets just say Captain America: The Winter Soldier or Man of Steel. Its the cartoony comic book style type of visual effects (sort of like 300's) which is great for this type of movie. I also like how they don't over do the slow motion in the movie. It was used when it was needed the most and it looked great. All and all, this film felt like it was directed by Michael Bay. It had that weird, off, quick cut, rushed, forced and messy pace but had great visual effects just like Transformers 2 and 3. This isn't a terrible film, but its not good either. If you want to watch this movie for the action, then you're in for a treat. However, you will need to get through the clunky dialog, bad pacing, okay acting, rushed villain origin stories and a generic storyline. In total, there is probably only around 30-40 minutes of action which means you will need to get through the 90 to 100 minutes of everything else.5/10 - Mediocre","28 out of 68 found this helpful.

Dane DeHaan is also on hand as Harry Osborn, who has a startling transformation of his own. Sally Field plays Aunt May while Felicity Jones appears as Felicia.It's best to watch the first film before this one because some story elements transfer over. It features the same main cast and has the same tone, so if you liked that one you'll probably like this sequel. Thankfully, they fixed Spider-Man's costume, noticeably the mask & eyes. While I like the mature, sometimes reverential tone, the story feels listless, particularly the part revolving around Electro (which is thoroughly changed from the comics). Foxx is fine; I just found the character, as written, uninteresting. Ditto with the other convoluted subplot. DeHaan works better as the second villain (I'm not going to say who, but it's obvious if you know anything about Spider-Man).Thankfully, everything perks up in the final act where the creators do something bold. I didn't think they'd do it and found it almost shocking, although they didn't milk it for it's potential (but they did well enough). Even the Rhino shows up.The movie runs 142 minutes and was shot in New York (The City, Rochester & Long Island) and Los Angeles. WRITERS: Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci & a couple others.GRADE: B- (6.5/10)","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Jamie Foxx does surprisingly well in his role considering it is not his usual type of character. It is definitely a new interpretation of the franchise. However, I can understand the complaint that it is too long and combines too many storylines in one.

And yes it was better than the first film but was it "" amazing""? No, not yet.The biggest fear I had was that it would had too many villains and story lines and I was partly right ( however it was not as bad as I thought it would be). Sony just wants to build its universe as quick as possible and set up as many story lines as possible but it's going too fast in my opinion. To build an natural superhero universe it takes time and effort. Don't try to cram too much into one film.The best thing about the film are the performances of the leads. I adore the chemistry between Garfield and Stone. Stone shines as Gwen Stacy and she is one of my favourite parts of the new films. Jamie Foxx and Dane Dehaan were also great in their roles. Giamatti was a bit too much over the top but he was fun too watch.The pace and tone felt a bit uneven. At times was the film even a bit corny ( but I guess that's the tone of the comics so I can live with that). The film was a bit too long and I would have like to seen more Electro ( his powers were awesome) and to take a little more time to develop the story of the green goblin ( perhaps span it over a couple of films). I personally would have cut Goblin out of the film ( not Osborn, just his transformation), added more Electro and cut a few scenes.( Another note I would like to make is the weird use of the music: the music was really well done and sometimes even creepy,like during the appearances of Electro. Almost every time there was some dubstep along with Electro so that was really weird but it had an epic feel. Oh yeah , the music during the end credits didn't fit with the tone of the film)7.5/10","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The second attempt gets finally seems to get things right with Spiderman's style and attitude - true to the comic. Another thing worth noting is that his suit is now more believable considering you can see it ripple in the wind as he swings along the city; a vast improvement from the obvious CGI with Tobey Maquire. Garfield also seems to have beefed up this time around (definitely needed to enable him to portray someone capable of throwing a punch!).The movie runs quite long and they cram a lot into it - this has been criticised by a few but is something I rather enjoyed.

And that made for a somewhat below average experience, because these villains could have added so much more to the movie.I didn't get that whole fake teeth thing that was going on with the Max Dillon character, especially when you could see Jamie Foxx's real teeth through the fake teeth in the upper mouth. It was just horrible to witness.And one thing that also made this movie less than mediocre for me was the usage of comedy throughout the movie. It was just so misplaced and it didn't work out at all with the rest of the movie.Truth be told, then Tobey Maguire actually pulled off the spider-man character better than this new guy in these two movies, Andrew Garfield.Well, I have seen it now, and thus can scratch it off the ""not watched yet"" list.

The plot developments keep coming and coming without letting the characters breathe. The best part by far is the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. The movie is better every time they are together on the screen. Without them, I would definitely fail this because this is generally a mess. Jamie Foxx is being a ridiculous cartoon as Max Dillon. As Electro, he's much better. Dane DeHaan is very good but Green Goblin is completely rushed. Again the movie is jamming so much into this. Also I don't know why people keep hanging around to watch as chaos ensues. Electro is wrecking Time Square and people are gathered around to cheer like it's New Year's Eve. There are so many ideas going on like Peter's parents and corporate intrigue. There is enough material for two movies and would probably be better as that.","13 out of 30 found this helpful.

I remember liking the previous man a lot, but this sequel is very disappointing.","32 out of 91 found this helpful.

And the camera work was par excellence it's brilliant, the elements of the movie are perfectly timed be it comedy, action, drama whatever it was like spot on. Yeah I agree the movie goes a little slow at some point in the 2nd half but its still worth watching, definitely! The background music is pretty dope, brilliant characterization & performances by Emmastone & Andrewgarfield, what an actor he is, his performance is awesome especially in the climax scenes. You know what I love most about Spider-Man? Everything. God I'm unbelievably hyped for this movie....","26 out of 40 found this helpful.

I was angry when I didn't get a Spider-man 4 but instead got a reboot. While The Amazing Spider-man was decent its main flaw was being a rehash of the first film. But the Amazing Spider-man 2 has the advantage of not being an origin story. This film is truly spectacular. I do not agree with the critics at all about this one. This film continues to tie up 'untold story' TASM was supposed to conclude. Acting by DeDehan, Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield are top-notch. The Action Scenes and Spidey swinging are Visually Stunning, especially in 3-D. The final action scene was intense and had my heart racing. Electro and Harry Goblin were creepy villains. Electro seemed like Dr. Manhattan (teleporting and disintegrating) and his motivations were somewhat weak, IMO but I consoled myself that he did what he did because he was crazy. My main problem is with the trailers as they showed the entire Rhino fight scene in the trailers and 70-80% of the Goblin fight scene. The trailers were badly put as they spoiled many things. If Rhino wasn't in the trailer or poster at all, I would have been surprised and excited about him in the film. Even though his role works fine in the context of the film. While I don't think it's better than the first two Raimi films. Its pretty close. My rating: 8.5/10","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I am so amazed with this movie I truly am, because I was so disappointed after the first part that I had little hope about this movie and I went to cinema to see how bad it would be and I felt so good and glad when it ended.

It had a good amount of comedy, truly deep emotions, and brilliant action. A great, cohesive film to lead on from the first one.The relationship between the two main characters are brilliant, and you can really understand what's going on between them as both actors portray their characters very well.Also, what I like from these movies are that they are more relative to the Spider-man comic books, compared to the Spider-man Trilogy (and let's be honest, they were terrible.) If you have read the comic books, then you'll understand where I'm coming from when you see this movie.The only downside/s I feel this movie has is that Jamie Foxx, in my opinion, doesn't really fit his character and I felt that he didn't really have a massive say in the whole film, it was more about the other villain - but what I did like is that having two villains didn't make it feel like there was too much going on; it was very understandable and a pleasurable viewing experience, so the director receives points in my book for his story telling.This review is really brief as I don't want to sway your opinion on the film before you've watched it, but rather to change your opinion on whether you should watch it, and I believe that you definitely should.","286 out of 533 found this helpful.

Garfield's Taunts are as funny as the ones from cartoons provocative and witty, managing to find a sweet spot in my heart.Emma Stone as lovely as ever, not only steals Peter's heart but also holds our own in her hands with her cuteness and independent personality, her courage and intelligence.The combat in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is incredible, it feels fluid and natural, and the special effects stamps this experience in our brain, feeling that 2 hours and 22 minutes are not enough for this grandeur masterpiece of Super Heroes and Super Villains!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Personally, I am a fan of Spiderman and I enjoyed this film. Here is what I liked about the film: 1) The action was very good and I enjoyed the way they filmed it. In addition, Spiderman swinging around the city was great, especially since they made him interact with the environment and people a lot, thus making the film seem more realistic, instead of having him just focus on the main plot. In addition, the conflicts in the plot were very good. I didn't expect the characters to develop that well, but they did and by linking the villains conflicts together (through Oscorp) the villains stories were very well put. However, the Green Goblin didn't get that much screen time. I would like to point out that I think that the final fight with Electro was great and suspenseful, but his defeat wasn't that great. The goes with Rhino, who seemed very unnecessary throughout the entire plot. Also, there was lots of CGI used which would usually remove interest from a film, but since it was Electro, the CGI made sense. In addition, the new theme made by Hans Zimmer was good, but it was constantly played during every Spiderman scene, which got annoying. The same goes with the constant dubstep played for Electro. Another negative factor I would like to point out is the abundance of humour. There was a lot of comedy in the film, which was good and placed, but sometimes there was too much humour. However, the film was also very dark and violent which I liked (especially with the fight between The Green Goblin and Spiderman). Thirdly, the final negative point about this film was the ending. They usually had an inspirational speech of some sort (which was there, but wasn't the main focus in the end), instead they chose to add a poor conflict in, instead of a ""final swing"" like the other films. In summary, the film was good, with well times humour and dark moments. The plot was very good, and 2/3 villains had very good plots which interlocked well, creating a great set of villains. However, there were a large group of characters introduced, and a few too many plots which was a lot to work with, but nothing to effect the film in a big way. The filming was great, and the action and plot was very well put together, creating a unique storyline. 9/10","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

The very first one back in 2002 is obviously a humble beginning, the second is more of an existential experiment, the third is basically a series of soap operatic subplots that happens to be a blockbuster, and finally the reboot is a nearly down-to-earth coming-of-age film about an angsty teenager who finds himself as a superhero. In this latest installment, based on the infinite amount of trailers, it is supposed to be the biggest of the bunch. Because sequels are always suppose to be big. But surprisingly, it is not even close to the expected scale. A more appropriate word to describe it is manipulation. The film instead displays itself with serious, challenging conflicts that mostly end up as cliffhangers. They're not bad, it just feels like it cheated the audience for something more.In spite that it's the longest Spider-Man movie so far, there isn't much big happening on screen. The questions the story asks sure are, but the narrative just juggles off the subplots with contrivance which results as underwhelming. There is no actual straighter point. Stretching it with that runtime just made it kind of exhausting. It also scatters with a lot of potential themes. This is usually the specialty of these movies, no matter how good or weak the movie can be, the central message is always clear, but here the sentiments get a little shakier. The script probably just wants to focus more on the superhero elements, but the plot itself wanted to reserve the bigger action later.The commitment of director Marc Webb is a huge benefit. Even with all the messy plotting and contrivance, he made those ridiculous turns look pretty natural. The romance between Peter and Gwen is still likable even though it sometimes become more of a priority for Peter than the real threat happening behind Oscorp. The action scenes are also better. The web swinging is a lot breathtaking and the fight scenes are surprisingly compelling. People might be focusing on the special effects and the cool slow-mos, but those aren't the real merits. Instead of long shots of massive explosions, it mostly concerns the normal citizens in danger, making the fights look more than personal. It's no groundbreaker to the genre of course, but at one point when some of them are about to die, it does feel like a big deal.The acting of the returning actors from the last one didn't change a bit, which is good. The new ones are fine. Jamie Foxx is fair as Electro, but the alter ego is what handicaps. Max Dillon appears to be a sociopath and that should make him terrifying, but instead he acts more like a buffoon. Better is Dane DeHaan, though the script disappointingly rushed the character to the dark side, but the actor balances Harry Osborn's both human and sinister personalities quite well. And in one killer scene of the uncredited appearance of Chris Cooper indicates that the movie should be ashamed for not giving him more screen time as Norman Osborn.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not yet the most epic Spider-Man ever. It's basically a busy sequel that hardly been anywhere, but even with all the pretentiousness of the story, the film can still provide genuine emotion and fortitude behind the action, the obvious dramas, and even in its most bombastic cliffhanger. The real letdown is it fails to promise the real deal, but even if it has a lot of action, the problems of the story are still too noticeable. The direction and acting are once again competent, the plot just needs consistency.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Heroes deal with their painful pasts and yet rise to face the evil that can threaten the present day. It is their ability to overcome those personal battles in times when darkness looms over society, that makes them superheroes. In the follow-up to the reboot of Raimi's Spiderman trilogy, director Marc Webb (!) massively improvises upon the story's technological rendering and the human element of it that delineates the challenges of being a superhero for an ordinary man. Peter Parker's ability to overcome his fears, his childhood loss, his financial instability and relationship's complication is what really makes him the Amazing Spiderman and in its 2nd installment, his portrayal by Andrew Garfield outclasses any prior attempt. At the burden-heavy core of his responsibility web is Emma Stone's charming Gwen Stacy who is perhaps the most lovable superhero girlfriend yet. As Spiderman busies himself with crime prevention in the city, thus gaining popularity among its citizens, Peter Parker's personal struggles mount. Devoting time for his girlfriend and being there for her big moments is one challenge but visions of her deceased father warning him to keep her out of his harm's way is a decision that is taken by his destiny and not him. Meanwhile, Harry Osborne (Dan DeHaan) returns to his ailing father's death-bed to take over a device containing his life's work and his empire of OsCorp. The same illness however is detected in Harry and his only solution to a cure is blood transfusion from Spiderman. The hero's woes aren't over just yet. In a freak accident in a lab, Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) is submerged in a tank of genetically modified Eels that mutate him into 'Electro' – a living electric station that has the power to cause a massive blackout and use that energy against Spiderman. Parker soon realizes that all of his challenges have OsCorp in common and it is his father's hidden video feed that clarifies Norman Osborn's true intentions about the biogenetic projects. Spiderman must now face all his demons, take high volts of electricity thrown at him by Electro, combat the wrath of the goblin-glide rider Harry Osborn and keep Gwen away from imminent danger. A hero's strength will become his weakness and he will pay a price to be the savior of the city that he must protect. The action is frenetic at times and draws parallels with 'Man of Steel' where each sequence isn't elaborately explained but is delivered in its intense form directly. We all know the powers of Spiderman so the director doesn't waste time in how he goes about the action. The swinging scenes are better than ever at engaging the audience, the action is bigger and Spiderman's powers seem enhanced. The special effects truly come into play when portraying the destruction by Electro and yet, they simply aid the story and characters. The plot balances well between being a Superhero's struggle story and an all-out action duel. Dane DeHaan plays a sinister Harry Osborn with evil emanating from his expressions. Jamie Foxx 's innocent Max Dillon is then transformed into the CGI version that is Electro and Foxx is excellent in his powerful villain's character. As secrets that are buried in the past are revealed, Peter understands his purpose better and overcomes his challenges. Garfield's quirkiness works in his friendship with Harry, his vulnerability works with Aunt May and his ambivalence works with Gwen. In an all round performance, Garfield manages to out-swing The Amazing Spiderman's curse of being the 5th movie about the superhero in 12 years. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is the reason this film stands out beyond all the action and effects. Her charming portrayal of the young, ambitious and intelligent individual is such a far cry from Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane. Peter's fears raise complications between them while Gwen's confidence and charm bring them closer. The scene when they establish 'ground rules' after a break up can just make one fall in love with her as Peter did. Gwen's science degree makes her more of an understanding partner rather than just a romantic one and such chemistry makes them the best couple in a superhero film.Faced with an enemy far superior in powers, a complicated relationship shrouded in fear and a past remembered for its losses, the friendly neighborhood Spiderman must rise to live up to a role that every superhero embraces. Through the dark days that took over the city and through days he felt alone, what made our hero 'The Amazing Spiderman' was his ability to give hope to people...... and of course, how he can free fall from the tallest building's top and make us spend all that money on its 3D effect.","42 out of 69 found this helpful.

The 90s animated series ruled, the Raimi trilogy made true the dream of a real action movie of the webhead but threw it all away in the final installment and this franchise..... just doesn't feel right to me.The main issue I have with Amazing Spiderman both 1 and 2 is that the writers seem to misinterpret the aspects of the hero and it's surroundings. Spidey comes out more silly and clowny than witty and sarcastic. He is annoying to the guys he's fighting like a mime can be annoying when you walk by him in the sidewalk and chooses to displayed all his talents for you to see, and that's just not the feeling I think this character should provoke. All that, added to the crowds cheering behind a police line while Spidey fights a villain makes it all too childish for my taste.What's really sad is that Andrew Garfield is the best Spiderman there is and will be. He has embodied the character amazingly and any shortcomings are due to the screenplay he's has to work with. Same goes to Emma Stone, a brilliant young actress that has returned dignity to our beloved Gwen Stacy after what Spiderman 3 did to her. Them and the greatly accomplished CGI scenes of Spidey's web swinging, which are what I've always thought that these scenes should look like, are the beautiful things about this movie that end up wasted in a context that doesn't do justice to a wonderful character and it's even more wonderful universe.","56 out of 131 found this helpful.

I know as the audience we are privy to all the secrets on the good side and the bad side, but it never ceases to amaze me that the person closest to him, his Aunt May, has never discovered the spider suit which is just sitting in a heap in his closet, open your eyes lady, the guy you raised from a small boy is one of the coolest super heroes around.

When Gwen is leaving to have a future and he stops her, I didn't like it either. Their relationship is rocky, but it's a thriller romance movie, so it's good. The opening scene is perfect. Gwen's death is very shocking and it makes me sad to remember it. Villains are very bad. Unmotivated electro and horrible looking, Harry's Goblin is horrible and looks like a vampire after blood.

I'm gonna get straight to the point, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not as good as the other Spider-Man films, but it is a piece of popcorn entertainment that will entertain for most of it's two plus hour run time. However, as a fan, I cannot lie and say that I am not disappointed by this film, and as an amateur film critic, I have to be honest and point out how cluttered the film often feels. In all honesty, they just tried to pack too much into this one movie to try and set up future films and spin-offs, like Venom and The Sinister Six. There is not a clear focus to this film, unlike any of the other Spider-Man films. It's unclear as to what the filmmakers were actually trying to do here. Is it the story of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy? Is it the story of how Spidey met Electro? Or is it the story of the Green Goblin? It's all of those things and a whole lot more, but there is never enough time devoted to any one of those story threads for them to feel fully fleshed out and satisfying on their own. I really think the culprit for all of this is in the Spidey producers trying to be like Marvel Studios and The Avengers. No longer can a superhero movie be simply a good standalone movie, and if that one is successful, they make another one with a similar, single-minded focus. Now, in the wake of the massive amount of cash The Avengers brought in, every superhero film franchise has to create this larger than life canvas of multiple films intersecting to create a larger story. While I love The Avengers, here's one of the things that Marvel Studios has done for almost all of their films, which The Amazing Spider-Man 2 did not do. They made every one of their superhero films good standalone films on their own right, and not just films that had to be seen in the larger context to be liked or understood. I mean, look at both of the Captain America movies. Take those away from the context of The Avengers, and they're phenomenal films irregardless, but add in the ingredient that is The Avengers, and you get super awesomeness. The thing is, the key is making one good film, and not placing so much focus on the future that you forget about the present. Of course, what really makes me feel conflicted here is that there are just a good many things that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 does right.Andrew Garfield is once again phenomenal as Spider-Man, and Emma Stone is even more lovable as Gwen Stacy (as if that was possible). The film truly shines in the romantic scenes between Stone and Garfield, particularly because those are the scenes, alongside the music montages, where it feels like director Marc Webb is most comfortable. There are moments where I see that spark from his music video work and (500) Days of Summer, and in the midst of all the spectacle and bombastic action, it is those moments that stuck with me more than anything else. Somewhere in the midst of all of the excess that this film has, there is a very innocent and true romance, and I think that is the real focus of this film, but it's often pushed aside for too long to develop something that may not pay off for another film or two. As a matter of fact, if the film was purely about Peter and Gwen's romantic woes and Electro, I'd have been a happier Spider-Man fan, because I really like what actor Jamie Foxx and the filmmakers did with Electro, alas he gets the shaft after about the first hour mark. Maybe I'm becoming a bit of a movie curmudgeon, but the more and more I analyze films, the more I realize, the simpler you often make the story, the better the film. While that may not always be the case, I think here, it is. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is just too bloated, feeling like three different films crammed into the run time of just one. While it is a film that you will have fun at, laugh at, and actually feel something at, it is not a great film, it's simply okay. I actually remember reading another review the other day where they said, had this film been made in the Nineties, it would be one of the best superhero movies ever made, but made now, when we have so many other top notch superhero films, many of which being other Spider-Man movies, it just pales in comparison. Even still, if you can accept that this is not the greatest Spider-Man film, you will enjoy yourself with The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which I did for at least three-fourths of this film, I just wish it had all tied together a little better.I give The Amazing Spider-Man 2 a 7 out of 10!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

In a more video game or comic inspired illustration, the overall colorful tone works wonderfully, especially in larger scales fights such as in Times Square, it's baffling not many movies do battles in the famous location. Its multitude of talents does a great job in bringing the characters to life; chemistry between them is definitely present. Regardless of some flaws, narrative might get crowded sewing numerous plots and villains, the movie will most likely satisfy fans and casual viewers alike.The story tells origins of Electro and Green Goblin, played by Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan respectively, both of which have awkward relationship with the titular hero. Their stories are a bit foreshadowing, even more so to those who have knowledge of the comic or seen the previous trilogy and this might just be too predictable for some. Nevertheless the movie does a decent job on modernizing the villains and keeping them grounded without being too comical, it's a good choice not to put Electro in green yellow spandex. Jamie Foxx certainly has charisma for the main villain, although the fanatic aspect of the character in early parts is odd. It's a bit silly and too old-fashioned for an origin tale, he then becomes more appropriately menacing later on, partly due the blue CG face.Dane DeHaan is a suitable cast for Harry Osborn, I daresay even better than James Franco who previously donned the green cape. He's an eerie reminiscence of young Leonardo DiCaprio, even with similar hairdo. He takes the role of Harry into a darker more obsessed persona, one with volatile and conniving nature. Most of the movie is oriented in Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) as they struggle with emotion and passion. Both of them showcase personal touches; it's apparent that Garfield admirably tries to fill the protagonist role. Spider-Man is a closer more relatable superhero as he endures doubt, guilt, and even the things ordinary folks go through daily, Garfield plays to this strength pretty well. Props to Sally Field and Chris Cooper as parental figures, each the polar opposite of the other, complementing the hero and villain, respectively.Graphic differs from the usual gritty mainstream superhero flicks, New York is displayed in all its vibrant wonder. At first, it seems a tad close to video game, but I fancy the distinct feel. When the movie talks about hope aplenty, it helps to view the world in radiance. Action is great, often taking camera angles close to Spider-Man, slowing down just barely at the moment of impact. The use of audio matches pretty well, Hans Zimmer is a master in this regard. Many techno dubstep tracks focused on Electro blazing in the background and electrically pumping adrenaline, it may appear ludicrous at first, but it fits the movie brilliantly. Pop and rock songs litter the movie, played just in the right time. The production value is aggressive and undeniably entertaining.The story sadly may stutter throughout the movie, there are just too many angles to show. From the romance between the two, origins of villains, the lingering past, the pace sometimes take too long on certain element and not enough on some. Not to mention the transition can be cumbersome, it doesn't help that the usual coincidence and practical cliché plots still persist. The flaws are there, yet its entire cast and production value overshadow them. Its simple premise of one overcoming their crisis is emotionally captivating, effectively presented and thoroughly entertaining.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

In the film, Spider-Man has to deal with new enemies including Electro and the Green Goblin, as well as Rhino. The action scenes were refreshingly good and, although there were too many romantic scenes for my liking, which in turn made the movie slightly too long, they were humorous at times - throughout the movie, there were scenes which triggered a few laughs from the audience which lightened up the production. Having said that, I don't think that it was as dark as the first instalment. All in all, a film worth seeing.","33 out of 53 found this helpful.

There's a lot here, but it feels like it was meant to play out in a different order. It feels like Sony didn't know what to do with the story.The opening scene with Peter's parents on the jet did NOT need to happen. The assassin on the plane is legit the WORST assassin I've ever seen portrayed in media. The story details fed to us, being the fact that Richard Parker was uploading his research to a private server rather than selling it to the highest bidder, is also not necessary and undermines the false information Peter initially finds. If this scene was cut out of the film, it would instantly make it a bit better.The first scene with Peter swinging around as Spider-Man is excellent. The new suit is really cool and pleasing to look at. We also get to see a good depiction of Peter's daily life as Spider-Man, stopping criminals, saving civilians, and swinging around New York. The part where he saves a kid from bullies is so wholesome an reminds us that Spider-Man is always looking out for the little guy.Then there's Max Dillon. Having him feel like he's unappreciated is a rather good character trait, but having him be literally obsessed with Spider-Man is just weird. If they showed him with his family, it would have made his descent into the villian of Electro more... impactful. Jamie Foxx still does a great job with his performance.Harry Osborn's role in this movie is rather mid. He was never mentioned in the first movie, and having him just appear 30 minutes into the movie is just so sudden. I know they wanted the green goblin in this movie, but at least give us a mention of Harry sometime before his first scene.The fight in Times Square is pretty good for the most part. Max finally feels seen, and now with his new powers, giving him a feeling of strength. The VFX for Electro are also really good, and the scene where Spider-Man uses his Spider-Sense to save civilians on the Times Square Steps is really well done with some fantastic camera movements. The worst part about the fight is that it's over within just a few minutes. They could have had Spidey and Electro jump from building to building, with Spidey hanging from billboards while Electro glitches them would have elevated the fight to iconic status. At least we got to see Spidey wearing a firefighter hat.Gwen deciding to move to London doesn't feel right. She has a well paying job at New York's biggest corporation. Why couldn't she just attend college in Manhattan? It would have made more sense if she decided to move to London to flee from Oscorp, as they begin pursuing her after she learns about the confidential Max Dillon incident.The arc with Peter trying to figure out his parent's past didn't need to happen. It was in the first movie, and this arc only exists to clarify that only Peter can be Spider-Man by explaining that only a Parker can access the spider's benefits (which later gives way to Harry's transformation into the Green Goblin.)
And the lawyer that sabatoges Harry and gets him fired is a neat addition, although I wish he had a motive for doing so.The final fight with Spider-Man and Electro looks really cool but feels overproduced as hell. They're fighting in a super-massive power grid that looks to futuristic for the movie's time period (I don't care if Oscorp has this kind of tech, it just doesnt feel natural), The screen is constantly flashing with Electro's movements which look good, just overproduced.Harry as the Green Goblin makes some sense. He's going after Spider-Man as revenge for not being able to use his blood, which feels justified considering his mutation. His costume also looks good, and the fight in the clocktower is great, with the best part being Gwen's death.Gwen's sudden death hits really hard, as on a first viewing with no prior knowledge, the average viewer would most likely expect a less dark outcome. Having it be so abrupt really enhances it's effectiveness, as the loud thud as Gwen hits the floor feels strong and impactful. Andrew Garfield's performance is top-tier here, with his facial expression and line delivery making you feel sad for him.The montage with him standing over Gwen's grave through different seasons also feels emotionally strong. Death can really affect a person, and the only thing Peter can do is grieve. He feels weaker after her death, as he was too late to save her.Having the movie end on a cliffhanger with the Rhino fight was ok at the time, considering that Sony really wanted to make a sequel to this film.In short, this movie has some good parts, and some... not so good parts. Each character has like 3 different arcs they go through, most of which don't go anywhere. The story feels entangled in the web that is this movie, and it could most definitely could have been done better.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Before the 2000's, most of these adaptations took two different paths that separated these crowds; either something that's more playful with bright colors like Superman and the original Spider-Man that's self aware that it's campy and silly. And there's the dark and dramatic route that Batman and The Crow took with an atmosphere that's cold but stylish, and bolder character development.Most superhero movies today tend to go with the latter. The idea behind this is that with every caped crusader, there has to be some big epic story with how they got there and the dilemma they must be going through, doing their typical ""saving the day"" routine. The previous Spider- Man trilogy had more of a campy route with occasional scenes of dramatic character arcs. The recent reboot of The Amazing Spider-Man gave our friendly neighborhood hero a reimagining that was darker, but still the same wisecracker we loved. It took me by surprise, so it made sense that I was hyped to see where the story would go in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.So what's going on? The real question is, ""What's not going on?"" as the movie tries to put a lot into it's story. Peter Parker (played by Andrew Garfield) has settled into his role as New York's favorite son as he catches thieves, thwarts dangers, and saves an occasional life, including that of an electrical engineer Max Dillon (played by Jamie Fox). What Spider-Man didn't know was that Max was a big fan of the Web Slinger, and dreams of being just as important and wanted.An accident with electric eels causes Max to mutate into a living electric generator. His debut is met with disgust and horror. In a spectacular action sequence, Max calls himself Electro and starts to destroy Time's Square, finally releasing his personal anger with the world. You would think that Spider-Man would have enough trouble with this guy, but Peter also has to deal with discovering that his father may have been hiding top secret research work from evil, his best friend Harry Osborn (played by Dane DeHaan) returning to take over his dad's company, a relationship with Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone), and even the beginning of submitting photos for The Daily Bugle newspaper.There's a lot more plot to tell, but I don't want to lose focus. That's the biggest problem with The Amazing Spider-Man 2; it tries to tell a lot of story. Since they got the origin story out of the way in the previous film, I thought that this movie would be ready to give us something that was different from the previous trilogy. In truth, I found myself making a lot of comparisons to the okay-received Spider-Man 3.It shares the same problem of adding in too many villains and rushing most of the development in place for uninteresting story and jokes. I can only blame the less then average screenplay, as the acting here is really good. The material with Electro, with his back-story and the battle sequences, was so good that I don't know why they simply didn't settle on that for a movie. There's nothing wrong with a superhero film that's only ninety minutes long. I can tell that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a result of a director's vision clashing with Sony's corporate idea of setting up a franchise. It never meshes enough for a solid story.I'll give this four comic book electros out of ten. This movie has impressive acting, impressive visuals, and impressive cinematography, but it's badly put together story lacks true excitement that I got from the previous franchise. Ughit was close.","37 out of 88 found this helpful.

This second installment starts where the first left off. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is still on the hunt for answers to what happened to his parents, while trying to balance the new superhero gig and a complicated relationship with Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone).As with round one, the real highlights are in the puppy love bits between Garfield and Stone. The two have a quirky chemistry that's bolstered by the offbeat humor both bring to their respective roles. Garfield in particular shines in the most trying of moments for his character that require more tears than webbing.Of course, no love story can come off perfectly. A new array of baddies are on the hunt for our hero, including Electro (Jamie Foxx) and younger Green Goblin in the form of Peter's old buddy Harry Osborn (Dane DeHann). Foxx's Electro comes off as a tad too goofy to ever be taken as a threat, but DeHann's Osborn is a real seat-shaker, perfectly pitched as a true creep with overwhelming power.There are plenty of twists and turns along the way, with a genuine stunner in the final moments that will lead to some dropped jaws. The question remains, though: after seeing this latest film in Sony's prized series, which camp is more justified in its reasoning?While the studio is undeniably banking on the webslinger's worldwide popularity to coast to the $1 billion-mark in box office receipts, director Marc Webb is at least continuing to do his best to bring a youthful, dynamic version of Marvel's biggest hero to the silver screen. There's just enough new drama to keep audiences engaged in what turn Peter will make next.That being said, at nearly two-and-a-half hours long, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" can still drag from time to time, ironically more in the action than the lower key segments. Proving to be a true contrast to most other films in the superhero genre, it's those romantic moments between Peter and Gwen we crave, and the CGI blasts can often feel in the way of that joy.It's an upgrade over the first film for sure, and Webb makes sure to dangle some carrots in front of us at the conclusion for future films. While it certainly has its faults, the wall-crawler's latest is an admirable start to the summer movie season for its stellar performances more than its loud effects.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I think the story was very progressive this time and there were moments where I honestly felt like hugging the person sitting next to me while watching Peter and Gwen go through their love life. The special effects and camera angles were very neatly put together and I thought the action was pretty amazing too... no pun intended. Overall, it was a fun film to watch, it had its laughs, possibly a few tears, and an interesting storyline. If you have a love for superheroes, don't wait any longer to watch this film.

Sure, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is not as good as its predecessor from two years ago, but it is still very enjoyable. The film does well linking back to the first film, while also laying some back story for the next one.The storyline starts off quite simple - Peter & Gwen are in still in love, but he's conflicted because of the promise he made to her Dad, so there's a bit of ""will they, won't they?"" But at least we have Garfield & Stone - both just plain better actors than Maguire & Dunst. They introduce Max/Electro (Foxx) quite well, but Harry Osborn (DeHaan) a little less so. And I wish they'd saved the Stan Lee cameo for later on! Still, it's mostly faithful for the comics - with the exception of Giamatti as The Rhino (almost unrecognisable!), although it makes sense he'd be in metal armour, rather than rubber!I feel they went a little too close to the original trilogy by focusing on Osborn/Green Goblin/Oscorp and not enough on Electro as the main villain & Gwen as the love interest. When you see how powerful Electro becomes (I don't recall him being as strong/capable in the comics), it makes you question why/how Spider-Man would actually be fighting him - seems like a job for the Fantastic Four or The Avengers! It's probably a little too long at 2 hours 20min, but still, there's some rousing speeches (thanks Aunt May & Gwen), some very funny moments and plenty of great action. It just seemed to (please forgive me for this pun) lack a little spark!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Upon conclusion of this 130 minute plus blast of hot air it becomes clear that the hope we had with the reboot of an already new franchise is now sadly hanging in the balance of movie purgatory, a place that is neither here nor there and a place where we the audience now will find it hard to care what else this franchise has to offer.Webb's 2012 film benefited greatly from a fresh sense of direction that Webb harnessed to great use in his breakout movie 500 Days of Summer, but here just a few years on the direction and pace of this ""amazing"" adventure feels well and truly drained of its power. As mentioned in the opening the film exists to cover ground that has been covered before and makes this venture seriously hard to warm to when so many words and scenarios are playing out for playing-out's sake. With Webb's direction feeling now lacklustre the bad mojo spreads to his cast in particular Andrew Garfield who gets lost in a movie that his natural charm can't escape from, his Spider-Man and Peter Parker that showed youthful enthusiasm in the first is here nothing more than a wisecracking, sulky mess that makes you wonder if we should actually even like him, although the story Garfield has been placed in is so overplayed now over all these incarnations that it could just be fatigue from over familiarity that even the introduction of two new villains cant solve.Jamie Foxx coming off his most beloved film Django Unchained was a hot casting choice as the sorry and powerful Electro while Dane DeHaan so good in Chronicle and The Place Beyond the Pines was also a score for the movie's casting, but both man sadly don't get much shift with a particular wasting of Foxx. Foxx's dweebish Max Dillon is neither scary or human enough to be memorable and he does overplay the outsider nature of the character to unbelievable levels, while DeHaan has small moments, his Harry Osborn is perhaps being saved for later entries to shine truly. The ensemble as a whole here feels weak which is a shame, an indictment backed up the fact Paul Giamatti who appears for 5 or so minutes seems far more interesting.Without a real stand-out action piece, and with far too much exposition that has been covered before this Amazing movie feels anything but. For a film with a $200 million budget and with talent in all departments it's a real shame that it turned out to be the movie that it is, although with 5 separate Spider-Man films now done and dusted, one must wonder if there is anything that could make this blockbuster staple truly jaw dropping again.This particular reviewer would be leaning towards the answer of highly doubtful.2 mid air data transfers out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com","39 out of 94 found this helpful.

The director and the team know how to deliver fantastic and thrilling camera angles to showcase flexible, fast-paced, and detailed web techniques that Spider- Man used when going through oodles of hazardous obstacles to protect citizens in New York while naturally executing chores and roles as an ordinary guy. If that does not live up to your expectations, get ready to giggle at some of the jokes along with mischievous antics.The super-villain, the blue-neon bodied nerd, Electro, is an electrifying and unique character to be seen. Jamie Foxx does his part as an actor and villain for the first time. The one-on-one battle that involves elemental moves and scientific tactics is the highlight of the movie. Although the plot get vaguely wrapped around between Electro and the Oscorp, it is still interesting to watch the character development. So what takes 2 stars away from me? It would be the complicated bonds between a young couple, Peter and Gwen, who just can't make up their mind by being hesitant, especially in the middle of the movie. I mean, it is normal for any couples to experience erratic emotions, but the whole romance definitely can be succinct to intensify other aspects.Despite a number of downsides, I would still strongly recommend this to anyone who is itching to watch a different type of feisty film. Because no movies can offer such a sticky, nifty, and vigorous action like ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2."" Yes, it is as good as the first one, or like others say, it is better.","26 out of 41 found this helpful.

When I saw it in theaters, I was blown away. Now that I own it and have had a chance to study it, I've come across some issues.Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is weak in this movie compared to the first Amazing Spider-Man movie, where Garfield's Peter was excellent and Spidey not so much.Truth be told, I want to like Andrew Garfield's portrayal because you can tell he genuinely loves Spider-Man and I'm happy that he gets to be Spider-Man, but this was weak. Hopefully future movies will allow him to fully express the Spidey persona.Now, as for Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy, I couldn't care less for her. Sure, she helps Spider-Man here and there but eh. I could do without her.The one character that redeemed this movie (in my opinion) was Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn. I CANNOT get enough of him and I'm looking forward to seeing more of him as Green Goblin. His portrayal is spot-on maniacal and dangerous, even though he wasn't in the movie for that long.Another redeeming factor is the easter eggs and references here and there, like the notorious Daily Bugle editor...This movie feels like a set-up rather than an actual movie. It's like a 2 hour-long preview of what's next to come and I honestly have no problem with that, except when it gets exhausting.The plot is flawed, so are the motives of some characters and despite its great soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, even I got tired of literally every scene having too much music in the background. Can't recall a quiet scene other than the closet one.In the end, it's not as bad as people make it seem but it definitely has its issues.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In saying that though, I think the only part of this version I didn't really like was the way the Green Goblin was portrayed. He actually looked like a cross between Wolverine and a leprechaun and he was more laughable than menacing. Other than that however, this is a much more enjoyable film than any of the others.The story for the film, while being pretty predictable, is very decent for a super hero movie. I mean, how many super hero movies can have an Award-winning story that is NOT original or predictable? They are all the same in one way or another so for this story to be criticised more over others is a bit laughable. There is more of a ""love story"" with this sequel as well between Stacy and Parker, but unlike the way the annoying relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson was portrayed in the Raimi films, this one is not insufferable. And that's coming from a guy who hates any sort of romance in movies.The main cast done a stand-up job once again with Garfield and Stone doing well with their continuation of Parker/Spider-man and Gwen Stacy. Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan were excellent in their roles as Electro/Max Dillon and Green Goblin/Harry Osborn respectively, especially DeHaan as Harry Osborn who brought a sly, sneaky, and very snake-like menace to the character. I also liked the Stan Lee cameo again in this one....it wasn't as good as his cameo in the 1st film, but it was still a nice touch.Sam Raimi may have brought us a more up-to-date take on Spider-man but Marc Webb has made the franchise more enjoyable with less cheese.

Firstly, let me acknowledge that I love Andrew Garfield as Spiderman. Captain America ""Civil War"" was great. If you're going to do Spiderman, you either have to start small, from his beginnings, and dedicate a whole movie to that, or just make a movie assuming he already holds the mantle of superhero and have him solve a big mystery using his brains. More of Spiderman at the computer if nothing else. I know this may remind some of the Spiderman and Friends cartoon, so if you're too cool for that I guess, then, well... So what.This movie did not captivate me or anyone else. Who cares if Andrew Garfield is young. It would be that much more hilarious if he was a well-established superhero in New York City. Then, just when he thinks he has everything figured out, an alien craft is reported over the city. At first the sighting is a joke, but a week later people begin disappearing. Mutilated bodies appear in the streets. A strange creature called Venom is rumored to exist. Spiderman must fight him and then in the end he wins back the black Spidey suit in the most epic thing that has ever happened.

It almost goes without saying that this is a staggeringly transparent cash- grab on the part of Sony and to a lesser extent Marvel, but the question is, is it worth your time and money?The short answer is, absolutely not. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 evokes unavoidable comparisons to the masterstroke of the 2002-2007 trilogy, Spiderman 2, which was unquestionably superior in literally every conceivable fashion. As a matter-of-fact, you'll often wish – during TASM2's 140 minute runtime – that you're watching Spiderman 2. But how can that be? As Buzzfeed like to remind us, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are delightful; Dane De Haan is a promising young actor with a striking resemblance to a young Leonardo Di Caprio and Jamie Foxx is an experienced actor playing a potentially strong villain. Behind the camera, director Marc Webb impressed everybody with (500) Days of Summer and a string of well-known music videos, so what could go wrong? The answer, as is often the case in failed blockbusters, is lazy, shitty writing. It will be of no surprise to anyone that screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have each had a hand in at least one Transformers movie. But I digress.TASM2, much like its predecessor, tediously and uncharismatically explores the mystery of what happened to Peter's parents, while Peter himself unconvincingly gets adjusted to his new life as Spiderman. Typically, there is also an antagonist who pops out of the woodwork courtesy of Oscorp (which surely by now should've faced at least some legal scrutiny for becoming a world-leader in the manufacture of supervillains), and Harry Osborn also appears as the harbinger of an inevitable Green Goblin return. This much has surely been made obvious by the trailer.While this movie has some legitimately impressive action set-pieces, it succeeds only in turning a respectable group of lead actors into scenery-chewing, Saturday-morning-cartoon caricatures. During the film's non-action scenes, the leads unforgivably adopt ham-fisted pseudo- representations of their real-life personalities - I'm referring in mainly to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone here. It becomes insipidly clear as the film goes on that their off-screen personality as a ""cute celebrity couple"" has been allowed to directly influence the writing. Often it feels as if they've just been thrown into a scene and told to improvise, and riff off of their natural chemistry. This is cute to watch, but when you suddenly remember that the last scene finished with an argument (or even an official break up at one point) it does make you question how well the writers knew their own screenplay. They chuckle and fawn giddily over each other, in spite of the fact that the narrative demands that they behave otherwise – like real human people would.Poorly written scenes are not in short supply, and they encapsulate the knuckle-bitingly poor dialogue that mutilates this movie from beginning to end. The dialogue in the original trilogy was far from Shakespeare, but it was firm, utilitarian dialogue that moved the plot along. Here, everything is awkward and confused. It also through this poor scripting and story-telling that it becomes unescapable to realise Peter is in fact, quite obnoxious and douchey in this incarnation of Spiderman. Look at the plot from the villains' point of view as the film goes along, and you'll see what I mean.Ultimately, TASM2 just left me feeling quite sad. The writers' tendency to open up plot holes the size of craters, and the bizarre shift toward Adam West Batman-style ""campy"" villains just made everyone seem like a dick who wasn't worth rooting for. By rebooting the Spiderman franchise this early – and getting a great cast to boot – Sony have made the unspoken promise that they've corrected the mistakes that the original trilogy made, and even improved upon its positives. However, they have achieved neither. This series has thus far done everything that the original series did, but slightly worse. Anything new it's tried to do, it has done poorly, and frankly I feel like a sucker for going to see it.BUT HEY, THEY'RE MAKING A THIRD ONE WITH DOC OCK AND VULTURE AND OTHERS. GET OUT YOUR WALLETS.","37 out of 92 found this helpful.

However, it's tough not to, at least, try to compare the two. I get frustrated with people who say, ""it's not as good as the book"", so I try not to do the same thing with the comics. However, the comic book fan in me had some problems with the Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014). If you remove Spider-Man from the equation, this actually is not a bad movie. There are some silly lines of dialogue in the script, however those conversations, fit appropriately into the Spider-Man mythos. Our Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), is handed too many moments of comedy-relief and some of that comedy in the film, was not needed. It made Peter look, somewhat like a jerk. The producers of these films, need to remember, that a large bank of the motion-picture, viewing public, believe comic-book movies are silly, so don't make the film even more silly, by turning an already great character, into a cocky a-hole, especially if you want to keep ticket sales going.The special effects and action scenes are worth the money, if seen in the theaters or at home. The action captured on film is top-notch. Many emotions run high in this film. Although, I don't think she is a good Aunt May (Sally Field), she still manages to knock it out of the park with her performance. Dane DeHaan does a really good, unique, different approach, towards the character of Harry Osborn/the Green Goblin. He created a more darker form of Harry, that the James Franco version couldn't. Jamie Foxx as Electro, seemed a little bit like he was just collecting a paycheck and unfortunately, I didn't get it back in 2014. It wasn't until I saw his return, in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), that I realized how good he was, at that particular version of Electro. I have a new appreciation of his performance, since 2014.Many emotions run high in the Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014). The chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone, his Gwen Stacy (the character from the comics, that really changes Peter from a kid to a man), is very solid, but I still think the relationship, between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst (Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson in the Sam Raimi movies), was more believable, which leads me to this. I am still a bigger fan of the Sam Raimi, Spider-Man films, although director Marc Webb, did show some promise in the Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014). It is promise, that might have grown into the form of a third film, which, as we all know, never happened. However, most of the characters from his two Spider-Man films, came back in 2021, so a legacy seems to have been established.7.2 (C) = 7 IMDB.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It lived up to every expectation I had of it and exceeded them. I am quite a bit Spider-Man fan so this movie was a big deal for me. I already knew the out come of the movie having read the comics and therefore spent a lot of the movie waiting to see how they played out the ending (which they did marvellously and I did actually even cry a little) other then that this movie was just simply marvellous, I couldn't think of any faults.The directing and acting was just superb as it was in the first movie but this was a step up. The comical elements where put all in the right places and presented effortlessly by the actors and actresses. The slow motion elements really made this film when watching it in 3D, but i wouldn't say it was necessary to see it in 3D.I've already planned to see it again with a friend and would recommend it to anyone who wanted to go to the cinema (even my sister who isn't a fan of marvel and also hasn't seen the first film loved this one and also cried)","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

There's a trailer that's really a preview of a new X-Men movie.This time around, Stan Lee is easy to spot. He even gets a speaking line. I wonder if they paid him scale......After a few giant monster movies, the genre gets old. I saw nothing new and interesting about this movie's monsters. Big, nasty, powerful - yawn, been there, done that. There's an interesting contrast between Parker/Spiderman and Wayne/Batman: Batman comes from a wealthy family (and has Michael Caine as a Number Two), lives in a mansion; Parker and his aunt are barely getting by, live in an apartment.The spider-silk acrobatics are too far out to be believable. Each journey through the city (always conducted at altitude) takes at least 23 times his own body weight in silk thread.On the other hand, the special effects are great. Downtown New York has been destroyed in so many movies, it's a wonder anybody stays there.The local theater where we saw it dropped the 3D version early. I asked the manager about that; he said hardly anybody went to that one.

It's quite a long film with multiple arcs throughout. Our hero is struggling to juggle his options and wishes, with a loving girlfriend, family secrets and local hero status all fighting for his attention.Andrew Hatfield is very good again as our tormented hero, and his fellow stars don't let him down.We've a few villains and they are the best part of the film. Electro is well done by Jamie Fox, but it's our new man Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn who is the surprise with some great acting as the cornered dying young man.The story though is a bit of a mix. Too many strands seem to get in the way of each other and don't seem to resolve well. Problem is that stops actors developing their stories. This also bloats the film and can make it sag, and overall it's overlong.The big surprise is the 3D. It's absorbing and unobtrusive. Impressed. Thumbs up.Overall, it's a fine film.

The screenplay is weak and the story line lacks a definite structure and regular consistency. The overlong story is clichéd, crowded with villains and contains some unnecessary subplots forced into it. The background soundtrack certainly did not help.But regardless of it's flaws it does have a few positives. The visual effects are impressive and the performances by Andrew Garfield and Jamie Foxx are great. But that's really all.It doesn't really surpass it's predecessor and considering the recent achievements of the superhero genre in recent years, The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a huge step back.

It seems that Spidey's costume has evolved throughout the years...this newly-designed costume finally resembles the costume he always wears in the comics.Moreover, it is noticeable that Spidey's CGI renders have improved a lot as we see Spidey swings by on the streets of New York City. We also get to see what Spider-Man really does in battle - always jokes while moving swiftly with his super-reflexes. Garfield and Stone have terrific on- screen chemistry as a couple and they have a few genuinely funny and heartfelt moments together in the film. The film does come with a major shocking plot twist at the end (not so much for the fans who knew Spidey for a long time though)Despite the CGI and costume design improvements, plot twist and a strong relationship between Garfield and Stone, the entire plot structure of the film is a disaster as things just keeps on happening from scene to scene. The film is overstuffed with various subplots and the pieces don't fit together nicely, without a central story tying them together: the mysterious disappearance of Peter's parents, Peter and Gwen's complicated relationship, the dual-sided nature of Harry and Peter's friendship, development of the new villains - Electro, Rhino and Green Goblin, Sinister Six setup, Aunt May and Peter's relationship after Uncle Ben's death...all in one film.The villains' motivations are fuzzy and poorly conceived. It's a pity to see such potential go to waste. Max/Electro and Aleksei Sytsevich/Rhino barely have character development in the film at all. Their character arcs aren't properly fleshed out as intended and they're barely connected to the main protagonist's character arc. You won't feel anything missing if they're both completely removed from the story, since it doesn't affect the overall plot of the film at all. It's understandable that the purpose of Rhino's inclusion to the film is for the next sequel's setup. However, it seems that the inclusion of Electro in the film serves no purpose other than to add more exciting, extravagant action fight scenes for the audience to watch. While the extravagance of the action scenes make the film more entertaining, it feels cartoony and not realistic at all.Worst, the tone of the film shifts drastically back and forth between fun, not-so-serious and entertaining to emotional, serious and dark, which takes some time for the audience to adjust and keep up with, hurts the film a lot. When there's a tender, intimate moment between Peter and Gwen happening in the film and you start to feel the emotions coming, the film robs them away by abruptly shifting to an Electro scene, a clue to Peter's parent disappearance appears, or another Harry scene.As a long-time Spidey fan, I personally feel that the film fails to capture the most influential, emotional and devastating moment in Peter Parker's life before meeting his lifelong partner, Mary Jane in the future. It lacks the much-needed emotional buildup to deliver the punch in the end, which is not present due to the horrendous plot structure and inconsistent tonal shifts of the film. The various subplots constantly interfere and collide with each other because that's how it was structured in the script. While seemingly looks good in script, it just doesn't translate well on screen.Furthermore, the Amazing Spider-Man 2 repeats the same mistakes as Iron Man 2, too many heavy-handed foreshadowing for future sequels, instead of making it a compelling stand-alone film. While the sequel is better than its predecessor (the first Amazing Spider-Man film) in many ways, it's still not the hands-down, best Spidey film that many fans would hoped to see.Rating: 6/10Although the story has a terrible narrative structure, I believe the central theme of the story should be dealing with life's two biggest questions:Are you capable enough to deal with the repercussions of taking chances, knowing that they might happen in the future? Are you willing to accept the consequences of not taking those chances and in turn living regretfully because of it?http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/05/movie-review-amazing-spider-man- 2.html","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

There are a few darker moments, but the overall feel of the movie is light and fun. That tone is perfect for Spidey movies, and that is where I think Sam Raimi went wrong with his Spider-Man trilogy. He wanted to make a good film, not a good Spider-Man film. Mark Webb is making good Spider-Man films, so critics are not liking it because they view it the same as they would Shawshank Redemption. And fans aren't on board because they want all superhero movies to be ""darker"". Ask Man Of Steel how that worked out.

I returned to theater this week in hope of seeing some improvement in our kid Peter. Not as disappointed as by the previous one but i wasn't too happy either. The story-line was still a little bit rushed and the villains , though vicious were not the 'sandman' or 'green goblins' , we had come to know from the original spidey series. Acting was justified to the story-line and direction was as expected, good. Andrew Garfield , however 'amazing' can never match the character done beautifully by Tobey Maguire.Among other flaws, this movie is incomplete emotionally and humorously. The pros of this movie... Emma stone i guess. She portrays Gwen Stacy's character quite nicely . Jamie foxx's potential , in my opinion has been wasted, he seems like a villain whom we all know can be destroyed(again nothing like sandman) and we do not worry over him that much. Dane Dee Han does a childish Harry Osborn , obviously Franco was wayyy better.The action scenes were good and they are one of the reason i gave this flick a 6 rather than a 5.Maybe if for a second you forget the original series by sam raimi, you might end up liking this movie , maybe not.In my opinion if you are not in a rush for a superhero movie, wait for x-men days of future past.

In essence a perfect sequel.Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone reprise their roles and the two are just as adorable and lovable together as they were in the first film. And it's surprising how well their chemistry can overcome even the worst clichés. In a weaker film their particular romantic subplot would be painful to watch and you'd know instantly how it'd end. Not so much here. Their character have enough depth and they're played well enough that you not only buy it but you'll also feel like it could go either way. And that's good storytelling.Furthermore, the special effects and all the technical aspects are just as good as they were before. The fight scenes are still a lot of fun and this time even the settings are more grandeur and imaginative. The way they have realized the so called ""spidey sense"" is very cool to look at.Unfortunately the villains are still not that good. The more realistic tone and setting mean that their over-the-topness seems more silly than fun and they're not given as much room to shine as in the original trilogy. They're perhaps a bit improved from the previous film, but there's the new problem of there being too many of them. Hopefully the third installment can fix this one glaring weakness.All in all this is a great film. If you enjoyed the first film, this is definitely worth a watch, and even if you haven't, it's one of the best superhero films in recent years.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The finale of that film saw police chief Stacey - father of his girlfriend Gwen Stacey - make Spidey swear with his dying breath that he would stay away from Gwen in order not to put her in danger. So the first - very enjoyable - half of this film sees Parker (Andrew Garfield) struggling with this promise against his better hormones: she is Emma Stone after all, and he is only human! Garfield is as good in this film as in the first, bringing a depth of feeling and emotion to the role of the split-personality Parker/Spidey, caught between his duty and his feelings. And he has real chemistry with Stone: the couple are genuinely funny together and she looks just drop-dead gorgeous.There was a suggestion in the run up to this film's release that there would be only one main villain: a key learning from the true awfulness that was Spiderman 3. They lied. There are two main villains in this flick - two and a half if you count 'Rhino man'. (Seriously, anyone who has recently spectated at the London Marathon couldn't take this villain seriously... I certainly wanted to chant ""Rhino, Rhino, Rhino..."" at that bit).But I digress. The two primary villains of the piece are Electro, played rather well, in nerdy-janitor mode at least, by Jamie Foxx and The Green Goblin, played by up-and-coming star Dane DeHaan, whose first memorable movie appearance was as the kid-with-superpowers in the sleeper hit ""Chronicle"" from 2012. DeHaan has such a memorably strange and mesmerising face - somewhat reminiscent of the intensity of a young Leo DiCaprio - that his transformation into the leering Green Goblin is genuinely memorable.However, my main gripe with the second half of this film is that there is just too much going on. Both of these villains are quite good, but both together are complete overload (or in the case of Electro, over-voltage). Having two and a half villains means that there are two and a half finales to work your way through. And it's pointless: one of these main villains would have been fine and dandy, so save the other one to live another day until The Amazing Spider-Man 3. Less is more Hollywood! Given the choice, I would have ditched the rather ridiculous Electro ending and kept the 'Goblin in the bell-tower' scene. Whilst curiously reminiscent of a certain Keaton/Nicholson finale in the first Batman film, the ending - where Spidey falls for Gwen Stacey in a wholly different kind of way - is both thrilling and shocking in equal measure.So - in my view a game of two halves: first half 8/10, second half 6/10.(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other film reviews and sign up to ""Follow the Fad"" at bobmann447.wordpress.com.

A fantastic movie. The scenes were funny, emotional, action packed, and interesting. The best Spider Man ever. The movie was surprisingly powerful.There were some very emotional scenes and I could not hold back my tears. But these scenes make the movie powerful. I was speechless as I got out of the cinema. The soundtrack is awesome and pretty cool to listen to continuously. Hans Zimmer and the Magnificent Six did a much better job then James Horner (his soundtrack was still good too).Overall, I think this movie is stunning. It is a must see.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's great for comic book lovers like most of are. Not so great for film directors and producers that don't really bring their A game.2) The plot is extremely unoriginal and very derivative -- for a refresher on a fantastic re-boot, re-watch Batman Begins. Or 007 re-boot Casino Royale with Craig James. When I saw that for the first time, I was like ""what the heck... is this James Bond? This is absolutely fantastic!"" It hits you right between the eyes. Does anyone get that sense from watching the TASM / TASM2 films? Not I.3) The villains (i.e Electro and GG) not only looked ridiculous, the dialog was uninspired and the costumes looked liked they were made from someone who had never read a comic book. Rhino was embarrassingly bad. Really.4) But, the main thing the TASM series has going against it is, frankly, Andrew Garfield. I don't think he's a bad actor. He was miscast, that's not his fault I guess. But he isn't a convincing Peter Parker. He's too old, he's too lanky and too depressing. Spidey / Parker, if nothing else, is bursting with personality with an amazing sense of humor, and he's gutsy -- I'd argue that only Captain America rivals Spidey's level of bravery / courage. As Parker, he has everything going against him -- loner nerd, has to hustle part-time job -- but I think deep down that's why comic book fans love and identify with Peter -- because WE could be Parker, hence, WE could be Spidey. That's why we root for Spidey. At least that's why I do. And I didn't feel an ounce of that from TASM2, and I have no interest in seeing TASM3 knowing we will get more of the same.","18 out of 41 found this helpful.

Paul Giamatti's Rhino, who is only in it for a few minutes, and Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon bring a cheesiness to the series that is reminiscent of the original. Once Electro is cemented as the main villain of the movie, Spiderman doesn't see much of him. The marketing of the movie would lead you to believe that Spiderman is taking on three enemies at once, but not only does that not happen, there really isn't that much Spidey action overall.The film focuses a lot on Peter and Gwen's relationship, which surprisingly doesn't slow the movie down, and Harry Osborn gets a lot of screen time too. He is introduced as Peter's friend, who is a likable and sympathetic character, and Dane Dehaan does an excellent job. One subplot that seems thrown in is the mystery of Peter's parents. With a lot of buildup from the first movie, the solving of the mystery wasn't satisfying and that story arc was unnecessary in the movie.Overall, it is a great summer movie that I thoroughly enjoyed.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Andrew Garfield is a fantastic actor, as is Emma Stone, and plenty of other people in this movie-but I seriously think they just didn't care. Everyone seems bored. Jamie Foxx is a different story: he's trying so, so hard, and it just makes him stick out even worse. Electro is one of the dumbest villains in any movie in a long time.Add to that a cringeworthy score, a script that's trying to cram fifteen different plots into the same movie AND set up for a sequel, and almost nonstop product placement for Sony, and what you get is one of the worst superhero movies of the decade.All this being said...I would watch this again before I revisit the first Amazing Spider-man movie. This does have entertainment value, just not for the reasons it was supposed to. So, if I'm being honest, it kind of IS worth your time.

While both Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have exceptionally appeared as a perfect sweet couple thanks to their great performance, which is quite outstanding as no other superheroes have a powerful love story, but it is sad to see that it could only save the film as a fantasy romance story rather than becoming a better reboot of superhero film. Heavily used CGIs does not really enhance the film effects and the directional effort reduces the enjoyment especially to see Spidey jumping here and there from slow-mo to fast-mo, fast-mo to slow-mo for a repetitive times just like video games. However, it is surprising that collaboration between Zimmer and The Magnificent Six provides the film with a number of great scores, different style from the usual superheroes film.","6 out of 21 found this helpful.

The reasons for these films are well-documented: contractual stipulations mean Sony lose the rights to the character if they don't make films on a semi-regular basis. The commercial machinations are quite interesting, in a way, but not very artistically credible.To be fair, in some areas, this version stands up quite well. Andrew Garfield makes a good Spidey, balancing the nerdy weakling and wisecracking hero sides of the character. This has especially pleased some people who never liked Tobey Maguire's portrayal, although I think he was at least as good. The rapport with co-star Emma Stone is good as well; whether this is just good acting or a sign of their reported off-screen romance I do not know, and to be honest don't much care, although I understand that it makes a great bit of PR. Too bad that... well, you'll see.Out of the two villains, Dane DeHaan has even more of a balance to strike as the schizophrenic Harry Osborn/Green Goblin, and manages it with more aplomb than James Franco did, in my opinion. It's just a shame that James Foxx is given so little to do as Electro. He is a very good actor, and doesn't deserve to be CGIed almost out of existence and given an emotional register that ranges from angry to very angry.The plot holes have been commented on by others, but I think they overstate the matter. Yes, there are plot holes, and contrivances, and none of the good stuff is quite enough to forgive this, but many of the criticisms don't hang together for me.The biggest difference between old Spidey and new, and the one that is most difficult to surmount, is the director. Marc Webb seems capable enough, but he just doesn't have that touch of flair that Sam Raimi could add at times. Without that, the new films will never be more than passable.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogger, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I doubt his potential after seeing this movie. I feel someone should take his position before it become too late. In the history of the Spider-man movies, from all the 6 this one is the worst. Commercially it has done a great business that grabbed around $800 million all over the world, but failed to deliver another quality movie for the fans. The movie engaged with the too much character and subplots. The subplots were not placed in the right spots, kind of random appearance brings the chaos in understanding the story. I had a high hope on this movie and it did not supply well. Frankly, I kind of lost interest in Spider-man. Maybe because it was too soon to reboot, I guess.''You want to be the hero. And now you gotta pay the price.''The first movie gave a decent re-start for the refreshed Spider-man movie series. And what happened here in this second installment was a disaster. The first thing is it was nearly a 2 and half an hour movie that brought me lightly a headache to carry on thus far. Actually, it was 10 minutes shorter than what it is now, but in the end they have developed a bit longer to show the opening scene of the third movie. When a movie got a powerful hero, it should have equally matched antagonist. If they are matched, then the fight between them are the next thing to bring the best out of it. I think the Electro man did not click as they have expected, at least not to me. The strength he had was something beyond spider-man, but did not unleash him in a perfect manner. Though Jamie Foxx was not bad in that avatar, the filmmakers kind of wasted his presence for not so good scenes.Remember the original Spider-man was the modern superhero movies, I mean it was done using computer graphics. Afterwards 'Batman', 'Iron Man', 'Thor' and all were followed. I like the version with Tobey Maguire in it, though my rating declined by movie after another in the trilogy. This reboot series had a good opening, but failed to get the momentum going. Especially all the emotions were looked fakes that do not appeal like the original movie series did. Yes, it had a wonderful box office and that does not mean the movie is good, either worst. But expected a little better, especially in the negative characters. Andrew Garfield was good, not awesome, because most of his masked parts were CGI. Emma stone was another let down and could not help comparing her with Kristen Dunst, because she was no way near, at all. The Dane DeHaan role had the same issue and I don't know why people did not get better space in the movie that ran 140 minutes long. Like I said subplot spoiled everything I think. The digital 3D and stunts were poor. Yeah, there are many things to complain about it than to praise, but all the answer should come in the next sequel. If that makes bigger, not commercially, I mean with a good story, graphics and performances then there will be no problem. But if it fails, I had to say 'bring back the fourth installment of the original movie series'. Definitely not worth a watch, but anyway most of the guys going to watch it or already watched it.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Having been a Spider-Man fan from I was a child, and thoroughly enjoying the original Amazing Spider-Man, I was eagerly anticipating this title. We are initially hit with some standard Spidey action, and some mind- blowing special effects, in a visually stunning and typically sarcastic intro. There is some cheesiness to be taken with the beginning but this won't bother any self-respecting Spider-Man fan. At this point I was expecting more of the same throughout, cleverly broken up by Peter Parker and Gwen's story in order to add an element of realism and something for the female audience... Sadly, it was too much of this and too little of that for me. I spent the entire first hour and a half (that might even be generous) wondering when Spider-Man was going to have his first proper fight scene. Too often I found myself watching Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone going around in circles in their ""complicated"" relationship. A touch of the real is nice but when it's this overwhelming in a film that you'd expect to be pretty action packed, it really just wastes time, regardless of how good the chemistry on screen is.That is my biggest criticism of the film, the fact that it would probably be more accurately titled if it was called ""The Amazing Peter Parker"". However it is not the only flaw. They clearly were not confident enough in Electro as the main villain, considering there is a Harry Osborne/Green Goblin sub-plot. I really do believe that one or the other would have sufficed, with not enough time dedicated to either of the main villains. I think that in terms of screen time, both villains were short lived. The transition from Max Dillon to Electro was fairly quick and we don't see enough of him in action between the first and last encounter with Spider-man. That said, watching him at his best was entertaining, and the combination of incredible effects and a bit of slow-mo in the final face-off was satisfying, if too short and a tad too easy for Spider-man. The Goblin sub plot had even less time dedicated to it and while I feel that it was in preparation for the third film, I also feel that it was a poor attempt at making Spider-man's life that little bit harder. In my opinion the primary focus should have been on Electro's development as a villain, ultimately leading to Spider-Man having ONE seriously powerful enemy to dispose of. This aside however, I do feel they are building towards a sinister six film and so the inclusion of Harry Osborne is likely crucial going forward.In conclusion, the film felt as though it focused too much on the love story, for reasons that become obvious, but it was lacking in everything you'd want to see in a Spider-Man film. The action is good, the effects are unbelievable as expected but the balance is not right. Too much realism and too little spidey is a bad combination, here's hoping the third instalment doesn't dwell so much on The Amazing Spider-mans relationship difficulties. Disappointing, all in all.","16 out of 38 found this helpful.

First of all, yes i am a little biased because i prefer Spiderman to have biological webs versus the home made ones in this version, which brings me to my first point. How does he afford these. It says in the first one that these are from Oscorp so he makes a hooter for them. Great. So we are to believe he is just buying these from Oscorp and no one has noticed their high-tensile strength line is the same thing Spiderman uses on a daily basis? Secondly,. how much power does a high schooler have? Gwen Stacey just say oh yeah I know how to shut down the power grid, no problem. Everything else has no power but good thing this one controller does. Backup generators all over the city are failing but this one thing works. Awesome. Third, Aunt May says at one point that she has to take nursing classes to afford to be able to put Peter trough college. What? She has to pay to take classes so she can pay for Peter too? This is not a good short term plan. Mostly my hatred of this movie lies in the overall story. this just was not a believable comic book movie and i love almost all of the comic book based movies that have come out in the past 10 years or so. This Peter Parker is not the shut out nerd we all love but more like the Emo- Cool nerdish type which is a complete departure from the comics. If you are a Marvel fan then go see this just for the sake of seeing it but I would wait until Netflix or something to do it. Hopefully if they go a third one, it will be much better than this trash. Instead go see Captain America 2, that is worth your time and money to see.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The teen angst is amped up to 11, the romantic pulling and pushing is nonstop and the threats against downtown Manhattan have tripled. Often when bigger and/or louder is the major goal of a movie it doesn't work out so great (see Transformers 2), yet returning director Marc Webb (no joke) handles the increased excess relatively well. The CGI-laden set pieces are, umm, electric and the fights are choreographed with panache, however the screenplay doesn't hold up quite as well. Straining under the influence of four different scribes and a rushed deadline, the plot is tonally muddled and chocked with clichés whilst the dialogue is not as witty and, with the banter between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey especially, less authentic. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's sparky chemistry remains and Dane DeHaan and Jamie Foxx bring their A-game as Harry Osborn/Green Goblin and Max Dillon/Electro respectively, but Paul Giamatti, Felicity Jones and Chris Cooper are all criminally underused. There's a hugely impactful and ballsy plot turn near the end, which would've been a fantastic note to finish on, however its effect is diminished with a bizarre coda that serves no purpose other than to set up the series' next part. Too long and with flaws aplenty, Rise of Electro is nevertheless exciting and humorous in it's own bombastic kind of way.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Writing this now, I'm armed with the knowledge that once again the web slinger will get another reboot in 2017, which after viewing this sequel comes as no surprise.It's not so much that it's a bad film, or a bad Spider-Man film at that, it's just that it feels all very familiar, whilst simultaneously hugging the same pitfalls as Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3. Webb tries to juggle a screenplay with 3 villains (well two and a half really), a tricky romance between Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and of course there's school, a best friend and affairs of the home heart to deal with.The introduction of Electro (Jamie Foxx) is a good move, inputting a new villain into the spidey world is most welcome. Yet in spite of Foxx earning some level of sympathy with the characterisation, it never really works and unfortunately draws comparisons with a certain Mr. Freeze from another franchise. Dane DeHaan comes in as Harry Osborn, soon to be Green Goblin, again the tortured soul act is well performed, but come Goblin time the make up and effects work is laughable. While Paul Giamati as Aleksei Sytsevich - cum - Rhino, is having fun but is barely in the picture.Stone is the best thing in it by far, while Garfield works hard, but there is no getting away from the fact that they both are - and look - too old for their parts. The action is fun and pulse raising, but there's not enough of it to sustain a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes. Though on the plus side Webb and his team are to be applauded for choosing a story line that is ultimately bold and contains a great emotional whack. All told it's a shaky entry to the spidey world, one that once again forced Sony into another rethink. Lets hope the next journey spidey goes on has some clarity and streamlined sense. 6/10","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

The relationships that all the characters have in one way or another on screen was magnificent. (Not only Peter and Gwen but also props to Dane Dehaan as Goblin and Jamie Fox as Electro!! .... Each scene with them was a wow moment) If I only could see part 3 now. The action was a huge step up. This is how I want my comic book heroes to see on the silver screen. Nothing more to say about this part. Well crafted out, epic-moments and emotional moments. I saw it in 3D (only way for this avant-premiere) and the 3D was thanks to the 3D EPIC RED cameras full of depth. It felt natural and after a while you'll forget you have glasses on. It was very immersive and really added a new dimension! Occasionally they used also pop-out 3D. Summary: Big step forward for this Spidey universe. In my opinion best adaption of the comic-book hero.","114 out of 215 found this helpful.

Here, the sequel is bigger but not quite to its advantage. First off, I'll say that Andrew Garfield is excellent as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Even if he's not quite an awkward, geeky character, he at least has the wisecracking down to a 't.' Emma Stone also does an excellent job as Gwen Stacy. And the relationship between her and Peter is done rather well. In general, the cast gives good performances, with a couple of big exceptions though. The special effects are also top-notch, and Electro has a few scenes to show off his powers that really impressed me, even on my laptop.However, the area where this film falls short is the script. I'm no fan of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and they deliver an overstuffed narrative that tries to juggle too many characters and subplots, to the point where several of them feel shoehorned in as fan service. For this film to have been effective, Electro should have been the sole villain. You would have thought that Sony learned their lesson with Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 3, but they obviously didn't. Green Goblin's introduction (and one of its consequences) feels rushed and tacked on to the end, while Rhino was completely superfluous. And to make matters worse, Paul Giamatti completely hams it up in the worst way possible.To touch on a couple other things, the plot is so unwieldy that certain scenes stick out as the contrivances they are, merely excuses for characters to meet and exchange information, or for exposition. Overall, this movie's greatest sin is that it tried to do too much and as a result it was a good half-hour too long. Certain characters and subplots could have been left out so that more time could be devoted to fleshing out the main story. In the end, what you're left with is a visually impressive comic book movie that feels like a stepping stone to something else, in this case a Sinister Six movie. If you're a fan of these movies, or the Spider-Man character, just go ahead and see it if you haven't already. For everyone else, just stick to Sam Raimi's trilogy.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Besides that, we all know that historically Marvel movies weren't as good; although Disney has done wonders to overcoming that stigma. I'm happy to say that I was not only pleasantly proved wrong, but I left with a sense of readiness for the next installment! Anyone that knows the older canon for Spiderman knows that Stone's role is pivotal, and I won't say more than that. Even though I was expecting most of what happened, it was fun to watch it all unfold, and it was great to see certain images in the background of future villains. Keep your eyes peeled for fun gadgets, people! The story moved expertly, the acting was on par, and the filmography was all done very well. Stone and Garfield kept the awkward teen chemistry going, which is exactly what I liked so much about the two of them in the first one.I'm honestly having a hard time saying much about this movie without giving anything away, so I'll simply say this was a great moment in single-hero Marvel Movies.All of that being said, there are always some cons to go with the pros. There were parts of the movie that felt slower than they had to be, not because I was being told any great point of story; it actually felt more like filler to me. I feel like the role of Osborn/Goblin should have been more significant than it was, and I hope the lack of gravity for this character means we'll see A LOT more of him down the road (this was hinted at, but again ... trying to avoid spoilers). Finally, I really feel like I need to know more about his parents. Not really for the plot of this film, but just based on how interesting and tangled (pardon the web pun) the back story could get.Losing two points might seem harsh for a bit of slow story and the less-than-there Goblin role, but I stand by my 8/10. It may be a personal bias, but the Goblin was one of my favorite villains and, in my opinion, one of the more important. Being both an enemy and a friend - a frenemy, if you will - makes me feel like we missed a lot that could have been.","30 out of 50 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the first Amazing Spider-Man, though I didn't think it was nearly as well done as many of the other Marvel-based films. Unfortunately, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 did not even meet my fairly low expectations.The absolute worst aspect of this movie is the writing. Every single character arc felt extremely unnatural and awkward. I found myself not caring what happened to any of the characters, including Spider-Man. The majority of the lines in this film were extremely awful. I was painfully eager for nearly every scene to be over so that I could gain some respite from the awkwardness and pointless nature of the scenes. The first film was campy, sometimes annoyingly so, but overall, the story was well written. That is not the case with this sequel. The only redeeming aspect is that there are about 2-3 scenes where the jokes are genuinely funny.Another aspect that was immediately annoying was that the action scenes felt chaotic and hard to follow, especially at the beginning. It seemed like they were all too close; as though someone had zoomed in too far with the camera. I did not notice if this continued throughout the film because I honestly stopped caring about the results of any of the conflicts less than half way through the movie due to the awful story.Even with low expectations, this film did not even prove to entertain. It was simply difficult to sit through.","32 out of 89 found this helpful.

Eventually deciding to stick to his promise to her deceased father (Denis Leary) of keeping her out of his business, he is soon thrust a further set of challenges when his sudden new best friend Harry Osborn (DeHaan) reveals he needs Spider-Man's blood to save his life, Jamie Foxx reeks havoc as the villainous Electro while trying to piece together his father's past.While I commend Webb for trying, his efforts to strand all these plot points together hinders the film more than it helps. It's comparable to trying to cram twenty DVD's into a stack which hold 19, it just doesn't fit, unless you cut parts off the other DVD's to make space. This is exactly what Webb does. If you have viewed the trailers, you will realise already that many scenes did not make the final film due to the scenes being removed; this is most probably due to time restrictions on the duration. However, rather than delivering a complex and engaging story-line, Webb leaves us with numerous unfinished - some rather basic - plots and sub plots.Expanding briefly on this point, I would like to commend Dane DeHaan's performance. An excellent young actor for sure, his lines and performance throughout gave his scenes gravitas, and were the engaging. In interviews prior to the release, he stated he ""doesn't think I'll ever have a character that has this big of an arc (again)"" and that Harry is ""completely different"" from at the beginning to what he is at the end. This is true however that character arc to me felt very rushed and not very complex at all; judging by the edited out scenes I'm guessing there was a beefier run through of his transformation which unfortunately as viewers, we were unable to witness.Instead, Webb focuses on his hit-and-miss villain ""Electro"", the touching relationship between Stone and Garfield (on the screen, although maybe off also) as well as the dreary recollection of Richard Parker's past.Let's begin with ""Electro"". To me, his inclusion feels like a CGI prop to be perfectly honest, for the most part, while Jamie Foxx doesn't really feel suited to the role of this flying electric ball (this is from someone who thinks he's a great actor, and loved 'Django'). The romantic scenes - as you may expect - are done remarkably well by Webb with his experience under the helm of '(300) Days of Summer' playing a key factor here. He also chose the cast for Peter and Gwen with great precision as the chemistry is clear for all to see. Both these factors deserve commending. The sub slot however of his father and his dealings with Norman Osborn feels half baked. A James Bond style opening is followed by a rather uninteresting reflection on what makes Richard Parker such a good man.One final qualm is the action sequences which feel labored and never particularly engaging. Battles with Electro are just an overloaded CGI frenzy while the Paul Giamatti's eagerly anticipated Rhino makes an appearance for about two minutes (in costume). Equally irritating is DeHaan's appearance as the Goblin being very short and its fair to say his transformation leading up to that was hardly detailed on the final cut. However, having focused on the criticisms, the majority of the cast were first class and the on-screen chemistry between Stone and Garfield was a lovely touch. DeHaan steals the show with his performance as Osborn (which fills the cracks about his character development ever so slightly) whilst most importantly, I can look to the next installment with optimism. Optimism stemming from a cliffhanger ending, more DeHaan and a host of possibilities for Garfield to forefront.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

This instalment is another sequel, in another reboot of the Spider-Man franchise and one of my most anticipated films this year.. so far.I went with my 8 year old son and we chose to view it in 2D, to appreciate the scenery chewing web-flight sequences (and they are the best I've ever seen in this series). Apart from an electric eel staring at the camera, I could not see any part of the film that would be improved by wearing chunky spectacles. The tagline is 'His greatest battle begins' but we soon discover that the battle is not between Spiderman and his enemies, but between Peter Parker and growing up.Webb is determined to stamp his mark and set this reboot as the one by which all else will be measured. He begins his character driven movie by introducing a previously (in film) unknown backstory concerning Peter's parents. While it adds another level to the drama, it does feel a little forced and somewhat unnecessary, but it is only part of the many strands that makes this outing a treasure-trove of studies on relationships.The main thrust of the story is the love triangle between Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker and Spider-Man. They are stepping cautiously into adulthood, and have serious choices to make about their professional, romantic and superhero futures now that they are leaving high school behind. Gwen is unsure if she can cope with Peter's fear of what may happen if they stay together and Peter is haunted by his promise to Gwen's father to keep her away from the dangers of his new life and the conflict this creates within himself. It is evident that Peter loves being Spiderman almost as much as he loves Gwen. It is a credit to the director and Andrew Garfield that we feel his pain at the cost and weight of the role as he considers the impact of it upon those he loves. The theme of 'with great power comes great responsibility' is Spidey's USP and it ramped right up in this film. The relationship between Gwen and Peter is portrayed with a casual grace, depth and believability (their real life coupling crosses naturally into film) and the on screen chemistry between Garfield and Stone is palpable. At times, the fact that the actors are so credible stops the film descending into laborious schmaltz.Andrew Garfield is excellent, both as Peter Parker and Webby, and conveys his alter ego with humour and cheeky charm. We really get the feeling that Spiderman is always just Peter Parker wearing a mask. It is by far my favourite portrayal of the friendly neighbourhood web-slinger.The love theme and exploration of the interaction in relationships continues with all the main characters. Max Dillon thinks he is a nobody and falls in fan-love with Spiderman after he rescues him, telling him he needs him. Harry Osborn loves Peter after the shared experience of childhood abandonment creates a bond between them that remains strong despite ten years apart. Sally Field's Aunt May is perfect as a woman struggling with the loss of her husband and the growing up of the nephew she raised. There is a spark between them which showcases yet more truthful chemistry between Garfield and his co-stars. I laughed out loud twice during the film, once when Aunt May almost catches Peter out during a Spidey twist of the cliché of a teenager almost getting caught in his bedroom and the other was seeing Spider-Man in action while suffering from the dreaded Man-Flu.With the exception of Rhino (who is a nonevent), the villains, like Sandman and others before them, in the Spidey universe are victims of circumstance and do not choose to become villains. Rather they allow life, rejection, betrayal and anger to shape them. Max Dillon's (Jamie Foxx) change to Electro is a little disappointing. Despite his power, there is little spark and his demise fizzles into the background. Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan - looking impishly cruel yet vulnerable) makes a late but show stealing appearance as the Green Goblin.At just over 140 minutes, it is a little too long, especially during the middle section which provides the emotional vehicle for the finale punch. I turned to my son several times during action sequences and said 'here we go', only for the film to return to its character driven core. It is essentially a love story with some superhero action scenes, whereas I tend to prefer my Spider-Man to be more.. Amazing. However, I sense that is all about to change and after the ending teaser for The Sinister Six, I'll definitely be at the front of the line for The Amazing Spider-Man 3.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"6","/10","""Not the treatment our friendly neighborhood Spidey deserves.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3007955/?ref_=tt_urv","anilgamer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur51896943/?ref_=tt_urv","1 May 2014","High-octane action sequences and mind-blowing fight scenes were not enough to save the day from loosely presented content and clumsy story. At first, I was pretty excited to experience the new Spidey movie which was creating a lot of buzz. After all the trailers indicating 3 overwhelming Super-villains in one movie and announcements like ""HIS GREATEST BATTLE BEGINS"", I was quite sure that they must have learnt from the shortcomings of the previous installment and right choices will be taken for creating a better sequel. BUT, I was WRONG. This movie moves away from the being called a Superhero movie. With all the right content in the basket to make a superb 142 min blockbuster, the movie fails to pull the right chord and falls straight in the category of average. The 142 min run-time felt stretched and slow at times as the story presents emotional melodrama most of the time rather than putting other important and relevant stuff. A movie which had a potential to be the best Spidey movie till date but in the end it turns out to be a wasted opportunity.Would like to mention some positives after all that rage outburst:The 3D is really Awesome. The chemistry between Gwen and Peter. Spiderman feels fantastic. The best on-screen Spidey display till date. And last but not the least, the only part true to the word amazing were the breathtaking action sequences and fight scenes. Superb, fantastic and mind-blowing. Especially, the electro-soundtrack combo was too good. Really liked that concept. And that's it.Now lets look at the lots and loads of shortcomings: > It's a Superhero movie, Not a Chick Flick - How about putting some more time in developing the Super-Villains with story and character rather than keeping them on standby. > Creating the tense hero-villain relation which spreads the sense of threat and calls for Superhero treatment. Even this core stuff is seriously missing. > Peter Parker is a boy who tries to balance Spidey responsibilities and life as a normal guy. One who cannot hold on to a regular job, is short of cash, gets exploited at Daily Bugle by J. Jonah Jameson and lots of other troubles. That boy was nowhere to be found. > The Super-villain Trio - Electro, Green Goblin and Rhino was completely wasted. > Electro as the main antagonist is seriously wasted. His story and character development falls short and heavily underdeveloped. > Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn/ Green Goblin felt like one of the things done right in this movie. But the screen-time and space, which a villain like Green Goblin deserves is messed up. > Rhino is nothing more than a cameo. Simply putting, I didn't feel that sense of threat from Super-villains which is at core of any Superhero movie.When it got over, I was blank and disappointed. Tried to gather my thoughts and felt that lots of things were pushed and tried to fit in a single movie. But the effort to tie them together failed miserably due to over-emphasis on the emotions part taking away the space from more important and relevant stuff. One more thing which I would like to mention was the kid scene towards the end - the only emotion which was genuinely felt. Want to focus on emotions, bring more like this one instead of going for melodramatic ones. Was this made just to set table for the next one?? Was this a remake tried making a bold move to make a difference. Well if yes, it Does Not.Verdict: This one was better than the sequel but still disappointing. Feels like a rushed movie which tries to aim lots of targets with a single bullet but fails big time due to heavy overdose of Peter and Gwen Melodrama. I went to see a superhero movie, not a chick flick running around action sequences and wasted super-villains. This is not the Spider-Man movie fans deserve. A one-time watch which will fade from the memories soon.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

With expectation high despite the seemingly mediocre Amazing Spiderman it seemed impractical and implausible to believe this film would be any different. Yet with promises of a better script and storyline, it seemed as if the series was about to live up to its initially thought potential. This was already hyped up more so by the pretext of a more intricate storyline which was implied by the previous film's ending. So it proved. The storyline was better, and the bonus of empathy with villains really did not hurt its compelling case.

In addition to this and in order to spice up the story a bit our hero has to come to terms whether his relationship with the girl he loves is viable or to terminate it so that he can protect her.Aside from the rather unsophisticated storyline, the spectacle will not disappoint. It is both bold and ambitious with spectacular effects giving some grand action scenes.When I went to the big screen, I went to see some eye popping action and to a satisfying extent, this is what I got, so I can slightly overlook its faults.","5 out of 20 found this helpful.

Overall enjoyable. Storyline is good and expands on a few things from the first film. Performances from the main cast are good,especially DeHann as Harry Osborn. Some of the supporting roles could have been 'played down'a little though ( the governor/scientist in the prison being a prime example). However whilst watching the film I couldn't help thinking that I had seen the film already. Basically there is so much that has been put out online and in the numerous trailers that have been done, that i felt that I had seen every set piece already. This spoiled the enjoyment for me. I realise that I could go in without having viewed any of the saturation coverage for this film over the last six months or so, but sometimes I wish that the film makers would keep some of the best things back for the actual film. So a solid 6/10 rather than a probable 8 or 9 if they had kept some surprises for us.","4 out of 16 found this helpful.

You know me, a super-hero tart, my inner fourteen year old usually laps this stuff up (see my review of Winter Solider here) but Spidey, both in this incarnation and in the Tobey Maguire juggernaut, leaves me a little cold. Of course I'm being churlish. The visuals are incredible, the script sparkles, the acting is excellent. The 3D worked harder here, but it should really with the subject matter. The film opens with the familiar spider logo flexing on the screen as it becomes part of Spidey's suit as he plummets to the New York streets webs a-flying! Amazing. The story's good too, deeper than previously, but Spidey is still basically a teenager and precisely the things that appeal to that demographic put me off. The macho Roger-Moore-as-James-Bond patented good guy banter that punctuates the comics is here too, undermining the visuals and the reality - (yes I know it's a story about a boy bitten by a radioactive spider so it's not meant to be real!). When you're flying about trying to pick up lots of bouncing glass vials of plutonium would you really joke with the bad guy driver of the stolen truck? A suspension of disbelief too far - perhaps Spiderman just needs to secure it with a bit of his web.Andy Garfield gives a much more emotionally nuanced Spiderman and Emma Stone does a great job of being the sassy, clever and kick-arse heroine - she certainly has more dimensionality than Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson in the nerdier Tobey Maguire re-boot. Sally Field is a better Auntie May as is Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben, in fact the acting is seriously up a gear in this new re-boot with Jamie Foxx as Electro and Dane DeHaan as a slow-burning Green Goblin. But it still doesn't emotionally grip or have that slantways satirical lilt of the Avenger Assemble or Iron Man. And I think that's it, I love a Marvel superhero movie but I do like the satire, the great one- liners, the gentle mickey take of itself. Spidey's bad guys darknesses are undeveloped and untwisted, yes I know they're that way in the comics too. I want darker, nastier and altogether more conflicted bad guys I think and the Spidey Universe seems a little too simple. But The Amazing Spiderman 2 is brilliant entertainment with wondrous effects and explosions and lots of running, leaping and jumping. The little kid who used to watch the Spiderman cartoons as a kid on ITV would have totally loved it. Spiderman as a concept totally loved, brilliantly brought to the screen and envisaged, as good as this particular franchise gets. It is just that the original comic book didn't really delve into the depths like some of the other characters in Marvel. Does this lukewarm review mean I'm finally growing up? God, I hope not.(Four stars ****)","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was a little bit disappointing. The first 20 minutes are really awesome, the 3D conversion is pretty good. But, of 140 minutes of movie, only just 40 or 50 are of Spiderman saving New York, and doing some great stuff. The rest, it's only romance, and sub-plots. And it gets to annoy. At least, Raimi's trilogy had some New York aerial shots. In this movie, almost everything is CGI. The fights are good, but, too short. And,in some shots, the CGI looks extremely FAKE. It's good, but not that good. It's not epic, and it's absolutely forgettable. Yes, I admit it take my breath in some shots. I'm not saying that Raimi's trilogy it's best, but the every fight with Dr. Octopus is Spider-man 2 it's just... epic. I like the visual style of Marc Webb, it's like a comic book. And for that, I can forgive him. After all, it's not his fault, it's the writers fault.

Alright! May 2nd 2014 is approaching towards us, it's the day when our friendly neighborhood Spiderman will be hitting the silver screen once again with its freshest sequel to his 2012's reboot ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"". I got my hands on the pirated copy of The Amazing Spiderman 2, few days back, it's available on the Internet. Yaikks! Piracy alert! Yup, I downloaded it because I couldn't resist. The promos were so compelling and consuming, I just wanted to quench my irresistible desire for the web slinging action.This is not the first review on the Internet for this movie and people have called it ""perfunctory"", ""Waste of Time"" and ""Insipid"". But at the same time people have also given it glowing reviews calling it ""Inception of a great movie series"". I was blown away by the first Sam Raimi's Spiderman Movie and I was quite disappointed by the reboot that happened 2 years back. However, I think the director Mark Webb has hit the right spot this time. Andrew Garfield shines as both Peter Parker and Spiderman. The one thing that stands out in the focus light is the ACTION! It's just phenomenal, some of the scenes are breath-taking and you will be completely engaged when the Spiderman jumps and slings from one building to another while dodging a homing missile at the same time kick goons and showcasing his acrobatics before he lands on the ground!When I saw the trailer, I was pretty sure that this movie is going to suck really bad as Electro is not something that fanboys would consider before Venom, Mysterio or Carnage but I was completely wrong. They've given Electro a fresh perspective, and the thing which really got me riled up for Electro was its presentation. I have one word for Electro's outlook ""COOL"", you will see its transparent skin under which the lightening is swimming and his eel like facial structure, everything about electro was a fit!The trailers posed 3 villains, Electro, Hobgoblin ad Rhino. And when I saw it, I thought it's going to be a crowded movie and the story won't be able to do justice to all the villains due to time constraint. I won't say the movie is not crowded but its not congested due to many villains, its because of the dragging emotional plot of Peter Parker. The plot goes back and forth on the same family and love-angle topics so many times that you will start to feel hammered. They could have just removed extra emotional culmination points.When it comes to super villains of this movie, in actuality, there is only one villain who got proper screen time, that's Electro. Rhino got the shortest, hobgoblin was hovering off-n-on. There are some really charismatic action scenes in this movie that every fanboy or even the fresh audience must watch. The action scenes are properly choreographed and they are long enough to consume the audience with almost nil shaky cams! Just an personal background - I have enormous hatred for unnecessary shaky cams during an action sequence, which are being used a lot these days to make it more engaging and I totally believe that it takes away the thunder of scenes and abundantly irritates the audience. Back to review - Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's chemistry felt organic. Spiderman's humor was an untouched subject in Sam Raimi series, but here it is evident and actually works perfectly! His quips will actually make you giggle at times. Jamie Foxx has done a spectacular job in being the Electro! By the end of the movie, you will also palpate the assembly of the ""Sinister Six"" in the story line for future films.Verdict time! - The Amazing Spiderman is a fun movie to watch much better than its 2012 predecessor. The story could have been optimized and focused. There are sections of movie that will make you hate it, but the action scenes of this move will make you love it more! It's not going to be the best movie of 2014 but surely it is the beginning of something huge! I will call it ""Watchable without Ganja"".","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

After opening with a pretty good prologue, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a downhill trip from there & follows Peter Parker enjoying his life fighting crime as Spider-Man but having hallucinations of Gwen Stacy's deceased dad whenever he is with her. But soon he has other things to deal with as new villains in town arrive starting with a Spider-Man obsessed fan who after a mishap mutates into Electro. Next comes Harry Osborn who later transforms into Green Goblin & last we have Rhino but the less I talk about this ass-wimp, the better it is.Director Marc Webb tries to do so many things at once in this sequel that the movie as a whole becomes entangled in its own webbing & not a single one of its sub-plots come out as well as one would've liked. The screenplay is dull, camera-work is more focused on 3D experience than contributing to the story, editing leaves so many unnecessary scenes in tact, VFX is where most of its quarter-billion budget seems to have been expended, the entire plot has no sense of direction, characterization is poor & even Hans Zimmer's music fails to deliver this time.The very few things likable about it is the new Spidey costume which now closely resembles the comic books look, the Gwen/Peter chemistry that's on or off throughout the film, Peter/Harry friendship that should've been further explored & the scenes involving Aunt May which feel most authentic on an emotional scale. The recurring cast has done the same job they did in the last film, adding nothing new to talk about in this one. Jamie Foxx hams his way through as Electro, Dane DeHaan has better moments as Harry than Green Goblin & Paul Giamatti's Rhino is far worse than imaginable.Oh n don't be blinded by the false advertisement as Electro plays the main villain, Green Goblin is present only during the final moments but not for too long & Rhino almost doesn't even exist in this film. On an overall scale, the 2nd chapter of this needlessly rebooted franchise delivers another lackluster cinematic experience & proves that the team has learned nothing from the mistakes it made in the last movie. Adding more extravagant elements into its production only to later end up choking on it, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is far less amazing than what it's selling itself as. Do yourself a favour & waste your money on something else.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Jamie Foxx starts to give an electrifying performance but we never really understand his hatred of Spiderman. Surely he should take out his anger on Oscorp who made him like this and stole his ideas.Still the villains set up some action packed finale, however you feel once Electro is dealt with the Green Goblin will show up leading to another overwrought and frankly dull showdown.New writers have been brought in for the sequel but there is nothing fresh her just a run of the mill action film and not a good one at that.","17 out of 45 found this helpful.

There are some problems with it though. The Character of Electro was very poorly written and his motivations were very weak. He didn't really feel like a character and felt more like someone for Spider man to fight. Some of the Special Effects were not very convincing. The shots of Spider Man Swinging looked like they were pulled out of a video game. And there was just too many subplots and too many characters in the movie. However the action Scenes were quite exciting, the emotional scenes were touching and some of the characters were very compelling. Harry Osborn is a very strong character and you really feel His pain throughout the movie. The relationship Between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy was very well done. And this is an entertaining movie. Most of the Characters are likable and the pacing is good. Its not a masterpiece but its a fun ride. I'd say check it out. Just Don't expect it to be as good as something like The Dark Knight.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In the beginning when Spidey is swinging and doing his thing, we get this one camera angle which seems to be the POV of his balls. I wonder where they put the camera. Also, all the scenes where Spidey interacts with the NYC's residents, were awesome!Now the bad things:Too many sub-plot spoiled the movie. The sub-plots take a lot of time and don't really offer anything new. The main plot takes its toll because of that. Electro and Harry both turn into villains for apparently no real reason. Electro's digital VFX looked awkward in a film that's basically shot on film. Marc Webb, get back the Red Epic already! The movie switched genres often and that made it hard to follow. it didn't make it feel like a whole film but rather a compilation of scenes.Hans Zimmer really got it all wrong in this one. Playing TDKR in the opening plane scene and then playing the General Zod dubstep for Electro. Look we respect you and all and also you scored the awesome track of Inception, but really you can't use the same thing in all your movies.The cinematography was very contrasting. The swinging and aerial shots were awesome! But the action scenes had way too much flashing of lights and shaky cam, (which really is being overused nowadays).Verdict : As a guy whose favourite superhero film is Spiderman 2, TASM 2 is really a big disappointment. But if you went in with very few expectations, you might as well like it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I just literally watched this movie. What are we in 2022?? CrazyThe first time I watched this movie. First of all. I'm a die hard Spider-man fan. Even if the movie is crap I'll go watch it in theaters. Like just have toAnyways. This one made me so mad that I walked out of theaters. So I never really saw the whole thing.Fast forward 8 years. I still was kind of bummed when I started it. It's really corny at first and then Gwen comes along. I'm like oh here we go more teenage dramaBut dang! Emma Stone can act! I mean she kept this movie grounded. Even with dealing with the Russian and Max. (Max really brought me back to Jim Carey's Riddler. That's how much I wanted to skip it)The dialogue between her and Andrew is beyond anything Tobey and Kirsten had. I got into it.And Harry Osbourne. I was very surprised. From the cover he looks like an Emo version. But he has strong motivation in this movie and he feels real. Like a rich friend I could have. I mean yeah he played the part well.The ending is sad. Not gonna spoil it but even though I was mad at the writers, they redeemed themselves through Aunt May and Gwen. It really tied it altogether.It was corny and over the top many times but it felt real. It really felt real.So for that reason I give it 6 stars. Not the best Spider-Man. That still goes to Tobey in Spider-Man 2. But this is like number 3 or 4 for me including the Holland ones.So yeah give it a try. I'm glad I finally did. I actually just clicked purchase on ITunes.

"4","/10","This pointless waste of a sequel is even worse than the first one! But, is there any redemption here?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7626812/?ref_=tt_urv","TheHonestCritic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66610649/?ref_=tt_urv","8 December 2021","""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" (2014), as if one pointless reboot film wasn't bad enough. They had to vomit this worthless sequel in our mouths! Not surprisingly, this ""movie"" sucks and is even worse than the first one. Being the Spider-Man fan I am, I decided to give it a chance. I thought to myself: ""yeah, these film makers have should have learned from their mistakes. There's plenty of room for improvement!"" Sure enough, it's every bit as terrible as the first one and even worse in most aspects. ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" has a convoluted and dull storyline, average to horrible acting, and a generic predictable soundtrack to try and tie this diarrhea stain together. The plot is, Spider-Man/Peter Parker tries to investigate the death of his parents, while at the same time protecting Gwen Stacy, dealing with the villainous Electro and even the return of his childhood friend Harry Osborn/Green Goblin. Even those aren't all the villains, no, he also comes across the Rhino! Right off the bat, just from reading the story synopsis, it's obvious how overly complex it is. There are way too many subplots and too many villains. It's all too much for one movie! But, that's only scratching the surface. The plot is forced and for the majority of the time, next to nothing happens. That's right, a ""film"" as overstuffed as this one has next to nothing to offer, and it just leaves you feeling empty in the end. On top of that, it's just boring and unpleasant to watch. At 141 minutes in length, it's longer than the first movie and every second is completely wasted. I'll tell you one thing, the end credits were a sight for sore eyes! Granted, ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007) had three villains like this ""film"". That being said, that movie is written and executed so much better than this trainwreck. ""Spider-Man 3"" gets the job done, and then some. One thing I always say is, you can't put too many villains into a movie. I always say, one or two villains max is sufficient enough. Anything more than that, is way too much and it leads to convoluted execution as well as unresolved storylines. Now, it is possible to have more than two villains in a film. But, you have to be an expert when it comes to writing the script. Otherwise, the movie will inevitably crash and burn. Bottom line, everything that occurs in ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" could have been split into two, if not three standalone movies. It's in the same boat as ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016). Just like the way that film suffers, why did they squeeze so much into just one movie? Why? The golden rule of film making, is to always keep it simple. With simple plots, the audience gets more invested in what's going on. Unfortunately, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is the epitome of convoluted and complex. As for the acting, it's just as horrible as the story. Of course, Andrew Garfield's acting sucks, which is a given for the movies he somehow gets roped into. If you thought he was bad in the first one, you haven't seen anything yet. Just looking at him on the screen makes my skin crawl, let alone when he speaks! Pretty much every single syllable uttered from him just makes me cringe painfully. Now granted, I'm sure Andrew Garfield is a nice person in real-life. He just needs to pick a different career! Sadly, most of the acting from the rest of the cast is pretty much just as bad as his. The only ones who seem to be trying are: Emma Stone, Sally Field, Jamie Foxx, Felicity Jones and Campbell Scott. Everyone else is just awful with their attempts at acting. The sad thing is, most of these actors and actresses do well with their acting in other films and shows! What happened to them here? As far as the soundtrack goes, it's about as generic as you can possibly get. The most shocking thing about this film score, is that it was written and composed by Hans Zimmer, Pharrell Williams, Johnny Marr, Mike Einziger and Junkie XL. Yep, you're reading this right, five people composed the music for this ""movie"", and it still came out terrible! How is that possible? You would think that at some point during the writing and composing, one of them would've said: ""hey I don't like the way this sounds, maybe we should make some improvements."" The film score does have some decent parts. But overall, it's just a huge letdown. Not even Hans Zimmer, one of my top ten all-time favorite film score composers, could save it. Maybe the good parts were written by him? Who knows? Any way, let's move on to the only two good elements in this piece of crap. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in New York City! As far as the special effects go, they are well-done and still hold up today. Which is no surprise, being made in 2014! ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is nothing but an entirely pointless sequel of a pointless reboot franchise that nobody asked for. Just thinking about this ""film"", as well as the first one, just makes me feel unclean. I'm struggling to give this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Obviously, telling you to stay away from this ""movie"" should be clear enough based on my review. But, should you feel the need to subject yourself to this waste of cinema, be sure to bring a barf bag. The only bright side is, I'll never have to watch this ""film"", or the first one ever again!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

He didn't want what was to come to happen, but He knew it had to happen.The same sentiment is echoed in ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"", as we find ourselves knowing deep down exactly what has to happen, but we don't want it to.For comic book aficionados, or at least people who know anything about the comics, we know exactly what we're referring to, but you still have to see it for it to sink in. Which is what makes this film, in one sense, a very powerful story and a strong addition to the franchise.On the other hand, this film is suffering from the same affliction that ""Spiderman 3"" did: sub-plot-itis.We have Max Dillon, an electrical engineer with serious social issues who becomes Electro, Harry Osborn, Peter Parker's friend who eventually becomes the Green Goblin, and then we have the whole Peter-Gwen Stacy- Spider-Man trio going on all at the same time.There's one more villain that gets thrown in at the very end, but let's not beat a dead horse. It seemed that the people at Sony and Columbia Tristar have forgotten the lessons that forced them to reboot the Spider-Man franchise in the first place.Make it, and fans will come. Don't try too hard, or you'll end up shooting yourself in the foot. Again.While this film hardly does that, it does sound a word of caution to the creators. There is certainly sequel material, but look what happened with 'third time's a charm' last time.In short: fans of the comics will love this film. Serious film buffs may not like it for its fairly shallow and predictable character development. However, by the time you leave the theater, you will be filled with conflicting emotions over what you just saw.And that's a good thing, in this case.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

""The Amazing Spider-Man"" movies with Andrew Garfield are superior to the Tobey Maguire ""Spider-Man"" films. There. That's out of the way. Trust me, I grew up with the original Maguire ""Spider-Man"" and the nostalgia factor keeps them close to my heart. However, substance and visual effects staying power they lack. I give it up to BOTH ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" movies for introducing audiences to lesser known villains. It was a risk, and most people didn't like it, but it pays off to viewers who want to appreciate something different. The acting in this film was hands down the best in any of the 5 ""Spider-Man"" movies to this date (therefore, not including Tom Holland's films). Garfield gives everything to this role and the story of Peter Parker is told so humanly and organically with this film. The growth in character makes sense. Not just for him, but for Gwen Stacy as well. Talk about a great change. Unlike MJ or Gwen Stacy from the Maguire films, this Gwen Stacy actually knows she is intelligent and won't allow herself to sit in a corner and be sad for 2 movies straight (sorry, not sorry - but that was literally MJ in ""Spider-Man 2 & 3""). Anyway, the connection between Garfield and Stone is undeniable and incredibly relatable. I love the introduction of a ""new"" villain (Electro) and bringing in an ""old"" (known) villain (Goblin). The visual effects are beautiful and a work of art, this movie is 8 years old now and it looks like it was made this year. Now, stopping comparing them to the first Triology. These films are wonderful. Great acting. Great character development. Great stories. Great ""new"" (and ""old"") characters. Great takes on developing story arch's. Wonderful visuals. A must see film. Worst thing to say, once in a while, I felt the movie drag out scenes a little too long. But I'd say that happened, maybe 3 times throughout the whole movie. Again, this was like watching a comic book come to life and play out on screen. No characters were wasted or thrown in out of ""fan service"" (Gwen Stacy in original). Characters stayed true from first film to the end of this film, unlike the original Triology movies characters (who changed dramatically for story purposes only and it was jarring from an audience perspective). Overall, this is a great movie. I think #justiceforgarfieldsspiderman needs to become a trending tweet, cause honestly, he's pretty fantastic!","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

The best parts of this movie are when Gwen and Peter are together. The villians are lackluster. Electro was horrible and completely ridiculous. They try to make you feel bad for him which is done well in some pre-Electro scenes but falls flat in other scenes. Green Goblin was atrocious and turning him into an actual monster was blah and unnecessary. The mentally disturbed version would have worked a whole lot better without the hereditary disease monster transformation. Overall, it's a miss for me and a one and done viewing is enough.

For starters they cram in three underdeveloped villains, none more so than the Rhino, who literally appears there for about 2 seconds. No seriously, they just cram him into the final five minutes of the film with about 2 seconds of actual combat and as soon as Spider-Man is actually about to land a punch the film immediately ends. I honestly think it should be illegal for them to even include the Rhino in the adverts and poster if he is given this much screen time, under false advertising. Similarly, the Green Goblin is often ranked as the number one villain for Spider-Man in many polls and again was given just one short 3 minute fight with Spidey before being defeated. Electro actually had some development but it actually undermined the characters motives: basically he was a huge Spider-Man fan met him, saw that Spider-Man was on a big TV and decided to try and kill him (no seriously, this is exactly what happened) It was also cringe worthily cheesy during any actual slight sniff of combat: including Spider-Man pulling down a robbers underwear and wearing a firefighter's helmet when stealing a hose to spray Electro There are so many other plot holes and flaws it's best to just list the main ones here or I'll be here all day, so: 1. Electro looks and acts nothing like in the comics (particularly the fact he's a black guy in a hoodie) 2. The Rhino is a robot that appears for 5 seconds 3. Spider-Man has an infinite supply of his webbing 4. Oscorp is literally the most ridiculous company of all time, they almost killed everyone in the city on countless occasions and even mention how they had to get rid of all animal experiments only for Electro to be turned into what he was by some fish (another animal) 6. Harry has no understanding of any medical science whatsoever and is completely oblivious of any possible problems with just injecting himself with a random blood/chemical sample. 7. Gwen acts as if she's already secured a place at uni when all she is doing is being interviewed and then the second the interview is over they send her on a jet to England 8. A mother decides to send her kid to watch a terrorist shoot at police and destroy the city just because he likes to dress up as Spider-Man. Overall, a horrible mess of a very cheesy movie compounded by the 2 seconds of action involving the Rhino. AWFUL!!!","30 out of 92 found this helpful.

I wasn't disappointed. This did what a good 2 movie should do, it gave us a really good villain. Electro was a great villain, who was very menacing. Harry Osborn was another great villain, and he had a clearly explored back story and motivation. Combine the two and you get the perfect villain. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are still in-arguably great as the leads, and their chemistry together is top-notch. The effects are even better this time around (which is really saying something), and these are possibly the best effects I've ever seen. This movie keeps a great tone, in that it has some funny moments, but it knows when to be serious, and that's the tone I want from a Spider-man movie. I'm still not 100 percent sure how I feel about Gwen's death. It made a nice conclusion to the series, but if they had wanted to make more, they would've needed Gwen alive. There are a few too many plot-lines, and that's why I rate this a bit under the first movie, but I still give the story a thumbs-up. In conclusion, I think this movie was really good, with great characters, perfect visual effects, a good story, that occasionally got too muddled, and a good tone. I was really sad to hear that this great series was getting thrown out to make way for another bland MCU movie with forced humor and no tension. This could've been one of my top five favorite trilogies of all time, now it'll be my favorite double-feature. This was a great send off to a great series.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Here comes the Spiderman. We all love this theme song from the Spiderman TV series. Apparently, Spidey loves it too, so much that it is his ring-tone in The Amazing Spiderman 2. As like the previous film, Andrew Garfield's Spiderman is straight off the comic books- lissome, smarty pants, witty, and affable, everyday hero. The people's hero. But is it his greatest battle? Not really, even though he had to stop Electro, Green Goblin and the Rhino, all in the same movie. Like most superheroes, Peter Parker's struggles are within himself, to balance his obligations for his friends and family and his extraordinary responsibilities to New York City as Spiderman. With the back-story kind of done with in the first movie, director Marc Webb does not waste anytime but cuts straight to the chase. And chase it is in a breath- taking sequence as Spiderman saves bystanders, cops, foils a plutonium robbery while talking mushy with Gwen Stacy, at the same time. Things are not all hunky dory though, with Peter consumed with guilt over the possibility of Gwen being exposed to his adversaries, and his continued disturbance over his parents' disappearance. Adding to the volatility is the origin of his perhaps his most popular foe, Electro, and the emergence of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn.First the good- it is a great thing whenever Spidey is suited up. For when he does, he is either inducing guffaws with his one liners, or taking us on a roller coaster ride with his slow motion acrobatics and creative uses of his web-slinging capabilities. Andrew Garfield is a GREAT Spiderman, full of joi de vivre. Radiating nervous energy and childish enthusiasm, his chemistry with Emma Stone's Stacy is excellent. The visual effects are amazing, and the villains are suitably over the top, with Jamie Foxx's Electro getting maximum screen time, a hilarious Paul Giamatti as Rhino, and Dane DeHaan who turns into the murderous Green Goblin by the time you blinked. New Yorkers seem to love a show clapping and cheering their hero, and like a pro wrester, a show it is that Spidey gives them, every time a maniac pops up. People familiar with Spiderman canons will know the fate that awaits Gwen Stacy and so the rest of the movie plays out like a sappy teen romance drama, and largely a popcorn affair.The bad- there is too much happening. Two is company, three is a crowd. Three villains is an overkill, though in deference, Rhino just makes a special appearance in this, promising more in the next film. The narrative suffers from being the second movie in a planned trilogy, as a result it asks more questions than it answers. What is up with Richard Parker? What secrets will the hidden laboratory hold? Who is the man in the hat? Why is Oscorp the center of all mayhem? There is a deluge of superhero films, and I have a feeling The Amazing Spiderman 2 will get lost in the crowd, because it is good, but not great. No worries though, redemption coming right up in 2016, and villain list is set to include the Rhino, Vulture and Doc Ock- 7/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And I'd describe that with some pros & cons.It was a very efficient adaptation and I appreciate that about it. In addition to web-slinging, wall crawling and a Spider sense, we also get witty banter with villains and criminals alike as well as a suit upgrade. As a huge fan of the comics as a child, my biggest attractive characteristic of Spiderman is his ability to churn up amazing one-liners with super-villains even in the midst of unfavorable circumstances. In the previous movie, the attempt at this was a hit and miss and very tacky at best but Andrew Garfield seems to have done his homework with this one.All actors did a very good job. I didn't find the non-action sequences a drag & they did well to drive the movie forward. My star performer is Jamie Fox as well as Sally Field.As for the tone, Spiderman is not Batman and most certainly not the dark knight either. A brilliant teenager with spectacular superhuman abilities on the big-screen... In my opinion, its allowed to be a bit over-the-top and not quite as childish as other reviewers claim..On the other hand, the big screen effect could have been more amazing without half of the movie being included in the trailers. There was no room for surprises. Non whatsoever. Not even in the climax battle. If for anything, the end battle was anti-climatic as I've seen it in the Trailers over & over again.The worst part for me was the climax battle. It was so crammed up you could hardly figure out what's happening anywhere. It just seemed like a skits show of visual effects blitz.Better than previous installments but couldn't match Spiderman 2.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This follow-up to The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) seems to have the mission of throwing as much onto the screen as possible. There are not one, but three key villains, a teenage love story, a deathbed scene, numerous moments of soul-searching, a stream of wise cracks and puns, the most outrageous laboratory setting, a cartoonish evil doctor accent, the furrowed brow of Aunt Mary (Sally Field), flashbacks and video of the mysterious father, teasers for future movies, and of course, enough action and special effects to ward off any thoughts of peace.Personally, I find Andrew Garfield to be a nice fit as Spidey, but I just can't buy him as ultimate science geek Peter Parker. He bumbles about and bats his eyes too much for my tastes, and can't stand toe to toe with Gwen Stacy (real life squeeze Emma Stone) in scientific banter. Still, the original story is interesting enough that any minor issues are easily overlooked.At its core, this entry is a story of revenge. The foundation for Peter Parket's troubles all stem from Oscorp, so we are treated to some behind the facade sets that will keep viewers on their toes. After an initial face-off with bad guy Aleksei Sytsevich (a maniacal Paul Giamatti), we see the transformation of goofy Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) into the shocking (get it?) Electro. If that's not enough, childhood buddies Peter Parker and Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) are reunited to set the stage for more good vs evil.The story would have benefited from more concentration on any of these three stories, while dropping one altogether. The viewer would have benefited from a slower jolt (one more!) in the transformation of Max to Electro. We needed to find the humanity, rather than just desperation. The same goes for Peter and Harry. The dots are a bit too far apart for connection, though DeHaan (so good in Lawless and Chronicle) is a striking contrast to the doe-eyed, beautifully coiffed Garfield.It's nice to see Stone's Gwen portrayed as a smart, ambitious young woman who also understands how demanding a relationship is, and the responsibility that goes with dating a superhero. Speaking of responsibility, the lack of Uncle Ben's influence here is disturbing, though probably necessary given the exploration of backstory on Peter's parents (Campbell Scott, Embeth Davidtz).When Paul Giamatti reappears near the end as Rhino, it's a bit difficult to not think ""enough is enough"". And oddly, this fight sequence ends abruptly, evidently setting the stage for future Spidey. And speaking of the future, the end credits scene plays as nothing more than a teaser trailer for the next X-Men movie, while robbing us of any details to the Sinister Six.Admittedly, I feel somewhat overdosed on Superhero and Comic book adaptations, yet the action and effects are still quite fun to watch, even if director Marc Webb (Ok, that pun is too easy) seems to jumble up too many story lines.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

Why? Because we (30up) remember all too well the 3 Raimi films. They were good. No, they were more than good. So here we are now. It's 2014 and we find ourselves watching part two of this pretty unnecessary re-boot*. Why unnecessary you ask? Well... Spider-Man 1 was a wonderful film. In two hours Sam Raimi introduced us to the beautifully crafted world of Peter Parker: - Peter turning into Spider-Man (entertaining) - His job as a photographer and his awful boss (good comedy) - Mary Jane Watson (fit the part nicely) - Aunt May (could she have been any sweater?) - His friend Harry O. (good fit) - Norman Osborne/ Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe was the perfect choice)Sam found time to fit all of this into the first movie and it fit perfectly. That was some beautiful storytelling! The flow, the action, the cast... Awesome. And he pulled off the same with part 2!!But those days are gone. With The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (and one), we get similar elements put together in a different way, but not in the same quality. It feels like one of those dance-floor remixes of classic songs. They are new and shiny and (by some people considered) cool, but really you just wish they would play the original.My summary? The Amazing Spider-Man is not a bad movie... it's just inferior to the original in every way possible. That's it.*Don't think that I'm against all re-boots on principle. Total Recall didn't bother me at all. It's just that a re-boot should not be done with franchises that are 5-10 years old. That's way too early. (Hear that 'Fantastic Four'??)","5 out of 25 found this helpful.

I see all the bad reviews saying bad things about spidey, about Andrew Garfield and comparing this to Twillight. I really do not get those people. Let me tell you why.Firstly because Andrew Garfield fits perfectly for the role of Peter Parker and also does Emma Stone for Gwen Stacy. A real, honest love between these two characters. It is so powerful that I felt it when they look at each other, talk to each other and in every other romantic scene. I know you expect a great superhero movie with a lot of action, with a good villain but this movie is something more than just a superhero movie. This is a really great romance that in the end it almost made me cry. Another thing about this movie is that I really like the villain and Jamie Foxx was really good at being Electro. Not much action and battles between spiderman and Electro but that is what makes this superhero movie so special.And the last thing may contain a little spoiler(do not read it if you want to watch the movie for the 1st time). It has an really amazing twist at the very end when Gwen dies and like I said it almost made me cry. So I can not wait for the 3rd movie of this trilogy.","29 out of 49 found this helpful.

It was exactly as I have come to expect a Marvel movie to be: ridiculous bad guys, stunts, explosions and a bit of back story to keep us relatively interested. It does exactly what it says on the tin; I think if you REALLY criticise it, then it's not your type of film anyway.That said, the dialogue was not particularly snappy, the plot was utterly predictable and most of the acting wasn't that great. Jamie Foxx went through the motions (as much as you can when you're playing an electrified bloke with a vendetta) and every time I look at Andrew Garfield I see Andy Murray and think to myself ""boring"". Dane DeHaan was suitably unhinged as Harry Osborn but unfortunately had very little back story, and Emma Stone was, as usual, gorgeous. I did however find myself a bit bored every so often when I saw ANOTHER long shot of Spidey jumping off a building.It's not a bad film; just that there's not much point to it. If you're looking for explosions and stunts with no obvious plot, this is perfect.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The first reboot, I kind of like it. But like my guess, this TASM 2 mess every thing up. After seeing the first trailer I thought it seemed like a total mess, and I wasn't convinced by Electro one bit. Unfortunately I was spot on, I hoped to at least get an enjoyable time at the cinema with my friends, but ended up feeling quite uncomfortable and laughing throughout most of the film. Garfield and Stone has their chemistry and does their best with the incredibly thin script and cheesy one-liners, but their potential quite beautiful scenes together gets lost in the over-full and messy plot. I can't buy an emotional scene that is interrupted by heavy dub-step and a blue electric guy. Their love scene is to much for me, It like see another Twilight film in the theater. I don't like Mary Jame of the first trilogy, but still love the emotion from Peter to her. And About the villain, Electro - stupid, dumb ass, don't know any word to described it. Green Globin - Jerk, Peter don't give you his blood so you wanna kill him, after use the poison you still wanna kill him WTF. With this villain, how it can't be better than the old Spider-man 3.The point I like is the battle, yeah It is good, can't deny it. Spider man is funnier, smarter, but can't look like a nerd in comic book so good like Tobey, and how this nerd can't make the most beautiful girl in the school love him, show me please :D. But CGI look like a video game. Can't wain the last of this mess up Trilogy.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I walked in the theater with semi-high expectations, because I read some reviews and was skeptical about it. However, it was actually fantastic, and is definitely going in the best Marvel movies ever made. I was surprised by the performances of Dane DeHaan(Green Goblin), and Andrew Garfield(Spider-Man), both fitting their roles very well.The special effects are spectacular and imaginative, particularly the web-slinging scenes and Electro's skin. I have an issue with Paul Giamatti's performance as Aleskei Systevech/Rhino and the Sony marketing, but TAS2 is still very awesome and underrated. Even my mom enjoyed it, who doesn't like Spider-Man!

I really enjoyed the first of the franchise and thought they really nailed Peter Parker and Spidey.The movie itself is a pretty solid, super hero action flick. The film looks great, the action sequences are good and you are (in your head) cheering Spidey on! That being said I found Max/Electro a pretty dorky villain. I'm not convinced he has enough of a reason to use his newly found powers they way he does. The crescendo also came across a little half baked in points.There are some nice references in there for comic book fans to spot.All in all it's a fun ride and fans of the first will no doubt enjoy it. Just don't expect it to break the molds of the superhero genre.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

There's just too much internal turmoil for this type of thing.The Story outside the Personal Stuff is OK and there are layers upon layers of interesting happenings. Jamie Foxx's ""Electro"" is flashy and fantastic at times. The CGI is bright, glaring, and gaudy, but works nonetheless. There are many other Characters in an around Osborn Corp. Harry (Dane DeHaan) shows up. So does His Dad briefly. Oscorp is shown to be an Evil breeding ground for present and future Super-Villains like Rhino, who makes a Cameo and there are hints of others. Overall, an acceptable entertainment, but these Comic-Book Movies have become such a huge part of the Cinematic Lexicon that expectations are high every time out and Fanboys are always pushing for perfection.This one was considered a Flop, both commercially and critically, and #3 is a no go.

Unfortunately, in contrast 'The Amazing Spiderman 2' turned out to be the lowest earning entry in the franchise. To put in a few straight words, the movie was drab and dragged across its span of 142 minutes unlike the previous stints. The movie starts with an incident in the distant past of Peter Parker, explaining the circumstances of their missing in Peter's childhood. The movie then takes a leap into the current life of Peter Parker, a man in his 20s.This jump can surely be uncomfortable for those viewers those who have not watched the prequel of the sequence. This movie tried to impart sense of humor by gimmicks like 'Spiderman ring-tone in serious situations', which disturbed the action and didn't fell in well with the audience, at least me. It looked cheap and undesirable. The movie has logical lapses at some places that decreases interest in the movie. Peter's first meeting with Max(one of villains known as Electro) is one such instance. The movie tries to bring in romantic elements but they die out before climax or conclusion. Intense action scenes are also lacking in the movie, unlike the previous versions. Thus the movie fails to quality either as ""action"", ""romance"" or ""thriller"" or ""tragedy"". During the later half the movie becomes predictable and there is nothing much left for the audience to speculate. The movie also has some positive points. It is a good watch for those who are those who are ""die-hard"" spider-man fans. The Cinematography in the movie is awesome with some breath-taking shots. It could have been another blockbuster, had the story been more absorbing and realistic.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The thing that captured my attention in this movie is that it doesn't feel like he is acting, it's feels like that is his actual personality and traits.The same can be said with Emma Stone. When those two share a scene together, it's like they aren't acting at all.This movie has a lot of foreshadowing to the future Spider-Man movies and the planned spin- offs and even references and small appearances by characters that may or may not live up to their comic destiny in this universe.Something I also liked was the new Green Goblin costume. This version has a sense of realism to it, something you can see an actually villain wearing, not some cartoon character costume like the William Dafoe/James Franco costume looked like.There is a scene between Peter and Aunt May that is just remarkable! Certainly shows you why Andrew Garfield is where he is now and why Sally Field has been nominated and won so many awards in her acting career!If you are a fan of comic books and/or the first Amazing Spider-Man, well you probably would have already seen this, but if you haven't than you should get on that! This will definitely be a Day 1 purchase for me.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I love Andrew Garfield as Pete Parker and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey as well as some of the varies side character like aunt May. I really loved the first Amazing Spiderman when it was released. I loved seeing a new much more believable take on really every character that was in the original Raimi trilogy (peter, Gwen, aunt May and Uncle Ben just for example). I found all these characters to be very likable and actually useful and intelligent unlike in the Raimi trilogy.The amazing Spiderman 2 definitely had a lot of the things I liked about the first one for example the creative way Peter uses his web shooters. I love watching him do things like putting his finger over one to make it shoot web in 2 different directions or like in the first movie when he used his web to find the lizard. I also like how Gwen Stacey is actually useful unlike Mary Jane. It's cool to see her try to find ways to help peter when he battles against the bad guys. I suppose its not official or anything but I think that aunt May knows Peter is Spiderman which is really cool because I'm pretty sure people close to him would be pretty suspicious.One thing that I really missed in this movie though was the lack of some of the side characters from the first one in particular Flash. I really liked how he started out as a jerk but turned out to be an okay guy.It was a smaller detail but I really liked the dynamics between him and Peter and I was hoping to see more of that. i have heard rumors though that Flash will become Venom in a future film so I hope that that is the case.Now I just want to give my opinion on some of the major complaints that I have heard.1. To many villains with sloppy under developed story arcs2. To much romanceI completely understand where both of these complaints come from but I have to disagree with them both. The Amazing Spiderman 2 was really more of a set up for future installments in the franchise which I know irritates people. For me though being a BIG fan of following long running TV shows and waiting all season for the big pay off of each season for whatever show I'm watching this did not bother me about the movie. I don't mind at all that this movie had a lot of set up because IMO it was an entertaining movie by itself as well. As for the romance all I really have to say is I didn't mind it because Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone work Pretty well together.So overall I really enjoyed The Amazing Spiderman 2 but I liked the first one just a little bit more. I also realize that I did a fair amount of trash talking about the Raimi trilogy which means that this review will automatically be rated down by a lot of people who see it... but oh well it's just my opinion on the 2 separate franchises.I give The Amazing Spiderman 2 an 8/10","31 out of 53 found this helpful.

There are a number of really good ideas, scenes and performances, but they're all held together by an over-stuffed and under-cooked story that clunkily moves along for a mind-numbing 142 minutes. It's curious that with that much screen time Webb is unable to work in rather important aspects of Peter's life, such as going to college (which is barely even hinted at, let alone shown) or his job with the Daily Bugle.Instead, the focus becomes split between the admittedly well handled love travails of Gwen and Peter and the development of two entirely new villains. Real life couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are quite good as the web slinger and his best gal, while Dean DeHaan manages to make co-villain Harry Osborne scary and sympathetic at the same time. Unfortunately his partner in crime, Jamie Foxx is horribly miscast as a milquetoast techno geek who dreams of becoming as popular and beloved as Spider-Man. Even worse is Paul Giamatti, who is downright embarrassing in a smaller role that is obviously a set-up for the next film.Like the drama, the action is also polarizing. On one hand, it's over-stylized and relies too heavily on slo-mo gimmickry, but yet it's thrilling to swing along through New York city with Spider-Man.Ultimately the 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is bogged down by trying to spin too many plates and undermined by a misplaced, and ultimately dissipated, focus.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Upon seeing it, man I was right, a lot of villains to begin with, too noisy for the action sequences, and too convoluted for the story line. Although I find the actions sequences truly amazing, the acting was as well superbly done; the only drawback was that the story lack depth like what happened to the conclusion of Raimi's trilogy. There was also this one scene where Electro (Max Dillon), played by the Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, emerges for the first time and I couldn't quite put it if the whispers of outrage obviously voiced by him was part of the musical score or not. This was somehow awkward because it seems like he was rapping it along with the music. There's nothing quite much to hype about this movie except that it stayed true to what happened to The Amazing Spider-Man comic book issue number 121. This movie could have deserved more treatment and more substance. Overall I would rate the movie 3 out of 5 stars.","3 out of 16 found this helpful.

The beginning was set up with maybe to much hype for the villains. On that same note though when the fight scene first started I was really into it because of the anticipation that they built. For the fight scenes two things I personally didn't enjoy. Firstly, they were incredibly short for the amount of build up they had leading into it. Secondly, the scoring was either really spot on or horribly placed and both happened within the five minute scene. The start up of the fights had this music playing with what were like whispers in Jamie Foxx's character head that was there for what seemed to be more build up but was so unneeded. The last negative piece for me was the slow motion bits. Yes the 3D value of these shots were stunning but that's why they were there, to be cool 3D moments. Anyways in all the movie was far better then the first and overall a very good Marvel superhero movie. Pros: Great use of villains. Not having them all jump in at once. Awesome cinematic work Story backing was well written Cons: Long winded beginning Short fight scenes Over used slow motion effect Various scoring problems","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Well maybe it might be down to money and director's vision ? Regardless of why there the narrative dead end of having to set up the characters once again . Anyone going to see a Spiderman film will know who Peter Parker is . A geek boy who leads a double life as Spiderman , a web slinging , roof top bounding crime fighter with special powers who takes on villains who use their own special powers as a force of evil . Because of my own familiarity of the backstory and premise I didn't bother wasting my time watching THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN from a couple of years ago since I'd already seen the trilogy by Sam Raimi a few years earlier so didn't want to watch a film whose runtime is going to be going over old ground and only watched this sequel because of a chance to watch a recent blockbuster for free There's not a lot here that can be called groundbreaking or original but for what it is - a big budget Summer blockbuster - it functions very well . I do consider Sam Raimi as being one of the most underrated directors in the last couple of decades and while Marc Webb might be an inferior director at least Webb knows how to make a marketable Summer film . I definitely found Andrew Garfield a more impressionable Peter Parker/ Spiderman than Toby MaGuire . Garfield job is made easier by having his Spiderman make wisecracks which never becomes as silly as it could have been . Garfield's smouldering good looks and his character interaction with Emma Stone's Gwen Stacey is obviously produced to rope in the TWILIGHT demographic but I thought this aspect worked fairly well . It was also nice to see Peter Parker/Spiderman have Harry Osborn / The Green Goblin as an equal of sorts . The downside is that Jamie Foxx Electro seems shoehorned in as a subsidiary villain , and at the end of the day THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 is nothing more than a big budget superhero blockbuster though it's a superior and likable one","3 out of 17 found this helpful.

It wasn't.Let's start with the positives. I liked Electro's storyline and the fight scenes between him and Spiderman were awesome. I liked the opening chase scene and the chemistry between Peter and Gwen. I also liked Peter and Aunt May's scenes. Now let's move onto the negatives of the film. And If you don't want to read any spoilers leave in 3,2,1.Now what I didn't like about the movie. I didn't like Harry Osborn becoming the Green Goblin. Norman Osborn should have been the Green Goblin in this one instead. Another thing that bothered me was the way in which they killed Gwen Stacey off. I would of liked for them to have been more faithful to the comics. I also didn't like Richard Parker's storyline as it was hyped for much of the film but there was no end reward. And I didn't like how they forgot about Uncle Ben's killer. Not cool writers. Not cool.Adding to this I would have liked to seen another movie with Gwen Stacey meeting Mary Jane. They were friends in the comics and it's a shame that they couldn't develop that into ""The Amazing Spiderman 3"". Maybe they can do that in the next Spiderman reboot.In conclusion it was a pretty good movie but it didn't live up to the last one for me.

Perhaps I'm being a little harsh, but if you compare a superhero franchise such as the Dark Knight to the writings of Kurtzman & Orci, you'll understand that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not so amazing at all. These writers had previously worked on such films as the Transformer series, so how could they forget how to write an action film within a year? The typical last second save of a persons life, is literally text book stuff. When will we see something that isn't inevitably predictable? What enraged me was the lack of originality, the poor continuity and excessive/unnecessary use of music throughout the production. I can only question whether the audio department had done their jobs correctly if they believed adding an inappropriate/unnecessary songs would mask their errors. Maybe I'm looking too far into it and in fact it was an attempt to appeal to a younger target audience. Regardless, I didn't like it.For anyone who isn't familiar with Webb's work, you should know that throughout his career, directing action/adventure movies is not a regular occurrence; which is evident within The Amazing Spider-Man 2. It just shows that anyone with a slight interest in action and a high budget can produce a run-of-the-mill action film.By employing just under 400 people within the visual effects department, Marc Webb clearly states his intentions for the movie. Its no secret that the Spider-Man films are nothing less than visually amazing, but when the plot suffers as a result of this you have to question Webb's decisions.Nevertheless, this film was entertaining and the casts performance was exceptional, in specifically Garfield (Spider-Man). I imagine the younger target audience would get out the cinema and instantly be mimicking Spider-Man's web-slinging abilities.","14 out of 40 found this helpful.

On the one hand its a very fun action film with some great performances and great special effect. On the other hand the plot feels like it wants to be so many things that it felt jumbled and lacked focus. The villains were exciting and cool but also felt underwhelming in the ending result. Electro lacked resolution and Harry Osbourne just seemed pushed. Also, what was the point of Rhino? I understand they are trying to setup the Six storyline, but they need to keep the story in one place. Andrew Garfield is the best Spider-Man to ever grace the big screen, sorry Tobey Maguire. Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHann, and the rest are all fantastic as well. The action was beautifully done and Peter Parker's character had some very good development and his wise cracking humor made the film highly enjoyable. Overall while it doesn't tread any new ground we still receive a sequel that lives up to its fun predecessor and proves to be more than worth the price of admission.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film stars: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, and Dane DeHann. The movie starts out great, showing how Peter (Garfield) has gotten used to being 'Spider-Man'. He's protecting New York's citizens, putting it's bad guys behind bars, and being the friendly neighborhood hero we all know and love. He is also in the midst of a complicated relationship between him and Gwen Stacy (Stone) involving Peter's hesitance to involve Gwen in his dangerous job as Spider-Man. And before long we meet the films antagonists, Electro (Foxx) and Harry Osborn (DeHann).Coming out of The Amazing Spider-man 2, I'm weighing out the good and the bad. This movie has its fair share of both. For example, the movie has some great action sequences, making use of stunning visual effects in the process. But these scenes are too short and too few for a 140-minute movie. This, in turn, makes the movie feel sluggish and slow to the point. Fortunately performances by Garfield and DeHann pick up the slack. There is a major improvement in Garfield's acting since the first of the films and DeHann plays a compelling Harry Osborn, even if his darker side as Green Goblin doesn't get as much screen time as Foxx. Which brings me to another downside, Electro. Electro's role in the movie is questionable, as he hardly gets any screen time himself, and doesn't measure up to his evil accomplice, Green Goblin.As a whole, Amazing Spider-Man 2 has some good acting in it, looks great visually, and is good enough to make an entertaining addition to the Spider-Man franchise.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

After seeing how much better the first one was than the originals... I couldn't wait to see this one. Well, it was definitely worth the $15 dollars (the additional 4 dollars because of it being in 3-D) I enjoyed every second of it. If you are familiar with the comic books you unfortunately are going to know what happens. But it adds to the story and the ending makes you wonder about the future. Dane DeHaan played a Fabulous portrayal of the Green Goblin... Better than William Dafoe? I don't know, it's a possibility. You be the judge. Paul Giamatti played a good criminal/Rhino when he had the chance to be on screen (which was rarely). And Jamie Foxx did a tremendous job as usual playing as the loner Max a.k.a Electro a.k.a bad ass super-villain. This movie makes you think big time about the future of Spider-Man and also... Who his future opponents are going to be. I extremely recommend watching this in 3-D.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"7","/10","TASM2 still engages and dazzles despite narrative overcrowding","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3015770/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie_Muse_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2496397/?ref_=tt_urv","14 May 2014","As the world's most popular superhero, Spider-Man is the poster hero for the resurgence of the superhero genre at the movies, but these days he's hanging there by a strand of webbing. When Sony gave Peter Parker a reboot in 2012's ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" they became the first studio to recast and reimagine an entire (and lucrative) franchise, and therefore ran the first experiment to test audiences' reactions to a reboot with the original so fresh in their memory.Results have been all over the board, and they will likely continue that way for ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2."" With the Spider-Man origin story out of the way, director Marc Webb and a large team of story architects including James Vanderbilt (lone remaining writer from ""The Amazing Spider-Man""), Jeff Pinkner (TV's ""Fringe"") and the infamous blockbuster duo of Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (""Transformers,"" ""Star Trek"") had the freedom to explore new ideas and grow the scale of the Spider-Man universe.As advertised, Spider-Man battles three baddies in this film: Electro/Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), Harry Osborn/Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan) and Aleksei Sytsevich/Rhino (Paul Giamatti). Although the film narratively manages to avoid the villain overcrowding of the late-'90s ""Batman"" films and ""Spider-Man 3,"" it's far from ideal.As with the Lizard in the first film, these villains stem from Oscorp, which truly emerges as evil's central address in this rebooted Spider-Man universe. The opening sequence further establishes Richard Parker's connection to Oscorp, which is completely revealed in this film after being heavily teased in the first.Along with the villains and their plots and the mystery of Peter's parents, there's Peter himself and his journey as Spider-Man, his journey of discovering the truth about his parents and his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). It's probably enough material for two 90-minute films, but it's presented instead in one 142-minute film. Something does give, but surprisingly, it's not the Peter Parker stuff, or the emotion.Webb makes the cut as an action director to be sure, but his real strength is in creating character chemistry and realistic romance. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are special together on screen, which might have something to do with their off-screen chemistry, but regardless, their performances – particularly together – are the movie's greatest asset. What could have been a melodramatic roller-coaster subplot really works because Garfield shows us how torn Peter is between his instinct to love Gwen and her father's stern warning in the first film to leave her alone. Stone's Gwen is a strong young woman who acts for herself first, and so her conflicts with Peter aren't petty, but realistic.But the real testament to both Webb, the casting folks and the writers is the relationship between Peter and old friend Harry, which has just minutes to materialize in a believable manner. DeHaan and Garfield create this honest portrayal of forgotten friendship in only a few key scenes that lead to the crucial turning points of the film. Those turning points are just okay as is, so the work in these low-key scenes proves critical.Essentially, for all the good work done in character development on Peter's end, the dreadful development of the villains acts as a counter force that fortunately only weighs the final product down so much thanks to the good elements.Let's start with Electro. Foxx is cast as a one-dimensional version of his mentally ill character from ""The Soloist."" An Oscorp electrician and huge fan of Spider-Man, Max Dillon lives in his own world and suffers from an inability to separate logic from his emotions. Although the character does victims of mental illness no favors, it's plausible that Dillon could become villainous under the right circumstances. That said, the film's circumstances aren't great, particularly in the realm of why the self-proclaimed Electro would want to kill Spider-Man. Electro is a cool villain aesthetically and the special effects are terrific, but he's comparable with Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze.Although Harry Osborn's motivations make a bit more sense, the film rushes through his character arc. The story asks us to pity him and then despise him with little time to make the transition. DeHaan makes the most of it, however, and shows he has quite the chops for playing a villain.Plopped in all of this is Peter discovering just what his father was up to for Oscorp and why he left him as a child. What we learn makes total sense and satisfies our curiosity to know, but the information doesn't impact the film's climax in any way. Peter does nothing differently – he still must stop Electro and Green Goblin from destroying New York – and killing him.It is easy to get lost in story details and plot points and character motivation, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is also as entertaining as it should be, and more so than its predecessor. The camera-work and special effects are the stuff Sam Raimi probably only dreamed of and take the character (literally) to new heights. The use of slow-motion proves to not be cliché, but to actually let the audience see the quality of the effects, the attention to detail. The action also hits harder – PG-13 seems to be getting more and more graphic, which as a 20-something non-parent, doesn't bother me one iota.With the ""Sinister Six"" – a team of Spider-Man's enemies – coming down the pipeline soon, Sony needs to be a little more thoughtful about how it handles its villains, and they also should consider condensing the many themes and story lines of this new series. With just a bit more focused storytelling, their engaging, thoughtful and entertaining new ""Spider-Man"" could go from good to great, and meet fans' growing expectations of Spider-Man on the big screen.~Steve C Thanks for reading!

This comes with good and bad news. The good, Sony learned that people want a bit of fun with their webbed hero. The bad, Sony figured that Spider-Man 3 wasnt boring so....For those who thought Spider-Man 3 was a bloated, tone-deaf mess, brace yourself!The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is garbage! It's a terrible film that didn't get past basic concepts before being forced into filming. There are 7 or 8 stories, but 0 overall plot. There are so many characters that you only recognise them because of their actors. It's shot like a music video, with enough deleted or altered scenes to make for an entirely different film. The music sounds like Hans Zimmer just came back from a Skrillex concert. And the script was written by Alex Kurtsman and Robert Orci, which is an automatic fail.As of 2022, going by quality alone, this is easily the worst Spiderman film to date. But in a strange twist of fate, this was far more entertaining film than its predecessor, and even more than some of the later Tom Holland ones.Garfield, who was pretty ropy in the first one, finds hit footing here. He is a good spiderman. He comes across as a geeky, joky, friendly neighbourhood hero. Emma Stone has excellent chemistry with Garfield and makes for a good Gwen. Jamie Foxx as Electro works perfectly, despite the characters poorly written origin and motives. Everyone else is doing enough to be fine, while Paul Giamatti is hilariously over the top.When the dubstep doesn't kick in, the music makes for a good superhero theme. When the dubstep does kick in, it's hilarious. The script is so stupid it baffles belief. That means that sometimes it hits the fun camp mark, and others it is unintentionally hilarious. And others it's frustrating or even boring. The amount of sequel baiting is so much that it's clear that to Sony this was less a movie and more an advert for a whole film universe.In the end, if you are going to make a bad film, make it this bad. As terrible as it is, it is one of the only live action, not Sam Raimi made spiderman films I will watch more than once. It has too many boring moments to be a guilty pleasure. But it is an entertaining outing for Spiderman, in both the right and wrong ways.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Personally did not like acting skills of Garfield. Don't think he has done well in scenes he as to engage with Emma Stone. Other scene were quite OK.

It's aesthetics didn't match Sam Raimi's trilogy, despite how bombastic the third one was, but Andrew Garfield was a better Spider-Man, not a better Peter Parker. It was a favourable average film that had a lot of room for improvement but since they announced the second film, I was instantly excited. I was expecting the sequel to have major improvements over the first and my expectations were correct. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has lots of improvements to admire. Director Marc Webb's sequel is bold and bright and possesses charm in abundance. It swings into the future and carries the audience with it. Entertainment is important and this film has it. One thing in the film is noticeable, however, it suffers from a clumsy script.Events begin not long after the end of the first film. Peter Parker is still haunted by the death of Gwen's father and the promise he failed to keep (to protect his daughter by leaving her alone). But in some ways he's moved on, graduating high school, enjoying life and really embracing the role of being New York's protector. Unlike so many superheroes, the identity of Spider-Man doesn't seem to be a burden but a release for Peter – he's confident and cocky with his now-honed abilities. Director Marc Webb presents this brilliantly. The audience are instantly hooked into Peter's life and his responsibilities and this is because of engaging screenplay and playful cinematography, expertly executed. The beginning of the film shows Spider-Man battling on-the-run criminals as part of his responsibility and this gets in the way of Peter and Gwen's relationship. During this chase, Peter saves a man from a car crash named Max Dillon (played by Jamie Foxx) who works for Oscorp, led by Harry Osborn, Peter's childhood friend. The film tries to introduce Max Dillon as a character for whom we should feel sympathy – he's socially awkward, lonely, unappreciated, and since Spider-Man saved his life, he's become obsessed with the hero. Max, shortly after a major accident at Oscorp, discovers that he has powerful electric powers and soon becomes Electro, the main antagonist of the film. This is well told through the detailed, enjoyable but increasingly clumsy script. One thing that confuses me about the film is that the first instalment was supposed to be ""the untold story of Peter Parker"". This film actually shares more untold elements than the first, such as finding out what happened to Peter's parents. Peter's parents are a big part of The Amazing Spider-Man 2's plot, without going into much detail. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 benefits from a lot of good qualities, such as a brilliant chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, a great Spider-Man, satisfying and exhilarating action and well presented villains but also negatively benefits from minor issues. It's childish but emotional script penned by Alex Kurtsman & Roberto Orci lets the film down and frankly, it may be a biased opinion, their work on Transformers was TERRIBLE. There's a lot going on in Amazing Spider-Man 2, and sadly it doesn't always come together because of it's writers. Action, as you expect from a Marvel film, is very good indeed. Spider-Man's abilities are shown perfectly without any flaw in the picture. Music is quite unique and heroic, brought together by Hans Zimmer, The Magnificent Six, Pharrell Williams & Johnny Marr. It certainly sounds good, with high-quality instruments and themes but some material sounds like it came from another movie. The acting is very good as well. Andrew Garfield is a FANTASTIC Spider-Man and is certainly better at his role than the previous instalment. The film positively benefits from a great cast in overall and there is nothing to judge, especially Dane DeHann as he steals the show as Harry Osborn / Green Goblin.Pros & Cons:+ Great chemistry with Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and director Marc Webb.+ Very entertaining presentation and opening. Perfectly judged slingshot ending.+ Great Spider-Man action and great villains.+ Improves the strengths of the first film entirely such as action and presentation.+ Unique and powerful soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, The Magnificent Six, Pharrell Williams and Johnny Marr.Verdict: 7.7 out of 10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The characters were underdeveloped, the story was disjointed,and our web- head spent the majority of the movie stalking his love interest.Electro gets his name and a nice pretty suit out of nowhere just like Peter's friendship with Harry. The dots in this story weren't connected by any means of the imagination.This movie feels like a crappier version of Raimi's Spider-Man 3 re- visited: One cool villain with great cgi, and the rest just sort of rushed and tossed in, (instead of a Crappy whiney Venom we got a crappy cartoony Rhino) thus overloading our hero's plate and our mind's eye.Once again Oscorp is at the center of our movie world and this apparently will be the continuing theme in this franchise, moving further and further away from comic canon.Most of what you saw in the trailers misleads the direction of the entire film, many scenes didn't even make the final cut. Basically if you saw the right trailer, you've seen the end.","11 out of 31 found this helpful.

The Amazing Spiderman II music team exercises an eclectic mix of talent with modern music production and styles and orchestral themes. While the pieces are each awesome, the selections loose consistency to one another. Maybe that's the point because the story is brilliant and as the characters experience victory and defeat, so does the music.The opening piece is fantastic where the modern meets the ""trad"" world and both work together resulting in artistry on the output channel. Then here come the trendy club sounds, glitches and other effects that over saturate the current market for video gamers and midnight dancers.A beautiful sound design could have joined these styles together, but this is what is missing in this film as the score simply goes from one piece to the next. Maybe that's what the director wanted but it misses the consistency mark in sound design. Still awesome though.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The reason for that though was due to Sony's plans to set up a Live Action Spider-Man Universe. So The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was the one film of the series that essentially had to get sacrificed with too much being in it in order to kickstart their future film plans, which was: Sinister Six, The Amazing Spider-Man 3, Venom, etc.PS: I really recommend that before you watch this movie, that you also watch videos critically reviewing it, because after the movie is completed, you'll be shocked as to how far off most of those reviews are. A lot of them nitpick every aspect of the movie that rubbed particularly them the wrong way... You really begin to appreciate the Marc Webb, Andrew Garfield films much more compared to the current team.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

That said, I really don't care for the way the writers, director and editor of this series have cherry picked certain plot elements to change and others to leave intact. Also, I am very appreciative of the excellent acting skills and chemistry the principals bring to the table so I feel like there is a lot of potential wasted here.The two things that really bother me are the pacing and the way the story telling talks down to the audience. First of all, this movie, as well as the first one, in the series, suffer from very long exposition up front and then break into the action later in the film, which is not always explained as well. In this case it causes serious problems in that there are several major story elements late in the film that are not explained and the audience is just supposed to go along with, without sufficient explanation. Also, they just pull some crap out of their posteriors late in the film that makes no real sense and feels like they really have no respect for their audience. Anyway, I have wasted enough time on this turkey already. I will re-watch the Sam Raimi versions over the weekend to clear out the bad taste.","18 out of 57 found this helpful.

Every teaser and trailer leading up to the film got me more and more excited. Heading into the theater I was so hyped up for the film... But I guess my expectations got too high for this Spidey sequel.The cast in this movie was excellent, Andrew Garfield embodies everything I remember from the Spider-Man growing up. He's smart, funny and kind of cocky. Emma Stone put on a solid performance as well, she and Garfield definitely have great chemistry on screen. Newcomer Dane DeHaan was a great choice for Harry Osborn/Goblin. I was pumped when they announced him for the character, mainly because of Chronicle. I was surprised how much Dennis Leary was in this movie though, I thought he was great in the first movie. Jaime Foxx was another person who did a phenomenal job in this movie, his transformation from a bumbling nobody to a villain to be reckoned with was impressive. Finally Paul Giamatti is a very talented actor and I felt as if he was underused in this sequel. He had a heavy accent and had barely any screen time, but his scenes were some of the best in the movie.The movie starts off in the past with Peter's parents and how why they had to leave him as a child. I was surprised how badass his parents were for a couple of revolutionary scientists. After his parents' demise, the film jumps right into Peter doing his thing around the city as everybody's favorite hero. As he jumps, flips, and swings through the city after some criminals, he showcases his cockyness. A lot of physical humor as he's using his superior reflexes and agility to save the day and narrowly making his high school graduation at the same time. Then this is where the movie slows down a little, Peter has to deal with the promise he made to Dennis Leary at the end of the last movie to stay away from his daughter, Gwen Stacy. This throws a lot of guilt on his shoulders because he is blatantly disregarding the promise he made. Gwen and Peter go back and forth with this ""we can't be together"" for a chunk of the movie. This is where Harry comes into play and Peter starts to uncover more about his parents actually reasons for leaving. The movie kind of drags until Max Dillon has the typical pre-villain accident that turns him into Electro. Spider-Man's first battle with Electro in Times Square is awesome. That action was entertaining and unique, the CGI in this movie was well done, especially the slow motion and 3-D. I love when movies nail the use of 3-D and this sequel did, just as the previous movie did. Then Harry takes over Oscorp and digs up all of the company's technology and projects, basically to give him everything he needs to become the goblin. I really enjoyed when Harry teamed up with Electro and wreaked havoc on the city. The movie culminates into a battle at the electric grid where Spider-Man takes out Electro then battles Green Goblin back to back. Peter goes toe to toe with Harry and Gwen gets caught in the mix. As she is falling to her peril Peter shoots his web down after her, only to maneuver through ridiculous odds to only reach her a split second too late. He catches her but she smacks the floor just enough to end her life. This takes its toll on Peter as he gives up his webs and tights for a normal life. Only for it to be five months later and the mysterious man in the shadows from the end of the first one, unleashes Rhino onto the city. The movie ends with the clip played in every trailer of him swinging the man hole cover at Rhino.I would give this movie a 7/10 because it had a great cast and great action, but it just had a big lull in the middle that didn't really do it for me. Yeah I get it, Gwen's gonna die so let's make sure she gets her screen time before then to make it more meaningful, but I'd rather have seen Spider-Man handle business in the streets. On a side note, I am most definitely excited for the Sinister Six movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But since it was the only movie showing, I decided to watch it. I did not regret my choice. The pros: The villains were really good at their portrayal. Harry not only looked like an emo teenager who whispers and sport a goth haircut, he had a real reason to save his own skin. Max Dillon was very pitiful as a villain and he seems to reflect all the teenagers who want to be seen on social media. Max is like a stalker who had a crush on his hero Peter. But when Peter scorned him, Max turned to Harry, because Harry said he needed him, and all that mushy stuff. Gwen Stacy grew a backbone and became a perfect woman who is smart AND beautiful. The movie was also very action-packed and long. Cons: Am I the only one who thinks Gwen is a hypocrite? If she want to be successful so much, why did she lead Peter on when she''s going to England? She seems very indecisive about whether she want to be with Peter or not, and her death, is purely caused by her wilfulness. She is also dressed really unrealistically like for her interview, which made this movie less realistic. Peter also looked uglier than ever, and selfish as always, because he thinks he is doing what he thinks is best for Harry. Well, what can you expect from these ""non best friends"" who didn't talk for 8 years? Overall, if you try to ignore Peter and his whole self-righteousness thing, then focus on the handsome Harry and the pitiful Max, then you will enjoy the movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Director Marc Webb has once again swung us into the world of our favorite web-slinger, and this time, he's facing challenges that will truly test not only his spidey-powers but also his heart.From the moment the film kicks off, you're immediately immersed in Peter Parker's world - the duality of his life as the iconic Spider-Man and his struggles as a young man grappling with love, loss, and the responsibility that comes with his extraordinary abilities. Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker is nothing short of spectacular - he captures the wit, the charm, and the underlying vulnerability that make Spider-Man such a relatable and beloved character.The chemistry between Garfield's Spider-Man and Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is palpable and heartwarming. Their relationship is at the forefront of the film, and the dynamic between them is so genuine that you can't help but root for their love to conquer all. Emma Stone brings a depth and strength to Gwen Stacy that transcends the typical damsel-in-distress trope, making her a force to be reckoned with in her own right.And let's talk about the villains! Jamie Foxx as Electro is positively electrifying (pun intended). The transformation of Max Dillon from an overlooked, unappreciated electrical engineer to the formidable, power-hungry Electro is mesmerizing to watch. His dazzling special effects and intense battles with Spidey bring a whole new level of visual excitement to the film.But that's not all - we're also introduced to Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn, Peter's childhood friend, and a complex character who grapples with his own demons. DeHaan's portrayal of the conflicted and tragic Harry is a standout, bringing a new layer of depth to the Spider-Man universe.And of course, who could forget the adrenaline-pumping action sequences? The web-swinging scenes are breathtaking, capturing the exhilarating feeling of soaring through the city skyscrapers. The showdowns between Spidey and his adversaries are intense and masterfully choreographed, keeping you on the edge of your seat.""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" isn't just a superhero movie - it's a tale of love, loss, friendship, and the choices we make that define us. It's a reminder that even the most powerful heroes have their vulnerabilities, their doubts, and their internal struggles. As Spidey faces down powerful foes and personal challenges, you'll find yourself laughing, crying, and cheering him on every step of the way.In a cinematic landscape filled with superhero movies, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" stands out as a triumph of storytelling, character development, and sheer entertainment. So, grab your popcorn, settle in, and prepare to be swept away on a web-slinging adventure that will leave you exhilarated and wanting more. Because, as Spidey himself would say, ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" and this movie takes that responsibility to heart.**Rating: 10/10 - A Spectacular Must-Watch!**","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Garfield though does kind of pull that off, even though it's very frenetic and does make little sense (other than to be revisited towards the end). Still Andrews Peter Parker is lovable (mostly).There is a sense of overload though and especially the character portrayed by Jamie Foxx is not playing well into all of this. It's a shame, because Foxx has proved that he can be part of a big movie (see Django Unchained), but he's not working here. The motives are clear in the big picture, but the way they do get ""unleashed"" is not realized in the best way possible.Having said all that, the special effects are really good and if you let yourself into it, the movie will take you onto a ride.

Well here we have great actors, great writers, incredibly talented C.G.I artists, an enormous budget and best of all one of the most iconic Marvel super hero of all time and yet somehow they managed to make an unstructured and unbalanced mess out of this movie.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 goes from comedy to intense drama to high speed super hero slow motion action scenes. It takes you on a mood swing trip as if you were a monkey on speed. At first you think: ""Hell yes! Spider-Man! I am in for a ride! Bring it on!"" But suddenly you realize that this movie is completely out of balance. The tone of the whole movie leaves you in a state of confusion. It doesn't seem to be a streamlined movie at all. Where does it go? Do we laugh now? Do we cry now? What is all this nonsense? Of course they have promoted this movie through the roof with showing off trailers and video clips of high tech 2014 ready C.G.I action scenes. It's safe to say that TASM2 looks stunning with crazy super slow motion micro detailed comic book flavored scenes. But at some point it was as if the different C.G.I scenes had to compete against each other to stand out, and therefore they became somewhat of a distraction of the whole flow of the movie. This is also the problem with basically all other scenes. The drama isn't bad, the acting isn't bad, it's good in fact. But they don't build up to it, they just magically appear. We suddenly get pulled out because of yet another deeply romantic love scene or yet another highly dramatic plot twist and I ask myself so many times during this movie: This doesn't make sense at all, and why am I seeing this now at this precise moment, please just carry on with the story! Didn't Marc Webb ever heard of the principle: ""Less Is More?"". It's more like ""more is bigger and better equals more drama, more comedy and let's trow in another bad guy!"" with this flick.In all seriousness, it really felt as if there were too many people involved in making decisions in this movie. I imagine Marc Webb trying to do his own thing in his little working room and suddenly some big corporate Sony guy comes in and says: NO WE NEED MORE ACTION AND MORE SUPER BAD GUYS..! And... errr... EXPLOSIONS!!! And there, we have Marc Webb all teary eyed wanting to just make a 500 Days Of Summer Spider-Man remix. Well Marc, you can't just do your emotional thing and trying to mix and match this with big budget superhero movies. If there is one company that has it down (and I passionately share the opinion of many other true believers) it's Marvel. So Marc or Sony, if you guys are reading this, you have told your origin story of Spider-Man (again), but now is the time to give back the torch to Marvel so we can continue to see Spider-Man in a much greater light.So my score is 4 out of 10: 3 points for great actors (1 for Garfield, 1 for Dehaan and 1 for that subway pigeon that took a giant dump on Emma Stone's head) and 1 point for that Asian guy who made the realistic Spidey fart effect during the swinging scene in daylight NY.","12 out of 35 found this helpful.

First, the good. Peter is far more likable in this movie. He's fun, he cracks more jokes, and seems more in line with the way Spider-Man should be portrayed. The cast is mostly solid. Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, and Sally Field all return from the first movie and shine. Dane DeHaan is very good as Harry Osborn, although the movie would have been better served with just him as the villain and giving him more screen time to build up his relationship with Peter. The action is much improved over the first movie, with some very impressive sequences that stand out. I can't recall a notable action scene from the first movie. I also loved the ending to this one. It was perfect.Now, the bad. Let's start with friggin' Electro, played by Jamie Foxx. Ugh what kind of crap is this? I wonder if this is yet another case of the studio forcing them to add another villain to the movie, afraid audiences would be bored otherwise. Foxx's performance is embarrassingly bad. He seems like he would be more at home in a Joel Schumacher Batman movie. They also give him goofy music in the first part of the film like Otis from Superman (78). Terrible. I hated the look of the character, as well. All too often Hollywood's crappy designers think they can improve upon costumes and appearances of characters from comic books that have lasted for decades. Well, they're wrong 99% of the time and here Electro is yet another example of that. Not to mention Rhino, but I'll let that slide. The video game climax was a bit much, with the CGI Spider-Man looking so cartoony I thought the movie had turned into an animated film for awhile. Lastly, something I didn't like from this or the first movie is the stupid plot involving Peter's parents. I don't think it was necessary and ultimately added very little to either movie.I still recommend the movie because parts of it are excellent and overall the movie works, despite the problems with Foxx and some of the other issues. It strikes a nice balance between light and dark, even better than the first movie did. I just wish they wouldn't keep thinking that superhero sequels had to have multiple villains, especially cheesy ones.","3 out of 19 found this helpful.

The truth does too.""The truth in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is it might cost you over $10 to be bored for 142 minutes. Spidey/Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is fighting the romantic demons once again while powerful enemies are reduced to the status of playground bullies by comparison to the film's minutes. The reboot has moments of humor (Peter Parker: You want me to come down there so you can kill me? Aleksei Sytsevich: Yeah! Peter Parker: OK, I'll be right there.) but just too few. In fact, I may not review another super-hero film this summer just to avoid wasting more hours on these clichéd adventure-fantasies. Marc Webb goes nose to nose with Sam Raimi's earlier trilogy and comes off second place (notwithstanding Raimi's soporific 2007 Spider-Man 3). Although Peter's on again-off again love of Gwen (Emma Stone) is as repetitious as the rest of the film, the moment he allows her to contribute her intelligence to the downfall of Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx), the film becomes charged with honest characterization—she is after all going to Oxford—whereby the old stereotype of the helpless maiden is short-circuited for a moment, but only a moment. Most of the other time she is in need of rescue or trying to break up their relationship, both motifs overwrought and tedious. By the way, Electro is a promising villain, pumped up with energy that can debilitate a city and a character from humble roots, who could have provided fascinating complexity but who ends up just getting too charged up. The special effects for Electro brimming with volts and Spidey spinning through Gotham are as to be expected, state of the art. But a good story is more than CGI—it should engage the minds of bright people gone bad, such as the heir to Oscorp, Harry (Dane DeHaan), who is the new head of the sinister corporation Peter's father worked for in genetic engineering gone wrong and where Max picked up his energy.Harry has his moments, but like Electro, he can't trump the time director Mark Webb and his writers give to the simple-minded star- crossed romance. Webb is far away from the lovely little story of troubled romance he directed in (500) Days of Summer. Maybe when DeHaan fleshes out the Green Goblin, and maybe Gwen returns, then I will be renewed, overcharged as this iteration is with mediocre romance.Peter Parker: There really is no place like home.","3 out of 19 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong I didn't hate it, nor did I regret watching it. I just felt that there was an element of 'seen it all before' in there.I'm not going to go into the plot of a Spiderman film. If you can't guess that our web-slinging superhero star comes up against another baddie then you really need to watch more movies! I wasn't expecting some deep and revolutionary film, filled with perfect character arcs and plot twists, but I did think it would be a little more original than it was.It seemed to want to cater for the 'tween' generation, pushing Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey's relationship to the forefront of the film, as if it was nothing more than a 'teen drama.' Yes, there's the 'fantasy' element to the story of how being a superhero interferes with your 'normal' teenage romance, but when Peter and Gwen are doing their 'make-up/break-up' routine, it comes across as a 'Twilight' movie with more cobwebs.The fact is that a Spiderman movie is at its best when we see Spiderman. Andrew Garfield is much better (and much more interesting) as the superhero than when he's wandering up and down the halls of his school moaning about Gwen. The film-makers really should have learnt from 'Iron Man 3' about how the public feels about superhero movies where the hero doesn't spend enough time 'in costume.' However, when the action starts it gets going. You may have seen the advertising promoting 'three' villains. Well, that is technically true, but the only one you'll really get to know properly is Jamie Fox's 'Electro.' He's the main threat to Spiderman (and the best). And when he starts kicking off then our web-slinging friend is in trouble. Everything is better when things explode. Jamie Fox plays the tragic villain with sympathy at first, before slipping into full-blown menace. The 'Green Goblin' is also in it, but he's secondary at this stage to Electro. And don't even bother mentioning 'Rhino' – he's barely got more than a cameo in the film.It's a long film, stretching over two hours and, although the action is exciting and when it's good it's good, there was still what felt like a lot of 'filler' in there that could have been trimmed out to make it a little less irrelevant.Probably loved by kids and enjoyed by me on only some of the levels it was meant for.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I know its the universally disliked one and probably the lowest rated of any Spider-Man movie but I just love it.Not saying it is without flaw because there sure are a lot of them really. First of all I'm not a fan of the casting of the villains, it just doesn't work for me at all. Which is weird because these were all comic accurate, certainly more accurate than the Sam Raimi villains but the casting doesn't work for me. I guess I might be too attached to the James Franco Harry. DeHaan as Goblin/Hary was the weakest part of the film for me, so much so that had it been completely removed I would've loved it even more and rated it much higher too. It was poorly acted and didn't transition well on the big screen. Jamie Foxx as Electro was certainly more bearable but nothing to write home about. The script is still a letdown and it is messy at times even tho plot progression is not too bad.That is where the negatives end for me and as you guessed it the positives far outshine the negatives. This movie has my favorite score in a Spider-Man movie so far. That Electro theme and the battle music is hands down my favorite piece of audio in any Spider-Man property. The whole movie feels like a videogame and that is a good thing here. It does come off understandably cheesy but it really helps with making Spider-Man be at his best. The powerplant synthesizer battle is also something that tickles the nerd bone. It is an inferior movie in almost every aspect but it is a very good Spider-Man movie. It encapsulates everything we associate with Spider-Man.The fight scenes were as good as ever altho messy at times. But what makes this movie stand up is the amount of iconic moments, something the first movie seriously lacked. One of the most iconic event in Spider-Man canon with excellent gut punch and visceral acting that is often not seen in superhero movies. Excellent chemistry between Andrew and Emma is still the cornerstone of the Marc Webb series. It is also the most comic accurate Spider-Man movie so far even tho it didn't do the movie any favor.Its honestly everything Peter Parker is, all complex emotions presented in movie runtime. This movie gets Spider-Man absolutely right, it understands the character. The opening and closing scene are the perfect representation of Spider-Man as a character. If the last movie was for the comic fans this one is for the videogame fans for sure. I'm a fan of both so worked great for me. There are several moments that I wish were cut from the movie and characters axed altogether, then comes scene where my face glows up because I can see the directors understanding and love for the character. Fan of Tobey Maguire Spider-Man are going to have a hard time with it no doubt but if you're a fan of Spider-Man in all forms and media then you're going to love this despite its glaring issuesRATING: 8.5/10.","12 out of 18 found this helpful.

After seeing about 20 trailers I though I had seen most of the movie ( plus the clips we saw were, to be honest, not the best ) but boy, I was wrong. With great action scenes, engaging characters and an entertaining plot this has to be the best Spiderman movie Sony have made.The story focuses on Peter's personal life throughout most of the movie as he tries to keep a normal life with Gwen and figure out what happened to his parents. The main villain is Electro which is brilliantly acted by Jamie Foxx but unfortunately doesn't get enough screen time. The second villain is the Green Goblin, acted by Dane DeHaan who was not ( in my opinion ) the best choice of casting because he seems depressed most of the time and makes the character rather boring. This film feels like you are watching a comic book rather than a movie, as it isn't all fight scenes and sadness because we see Spiderman save people rather than focus on the villain and destroy everything possible. Talking about destruction, the visual effects look amazing but seem a bit like a cartoon which is rather good to keep the feeling of a comic book.Overall this film is entertaining but doesn't live up to the name amazing. I would recommend anyone to watch it as it is something new and basically a new genre of movie, a comic book movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Does it even require a reboot since last Spider man film released 5 years back only. Why do not they just continue with the same star cast and take it forward. I guess I was right !!!The Amazing Spiderman 2 continues the story of Peter Parkar and his battle petite against highly lethal enemies like Electro and The Green Goblin incepted out of the Oscorp company and the truth behind his father's sudden disappearance.I was slightly disappointed with The Amazing Spiderman as it was dark and shady on contrary to the comical version of Sam Raimi's. Fortunately, I was pumped up to see the sequel thanks to extraordinary and catchy trailer. The movie begins with Spider man fighting the goons with satirical humor embedded which was passable. As the movie progresses, the director loses the focus of the story and includes the romantic track which hinders the movement. The film picks up the steam as we watch the epic battle between ELECTRO and SPIDERMAN which was well executed with eye-catching CGI. The editing is really weak and the screenplay is a roller coaster ride. Though the 1st half is plain, second half gathers some momentum especially the climax fight scene which was well-executed and something to look out for. Cinematography is splendid with superb art direction. Dialogues are fine. Though the story is pretty weak, it is CGI which is highly driven and mesmerizing. Andrew Garfield does fine as Peter Parkar but still I would love to see Tobey Maguire reprising the role which made him famous. Emma Stone was not in form. Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan were good in their respective roles. Overall, The Amazing Spiderman 2 could have better.

Visually grand, with excellent CGI and sound effects, but lacks effective plot and performance-capable characters.This movie is the sequel to the 2012 movie, once again centered on the figure of Spiderman. Here, young Peter Parker is very torn between Gwen's love and the fear that her action as a punisher might endanger her. Then comes a new super villain (well, the whole story about him really didn't convince me, especially when he hates Spider-Man), and it all happens too fast from there.As in the first movie, the characters are superficial and the plot is undeveloped. The cast can't shine, because they didn't give you material for it. To some extent, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are saved for their good romantic match. The fast pace of the film and the way events run over allow no developments or delays. The film is clearly focused on the use and abuse of CGI and quality visual and sound features. Undoubtedly, they are remarkable, but they do not justify the film, which is full of dramatic and psychologically profound moments that the plot then completely wastes to the detriment of the action, CGI and show-off, which is really worth seeing. .Of all the movies about Spider-Man, I think this must be the worst, or one of the worst.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was very disappointed. I gave it a 6 because I think their hearts were in the right place, but their minds were most of the time somewhere else. The movie was so slow in so many spots. Another problem is that things would happen and you would either scratch your head trying to understand more or have a real desire to know a lot more - but you never do. There were some inconsistencies or inadequacies. One of the things movies seem to do these days is have a scene that required the characters to do something quickly and they stand around and talk. You won't be disappointed if you are looking for that. The action sequences were far too fast and at times incoherent. It's like they were trying to see how much animation and special effects they could put in a few seconds. I could live with most of that as I do not expect Spider-Man to be the Great American Epic, but I want to be entertained without having to constantly think about things like ""why did they do that"" or ""that really does not make any sense"". And there are movies that can combine humor with very serious stuff very well. This is for sure not one of them. It was an 8.5 for me until the end. While the ending may have pleased a lot of people or not been much of a problem, for me it sucked the big one in 3 different ways. I won't tell you what they are but let you find out for yourself. While the rating on IMDb at present is a 7.1 for both movies, you will note that the second movie has only about half the votes as the first one. My guess is that word of mouth slowed ticket sales significantly, which reflected in a lot less reviews. At present box office for the 2 movies shows almost twice as much for the original. In fact, add both 1 and 2 box offices together and they are not much more than the total for the original Spider-Man 3. Numbers are adjusted for inflation. If you love Spider-Man because you like the character, this movie will satisfy you. However, if you expect more out of the movie, don't buy it - rent it. It is hard to make a number 2 as good as the number 1. But with just some minor adjustments, this could have been even better. Number one is a 10 in my book. If you do like I did and watch the movies back to back you will be even more disappointed I believe.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a film directed by Marc Webb that came out in 2014. A sequel to the already first outstanding film, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 stars Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker also known as Spider-Man. With his special spider abilities Peter uses his powers to save New York from lunatic supervillains. However, even being one of the greatest superheroes in New York doesn't mean that Anthony Lane from The New Yorker will praise your movie. Anthony states, ""Despite the efforts of Electro, the franchise is running shockingly low on juice."" Something that is completely false as there is so much to cover in this film.Starting from the opening scene we get jam packed action. We start off with finally getting a bit of backstory of what happens with Peter's parents. Unlike the original Spider-Man where we're just prompted with Peter living with Aunt May and Uncle Ben and his actual parents are nowhere to be found or even mentioned at all. Though the scene runs a bit short, it is still nice being able to know why they're gone and not a part of Peter's life.Then we get Jamie Foxx into the mix. He plays the role of the main villain ""Electro"" or Max Dillion, a nerdy engineer who works at OSCORP. Electro goes on terrorizing New York City to get revenge on all those who have ever put him down. Foxx's role made this character 10 times better with his passion into making Max truly seem like an outcast. Though he is a villain we can still feel empathy towards him by the way Foxx shows the character's emotion. Just because Foxx is a bit older doesn't mean that he can't portray a great marvel villain. He instead uses his acting experience to improve on the character.Furthermore, Dane DeHaan's interpretation of Harry Osborn made the movie even better. The way that Harry and Electro both ended up becoming friends made the movie 10 times better through them being able to share similar experiences of betrayal. I feel that the partnership between Foxx and DeHaan was incredible and since they both have hatred towards Spider-Man they decide to take him on making them seem like a great villain partnership.Who doesn't like seeing a web slinging spider? If you're a Spider-Man fan then seeing him back in action is always a thriller, seeing all the stunts and acrobatics combined with CGI really should amaze you. The effects and CGI are incredible. I personally loved Max's transformation into Electro the most. You could tell the editor really took time into making his character. Even with the small details such as the sparks from his fingers to static electricity coursing through his body. His ability to teleport anywhere with electrical currents is astonishing.If you love a film with good cinematography this is the one. Starting from the main hero, the new suit gave Spider-Man a new futuristic look. I really enjoyed even the tiniest detail such as the meter on the side of Electro's head to indicate when he would be overcharging. By making and adding those small details it really can enhance the audience's experience when watching the film.Although some critics like David Sims from The Atlantic said that this film seems to be ""over-stuffed with plot and consequently struggles to invest the audience in any of it,"" I believe that the constant switch between scenes captures your attention even more. Instead of having scenes that bore the audience the director decides to intrigue the audience by having point of view switched from the main hero to the supervillain. By adding the point of view of Electro it helps you understand the character's motive to hate on people further than just by the fact of knowing that he was being bullied. This especially helps if you don't know much about the characters from reading the original marvel comics by giving you a bit more of their background story.For this film to receive 52% rotten tomatoes is a disgrace. This movie is set to entertain people and engage those who like seeing their childhood cartoon characters on film. This film should be enjoyable and meant to make people laugh a little with Spider-Man's jokes. I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone that isn't a comic book marvel fan but still enjoys watching the marvel movies and tv shows. It's always a pleasure to watch the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man on the big screen.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

There is no development in the process to create for the super villains, no way for the people to understand their motivations to be evil, they are just crazy foes. Yes, they seem to follow the comics plot, but a movie is a different medium than a comic book, you can't throw all the possible stuff that happens in the books in several years in just a couple of hours. It's a complete chaos. I think both the direction and the script are just awful. The actors just play fine with the text lines are told to say, but still they look like schizophrenic bipolar people, unaware of the context where they are.","24 out of 82 found this helpful.

The ASM re-creation was trying to achieve the origins of a much darker Spidey (albeit a teenager) (possibly following the Batman re-make success), but, it does not deliver on this second one. Hopefully, the third one will focus on that more.But, the special effects are unmatched, to date! Actually, the special effects keeps one on his/her toes for a good 2 hours!Well worth watching on TV/home cinema, but not something going to the cinema for (humble opinion).","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

When a character seems to run out of steam, one just has to leave him alone for a few years and then re-boot the hero. So, after three ""Spider-Man"" movies from director Sam Raimi, Marc Webb had such a success with ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" that he's back with another winner.I actually prefer Andrew Garfield to Tobey Maguire as the titular arachnid and this outing he's somewhat schizophrenic in mood: astonishingly light-hearted in the face of any villain but really morbid when it comes to family history and current romance. There is genuine chemistry between Garfield and co-star Emma Stone (as Gwen Stacy) which is obviously helped by their real-life coupling.The chief protagonist this time is a sparky character called Electro who had an unfortunate swimming accident with some eels and James Foxx clearly had fun in a different type of role for him. The subsidiary opponent is the Green Gobin whose starring role is obviously being kept back for the next movie in the series, ensuring that we will see the creepy Dabe HeHaan again. I enjoyed the more varied use of our hero's web in this movie for a lot more than swinging from one skyscraper to another. Stan Lee has met Tim Berners-Lee, so that the web has now become world wide.There are three writing credits for this film which might explain why some characters are underwritten. Certainly I would like to have seen more of the excellent Paul Giamatti as The Rhino and newcomer Felicity Jones as Harry Osborn's assistant. So take that as a request for ""TASM3"".","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It maintains (and expands) the humor of spider-man (which the Rami films really lacked), and the choreography is the best yet- Spider-man finally moves like you think he should from the comics (or video games). The villains are over-the-top (again), but for me that's part of the fun. The movie knows it's predictable, and I respect it for just kinda going with it. The acting overall is pretty on target, except from Garfield himself, who doesn't seem to know what to do during the serious scenes.The ending actually kinda surprised me. You might see it coming, but I wasn't sure...I'll give them props for that.Some of the scenes also just look really good- the CGI is *almost* to the point where it can seamlessly integrate into real footage...almost.The music was also pretty good. Not as melodic as Elfman's score, but still a fun addition to the action.Now to get all the negatives out in one paragraph: the dialogue is clichéd at best (lazy or aimless at worst), the tone of the movie is all over the place (is it campy? Is it serious? It tries to do both). The pacing is a bit off- starts with a promising sub-plot that gets a very rushed conclusion. Many characters are seemingly introduced for no reason, other than ""they're in the comic, so we'll mention them here too."" The plot over-relies on forced actions (meaning we see people change from good to bad or vice versa in the course of one scene). There's also just tons of little stupid things that are funny but unintentionally so (cinemasins will have a field day with this one). So overall...I'd recommend it if you love spider-man and just want to see some fun spider-man action, and are willing to put up with a pretty terrible script and awkward pacing. On the other hand, if you hated the ""first"" one this one might not be enough of an improvement.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was produced by Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach.I think many had very high expectations, which is one of the problems I will discuss later from an abundance of trailers that has been pumped towards TV SLOTS in the advertising campaign. One of the amazing things about the sequel, which definitely improved from the previous is the dramatisation. The first 30 minutes of the action flick provided a lot of set-up that was at the right balance and pace. Following a brief opening scene of the titular hero's parents (continued from the first movie), the current picture picks up Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) two years since the death of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Captain George Stacy (Denis Leary), Peter continues his crusade to fight crime as the web-slinger. He briefly humiliated Aleksei Systevich (Paul Giamatti) in a car chase, who with his mobsters were attempting to steal vials of plutonium.After graduation from HIGH SCHOOL with a moving speech from Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), Peter struggles to maintain his relationship with Gwen and the duties as a superhero while trying to keep a promise from George's dying wish to stay away from Gwen. To not let her daughter get between the responsibilities of crime-fighting. However, trouble brews on the horizon as now Peter as Spidey must deal with the return of Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) and formidable Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx).What this chapter of Webb's vision of the movie got right was the threat level. It was exceedingly high as the character of Peter has to deal with his inner conflict with Gwen, the lack of a father figure and the physical duress with three antagonists. My problem with the Lizard in the first trial run was the villain lacked a credible motivation and did not pose much of a challenge in terms of scale. The threat was real but not the intensity. A villain on the lackey axis than mastermind axis.The cinematography and visuals were stunning Sony did a real nice JOB with the special effects and digital animations. There were some mistakes during the edit – I will mention later but Webb's interpretation of the 'spider sense' was smooth. The acting was mostly believable as what cannot be denied is the chemistry between Garfield and Stone. Foxx managed to pull one head out in the role of the fiery, invigorating, Electro and wear the hat of socially inept and cryptic Dillon whilst DeHaan played a very menacing Harry Osborn.There were many problems with The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which did not live up to the hype as seen from the trailers. Although many of the performances from the main cast were at the very least satisfactory to brilliant; with Garfield nailing the Peter character this time around. Stone did well as Gwen, though my problem with the performance was Giamatti as Rhino. There was not much left for the actor to play with as the character and his accent as a Russian was too 'hammy' as Giamatti described. The let-down was the script, not so much story but more so dialogue, which affected parts of Garfield's portrayal in places, as well as the comedy being forced.Unlike Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3, the scope of villains for the flick was not the problem. Each nemesis Spidey faced in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 had a plausible motivation, which knit together in a joint 'arc'. The main issues were time to unravel major plot points and character development. Leave R.H.I.N.O. out of the picture, but in my opinion, Harry's transition from C.E.O. of Oscorp to crazed lunatic as a result of induced mutation through chemical mutagens felt rushed. The pacing was a lot better this time round but was a bit rapid.Another one of the many flaws this has is the fight choreography was quite weak here. First round with Electro was too easy (forget the water there is actually a scientific explanation in regard to salts in the water used to short-circuit). I won't even get into the second round and the fight against Green Goblin could of been a bit more of a struggle. It seems a lot more thought was put into the set-up to the eventual formation of the Sinister Six (look this 'team' up).Performances from Garfield, Stone, DeHaan and Foxx were mostly admirable but were affected by clunky use of crying-out-loud quips of dialogue. Best lines were ""Let's go catch a spider"", ""Yo Sparkles!"" and ""You don't give people hope, you take it away! I'm gonna take away yours!"" Aside from some out-of-place shots and underwhelming fight scenes, the visual effects, set-designs, props and costumes were stunning and the soundtrack was helped to be spectacular thanks to Pharrell Williams and Hans Zimmer's magic, even a nice end-credits wild-track from Alisha Keys and Kendrick Lamar was terrific!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It wasn't bad, but it seemed as if this movie felt very forced with many unnecessary scenes. It definitely wasn't edited properly. There are many mini plots and scenes that have no significance. At times I felt like this movie had to fill out a checklist of scenes that had to be in the movie even thought they don't fit into the story, which they are many. The acting was great. Dane was my favorite character. And it's nice to see Spider-man being silly and making jokes with his enemies. I thought the CGI was a little bit too much. I liked it better when film makers used CGI to make things seem more realistic. Now it seems as if it's used to make things look more like a cartoon. The villains weren't developed properly. Electro wasn't a good villain because he had no clear motive. He was a psychological mess. These types of people don't make good villains in movies, neither in real life. This movie has no excuses. They just needed to find a reason for him to hate spider-man, it's poor screen writing. Rhino and Goblin are in it for an insignificant amount of time. There was no room for them, but they squashed them in anyway. But the main reason why I didn't enjoy it was because of the story and it's structure. The audience can't get emotionally involved with anything because there are too many plots. When this movie kept switching plots around you sometimes forget that other things are going on. And when they reappear you don't care anymore. This film tried to put too many apples in a bag that wasn't big enough, so the bag broke. The script had many other flaws, especially with dialogue. The script was the main reason why this movie suffered. I guess they should of thrown out that checklist.","8 out of 22 found this helpful.

This movie has a whole lot going for it. Its got stellar performances by Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and especially Sally Field, who gives probably the best portrayal of Aunt May ever and that includes comic books! It's smart, its dramatic, action packed and at the same time it never forgets it's core message of responsibility, truth and consequences. There is a downside to the film as it pertains to villains though, as I found their motivations to be half baked and shoehorned in. The chief offender being Jamie Foxx who's portrayal of Electro is just cringe-worthy.

The movie was very overly ambitious, although it did well to hit many important Spider-Man beats while missing many others. The most noteworthy misfire is how callously the movie casts aside Uncle Ben in favor of Peter's father and Captain Stacey who frankly are not as central. The first movie really shot itself in the foot by diminishing their relationship severely. This is supposed to be the man Peter admired and loved the most. In the comics his father is gone before Peter has made many memories of them. This movie series he has more vivid memories. But even here I found myself siding with Aunt May that essentially these were just people who abandoned him; that she and Ben were his true parents. As it should have been.However overall this movie trumps the last one, and demonstrates some understanding of Spider-Man that felt very absent in the Raimi movies. Namely the quips, his confidence while being Spider-Man versus his awkwardness as Peter, his connection to the 'common folk' of New York (although Raimi touched on this as well), making all his villains kooky science experiments, making Electro and Rhino basically overpowered henchmen as they usually are in the comics. All that stuff was great. The fight scenes were also spectacular.There's a lot in these movies that reminds me of early 80s Spider-Man, and a fair bit that reminds me of the initial Lee/Kirby runs mixed in with some of the Ultimate Spider-Man. It does a good job of ""feeling like"" a comic without coming off completely campy. This tone strikes a balance I haven't even seen in great movies like TDK and X2.The problem with the movie is the plot, or complete lack of one. That too, almost adds to the comic feel. The movie to me felt like a series of one shot issues, rather than one complete story. It felt almost like a musical, but instead of breaking into song, they broke into Spider-Man versus villain fights. But it seems like they don't know precisely where to take anyone. No one develops, no one has a Catharsis. They all just show up, overact a line or two, then move on.The movie, as I would describe it, is very raw. It's almost like Webb understands Spider-Man very well, but struggles to find what story to tell, but he knew he had to hurry up and SPOILER ALERT kill that one person we know HAS to be killed. I loved the way he handled the death. It was perfect. But that, itself could've been a movie. Electro could've been a movie. Rhino, could've gotten more to do. It's a mess.But it is a fun mess. I was entertained, so I won't be too hard on them.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Either that, or nothing in The Amazing Spiderman 2 surprised me, or wowed me. It follows the standard formula of Spidey fighting two bad guys (One only introduced towards the end) across New York, a clash between his personal and vigilante life, and his on/off relationship with the only girl who knows his secret identity.But the fights, banter and plot mechanics, while done well enough, don't leap off the screen at you. Everything feels strictly routine... Even the sad 'twist' towards the end feels tacked-on in the great scheme of things. There's angst, humour and special effects in equal measure, and you won't be bored. It isn't anything memorable though, and certainly doesn't live up to the 'Amazing' monicker in the title.Still, it could be worse... At least it's not Spiderman 3 (You know, BEFORE the reboot... sigh) 6/10","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I mean, we were introduced to Spider- man by Sam Raimi in 2002. Tobey as Spider man, Kirsten as Mary Jane and so on. These characters and their roles were etched in our memory for a decade! 10 freaking years we could only relate to these people and we were happy.Now in 2012, they decided to reboot the entire franchise. Bloody same story with different actors! Whats the f**king point. Peter is bitten by spider, his life before and after being Spider man, his love life, his struggles with the same, relation with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, everything is the same .. but with different actors. Again.. whats the f**king point ?No doubt Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone (as Gwen Stacy) have done a good job but we tend to draw comparisons with the earlier franchise, especially when so many of the aforementioned situations are the same.Okay, now coming back to this movie. This is strictly a one-time watch movie. I didn't have much expectations anyway but I was still a bit disappointed by a few things.1. The transformation of the villain Electro was done in a bit of hurry. One moment he idolizes Spider man and next moment he hates him because he forgot his name! WTF. They should have developed his villainy character a bit. It was not at all convincing.2. Some of the things were happening for the sake of happening. It seriously lacked depth.3. Killing off the main actress and love interest of Spidey so that they can introduce another actress (most probably Mary Jane) in the next sequel, was a big turn off4. Some Characters and transformation of both villains are woefully under- developedHowever, the chemistry between Spidey and Gwen was good and some of the action sequences are pretty good. Spidey has been shown as having some sense of humor and has smart and funny one-liners. That was also welcoming","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

It had pacing and script problems while offering nothing new in return, and it overall seemed like a pointless reboot. Luckily, there's the unwritten rule that the sequel to a superhero movie will usually be better than the original. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 follows that rule, and is better than the first one, but not by a long shot. This movie has all the big problems its predecessor had, and if this franchise wants to rise above mediocrity, these problems should definitely be solved in future movies.Beginning where the last one left, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 follows the life of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as he somewhat struggles with being Spider-Man. He is in a relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), although he feels guilty because of it, since he promised her late father (Denis Leary) he'll stay away from her. At the same time, he encounters a new threat in form of one Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) – an electrical engineer turned super villain during an accident. Also, Peter's childhood friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns to the city after his 8 year long absence, and he seems to have sinister plans of his own.The best thing about The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is surely the charisma between its two leads – Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. Garfield found his voice to a greater extent in this movie - he seems somewhat more relaxed and natural in his role and is arguably superior to Tobey Maguire – and, of course, Emma Stone is as sweet and likable as ever. They are accompanied by another strong performance – that of Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn. DeHaan was a breath of fresh air to the franchise and I personally can't wait to see him in future installments. In addition to the overall quality acting, Marc Webb's direction is great, even better than in the first one. Not only that, but The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is also a nice combination of, more or less, thrilling action sequences and some grim elements which should generally entertain audiences who are looking for nothing else.However, once again, the movie utterly fails in this, perhaps most important, aspect – the script. No one expects Oscar-worthy scriptwriting from a superhero movie, but the dialogues (and some scenes) in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 are laughably ridiculous, and the character of Max Dillon aka Electro was so poorly written that even an experienced actor like Jamie Foxx couldn't save it. Furthermore, once again, the villain designs were horrible: both Electro and Green Goblin looked cartoonishly goofy. And in spite of some action sequences looking great, some of them felt like they were taken directly from a video game (which is never a good thing) and were accompanied by a cheesy dubstep-like soundtrack. In brief, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is better than its predecessor, but that unfortunately isn't enough, since the movie is, at its best, mindless popcorn entertainment, and at its worst is a serious insult to intelligence.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at passpopcorn.com","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

No doubt the sequel yet again displays an amazing technical excellence in all its actions sequences along with a spellbinding cinematography. But with a confusing opposition featuring two weak villains not able to justify their immense power and hatred, the conflict falls flat without making any solid impact on the viewer. And one seriously misses the expected depth and logical character developments in the script of one of the most awaited movies of the year, undoubtedly. For instance it has a highly absurd case of the 'villain by accident' (Jamie Fox), who has no visible reasoning of becoming so wicked with such evil intentions after getting electrocuted, all of a sudden.Stressing too hard on the computer graphics, the director doesn't give much emphasis on the entertaining factor in the film and tries to cover up playing with the romance and an emotional twist in the end showcasing an unexpected tragedy. Now though the romance factor doesn't tease you much but still I honestly felt that is it necessary that a superhero always has to be involved romantically with a lady essentially.In short, as a 3D film with great action sequences (surpassing the past ones), average performances and a pleasant emotional touch, many would not mind watching it once in all possibilities. But frankly speaking, for me it was really not worth the wait at all, with even the Spiderman looking as if he was on a diet plan.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

So it goes with Marc Webb's second installment of the Spiderman legend. The Amazing Spiderman 2 is an entertaining but ultimately unsatisfying movie, especially when compared to its wonderful predecessor. (That 2012 film made it to my top ten films list that year.) While there are some nice aerial movements with our comic book hero once again and time is wisely spent on the human interest angle, this latest chapter lacks interesting villains, has many (too many) action sequences that go on far too long, and enough sub-plots to foul up even the most super of superheroes. Nothing connects and the overall effect is tedious and overbearing.When we last left our Peter Parker / Spidey, (again, very well played by Andrew Garfield), he was still enmeshed in dangerous adventures to rid the world of evildoers and enamored by the sweet and independently minded Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Now, in The Amazing Spiderman 2, Mr. Parker continues to protect the citizenry of New York and pine for Gwen. He is reticent to commit to his true love due to his promise made to her dying father: end the relationship with Gwen for her own safety. The chemistry between the two leads is still palpable, due to the talented actors in these roles, and one care about this young couple and their dilemmas. But it's more of the same with less impact. Peter still has abandonment and father issues after being left behind for his Aunt May to raise, but he has lost a bit of the boyish charm and seems rather smug and cocky in this outing. (Sally Field does yeoman-like work in her small but pivotal scenes as his doting guardian.) Spiderman still fights a good fight, but his swagger and pouty expression seems interminable. Director Marc Webb keeps his action moving, but can't control the multiple story lines and narrative structure of the film. The fault is mainly with a lame script by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Jeff Pinkner that tries too hard. This screenplay by committee approach results in awkward dialog, contrived situations, and lacks any real dramatic tension. It strains when it should soar. Spiderman's clever one-line retorts aren't. The villains come in droves and two out of three are bad, but not in a good way: Electro (Jamie Foxx) is the main nemesis and his character is played sympathetically at times and pathetically for most of the other times; Rhino (a wasted Paul Giamatti) seems like a mere afterthought and lacks any gravitas; the only effective foe is Harry Osborn a.k.a. Green Goblin, who makes his appearance far too late in the film to register much of his full menace, although he is nicely played by Dane DeHaan. (There is also a dreadful evil doctor played atrociously by Marton Csokas. This actor, poorly directed by Webb, delivers his lines in a thick German accent that only Frau Blücher could love.)The CGI has its moments of awe and wonder in some of its well staged battles, but the imagery of two of its villains, Electro and Rhino, never impresses as it should. (Green Goblin, however, is a compelling force and holds promise for future encounters.) Much of the set design looks too fabricated with much noise and destruction which is so common in the crash and burn bedlam on the big screen these days.The Amazing Spiderman 2 tries to spin its web of action and suspense, but it hopelessly gets entangled in its own confusing and chaotic plot devices that continually gum up the works. Amazing it's not.

While the first movie was alright (5/10), this one was not good at all, the acting lost its authenticity, Garfield's performance in this movie is the most inauthentic Spider-Man performance I have seen. Other supporting actors such as Foxx and Stone were okay but did not do much to stand out. The plot is messy and I do not understand why 2 villains, Electro was suffifcent and the final battle was not really enternaining to watch. Some of the visual effects were alright in this movie, but other most prominent effects such as Electro and the Electric visual effects were not impressive and felt ripped-off from some other Marvel or Sci-Fi movie.Overall, I think I can deduce that this is the worst Spider-Man movie I have watched, it really dissapoints at all levels unfortunately. Messy plot, bad acting and crappy visual effects. Please do not watch, in fact do yourself a favor and avoid the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man franchise, both the Tom Holland and the Tobey Maguire franchises are a hell of a lot better than this one in almost every way.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

You might feel sympathy for electro but you might also think he is a psychopath which kinda works, and you can't deny that the electro visuals are AMAZING. With harry you do feel sympathy but you see him quickly turn and turn again into the green goblin which looks awesome by the way.Don't go to the cinema expecting The Dark Knight but go expecting the best spiderman movie to date that will be a joy to watch with anyone.Final Verdict : 8.9/10","14 out of 22 found this helpful.

I'm not sure what they did between the last film and this one, but they went wrong.It still hasn't got a cast that particularly excites me. While Andrew Garfield has grown on me and he still gives a really emotive performance that had obviously been well prepared for, none of the others were anything above good. I certainly wouldn't hand out any Oscar's.I think that they tried too hard with adding characters for future set ups in sequels that didn't happen, because this one just didn't cut the mustard.I didn't mind the 'Rhino' elements and if it had been just him in those few scenes then it probably would have worked better and given more time for Electro, played by Jamie Foxx, to shine in his role and cause the appropriate chaos for his part, which could have been awesome, based on his super powers, but instead they brought in Harry Osborn as well.Not only that, but they chose an incredibly bratty and pre-pubescent, spoiled child direction for the character and an actor who seemed to fit the role too well. Maybe when his voice finally breaks, he won't seem quite so unsettling.I use the word grated to refer to things in my reviews a lot and probably too much, but he really made my skin uneasy and ""Grated"" on me.With his addition to the cast, he lowered the maturity of the story, making it very teenaged. It could almost have been a poorly made episode of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer'. Teenagers with monster problems.Looking at the people that they turned down to play Harry Osborn, all I can assume is that this guy was less expensive than the others?Although I am not a fan of Jamie Foxx at all, I did feel that he was wronged by this film. He didn't get a chance to prove his acting abilities, as he was overshadowed by romantic relationship issues, a friend who was creepy before anything else even happened and too much focus on incorporating Easter Eggs, such as references to Doc Ock and The Vulture, among others.I'd like them to realise that one villain is enough if they're going to spend time showing the development of the other characters. Spider-Man got lost amongst everyone else's problems and it's supposed to be a film about him.I think it also gets irritating that the lead characters all have issues surrounding their fathers. That theme is a bit heavy handed throughout and weighs the mood of the film down.It's still got that darker touch to it that the first 'Amazing Spider-Man' (2012) had, but they've added comedic and camp elements that make it more like the superhero films of the eighties.I don't mind the banter that Spidey has, but he's so overly cocky and I'm sure that's deliberate, to give room for him to be brought down a peg or two, but with everything else it became too much. The real story should have been his fights with 'Electro' whilst he tried to maintain an ordinary life with Gwen and how the results that occurred, because of who he is, affected him and his relationships. Basically adding Harry took it too far.It does have a more comic book edge to it and actually it reminds me of Tim Burton's 'Batman Returns' (1992) in its style, but I don't think that it's good enough for the 2010's and I have grown to expect a lot more from Marvel since this one was made.It's a shame that Mr Garfield didn't get the chance to showcase his Spider-Man incarnation more, as the material was overworked and the B & C list of supporting cast that he had to work with didn't really excite. To be fair they didn't have a lot to get on with.It's watchable, but don't worry about pausing it to make a cup of tea, because there's not enough depth to miss out on.556.87/1000.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Richard (Campbell Scott) and Mary Parker (Embeth Davidtz) are aboard the doomed flight along with an assassin yet in a moment of concentration Richard musters the ability to upload a file on his laptop before the plane vanishes. More than a decade later, Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) is chasing bad guys in a latex suit while balancing his relationship with on-again-off-again girlfriend Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone).You remember Stacey from the first film right? She still works for Oscorp, an organization who once employed the Parkers as well as Dr. Connors who turned out to be a Lizard creature in the first film. You know the guy who killed Gwen's father (Denis Leary) and may have been Peter's only link to his parents until the arrival of Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) who was given control of the company after father Norman Osborn (Chris Cooper) died. Also at the beginning of the film, he's chasing a menace by the name of Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) who has stolen; you guessed it, Oscorp property. Goodness, can't Peter find anyone outside the Oscorp circle of influence? Even the star villain of this new film is an Oscorp employee; Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) aka Electro.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) offers some of the same benefits the first installment did. There are elaborate set pieces and CGI that fulfills the fevered wet dreams of the sixteen-year-olds in all of us. The story, while a little cluttered, never ceases to provide interesting fodder when things aren't blowing up at you and then there are some dead-on performances by Emma Stone and franchise newcomer Dane DeHaan. The plot line of Peter finding out what happened to his parents takes center stage in this sequel which differentiates the Marc Webb movies from the old Sam Raimi trilogy. It all feels fresh if a little too heavy handed and busy.The thing is the various stories swirling around this bloated sequel could have been made into three worthwhile films. Yet with three villains and their origins to contend with, Peter and Gwen's ""complicated"" relationship, the enduring mystery of the Parkers' disappearance, the reappearance of The Gentleman in the Shadows (Michael Massee) from the first film and a Alistair Smythe (B.J. Novak) tease it's hard for anything in the film to resonate on an emotional level. If only Webb and Sony Productions learned passed lessons and didn't frontload the film with so many villains things may have turned out differently. I dare say Spider-Man 3 (2007) was a more sound film from a storytelling point of view than this Andrew Garfield helmed mess.And what of our 30-year-old high schooler leading man? Well his performance is convincing as a recent high school graduate and vulnerable orphan yet as a budding genius he falls short. There are many moments of slapstick provided by our leading man's tinkering yet if he actually cracked a textbook in his life or failed that, done a Google search he'd know how to keep Electro on his toes. Then of course there's Jamie Foxx who before his transformation tries to recreate his so-so performance in The Soloist (2009) only with a bad comb over. Once he becomes Electro, his character development into unstoppable psychopath seems a bit thin. Oh and of course there's Paul Giamatti's Rhino who insists he's a killer yet looks absolutely adorable both with and without his mechanized suit.There are flickers of decent ideas in this new installment of the Spider-Man saga so here's to hoping the inevitable sequel makes a mad dash for a more succinct story and convincing villains. If not here's to hoping the Marc Webb Sony movies accomplish a new nadir in superhero movies and sells the rights back to Marvel. Then we'll be able to see a real Avengers movie featuring your neighborhood friendly Spider-Man.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), a lonely electrician turns into Electro following a freak accident, and Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) in pursuit of curing himself of a disease turns himself into the infamous Green Goblin. Spider-Man now confronts far superior foes that not only threaten his city but also the ones he loves. This sequel has many things right such as Andrew Garfield's embodiment of Spider-Man, his interactions with the supporting cast, the action packed fight sequences, etc. Despite all the positives, the focus on multiple villains prevents this film from being one of the best superhero movies to just being a good movie.Full Review:There is a lot to love about this movie that I thought was done better than all other Spider-Man films before. The very first shot of the film is Spider-Man web slinging through New York City, and you can see how exhilarating it is to fly and swing like him between skyscrapers (especially in 3D). That plays into the action scenes as well, which are very well choreographed and gorgeous to see. The character interactions between Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and the rest of the characters such as Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), and Aunt May (Sally Field), are very natural and truly heartfelt. Credit for that should also be given to director Marc Webb, as he has always been great at showcasing these personal interactions in all his movies. The one thing that nobody will argue is that Andrew Garfield has solidified himself as the definitive Spider-Man and Peter Parker in this film. From his quick wit, movement, and teasing of the villains, to even small things like getting excited by a little kid's science project, it is just perfect. He doesn't just portray the character, he embodies it. Andrew Garfield is Spider-Man.Yes, there is a lot to love, but the few things that did irked me, I really did hate. The brunt of that hate goes towards the use of multiple villains. The marketing for this film shows that there are three villains Rhino (Paul Giamatti), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan). The reason all these villains are placed there is simple: setup for the next films of the franchise. Rhino is literally there for 3 mins, you have seen all his scenes in the trailers. Same goes for Green Goblin, as he is just shoehorned into a fight scene. So that leaves Electro as the main villain of the movie, one of the most uninteresting one-dimensional villains in comic book movie history. I can't blame Jamie Foxx for that because that is what the character is even in the comic books, someone who has been neglected his whole life and just wants to feel needed and loved. What I would have liked is to completely remove Electro and just focus on Harry Osborn/Green Goblin. As I mentioned before Harry and Peter have great chemistry and if their friendship and differences was fleshed out more, it would have made for a more compelling villain. Honestly, the Green Goblin as he is in this movie, even with his little screen time, had more gravity and significance than the main villain Electro.I know I went on bit of a rant on the villains, but it is just something I need to address. I don't use the word ""love"" lightly, so when I say there are things that I loved about this movie I truly mean it is excellent. It is because of these positives that I recommend watching this movie. You will have an enjoyable time despite some of the things that were disappointing.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Not great either. There is a lot that I didn't like. Dane DeHaan was BAD (remember Emo Peter from Spider-Man 3? Well this is Emo Harry)...I'm not sure how much is his fault and how much was either poor writing or poor direction...either way his performance was laughable. The spectacle of the action scenes is really something, but they get almost completely bogged down by the pointless use of slow-mo. Seriously, it felt like there was more slow-mo in this movie then there was in the THE MATRIX. And lastly... Paul Giamatti is absolutely WASTED in this. It's basically a 1 or 2 minute cameo that's only there to set up the next movie. And his Russian accent is totally incomprehensible. I guess I should say what I liked about it too... Garfield and Stone are really good together. Their chemistry is more or less what makes the movie tolerable. Jamie Foxx's Electro is cool I suppose, but the reasoning behind him becoming bad is pretty silly. So all-in-all it has more in common with Raimi's Spider-Man 3...which is pretty disappointing, but then again A LOT of these comic book movies have been feeling (to me anyway) like they're all the same. If you're a comic fan or a fan of the character then I'm sure you'll get some enjoyment out of this. Probably much more than I did anyway. Overall I'm teetering somewhere between a 6 and 6.5 out of 10.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The only character that I felt they really skimped on was Harry - I think they picked a good actor to play him, but the material just seemed really rushed. Also, There are some very awkward scenes, and the dialogue felt laughable at times although it wasn't suppose to be.The only thing that made the movie enjoyable for me, were the action scenes. I think they did a really good job on the CGI, and the music really added to the Electro fight scenes as well.

When it comes to the emotional core of the story and getting performances to match those many emotions in the film he does a hell of a job. The romance between Gwen and Peter is much more believable and real than Peter and Mary Jane's in Sam Raimi's trilogy. If only the rest of the film had the precision that the love story does this film would have been a home run.The film falls somewhere in the middle of something amazing and a missed opportunity. It never does get to the lows of some of the most terrible comic book movies like ""Batman and Robin"". What is most frustrating about it is that there is greatness hidden in such a bloated film where the misses outshine the hits. The first part of the movie where we are shown how comfortable Peter has fit into his role as the hero of the city while trying juggle his feelings and guilt about Gwen and the broken promise he failed to keep with her dad is where the film shines. This goes beyond Garfield and Stone being a real couple. There have been plenty of films where the two leads were a real life item but the chemistry failed to translate to the screen. Garfield and Stone are perfect for each other in this movie. They bounce off each other perfectly with all the romance and flirtatious dialogue they are given. While the romance is the strongest aspect of the film it does crutch on a bit too much at times, which in results in it being a bit too cutsey. That said, all the rest of the relationships are quite well done. Aunt May, played by Sally Field, is still a great emotional center for Peter. She provides Peter with what Uncle Ben did before he was killed. The characters growth is sold through Field's acting ability and some interesting plot points. In this film we meet the famed comic book villain Harry Osborn, who eventually becomes The Green Goblin. Even though Harry and Peter's relationship origin has been changed and is a bit underwritten; Dane DeHaan and Garfield do give off the vibe they were friends separated by life's obstacles. DeHann is sinister, cold, and a bit frightening with the limited screen time he has. It is going to be interesting what he brings us next time with more screen time.That screen time is given to Max Dillion and is one of the mistakes the movie commits. Where Harry's story is full intrigue, important to Peter's life, and had the potential to be something really great, we are given an extremely clichéd and underwritten backstory to why Dillion turns evil when he becomes Electro. Where Harry feels like he could have been a great fleshed out character, Electro feels like a secondary villain. Foxx does his best, and he is good, but the character is very underwritten and seems to have no other purpose than to showcase the effects in the movie. Andrew Garfield's confidence in this film has grown. He captures both the awkwardness and heroism that Spiderman/Peter Parker possesses. When he has that mask on he is a man that so many place their hope in for a better city. This point is nicely done at first but kind of gets overly dramatic towards the end. One thing that Garfield is great at is the legendary Spiderman wise cracks. His sarcasm and wit are so sharp when it needs to be. This is mainly because you can see Garfield loves playing the role. The bar has been set by Andrew for future actors of the role.One thing I will give Webb is that it seems he embraces the fun of Spiderman this time around. Where the 2012 film was a tad serious, this one embraces the spirit of Spiderman and the fun it is to be him. Even the suit has lost the out of place dark eyes and replaced them with the iconic large white eyes. The colors of the film are more vibrant, especially when it comes to Electro's screen time. When combined with Garfield's spirit it creates a light hearted superhero film that has seemed to be lost and looked down upon ever since Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" franchise. Several points in this film will bring a slight smile to the most jaded comic book movie fans. There are times though the choice of making it lighter does backfire. Some scenes or lines come off way too corny or feel like they belong in a bad 90's comic book film. For the most part though, Webb understands the balance between fun and serious. His ambitious nature does hurt the film a bit. Where some parts of the are extremely well done and you want to see them expanded, the amount of material stuffed into this film prevents that from happening. The first time Webb had to search for his own identity and found it in this film. Maybe next time he will learn to trim the fat because underneath this good film is something truly amazing. Hopefully next time we will get to see that.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Three Spider-man movies came out before, so why are the directors making the same movies again? Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are good actors, but not good as the originals. I found Tobey Maguire and Kristen Dunst way better at being Marry Jane Watson and Spiderman/ Peter Parker. I don't get what is the point of going to the movies and watching a worse version of Spiderman. Why didn't the director make a Spiderman movie with a different story line. This is what happens when greedy people want to make money and cant think outside the box. Hollywood cant come up with any new ideas? I love Spiderman, but I disliked this movie for its lack of originality.The only reason why I am giving this movie 5/10 is because of the action. There was action, but that's not enough for a movie. I watched the first Amazing Spiderman movie, and now I have watched the second. And I have to admit they are getting worse. Do not go waste your movie on this, which is an exact copy of the original Spiderman 2. What I suggest is, if you have a DVD of Spiderman 2, or have Netflix, go watch it there instead of watching this crappier version. I am not even going to see the third from how disappointed I was. Save your money and watch something original, and something you don't know what's going to happen every second.","12 out of 39 found this helpful.

Marc Webb did a comparatively better job than the first film. Then where's the problem? It's Kurtzman, Orci, Pinkner and Vanderbilt. Too much pressure on story resulting in excessive talking throughout the film. I'm not saying that it should be a story-less action film, but they should understand that it's a feature film and not a TV series (they should balance between the story and action). Secondly, too many characters. There is no need for so many characters. As a result not enough space was given to any character. There was no need to bring rhino. Instead they should have given more space to harry osborn. Electro only fights twice and the duration of the fight scene is very small. Webb did a wonderful action sequence but the pressure of excess story diminished everything. And finally at the end, x men. Omg.

Because it really felt like I was watching a comic book. From all the Spidey poses to the new costume and the amount of villains just making cameos. The story in itself felt like it was written by everyone's favorite cameo actor, Stan Lee.Andrew Garfield is a great Spider-Man. The right built, the right banter, he even talked like a kid from queens, it was great. By far the best part of the movie. The music was pretty good as well. I saw Pharell Williams straight from the Despicable Me soundtrack had a lot to do with it. The music decides to make Spider-man a little more heroic which was interesting.As a Fan boy, I did kind of feel that Spider-Man's origins are getting to big and complex. I know this is a block buster but some things in the movie seem to be leaning away from the basic concept that Spider-Man is a local vigilante. He's not a globe trotting super hero like Iron man. The movie is similar to Man of Steel in which his origins drive the story and the villains he faces.It's funny that some people felt that the original Spider-Man trilogy was campy and yet in this movie they made Electro very campy. I like Jamie Foxx just fine as Electro, in fact I think he does the combo of dangerous and campy very well, but like Spider-Man, they changed Electro's origin to be bigger than just a crook as if this would make him better. That's why the Rhino was my fav villain in the movie as he was just a simple criminal given awesome powers. As a regular movie goer, none of this might matter to you, but that's why Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not ideal. If you are not familiar with the comic book, the large amount of villains in it and the top notch story that reflects the full on relationship of Gwen and Peter might not be worth the extra 23mins this 2hours and 23 minute movie gives.I got to be honest, I like Spider-Man 2 better than Amazing Spider-Man 2 as a Fan boy it was amazing, but as a film Geek my mind has not changed about it being too soon for a reboot.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Even the scenes that were meant to be funny had poor comedic timing.After watching Captain America the winter soldier which which the bar high for upcoming movies, I'd say Spiderman failed to hit the mark.

It was effective particularly given it was a reboot, not too long after the Rami-MacGuire Movies. Andrew Garfield did well, but one complaint many had was he was very introverted, and it lacked a lot of the classic humor from the character in the Comics. Not So in The Amazing Spider-Man 2! Garfield's Spider-man is much more humorous and outgoing in this one! Garfield and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacey) continue their great chemistry from the 1st one, and Sally Field (Aunt May) also returning is great again. Dan DeHann's Harry Osborne is a true highlight. Jamie Foxx does well as ""Electro"". It should be noted not too much is given on his character's background, but it does little too diminish the movie. Tone Wise, The First ""Amazing Spider-Man"" is much better, and much more consistent. The changes in tone, is a fair criticism of the movie, as at times possibly the movie may be too fast paced, but in the end - It was Fun! 3 out of 4 Stars!","9 out of 13 found this helpful.

As it's precedent it stars Adrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy and Sally Field as Aunt May. Both Martin Sheen and Dennis Leary who portrayed Uncle Ben and Captain Stacy make cameo appearances in this film as well. The film also introduce new characters; Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx), Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), Aleksei Sytsevich/Rhino (Paul Giamatti)and Felicia Hardy (Felicity Jones). Unlike it's previous film the musician is Hanz Zimmer, who replaced James Horner.The actors's performances are outstanding, specially by actors Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. Garfield's body-language is better than Maguire's and he is way more curious, funny and emotional. Although Tobey Maguire was a great Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Garfield is a notch better. Emma Stone is a great choice to portray Gwen Stacy. The chemistry between her and Garfield is outstanding. Sally Field's performance as Aunty May/May Parker is marvelous and she has a bigger role in this one than it's previous venture. She is very secretive and is kind of a selfish woman who hides a lot of things for her nephew Peter. Jamie Foxx who portrayed Dillon was great even though the character is portrayed by a black actor. Dane DeHaan who played Harry Osborn/Green Goblin was good. Not as great as James Franco to play Harry Osborn, but better than Willem Dafoe to play Green Goblin.The film's storyline is well-built and it's more credible to the comic books than the previous Spider-Man films. It digs deeper about Peter Parker's past and his parents's disappearance. It's more humorous, more emotional and it has a more darker tone which keeps the film interesting to watch. The costumes are stylish and more high-tech and the CGI effects are amazing. However, I felt that the final battle between Spider-Man and Electro maybe had a bit too much effects. Even though the scenes where we see Spider-Man swinging around New York City is epic, I still miss James Horner's music. Zimmer's music is cool, but I felt that it wasn't that suitable as Horner's tunes.The movie is simply amazing and it deserves to be watched in the cinemas. Two thumbs way up!","29 out of 52 found this helpful.

The moments where we see some genuine interaction between Peter and Gwen feel tainted by the same thing. The ""romance"" of the two is selfish and driven largely by Peter's wants and ego.

I would give the first 1h 50m of the film an 8 or 9/10, but the dumb final section destroyed a lot of the goodwill the film had built up until that point. I've rarely seen something fall apart as quickly. If the movie had ended immediately after Spider-Man defeated the main villain (Jamie Foxx's Electro), it would have been fine. But it's like the film committed seppuku. Foxx and Stone are both poorly served by this film, as is DeHaan. And Andrew Garfield was the strongest part of both of these Spider-Man films - he deserved better too.

That is where I lost the touch with the characters. Still this movie provides some serious Action and Drama and a Bit of comedy as well. Overall, it is fun to watch Spider man flying (kind of) between the skyscrapers and Electro breaking those same buildings in a flash. Characters Peter, Gwen and Max have been portrayed well by their respective actors.

Meanwhile, Peter's friend, Harry Osborne, is struggling with finding a cure to a genetic disease he inherited and requires Spider-man's blood to generate a cure. While all this is happening, a shocking new villian arrives on the scene with a fixation on Spider-man.I actually really liked the first Amazing Spider-man. It wasn't perfect and Andrew Garfield was no Toby McGuire but it was still fun and looked fantastic. Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not in the same league as the original, it's a lot more action packed sure but the background story of the villians is a lot more comedic in the case of Electro and then just boring in the case of Green Goblin/Harry Osborne. The film goes more comical than the original and its fairly childish yet rhe overarching dilemmas are very adult and the combination of both approaches doesn't really work all the time. The biggest issue is the multiple storyline and too many characters. We have the secret of Peter Parkers father, the introduction of the Osbornes and their genetic disorder, Max Dillon turning into Electro, Aunt May needing to take a second job, Gwen Stacey debating if she moves overseas, the whole Rhino robot suit thing... just way too much. That's not to say there wasn't fun or impactful scenes - I quite liked the end of movie scene with the little boy standing up to Rhino before Spider-man arrives or when Harry Osborne arrives at the power plant in the final battle and he slowly comes to realize Spider-mans identity and of
then of course the most memorable scene of the film and arguably any Spider-man movie, Gwen Staceys death. There's also a few scenes that are just pointless and usually they involve Aunt May. She was well underutilized here and if you take her scenes out, the movies would not change in anyway.Final Verdict: Action packed but also bloated with too many characters and storylines. Visually, it looks extremely eye catching but the fancy special effects are trying to concele a convoluted story. You can do a lot worse but it doesn't live up to the original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We finally get to see the Spider-Man from the comics that not one single movie of either trilogy has shown. I loved that. Then the film went South in a hurry.The next hour is spent introducing characters, and not in a very convincing way, I might add. Why so much time spent on introductions? Because this movie has more plot lines than spider web has geometric shapes. The plot is so muddled with so many different things and there is nothing tying them all together. There is no central theme, nothing for me as the viewer to grasp on to to carry me from one end of the film to the other. It's really a mess.The other thing that turned me off was the awkward dialogue. It was poorly introduced and unconvincingly written. For example, there is absolutely no time spent developing the relationship between Peter Parker and Aunt May, but all of a sudden in the middle of the film there's this big emotional breakthrough which is meaningless because it hasn't been set up properly. And many of the exchanges had me putting my face in my hands and groaning.What's the one redeeming quality of the film? The web slinging.

It was refreshing and brought something new to the hero. But this one was not only unnecessary, it was a failure ! Of course I wouldn't have believed such a supposedly high-quality movie could be so bad, but it was indeed. -First, it is obviously a teenage oriented movie, because there's less blood than in a Disney one. -The story is messy and unfinished. -The characters are very cliché and too fake. -The electric special effects are retro and way too unrealistic.This movie gets a lot of things wrong, but it is still satisfying if you're looking for a classic blockbuster movie with an ordinary scenario... Don't raise your expectations too high, it's the only way you could get surprised.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

""Swinging into the cinematic web of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was an electrifying experience, much like Spidey himself. The actors brought their A-game, with Andrew Garfield's portrayal of the iconic web-slinger filled with charisma and emotional depth. The film's editing spun a visually dynamic narrative, though a tad tangled at times. Strengths gleamed through in the thrilling action sequences that left me clinging to the edge of my seat, and the music hit the right notes, enhancing the adrenaline-fueled moments. Yet, every hero has their kryptonite, and in this case, a slight weakness was the crowded plot, juggling multiple storylines like a web-slinger in overdrive. The cinematography, however, soared to new heights, capturing the essence of New York City with breathtaking shots. Despite the occasional stumble, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 swings its way to a 7/10 in my book, a web of entertainment that had me hooked.""","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Of course this isn't greatest movie of history, but as a comic book filming it is very entertaining. Spider-Man's leaps between skyscrapers are beautiful to watch especially in 3D experience is like sitting on a roller coaster. Andrew Garfield is great as a Spider-Man, Emma Stone succeed well as Spider-Man's girl friend despite the tragical end. Sally Field is always great actress. Only Jamie Foxx don't convince in his role as a nerd. Luckily he act nerd only half of the film and the rest of the movie he is digitally enhanced Electro. Story is entertaining and pretentious comic book adaption and that is the way it should been watch. Albeit the dialogue is quite childish at time to time it doesn't bother too much. Lots of popcorn and enough of soda is all you need to enjoy this movie. If you want to say something bad about the movie you could say it has been inflate to so big that it will be a hard to surpass on next movie. Movies massive budget (200 million dollars) is hard to cross over. On the other hand if movie makes enough profit as theatrical release couple of more millions should not be any infeasible to approve.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's actually come out a pretty good movie. Please don't listen the critics otherwise you will miss why Spider-man is Amazing. If you are going into this expecting a Dark Knight or an Avengers or any other movie, this isn't for you. Spider-Man is a fun character and this movie is like a comic book come to life. Certainly I am not saying that this movie is 100% perfect. There are some things about this movie which can be questioned but after watching i can say i really want to believe in superheroes. A great mix of action, humor, love and pure fun. From the story about Peter's father, over to aunt May and the love to Stacy - everything fitted so well together. End is little sad I was heart broken It killed me inside. If you're a fan of any characters in spider man, I suggest you prepare yourself mentally before watching this film, because you really should watch this film.","25 out of 44 found this helpful.

It has so many plot threads and so many characters and some of them get the shaft. This to me though, feels like a great romantic comedy with superheroes. The love between Emma and Andrew is so real. I mean, it is obvious real, but their connection in the film feels genuine and you can completely tell why they can't see a world without the other. Their dialogue is so good and you can clearly tell that some it is ad libed. Andrew Garfield, to me at least, is the quintessential Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He is a character who not only enjoys Spider-Man, but also who is saying fun quips at the same time. Andrew is such a good performer and just owns the role without ever trying to hard. It is a great performance. Emma also doesn't overplay Gwen at all. She could just be the silly girlfriend following him around thinking she is better than she is, but she also feels like a real person. She is just so good in her role. Dane DeHaan is also amazing, no pun intended, in his role as Harry Osborn. He has these great nuances of a villain character that just work for me and he is my favorite villain in this film because I don't believe his character gets over played as much as the other two. You can feel his true anger and sadness and you really see how he was a perfect fit for this character. The dialogue between him and Peter is so good that you can see that they actually were friends and it really could have been done so badly if not for someone like Marc Webb behind the camera. You also have this great relationship between Aunt May and Peter that is so good that you feel touched. You can tell that they are family and that they truly do love each other and each scene they have on screen together is so well done. Sally Field is so talented and she takes every scene she gets and really gives a really heartwarming performance.I do believe that some of the performances are dull. Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon or Electro is just to hammy. He doesn't come off real enough to be an actual character and being the one that is technically the main villain seems like a waste. You also have Paul Giamatti as The Rhino who is so much more hammier than Electro. He has this very thick Russian accent and his dialogue is so bad that you can't take anything he does seriously. His scenes are played up for comedy, but I don't find them funny at all. Chris Cooper also has a minor part in this film and his scene with Harry is so well done that I did enjoy it. It isn't just I hate you. You hate me. We are a unhappy family. You really see the depths of this relationship and it really can tell you something about Norman and Harry's relationship. Campbell Scott plays Richard Parker and definitely is the parent that has the most inspiration towards Peter in this film. You can really tell the love he has for Parker in his few moments that it is so sad when we find out his inevitable end in this film. What this film does though to his character is really so real and I love it to the end.With a Superhero film, you obviously want some spectacular, no pun intended, action scenes and I believe this film delivers. While the first didn't have any action scenes that really stood out, this film does have some really good action scenes that stick with you. Electro has such a cool power set and they use that to their advantage. You get some really amazing, no pun intended, effects that showcase the powers of both Spider-Man and Electro. I think that the fight with Harry is very lack luster, but has its effect on you. The special effects are top notch. Spider-Man has a weight to him in this film and you feel like Andrew Garfield might actually be in the suit while he is swinging around in New York. I do think that it feels like Electro sometimes feels like Dr. Manhattan from Watchmen, but it didn't bother me that much. Even with lackluster characters from the villains, you still had some great actions scenes come about. And another conflicting point is the music. Some of it is really well integrated into the film and sounds very good while other pieces of music aren't integrated well and threw me off. I thought that the Electro theme sounded very good, but sometimes it became a forefront to the scene and I didn't enjoy then. I feel that it is groundbreaking like Hans Zimmer likes to do, but sometimes it sounds awkward and takes me out of the film.The problems do arise from this film's jumbled plot. This film really is a great romantic comedy at its center. But then it moves to a new development for the villains and it doesn't give them really any time to develop a character so they just really become cardboard cut outs. The film does have some really good connections and, at its center, a really good love story, but all that levity is wasted with some very undeveloped villains that boil down to CGI tricks and some awkward music. This isn't a bad film. Just a disappointing film for someone who wanted it to be just as good and if not better than the first film. I give this film 2.75 out of 4 stars.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Typical MCU PG shtick: a superhero cracking wise while saving the city from violent but mostly bloodless carnage. Garfield is OK as the web-slinger but much of his dialogue was strained and contrived, especially the incessant quips. Emma Stone makes for a striking Gwen Stacy but the character's 'deux ex machina' arrival in the power plant was a silly plot twist and Jamie Foxx is fine as the syntho-voiced and largely CGI Electro but painfully awful as pre-villain nebbish Max Dillion. The film seems rushed and is stuffed with too many characters. In addition to Electro, there is a perfunctory fight with the Green Goblin (including a wedged in back story) and a teaser squabble with a ridiculously mechanised 'Rhino' (Paul Giamatti, although it's hard to imagine any attempt to depict the Rhino character not looking ridiculous). The plot is a by-the-numbers superhero sketch with yet another energy-sucking threat that maybe can be stopped by feeding it too much energy (a threat/solution that's been around since at least 1953's 'The Magnetic Monster'). Typical for MCU opuses, the film is very uneven, swinging between sentimental melodrama and light-weight action-adventure, and even the tragic event in the final reel is granted no more the a few minutes of drama before Spidey is back to his signature gibes and one-liners. Most of the climactic battle is so drenched with flashing lights and shifting colour that it is hard to tell what is supposed to be happening and action sequences are filled with too many gimmicky (and clichéd) slow-mo and bullet-time shots. The film's unimpressive returns killed this iteration of the Wall-crawler (the second of three in a decade).","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I went to see this one because when I went to the theatre it was the next movie playing.I didn't enjoy this movie. I fell asleep for a few minutes at the start, and I walked out after about 70 minutes, something I rarely do.However, I did enjoy the 3D CGI scenes of Spidey travelling through NYC.I was surprised to see that Spider-Man is more like Superman now, in terms of his strength. (But you see this creeping inflation in superhero powers in most comic-based action movies now.) Garfield is not a young actor who interests or excites me. I don't really see him as Spider-Man. I did give it a shot, for an hour or so.I really didn't like the wisecracking of this Spider-Man. The cheesiness of this caught me off guard. I didn't like the dialogue, which was more like repartee actually. The movie collapsed several times into boring melodrama that reminded me of soap opera or Glee. The scene in which Peter breaks up with Gwen seemed forced and cliché. The scene between Peter and Aunt May seemed off and unrealistic. The Jamie Foxx character was unappealing. His treatment by his coworkers was cartoonishly portrayed. (I've been wondering lately whether the Hollywood people who make movies have ever really been employed. They don't seem to know what employment is actually like.)This movie felt too movieish, too full of itself. It didn't seem original. After a while, I became aware of the problem that the scenes were disjointed, and I wasn't interested enough to thread it together.I didn't like the music.After a while I put on my jacket and left. I'm surprised by the current score, but I suppose the legions out there have spoken and we must all bear the consequences.I'm sorry to the people involved for such a negative review. I see from the demographics of the scoring that people under 18 are rating this movie the highest. This seems about right. It's absolutely absurd (and an indictment of internet rating systems) that about 20% of viewers give this movie 10/10. This is a phenomenon that I don't understand, and that I suspect has little or nothing to do with the movie itself. I want to give it 1/10 (because after all I wasted my money), but that seems irresponsible. I'll give it a 4.","10 out of 32 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Very well done if slightly run of the mill","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3006215/?ref_=tt_urv","ExpendableMan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4491531/?ref_=tt_urv","28 April 2014","Given that this is the fifth Spiderman movie in twelve years, it's very easy to feel cynical when the clichés start flying out of the screen before the first action set piece finishes. After all, it's not enough any more that Peter Parker is going to pull an innocent bystander out of the way of a car spinning through the air and be late to an important event which his girlfriend has put a lot of emotional investment in to. Oh no, now he's got to have a dark secret at the heart of his family and be the very centre piece of an evil conspiracy as well. Because having him played by an actor who looks uncomfortably similar to Stan Laurel isn't a big enough difference any more.However, one inevitable side effect of the sheer volume of superhero movies being made in recent years is that Hollywood has got very, very good at making them. And The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a very, very good movie. It doesn't get close to the high water mark set by The Dark Knight of course but it's definitely a step up from the first entry in the rebooted franchise and could put in a good case for being superior to any of the Sam Raimi movies as well.Sure, there are faults to be had but the film speeds along on such sheer, good natured fun that it's hard to be bothered by them. As Peter Parker, the annoyingly youthful Andrew Garfield (he's 30 years old people, 30 years old!) is a charming and effortlessly charismatic screen presence. As he zips through New York at high speed, wise cracking at bad guys and high-fiving firemen, you get the distinct impression that he really enjoys being a superhero. There's still time for him to be bothered by guilt and struggle with his responsibilities, but it doesn't weigh him or the film down and he's tremendous fun to spend time with. He's ably supported by Emma Stone as Parker's on again/off again girlfriend Gwen Stacey. The pair's real life relationship translates incredibly well on screen and there's so much chemistry between them, it's hard not to shake the feeling that both actors want to get the scene over and done with so they can go back to shaking trailers together. Dane Dehaan meanwhile makes a bid for this year's Best Sympathetic Villain In A Spiderman Movie award as Harry Osborn. Dehaan is making a career out of playing traumatised young men with incredible power, but it's a credit to both the actor and the script that he becomes genuinely likable, even when he's committing appalling acts against the people he loves.On the other hand, it is difficult to believe that Jamie Foxx could ever be a nerd, especially as the guy who bullies him at work looks like someone Foxx could break in two by breathing hard enough, but he makes a formidable villain when he inevitably becomes Electro. His Times Square smack down with Spidey is one incredible set piece and their later ruck in a power plant only ups the ante. If the appearance of Paul Giamatti's Rhino on the posters meanwhile has you worried about villain fatigue fear not, he's barely more than a cameo.So, great cast, awesome set pieces, what's the catch? Well just like the first Amazing Spider Man, this film still can't help but be a bit unnecessary. You'll have seen all of Parker's dilemmas in this before and the needless conspiracy subplot involving his folks never comes across as anything more than a way for the studio to say ""See, completely different film?"" The strengths outweigh the weaknesses however and aside from a few uncomfortable points (what's with the Mengele style German Doctor?), The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a fine superhero movie. It's great fun to watch, has an immensely likable duo at it's heart and just when it's getting a bit too familiar, it pulls the rug out from under your feet with a wicked third act. If this is Hollywood at it's money grabbing worst, long may it continue.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Too Many Cooks, Yet Again, Spoils the Broth!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3008460/?ref_=tt_urv","sohansurag","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21382612/?ref_=tt_urv","2 May 2014","Ah the Hollywood summer time starts and the next 3 months are lined up with some of the most anticipated movies of this year. Don't even get me started on the stars and budget of these flicks, everything seems marketed as the next best thing. From Bryan Cranston's Godzilla and Bryan Singer's X-Men Days of Future Past to Transformers Age of Extinction and Dawn Of Planet of The Apes and then some more. Apparently a separate budget needs to be planned for the same, cutting back some of em. A tough choice indeed.While Sony's decision to reboot Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise could be best tagged 'hasty', The Amazing Spider-man garnered enough attention and good critiques that they even green lit its 3rd and 4th sequels, all thanks to Andrew Garfield's portrayal of a 'better' Peter Parker and Marc Webb's direction. Frankly I am a fan of Sam Raimi's original trilogy and as opposed by many, I liked Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker more and maybe . But seems like Garfield's Peter Parker has grown on me and although I initially hated The Amazing Spider-man, I couldn't let go a Spider-man sequel. Just like Marvel's movies, I was bound to watch this and I did in all its splendor in IMAX. I so sorely wanted to add "".and boy, I loved it"" but unfortunately it neither had the charm nor the oomph I'd anticipated for.To start things off, we're shown the unfortunate demise of Peter's parents and the movie revolves around the the mysteries involved with the same. But it gets lost amidst Peter and Gwen's mushy romance. I appreciate Marc Webb's expertise with handling romance, as evident from 500 Days of Summer, but it also felt like too much time had been allotted for Peter and Gwen's goofy on and off relationship. It worked well in the comics but on celluloid it felt gratuitous and cheesy. And now let's discuss villains, shall we? What's with Sony and squeezing as much villains as possible in a spidey movie? Don't they know that saying 'Too many cooks spoil the broth or haven't they learnt anything from Spider-man 3? As obvious from the tag 'Rise of Electro', The Amazing Spider-Man 2's main villain is Electro and he would have sufficed for a good movie. But No, Sony just had to squeeze in Green Goblin and Rhino as well, even if it means mere minutes of them. Of the lot, Electro was impressive and tells us to stay away from obsessive 'nobody' like Max Dillon. And by the time he 'rises' to power his fickle-mindness can only matched with his ego and obsession. The Times Square scene in particular was tense, Electro felt like a bomb about to explode and spidey had to play all the right strings to keep him calm.Andrew Garlfield once again dons the Spider-man spandex suit and is bit less annoying than the first. Then again he never felt even remotely threatened by adversaries and on the other hand he seemed more worried and preoccupied with his relationship with Gwen. Weirdly, his performance felt better when he was suited up than not. Emma Stone is a brilliant actor but even she was like this adrenaline junkie who couldn't stay away from Spidey and the antagonists and in the end she just becomes a damsel in distress than anything. Jamie Foxx showcased an electrifying performance as Electro (all puns intended) and even as Max, he was able to convincingly pull off his innocent yet obsessive shades. He was well intimidating as Electro, a worthy contender for Spider-man but thanks to inane script it was never fleshed out. Dane Dehaan is no stranger playing antagonist and does a fair job of playing Harry Osborn/Green Goblin and may even slide into being a formidable villain in the upcoming sequels. Oh and by the way, Paul Giamatti plays Aleksei Sytsevich, a thug-turned-Rhino with a weird Russian which is best left at that.The Amazing Spider-man is surely dark and the weird injection of comedy was another nuance I found. Agreed, Spidey is meant to be a wisecracking superhero, but no superhero would be wisecracking if his or the one he loves' life is at stake, it makes the sequence less tense. And talk about 'being dark', the bodycounts were enormous this time and i can only imagine how much would have been at stake on the Time Square and highway stunts, yet the narrative just goes on not even addressing the grim things that just happened, crowds cheered, people went about their daily lives as if there was absolutely no threat in the horizon.The movie clocks in at a runtime of 142 minutes so good luck if you have a weak bladder. Despite the long runtime it becomes victim to some flimsily edited sequences. Action sequences were abruptly put to stop and there were some transitions where it felt like ""Did the film reel just do a backflip?"" Felicia Hardy makes a cameo and could be, hopefully, seen as Black Cat later on in the franchise. The same goes for the excellent end-credit sequence that kept us guessing, leading to speculations of the The Sinister Six.The score from Hans Zimmer and Pharell Williams upped the ante a bit this time able to give that much needed soul which the first lacked. And thanks to the same, Spider-man swinging by gave me goosebumps. I guess its in every fanboy's wishlist to do so and to watch it live in all the IMAX glory, it was nothing short of spectacular.Marc Webb is undoubtedly a skilled director but with no guidance from Marvel I guess he was just as lost as we were. Its time for Marvel to buy back its most beloved character. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 falls into the familiar mediocre territory that its predecessor fell into.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Spider-Man is undoubtedly a symbol of hope; a beacon of goodness; an ideal for morality. Growing up, Spider-Man was and continues to be one of my favourite comic book characters. Riding on emotion and sentiment, the web head is a fictional comic book character written as imperfectly as you and me.Making his fifth entry on the big screen in just twelve years in Marc Webb's second instalment of the Amazing Spider-Man series, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is less amazing and more routine. At times, the film shines as a gemstone indie love story similar to Webb's breakout hit, then, just seconds later, becomes a highly explosive and corny PG suitable Transformers imitation. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is as confused a film as its lead human character Peter Parker, taking too many liberties with his story yet trying to stay true to the comic book character Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created over fifty years ago. Thankfully, actor Andrew Garfield suits up again and holds the emotional scenes of the film together as the wise-cracking identity confused teenager, nailing every subtle and bold Peter Parker nuance while facing off against many obstacles and three very teed off villains in what has been marketed as 'his greatest battle yet'. With the exception of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3, the last of Raimi's trilogy with the character and a total train wreck, the films seem to be making a slow but steady decline in narrative, quality filmmaking and heart–and the same could be said with The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Rebooting the series in 2012 for the sole purpose of making great use of movie theatres current obsession of 3D and applying it to Spidey's first person metropolitan web-swinging, the point- of-view filming approach makes up for mere minutes of the film, usually focusing on the tormented personality of Peter Parker and the difficult choices he needs to make, as both a man and a hero, which was already visited in the first trilogy. Not that we are expecting a film to be made in the same way as the disastrous POV bomb Doom, but if the studio did decide to revisit a highly successful series only years after the first one was complete, at least make it worth while for the audience to drop the $20 for admission.In the first Amazing Spider-Man film, Webb's narrative felt like a familiar story of Peter Parker with a new villain. Thankfully, the series was able to pick up massive talent with a director who flourishes in his ability to flesh out the fine chemistry between his actors as seen with 500 Days of Summer and is able to create highly emotional, gut-wrenching bonds between lovers, friends, allies and enemies. With the talented Mr.Webb behind the lens, the Amazing franchise brought Peter Parker more vividly to life with the passionate and caring Andrew Garfield, who proved on many occasions how humbled and dedicated he was highlighting a side of Peter Parker in a way that Tobey Maguire never could. His interactions with his aunt and love interests Gwen are the best scenes in the film, hands down. Kudos to Ms. Emma Stone, who brings Peter Parker's first love Gwen Stacy to life with pizazz and spunk for a second time and finally rids herself of all the Emma Stone nuances that made her performance distracting in the first film.Picking up exactly where the last film left off in terms of secrets and mysteries, the film opens up to a flashback of Peter Parker's parent's disappearance. Richard and Mary Parker (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz) leave New York and their son behind after double-crossing Oscorp. Flash forward nearly two decades and their son is saving the big apple in his blue and red spandex suit, one fallen fruit at a time.One of the most interesting mythos behind Spider-Man is his bond with humanity and his internal struggle. Spider-Man is cocky and comical throughout the film, usually minimizing the severity of the action and violence going on around him. Meanwhile, Peter Parker is a highly emotional and tragic character whose curse lays in his inability to distance himself from the people he loves the most. Spider-Man narratives have always been about making choices, choosing paths and learning from one's mistakes. Almost all the comic book characters getting the big screen treatment have been adapting what I like to call The Dark Knight formula; a formula that allows its characters to somewhat be rooted in reality, adding a drizzle of grittiness. Spider-Man seems to be one of the few, if not only, comic book character on the silver screen today who maintains his childish, goofy and often times overly-comical approach, adding colourful hints of appropriate teenage-ness. Sadly, unlike many other famous comic book characters, Spidey's world is one that is conquered constantly by the death of others, a theme that is in no way easy to swallow for children or teenagers–making the film a topsy-turvy tonal mess.One of the biggest question marks in this film was whether Gwen would make it out alive or not. Webb's film franchise introduced Gwen and allows Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) to be the sole love interest in Peter Parker's life.

Sadly this movie dragged on full of story line that robbed itself of dynamic flow an action paced film requires.We've seen books turn into movies. This movie felt like a movie turned into a paperback book. The scenes had too much dialog in where redundancy of its context turned this action into more of a soap opera. I found myself having to keep myself optimistic that the movie will progress.Without having to give spoiler alerts, the scenes that had action were more of a show of graphics horsepower than brilliance in storyline. The villain(s) roles were poorly written in a way that was haphazard, untrue to the purists, and as if this will be the last Spider-Man installment. I say this because it seemed as they ran out of money/time or just didn't care to take attention to detail. If it weren't for my son wanting to see this movie, I wouldn't mind leaving. Thankfully Emma Stone kept me intrigued. Otherwise I would have been searching for a pillow.The Amazing Spider-Man franchise has done a poor job in transitioning away from its comic book aesthetic the way the Batman franchise did into the Darkknight franchise. Bottom-line I still prefer the original Spider-Man franchise because it was the best written and produced. How can they make this up to me? Well they kind of blew it with the villain aspect. But if they find a way to finally link Spider-Man to his Avenger teammates, that would be ultimate.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I didn't expect anything from this film, unless to be enjoyable. I was nothing less that amazed by the stupidity of the whole thing, even if it didn't start badly... The first sequence where Spider-Man chase a truck in Manhattan is at some point very impressive. The moment when we follow Spidey flying between the building, we almost feel like if we were with him. In fact, we could resume the movie with what I have already told : most of the action sequence are well directed, but apart from that, there's nothing to be satisfied with. Half of the film is focused on the Peter-Gwen love story, and I can guarantee you that you will do nothing else than sigh. And the villains! There's a lot to talk about (but not in good sadly...). To not spoil you, I will only speak about Electro. At first, his name is Max, but the problem is, that you don't have enough scene to understand the psychology of the character (if there is one), so you just think that he's just a very stupid guy, and I have to say that Jamie Foxx's interpretation is probably for something. And when he turn into a bad guy, well... we almost don't see his power until the last thirty minute, where Marc Webb must have noticed that we had seen enough of cheesy scene between the two lovers. So we get a terrible action scene, where the director put all the element he can. But it just turn amazingly bad, and we almost have an overdose of bad CGI - because yes, the CGI are bad. I could write a lot more to convince to not spend one dollar for this movie, but it would turn just as boring as the film was... The first was bad, the second is worse.","10 out of 33 found this helpful.

I got so angry watching this because even I, knowing nothing about film making, knew that so many scenes should have been edited out or not filmed at all.Much of it felt improvised and badly planned and I cannot believe that in this day and age, Hollywood is still making movies with an all-white cast and a token black (/blue) villain. At one point, another villain actually called him his 'fairy godmother'(!)The script wasn't rubbish but it needed editing. Instead, every single idea, line and scenario suggested during development was included in this ridiculously overlong film.The only saving grace was the action but that got extremely boring because it kicked in from the very beginning so there was no room for progression. It's like Hollywood just said: cute kid, love stuff, action scenes every 5 minutes, a few bad guys (one black/blue) and we'll make a few hundred million.I'm not impressed. I've already forgotten half of the film (the rest will be gone by morning).Tangent-rant: What is the point of a Spider-Man who cannot shoot webs out of his wrists (or body in general)? Without that ability, any villain could create that technology and Spider-Man would no longer be unique. This Spider-Man only has strength, speed and sticky feet. That does not a Spider-Man make I'm afraid. The only justification for the name Spider-Man is having some spider-specific feature built in which he currently does not have.Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone obviously had fun together but I only saw the spark between 'them' and not between their characters. This might be because Andrew Garfield has zero screen presence.I don't think it's worth more than a 5 but the effects were great and I wasn't totally bored throughout so I'll give it an extra point.6/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The Amazing Spider-man 2 blows them all away with ease. Very few films, actors and stories get you completely engrossed to the point where you feel as though you live in their world, but Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and the rest of the cast do it perfectly. Sam Riami's Predeceasing films were good but this Spidey is 'Amazing' and it is not for what you might think. Yes the cgi and special effects are better simply for the development of technology over time. However, It is how close knit to the original Spidey these films are keeping which is so impressive. Andrew Garfields portrayal is exceptional, he has completely made the role his own, some when I speak of Spider-man will now say, 'Toby Who?' His general look in the costume is much more realistic and his humour is beyond question, brilliant. He really is 'just a normal guy' as he claimed his the first instalment saving a kid from a dangling car inferno.The Plot is twisting and turning throughout with something always going on and when there is a non-action period, the story is so enthralling we don't even notice. With emotion, love, Undeynably excellent action sequences, Depth, and Character to both Amazing Spider-man films to date, a Spidey world has been created that I never want to leave. They have a chance here to do something really special, not just 3 films say, but more like a series of 7 or 8 or 9 films (Im thinking Star Wars, Harry Potter Style) and confidently stick with Garfield. Let his character of Spiderman grow as he does over a period of years to come. It could become arguably one of the greatest film sets of all time from one of the most famous and iconic fictional figures of all time. To sum up all iv'e said:Sheer Brilliance.","12 out of 19 found this helpful.

"3","/10","This Rebooted Franchise Just Gets Hammier As It Goes","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3009358/?ref_=tt_urv","FilmMuscle","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18123905/?ref_=tt_urv","3 May 2014","Frankly, watching the new Spider-Man movies made me miss Sam Raimi's original trilogy that much more—yes, even Spider-Man 3 (actually not even a hater of that movie like most people on the ""cool"" or comic-book train). This rebooted series has plenty of flaws and is markedly lacking in so many aspects that it often gets awkward and groan- inducing, including Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker. I preferred Tobey Maguire's Parker simply because he was much more relatable, sympathetic, likable—you know? This one is a cocky lady-charmer with a slew of cheesy jokes. Nope, as far as I know about the original Peter Parker from the comics, he was always a geek who eventually donned the bright outfit and took on the role as a ""friendly neighborhood"" and hero. We are far removed from that image with Marc Webb's rendition. Personally, though, it's definitely more fun to write a negative review than a positive one (I feel like there's so much more things to say) so the film did give me that pleasure. Ouch! Anyway, the mystery behind the sudden disappearance/deaths of Parker's parents continues from the first installment, and we're actually presented with much more depth into the arc this time around. In addition, Peter Parker is still attempting to somehow address Gwen Stacy's and his relationship after the death of her father and the promise he made Parker keep. Lots of drama already, and then—boom—a plethora of villains because we obviously didn't have enough story to cover. First, we get Electro (played by Jamie Foxx) who actually benefits from an intriguing set-up/origin story as a nerdy, awkward Spider-Man fanatic; that was fun. However, once we witness his transition into his villainous role as Electro, things start to get hammy and ridiculous with never the slightest hint of believability or proper development. There's never a scene that explains how he suddenly turned from a shy, humble Oscorp employee into a menacing, destructive baddie. ""I AM ELECTRO!"" Yes, he actually said that in the movieIn a significantly smaller part, Paul Giamatti horribly portrays the rhino, and yes, he too laughably exclaims ""I am the Rhino!"" at one point in the film, as well as carries a terrible Russian accent (I guess that's apparently what that babble/gibberish was supposed to be). Cringe- worthy, I know! Just like the rest of the flick's dialogue. And finally, we have Peter's dear friend, Harry Osborn, who of course turns into the Green Goblin, and actually, in comparison to the rest of the ""super-evil"" characters, he was fine. Now, Dane DeHaan, for some reason, thought that putting on a forced, deep and maniacal-like voice was going to sound convincing or make him sound more like a typical teenagerit didn't work. Usually, I'm a huge fan of DeHaan's work (from Chronicle to Kill Your Darlings), but this performance really disappointed, and like the rest of the film, was quite over-the-top. Most importantly and what I briefly mentioned above, the dialogue just can't be taken seriously. The conversations frequently make you cringe as far down as you can get into your seat, and the actors clearly think that stumbling with your lines and repeating the same word makes for fine acting. In essence, almost everything in this film feels forced and unnatural, and I don't know if Webb was going for a truly comic-booky superhero movie. If so, it really worked but not in a good way. The film is so confident that it abandons any sense of being grounded and just goes all out. Screw logic and have this guy burst with electricity, and yup, he gets even more powerful with the more electricity he consumes. If you're a comic- book fanboy, you might be biased into not minding these sorts of elements, but as a pure fan of films, it honestly was difficult to stomach. Shall we get to the movie's soundtrack too? You know it's a 2014 Spider-Man movie when you hear dubstep and hip electronic music playing in the background. Did we see any of that in the original trilogy? No because it wasn't necessary, and it also wasn't popular back then. Moreover, there's a scene that unnecessarily begins playing a pop/country song that makes it feel more like a music video than an authentically-edited search for information on his dad's death. Last but not least, in comparison to the original films, The Amazing Spider- Man 2 is undoubtedly geared towards younger audiences with its inclusion of extremely kiddy humor that only saw laughter from—who else?—the little kids in the movie theater. I thought Spider-Man was excessive with his use of jokes but, at least, witty ones. So, I practically drove everything this movie offered into the ground with this review, but don't get mad at me yet, Spider-Man fans, because— at least—the movie gained from the chemistry Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone share on-screen as the couple. On another note, the filmmakers actually pulled off a considerable risk towards the end by—*gasp*— killing off a character (like they did with its predecessor), which is certainly more than Marvel Studios could ever do with their properties in their magical worlds of miraculous revivals and recoveries. Furthermore, we do get some exciting action sequences and thankfully, Spider-Man faces off against his threatening foes a few times throughout the narrative instead of just an immediate final showdown that an abundance of similar movies mistakenly feature. In the end, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn't the worst of superhero movies. Actually, it's a little better than its forerunner and even more enjoyable than some of Marvel's recent films, but when compared to the classic superhero movies that Sam Raimi graced onto screens, the X- Men franchise, and—duh—Nolan's Batman films, this new Spider-Man story hardly warrants the franchise's quick resurrection.","8 out of 25 found this helpful.

This time it also carries spectacular action. The dialogue, the beautiful score, the layers to the characters, the action...everything was so awesome!! I'm truly amazed at how they could have possibly topped the first instalment, but they did somehow. Spider man is wittier than ever, which is great to see(props to Andrew Garfield).

Also, random 'dramatic' scenes like two planes somehow going to crash unless the lights come on fast (I hardly count this as a spoiler, since it exists in the film for about 3 minutes and if you don't know instantly what's going to happen you've never seen a movie before) is Stupid. Pilots flying 'blind' would certainly take measures to go up, down, something to change course, and anyway, why would they be flying directly into each other anyway? Just dumb. Overlong.

A brand new re-imagining of the popular comic book story, it had surprisingly great performances and amounted to one of the most entertaining films of that year. And after being so keen on the first movie I was extremely excited to hear that ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" was finally going to hit theaters. It may not have lived up to my immense expectations but notwithstanding its many flaws, I really enjoyed it.We pick up our story with Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as he struggles to balance his relationship with Gwen (Emma Stone) along with his responsibility as Spider-Man. With fresh villains emerging, including an uber-cheesy Jamie Foxx as Electro and a creepy Green Goblin, he is forced to choose between his own problems and the dangers that face the city. On a much bigger scale than its predecessor, and wildly more lively, it's more of a crowd-pleaser than anything else. It has various issues concerning the antagonists, but the strongest points lie in the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, who provide the most heartwarming and endearing scenes. I realize the film may not be for everyone, but I found to be charming and amusing amidst its problems. Rated PG-13 for action, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is fun but flawed.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I love Emma Stone, but there was too much of the love story and not enough everything else. Jamie Foxx plays a formidable villain who you start out feeling sorry for but quickly turns into a jerk who you would not miss if he was destroyed. Not too sure where they are going with this version of Spidey movies, but hope this is not a sign of what they will be.

It may not be as iconic as Spider-man 2 because then, it was like the only comic book movie coming out of that year, and these days, we got tons of other comic book movies that come out each year. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone has never been better, not to mention how special their chemistry is. Andrew Garfield is actually the one that stands out, he somehow managed successfully bring more vulnerability to his acting, either successfully bring dramatic scenes to life or bring jokes and humor that freshens up the movie. Dane DeHaan as Harry is a perfect fit, probably a better fit than what James Franco did in the old Spidey franchise. The villains were also quite well developed, though I may say that they could've done more with electro. The entire cast was excellent, the action were great and the special effects were superbly satisfying, much improvement compared to the last one. My only complaint is probably there should've been more places for the viewers to breathe, because there were so many things happening in the movie, sometimes it felt a little bit too crowded (as anyone has expected), since they got 3 villains, so it's quite reasonable. Other than that, this movie is without question an improvement over the first movie, and what's important is that this movie brings the combination of great comic-book movie plot, fantastic action and special effects, and heart. If you're a fan of comic book movies, you WILL love this film, if you liked the old spidey movie, you will like this film, and if u liked the first Amazing Spider-man, you will love this movie even more. As a comic book movie, it's truly amazing.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

I still have a soft spot for Raimi's film's even though I know Garfield and Stone are way better to watch than Maguire and....ugggggh...Kirsten Dunst and the 3rd film was awful. However I will give credit to where credit is due, this film does do some stuff better. Like they show the Rhino, pre-armour, as this crazy Russian gangster. The swinging and action sequences look cool as hell. Spider-Man makes his wise cracks, which were rarely in the Raimi films. Also Peter Parker takes the initiative and researches ways to defeat his foe. And Spidey's got the original costume.Yes I said foe, singular. The plot is too dense for it's own good and it ends up devoting screen time to the wrong things. The villains are one of them. It eventually ends up being that Electro is the main villain, and man is his story arc weak and silly to begin with. Seriously, who keeps a vat of electric eels lying around, and conveniently place them under a live wire and- OK calm down. And they call Raimi's films silly. There are way too many plot threads, and some really didn't require a resolution. Especially that thing with Peter's dad. Any idiot from a mile away could've easily figured out that his dad was fleeing because this company wanted to misuse his inventions and blah blah blah screen time wasted.Another thing that wastes screen time is the on again off again relationship between Peter and Gwen. Sure the two actors have chemistry but this stuff relative to the plot was tooth rotting. And also it really pushes the hipster aesthetic on you. And for those who've read the comics, you can tell that this movie has way less than subtle foreshadowing. And this is where my argument, on why the previous decade's Spidey films (at least the first two) are actually better, comes full circle. The Raimi film's have more of a timeless quality to them. They have that post 9/11 vibe and the stories flow really well albeit being very simple. When I watch the Amazing Spidey films, I can easily tell how dated they are. From the bad haircuts and clothes to the dubstep-ish music. Thank you director of 500 days of summer.In the end this movie is enjoyable. I can nitpick it to death but we all know Marvel needs to consolidate all their characters, now.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

The new villain Electro adds to the story. Is spiderman fighting the bad guys while trying to balance his life between being spierman and Peter Parker. There are some cool little scenes in that that shows you how both affect his life. For me but i loved Electro, his powers were so awesome! The graphics are amazing and the way he looked was sick. I thought he was a good villain in this story. The green goblin also was the beginning of him. You can tell with this spiderman that its a good story but also a setting up in this renewed spiderman series. Spiderman himself is way cooler than he was in the other trilogy. His funny and much more punky in this one, which i like a lot more. This movie is a good movie a really good one, nothing special but why does it have to be, its a good movie which i would definitely watch again.

I missed this in the theater and I remember watching it in my apartment in Parma. What I did remember was thinking that it was okay. I wasn't blown away though. Jaime and I watched this as she wants to watch Spider-Man: No Way Home, but I said we needed to see this first.We are picking up where the last one left off. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) has settled in somewhat to being his alter-ego of Spider-Man. He is fighting crime, but this is polarizing the city. It doesn't help that the Daily Bugle is branding him as a villain. Spider-Man does change the life of one Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx). He saves him from being killed by a runaway truck driven by Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti). There is a freak accident that changes Max into the villain Electro.Peter's life is also quite complicated. He is haunted by the images of Gwen's dad who passed away. He is Denis Leary and Gwen is Emma Stone. Peter made a promise to break up to protect her, but she wants him to let her decide. She takes steps to do so. Peter also continues to investigate the truth of what happened to his parents, Mary (Embeth Davidtz) and Richard Parker (Campbell Scott).What I didn't remember here is how dark this one went. I can almost see why this series didn't continue with the tragedy that Peter has deal with from Uncle Ben to Captain Stacy and now even Gwen. It is wild though since they introduce that Aleksei is the Rhino, Dane DeHaan is Harry Osborn aka Green Goblin and they even bring in The Gentleman Gustav Fiers (Michael Massee). This would lead to the creation of the Sinister Six. This didn't do as well though.I can understand why. I don't think Garfield is a great Peter Parker, but he's good. He is a bit too comedic which hurt this. Stone is great as Gwen. Foxx makes a good villain in Electro. I like the look they do with him. This has a cast around them as well with DeHaan, Colm Feore, Felicity Jones, Giamatti, Sally Field, Davidtz, Scott and the rest of the cast. It is just lacking that spark for it to come together.All that I have left to say is that this is well-made. It does run too long, but it looks good. This is another CGI-fest, but it doesn't look bad. I'll bring up again that I like the look of Electro. The take on the Rhino is good as is what they do with Green Goblin. I don't think this is a poorly made movie, but just is forgettable unfortunately.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But what about this one? Was it entertaining? Yes, it was very entertaining. Holding action with great suspenseful music and the plot and story was building up more and more for every minute. Great story development, with greatly introduced characters and good plot twists. Many unexpected turns that sometimes was good and sometimes unnecessary and meh. The reason it became a little lower rating was mostly because of the unnecessary plot twist at the end, and they dragged the story too long, the film could be at least twenty minutes shorter. Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man (Peter Parker) was playing great and from my view better than in the previous. He had expression and got deep into the character. His love connection with Gwen Stacy was very well performed and showed us step by step. The interesting concept here was also the unsure knowing of who was the villain. Sometimes you could think that, sometimes you could think another way, and I really liked that. I liked that it was a question of who the villain really was, and everything got revealed more in the second act. The action sequences were amazing. Spider-mans webs were flying here and there, unique camera angles and epic swings and fades. Very great suspenseful music, with a good upbuilding beat. The visual effects were on the middle. Very decent, and could have been programmed much better. I can even say that the original Spider-man movie from 2002 did have a better quality with greater originality. To conclude, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was an entertaining superhero movie, holding action, great story development and fine acting. Could have been twenty minutes shorter and the effects could be better made, but overall, it was ok.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Too-Cool Garfield as Spider-man and Disjointed Storyline Makes for Mixed Superhero Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3020296/?ref_=tt_urv","classicalsteve","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7383416/?ref_=tt_urv","22 May 2014","Stan Lee's original idea in the creation of Spider-man was to portray a typical teenage kid with all the navigation problems of someone of that age while also including a superhero alter-ego in the mix. Peter Park, who becomes Spider-man, was in his original conception an orphaned science wiz-kid who was bitten by a radioactive spider which gave him powers and abilities similar to those of a spider while still remaining a human being. Unfortunately, the present installments of ""the Amazing Spider-man"" on film with Andrew Garfield as Spider-man has changed much about what made Peter Parker a compelling character.While Garfield is a relatively convincing actor playing roles 10 years younger than his real age, the studios have opted to re-invent Peter Parker as a cool hip late teen. Instead of the nerdy wiz kid of the 1960's and 70's, the new Parker looks more like the lead singer of the latest all-boy teen pop sensation. The problem with Garfield as Peter Parker is he's just too cool and good-looking. He dates the best-looking girl in school, who also happens to be the valedictorian, and sports perfect hair and complexion which were probably made possible by the make-up artists of Vogue Magazine. Peter Parker of the original never quite fit in as a teen in school, and his becoming Spider-man helped him act out a kind of fantasy which he couldn't as Peter Parker. I think the biggest problem I had with believing Garfield was Parker was that I didn't see why the best-looking male in school would need to don a costume and right wrongs. For the nerdy not perfect-looking Parker it makes more sense. For the way-too-cool Garfield who looks like Justin Bieber's older brother, I couldn't buy him as Peter Parker, the brilliant but geeky kid who wasn't popular. Garfield comes off as the not-so-brilliant but highly popular teen who would have a waiting list of girls who desire to date him.Aside from the problem with casting, the current film has some interesting aspects and very confusing plot elements. The film begins with a flash-back of a couple we learn later were Peter Parker's true parents, Richard and Mary Parker. Richard has been engaged in some kind of top secret project which turns out to be both lucrative and very dangerous. Fast-forward to the present. Parker, now just graduated from high school, learns that his father and his boyhood friend Harry's father were both involved in research to foster regeneration through DNA found in spiders. Harry has now inherited his father's corporation, Oscorp, but also has inherited a degenerative disease. He comes to believe a transfusion of Spider-man's blood will offer him the regenerative abilities he needs to cure himself.At the same time, at Oscorp, a lowly but brilliant technician through an accident, gains power through electricity, becoming one of Spider-man's archenemies, Electro. At first, the person who became Electro and Harry appear to be on good terms with Peter Parker. Eventually, they both become his adversaries. Intertwined through the story is the love affair between Parker and Gwen (Emma Stone). For some reason, I felt the love story aspect was allowed too much screen time, and the other plots about Harry and Electro were underdeveloped. The story becomes a kind of foursome, with Harry and Electro challenging Spider-man and in some ways his girl Gwen, who also works for Oscorp.A decent but somewhat confusing story. Much screen-time is devoted to long action sequences and the love story, but the plot about the corporation and the secret research is underdeveloped and not explained thoroughly. While still relatively entertaining, the script probably needed about 2 or 3 more rewrites. Less Spider-man flying around and more about his father and the secret research. It kind of gets better as it goes along but I had many questions which were left unanswered by film's end.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Andrew Garfield once again shines as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, bringing a level of heart and humor to the role that is a joy to watch.The movie picks up where the first one left off, with Peter struggling to balance his superhero duties with his personal life. The story is engaging and well-paced, with plenty of action and drama to keep audiences entertained.Director Marc Webb has once again created a visually stunning movie, with action scenes that are both thrilling and inventive. The special effects are top-notch, and the 3D version of the movie is particularly impressive.But what really sets The Amazing Spider-Man 2 apart is its strong supporting cast. Emma Stone returns as Gwen Stacy, and her chemistry with Garfield is electric. Jamie Foxx delivers a memorable performance as the villainous Electro, and Dane DeHaan also impresses as Peter's old friend Harry Osborn.The movie also tackles some weighty themes, including the nature of power and responsibility, and the consequences of our actions. These themes are explored with a depth and sincerity that is rare in the superhero genre, and they add an emotional weight to the movie that is both poignant and thought-provoking.Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a spectacular sequel that delivers on all fronts. It is a thrilling action movie with a strong cast, engaging story, and impressive visuals, but it is also a movie with heart and depth that will leave audiences thinking long after the credits roll.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

First things first: it's worth your time. It's a superhero movie from the Marvel stable, and certain things in Marvel's movies are always done well. Garfield's performance is great for Spidey.Now let me tell you what I said to my friend on the way out of the theater: the storyline didn't seem tight enough. It would have been nice to have some additional depth and/or development, particularly in the case of Electro's character. What seems to have happened in this movie is the same thing that bothered me about the 3rd installment from the Sam Raimi-directed series... the script tried to take on too many different things and in the process left the viewer wanting. That's not to say the pacing was slow - it isn't - but the storyline does not evolve in a way that is easy to understand; it juggles several different subplots and suffers for it. The final battle left me wanting- wait, which final battle? This is a microcosm that explains the larger problem I think most people will have.Bottom line: see it, enjoy it, and hope that in the 3rd installment there is more cohesiveness to the storyline.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The bar for great comic book films has been raised so high recently with movies like the Nolan Batman trilogy, the X-Men reboots and even this year's Captain American: The Winter Soldier.

The same goes for the Osbourne Family.This movie is playing like 20yrs earlier than Spiderman 1-3, so it should be in 1980-1990, though the technology and theme of the movie is 2014 (according to the weapons they're using and whatnot)Peter Parkers aunts character is so much different from what she used to be earlier, which is just hilarious.(Similiar to the horrible 'James Bond Skyfall' where they said that it's playing in front of all the other James Bond movies, but just have a look onto the cars and the weapons and whatnot used there.)If you are trying to jump back in the story line of a movie / series, ... how hard can it be to adjust the theme of the movie then..?I'm really speechless about how a director can **** up a movie like it was done here.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a fun sequel that doesn't quite live up to its predecessor.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3010539/?ref_=tt_urv","WheelzFourReelz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur51074827/?ref_=tt_urv","5 May 2014","The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a continuation of the Amazing Spiderman series, in case you didn't know (you probably already did). Peter Parker has been doing his Spiderman thing for a while, and he's pretty much pro at life. He's a famous superhero, he's graduating high school, and he's got a hot girlfriend. But then, circumstances happen. And movie happens. BEST SYNOPSIS EVER! I was looking forward to this movie. I did enjoy The Amazing Spiderman quite a bit and I was hoping the sequel would be good. It was, but the first is still better. Let's start off with some things that I liked. Andrew Garfield is the best Peter Parker that we've ever had. He's charming, he's funny, he's a good actor, and he just flat out looks like he can be Spiderman. Everyone else does a really good job, too. Emma Stone was a great Gwen Stacy, Jamie Foxx was a good Electro, and Dane Dehaan was a good Harry Osbourne. I would say Paul Giamatti was a good Rhino but we'll get to that later. The action is a lot of fun. It's fast paced, exciting, and just a thrill to watch. There's lots of punching, kicking, flipping, and electricity. You can easily tell that a lot of care was put into the action to make it look awesome and it certainly does. There is a little slow motion, but it takes such a small part of the action that it's hardly noticeable. The best thing about this movie is its look. I mean, this movie is just gorgeous. The cinematography is excellent, the city is really cool to look at, the special effects are awesome. That's really the best part of the look. The special effects. Especially Electro's electricity. Having all that electricity running through Jamie Foxx's body was just really cool to look. And when he uses that power yeah. It's awesome. However, there is a fair amount wrong with this movie. For starters, the story. Don't get me wrong; the story is good. It's written well and it follows the comics pretty well (Or so I've heard. I haven't read any of the comics. Shoot me.). But, the problem with this story (or stories, as I should say) is that there are too many. This movie suffers in the same way that ""3 Days to Kill"" suffers in which the many plot lines makes the movie look focus. At one point, Spiderman is trying to spend time with his girlfriend. At another, he's trying to find the secret behind his parent's disappearance. At another, he's trying to hide his identity from his aunt. At another, he's reconnecting with an old friend. At another, we have Gwen Stacey's side story. At another, we have Max's (Electro's ) side story. At another, we have Harry Osbourne's side story. It's just too much. Another problem I have with this movie is the same problem I have with the first Amazing Spiderman; the villains. I do think, as a whole, the villains were executed better in this movie than in the first. But, each villain has their own flaws that make them not as strong as they could be. And since there are three, I feel like I should go over each one of them separately. First off, we have Max becoming Electro. Now, when Max actually becomes Electro, he's pretty awesome. But before, he acts way too cartoony. I mean, I get it, Max is supposed to be obsessed with Spiderman, but I feel like it was overdone to the point of being corny. The delivery just took me out of the movie. Next, we have Harry Osbourne becoming Green Goblin. I think Dane Dehaan was absolutely fantastic as the character. This guy does a great job at being evil. However, I didn't care about the character. When you have this villain that pretty much drives the story like Harry Osbourne does, I want to connect with this character. That's the great thing about the first Spiderman trilogy. Before he turned, Harry Osbourne was a really awesome, likable guy. I just didn't like or care about the Harry in this movie. And then we have Paul Giamatti as the Rhino. There are so many things wrong with this. First off, the Rhino is only in this two and a half hour movie for about two minutes. He's pretty much here to set up the Sinister Six plot line, I get it, but if you're in the movie for that little and for no purpose, then what's the point? Second, the delivery is way too over the top. I get it, he's supposed to be a crazy killer, but Paul Giamatti's deliver is just so poorly done. He just looks stupid. Third, WHY THE HECK DOES THE RHINO HAVE A ROBOTIC SUIT? He's supposed to have a skin-tight rhino suit that he can never take off. I mean, the robot suit would be okay if it looked cool, but I wasn't impressed. It really just looked like it was thrown together last minute and they threw Paul's face on it. I did not like this. If you wait until the end to see what after credits clip will be here to segway this movie to the next you will be disappointed. Don't worry, there is an after credits scene, but it's just a promo for an upcoming Marvel movie. This movie is not worth staying until after the credits unless you want to see Jennifer Lawrence kick butt. Overall this was a pretty fun movie. The acting was great, the chemistry worked, the look of the movie was just fantastic, and the action was fun to watch. However, these certain setbacks prevent this movie from being a completely worthy sequel. If you walk into this movie thinking this is going to be the definitive Spiderman movie, then you will probably be disappointed. But, as it stands, I really enjoyed this movie and I wish this series the best.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was actually looking forward to Spider-man 4 till they decided they had to reboot the franchise. I thought the reboot was really unnecessary. Andrew Garfield does have the younger, college boy look, more so than Toby Maguire to be Spider-man like he is in the comics and the 1994 animated series. Plus they also added more believable elements, like he used gadgets to create webbing, just like in the comics, which was far more believable than the Sam Raimi's movies. Unfortunately the first film had too many mysteries too many secrets about Parker's parents which were not cleared up at all by the end, they also kind of ruined the tragic Uncle Ben scene and Garfield's acting in that situation was not good. Plus the first film dragged on and on till the lizard showed up which was too late in the film, and the love story was not developed well at all like it was in the Sam Raimi's films in my honest opinion. Plus Spiderman looked really weak in the entire film, he needed way to much help to stop the lizard. What I did like was Garfield's humorous jokes as Spiderman, specially his interactions with the lizard otherwise the movie failed to impress.The Amazing Spiderman 2 on the other hand does many things right, it first clears up what happened to Parker's parents, the reason for their sudden departure, much better scenes between Gwen and Parker. And honestly an overall interesting plot. Harry's family back-story and the Oscorp back-story is extremely interesting and I was deeply invested in his character. Jamie Fox was actually good after his TRANSFORMATION before that he just came off like an idiot or a goofy spider-man fan-boy. Electro came off as a tough and believable villain and his fight scenes against Spiderman were done very well. Unlike it's prequel the film keeps me interested for most of it's duration mainly the scenes involving Electro and Harry, the interactions between Parker/Spidey and Harry were also done excellently. The climax was also good but unfortunately for me the ending was ruined on the net before I watched the film. But I still think this film also ended on a high note and I am actually interested in the sequel, and that is not something that came to my mind after watching the first film. I also felt Garfield did better in the emotional scenes this time around. Emma Stone was pretty much the same like she was in the last film, Jamie Fox was great as the dangerous Electro and James De Haan was just awesome in his role. The supporting cast also did a good job. The film's overall plot is good, but it is not what carries it strong performances from the main cast, regardless of cliché dialogs, the film also uses great high-tech graphics and CGI those action scenes are fantastic even better than the last film, all fight and action scenes were done well and were all fun to watch. Unfortunately the serious dialogs scenes were boring and kind of dragged on, dragging this movie down for me.Overall this is a fun action that is a good watch for any Spiderman fan, but I still love the Animated Series the most. Overall: 7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It follows the story of Peter Parker, once again played by Andrew Garfield, as he continues to navigate the challenges of being a superhero while also dealing with new threats and personal struggles. The film also explores Peter's relationships with Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone, and Harry Osborn, played by Dane DeHaan, and his conflicts with the film's main antagonists, Electro, played by Jamie Foxx, and Green Goblin, played by Dane DeHaan.One of the things that I enjoyed about the film was the performances by the lead actors, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone had great chemistry as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, and their performances were engaging and brought depth to their characters. The visual effects used to create Spider-Man and the villains were also impressive and added to the overall enjoyment of the movie. The action scenes were also well-choreographed and provided some exciting moments.However, compared to the first movie, the pacing of the film was uneven, some scenes felt rushed and others dragged on for too long. The film's plot was also a bit convoluted and had too many subplots that felt unnecessary. Additionally, the chemistry between the characters was lacking and some of the subplots felt unnecessary.Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a film that provides some exciting action scenes and impressive visual effects. However, it falls short in terms of pacing and plot complexity compared to the first movie. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's performances as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy are a highlight, but the film's convoluted plot and uneven pacing make it difficult to fully enjoy the film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"10","/10","The best in the Spider Man series even though its flawed and rushed.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3089943/?ref_=tt_urv","kyleluna","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32170352/?ref_=tt_urv","21 September 2014","Let me say that I'm a huge Spider Man fan ever since I saw the original Sam Raimi trilogy and I love the early series but when I learned that there were issues in the early film series I lost interest and I never watched any of Sam Raimi's Spider Man trilogy again after learning about its issues. But when I heard they were rebooting it with a new director and casts along with the same production team returning to make a brand new Spider Man film I was super excited. When I saw the 2012 reboot I was surprised and I started to like the series again. Now this year when I watched The Amazing Spider Man 2 the series seem to get better and better while Raimi's films are extremely flawed forever. Marc Webb's reboot films is making good progress. I remember being at the exclusive premiere of this film in IMAX back in April 30 me and my sister hit the exclusive late screening of the film which is at 11:55 pm to 2:00 am in the morning and when we watched it I was super amazed with it and I so love the new Spider Man film its even better than the previous films because this film like Spider Man 3 because the film has too many characters from the comic books where as Spider Man 3 failed due to the presence of too many characters from the comics and less screen time for the villains like Venom who was 2 or 3 minutes only in the film The Amazing Spider Man 2 worked a lot more even though there are way too many characters from the comics it managed to stay in the proper direction in terms of character development and introducing new characters even though this movie is way too rushed than Spider Man 3 because when we get to see a bunch of new characters Marc Webb seriously handled everything very well unlike Raimi who seriously worked way too hard and failed when the third Spider Man film was released Webb did a slightly better job than how Raimi worked on his films. One of the film's main highlights of course is the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone and it gives the movie a very good feel something the Sam Raimi's films failed to do and Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's chemistry will always be better than Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst's chemistry in the early films also the new villain Electro is amazing and the design of Electro is superb and it is way better than the Lizard's design in the first film. Plus one of the other film's highlights is the CGI and special effects which is always the highlight of the Spider Man films even in the Sam Raimi trilogy(The Sandman special effects are my personal favorite in the early films)but I love the special effects here way better and I would say that The Amazing Spider Man 2 has the best special effects in the series since Spider Man 2 and 3. OK it maybe rushed and flawed but they are easy to forget once you see the movie's highlights which are extremely unstoppable in the film and will keep you glued to the screen until the end and while we did see a couple of characters that we've seen before like the Osborn family what's great about reintroducing the early characters from the early films is that they are not only portrayed by new actors who give a stunning and amazing plus mesmerizing performance but I love how they are given a darker back story than in the early films. Overall The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a great sequel to the 2012 reboot and is a major improvement also to its predecessor in terms of character development, special effects, designs and stunning visuals and this is where the series get to expand where we are introduced to a lot of new characters and learn a lot more about the characters and I'm hoping that The Amazing Spider Man 3 and the spin offs will expand the Spider Man universe a bit more and have bigger and better fights.","21 out of 38 found this helpful.

I wouldn't pay money at a theatre to see it tho.I still don't understand Jamie Foxx's role in this movie; completely rushed and undetermined. There is a serious correlation between his character and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze in the old George Clooney Batman movie. The villain in this movie was seriously underdeveloped.Being an admirer of the the Amazing Spiderman, I was hoping the same movie elements would exist, and they did...but not without the pitfalls. Sequels always have a way of falling flat.I will give a nod to the indie shot in the bedroom scene. This movie, cinematography-ly speaking is all over the friggin map. You got awesome cgi, hand-held prosumer DSLR's, super syncopated slo-mo and Paul Giamatti talking in a terrible Russian accent in a full metal rhinoceros body suit - that is no lie my fellow IMDb friends. Spiderman really needs a new story, one that audience haven't seen before and this movie is all the same ole same ole with a bit of a better ending.

Other than raking big bucks, it has its share of weaknesses and good points but there is nothing 'amazing' about it as such.Spider-Man continues his struggle with himself, his life (love and otherwise), conclusions, and pretty much everything a normal adults does. This makes him a superhero everyone identifies with easily (perhaps the reason there is never an apparent overdose of Spidey).Strong points of the film: Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey: Emma is a vivacious actress who lights up the screen every time she enters the frame. Personally, she was the reason I actually decided to watch the first film when it clearly seemed unnecessary. The sequel has her carry on the good work; she and Andrew Garfield together, still sparkle. In fact she is what keeps Spidey grounded and thinking clearly. Without her guidance, we all know how confused our web-slinger gets.Supporting cast: primarily Dane DeHaan (Harry Osborne), Aunt May (Sally Field), and Paul Giamatti (Rhino) deliver strong performances, even though they had very minimal screen time to make any more impact. Osborne looked the right amount of ominous and can be looked forward to in upcoming films.The final 10 minutes: sum up everything a Spidey flick is all about, and energizes the audience. With no hope of deliverance, a kid picks up the mantle against an undeniable threat; Spidey gets over his slump and get back in the battle field.Other than these, Garfield does well as Spidey, the film starts off pretty well too, and there are some good laughs here and there. After a long time, got to chance enjoy an effects laden film in good old 2D, thoroughly enjoyed the 3D-less experience.Weak points of the film: Script is in complete disarray, and no matter how perky a chemistry Stacey-Garfield share, there is no salvation for a film scripted this poorly.Electro: Jamie Foxx simply...well, sucked—such a waste of potential. Rhino in his few minutes looked a much better villain.All in all a decent one time watch. You enjoy it and the same time wonder what is the need of continuing with the franchise.Upcoming film: Sinister Six have been given a sneak preview: Doctor Octopus, The Vulture, and Mysterio are more or less going to be unleashed. Rhino and Osborne look promising, others better be good because with Emma Stone (Gwen Stacey) departing from film there may be no saving grace for film, unless it is perfect.Post-credit: there is an X-Men: Days of Future Past scene that runs after the credits. It has a young William Stryker, Mystique, Toad, Spike, Ink, and Havoc. No apparent connection with Spider-man'a next film.7/10 P.S., of course, Stan Lee has a cameo!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

So just to name a few genres included in the latest Marc Webb's Spidey adaptation, the audience will experience action, comedy, romance, crime, fantasy, drama, detective fiction and even some musical elements. Two years after the first movie, Marc Webb brings back Peter Parker/Spider-Man, portrayed by Andrew Garfield, to the big screen and tries to pack it all the above together in just 142 minutes. If he succeeds or not, is a pretty difficult question to answer, but let's give it a try.While filling in the gaps of the ""dark"" secrets Peter Parker's parents left for their son, we watch the young hero trying to balance between his new life as New York's superhero, for some people still a vigilante, and his love interest, Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone, whose dead father is haunting him, because he promised to stay away from his daughter. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone deliver convincing representations of their characters and Marc Webb does great work, and lives up to other Marvel superhero movies, at least on the subject of the special effects.Three villains emerge during the movie, a not-in-the-right-mind electrical engineer Max Dillon, played by Jamie Foxx, who falls into a tank full of angry laboratory eels and is turned into Electro, the main villain of the film. Electro, who has an obsession with the New York's superhero, nevertheless turns against him, as Spider-Man doesn't recall his name when they encounter for a second time. A wanna-be main villain, Harry Osborn/Green Goblin, played by Dane DeHaan, brings his eccentric acting skills on board and delivers a fine performance as Harry Osborn, which cannot be said though of his performance as Green Goblin, mainly for the reason that there is no substantial time to decide on this one. The last and the least Aleksei Sytsevich/The Rhino makes an appearance almost as long as that of Stan Lee and also tries to steal some of that sparkle from Sparkles, as Spidey calls Electro during the whole movie, making us wish they would stick at most to two names per villain.Read the rest at Austrian Times/Panorama News","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I like how they've chosen to follow a storyline exploring Oscorp and the Parker family's dark secrets. There are some things i feel they should have changed (Like the underground laboratory) but overall a good arc to follow.Negative: What were they thinking with making Harry Osborn become the Goblin before Norman. This is a bad decision that will likely anger many fans. They gave Harry a plausible reason to become the Goblin, but this still does not sit well with me. The build-up to the Sinister Six makes it obvious that the rebooted Spiderman franchise's main motivation is to sell toys and cash in on those rather than the movies themselves.","8 out of 26 found this helpful.

Taking in the negative and positive comments about it, everyone still had an overall good outlook on how this turned out. It definitely surpassed the first on every level in my book.The story, even deeper than I expected, and it was very interesting to see how Peter's (Andrew Garfield) parents played a vital and tragic role of who he is and the company known as Oscorp. Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) is back as one of my favorite love interests for a superhero film: very smart, beautiful, emotional and even though she gets in danger, she does her very best to help out in a important way. I don't want to spoil anything, but it keeps your attention, you care for the characters, and by the end of the film you are both left with a sad feeling of loss, as well as triumphant when you see your favorite web-slinger return to fight the evils of NYC.The action is very cool, and Spider-Man's costume is so awesome looking. From incredibly immersive scenes of swinging around the city with Spidey (which looks amazing in 3D at times), to him entangling in intense battles with a powerful Electro, or a very menacing Green Goblin (sorry William Dafoe, this one works better).A lot of people were worried about 3 villains being in this film, and how much of a problem it was in the winy ""Toby-Spidey"" Spider-Man 3. No worry, the film balances this out quite nicely. The main villain for certain is Electro (performed very well by Jamie Foxx), and his journey from a slightly off the edge Spider-Man fan boy with no friends into a dark and electricity leeching monster. Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) plays a pivotal role in Spider-Man's life story, especially at the very end of the film when he finally becomes Green Goblin. Rhino (I love Paul Giamatti) is in the film at the very beginning and very end, and leaves you wanting so much more from his psychotic and hilarious performance, and his bada$$ Rhino suit.All in all, fans of Spider-Man and anybody who has seen the first TASM should definitely see this movie. It exceeds its predecessor, and leaves you yearning for more. Can't wait for TASM 3! 9/10","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

The first Amazing Spiderman had a good enemy, and this one had a decent one as well with Electro. I especially like the camera following Spiderman himself while swinging around the city in these films (feels kind of like a roller coaster ride!).

Most of the movie is spent on scenes and relationships that are, at best, tangential to the plot. An efficient version of the movie could have been done in a half- hour TV special. We spent most of the movie waiting for something, ANYTHING INTERESTING TO HAPPEN! While Spidey is usually the most conflicted/introspective of the major superheroes, he is still an action hero. The result was exactly opposite of 2011's ""Thor"", in which the normally flat and boring character had an engaging story.The writers apparently used Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, as a template, but decided that the 42 minutes and 37 seconds of Aragorn / Awren romance was the best part of that movie. So, they expanded those scenes and made the movie that combines the worst elements of Spider-man, Return of the King, and Waiting For Godot (a play in which the main characters hang themselves because they are bored). The only reason I give it 4 stars is that 1. it had decent special effects, 2. it set up future movies (anybody recognize Felicity Jones' character), 3. the plot, while boring, was comprehensible and internally consistent.","8 out of 26 found this helpful.

Top notch A-Level (Avengers level) VFX.2. Thank God, this movie didn't had any scenes of saving the American President or a flying Passenger Plane.3. Good Senti Love story 4. Good, True 3D Movie Negative: 1. The story is simple & typical. A new Villain comes to destroy the city & the Hero saves them. Serious story seekers can watch the Bourne Series again ! :P2.

I enjoyed how they showed Spider-Man,i mean he is one of the most amazing superheroes,why? Because he is a friendly web-slinger,he might give you a ride,he might buy something to eat for homeless guy. They also added his humor,which i think was kind of missing from Raimi's trilogy,no matter how hard can his private life be,he is always funny. They also concentrated a lot on Peters relationship with Gwen,because as we know from the comics he is a ""hard luck charlie"" or whatever they call him.Also this is just the beginning ,Webb tried to expand the spidey's universe,we will see smythe who made spider-slayers,Sinister-Six and probably venom. BTW don't miss the scene after the credits,it is amazing and we might even see spidey with X-men! Do not listen to haters,i am pretty sure that most of them haven't even seen the movie,if you love comics then you will probably love this movie.

The Script is predictable & hardly offers anything new in terms of story-telling! Certainly, Spidey Deserves Better! 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' Synopsis: Peter Parker runs the gauntlet as the mysterious company Oscorp sends up a slew of super-villains against him, impacting on his life.'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is visually brilliant & the action set-pieces, are outstanding. But in terms of storytelling, its strictly average. The love-story is blandly treated, while the hero versus villain conflict, has a few wow moments. But overall, everything comes across as predictable & foreseeable. The narrative is very been-there-seen-that!Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci & Jeff Pinkner's Screenplay is very okay, although a twist in the finale, does leave an impact. Marc Webb's Direction is dull. Graphics are top-class. Performance-Wise: Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man/Peter Parker, continues to deliver sincerely. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, looks gorgeous. Jamie Foxx as Electro/Max Dillon, delivers the best performance in the film. He's creepy & menacing. Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn, hams. Sally Field as Aunt May, is dignified. Paul Giamatti as Rhino, appears in a tiny role.On the whole, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is far from amazing.","9 out of 31 found this helpful.

Peter's relationship with Gwen, electro, peter's relationship, electro etc and it was kind of annoying. Another thing people might not catch was that THE SUIT WAS DIFFERENT!

Too long, mixed plot with to many characters and weird suit, but on a good note there was good things about the film. The action was pretty good and the special effects want bad either.

Spidey returns for his most most difficult battle yet - cramming as much web swinging, mid-air pirouettes and cheesy (but often cleverly timed) typical Spidey chat lines in a certain amount of time (142 minutes). Even though the special effects of this film will leave you almost on the edge of your seat, the most memorable and enjoyable scenes from Marc Webb's newest instalment of the 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is the refreshing on-screen chemistry between Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) and Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield).Jamie Foxx's portrayal of the eccentrically creepy Max Dillon who happens to stumble into his own world of trouble when he is transformed from the geeky Spider-Man loving employee of Oscorp to the easily manipulated, mayhem-causing Spider-Man loathing Electro. Jamie Foxx brought a new feeling to the category of Spidey villains by seeming misunderstood and mentally unable to cope. However Electro is not the only villain who seeks to wreck havoc, the Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan) returns in his best form yet. Yet again the 'Spider-Man' franchise has thrown one too many enemies into the movie. Due to the abundance of villains that Parker has to face, we only get half of the story. In 'The Amazing Spider-Man' we was allowed to look deeply into Dr. Curt Connors'/ The Lizard's (Rhys Ifans) mind and see what was torturing him so much. However having too many evil characters did not allow Webb enough time to develop them enough so we could fully understand them. Maybe for the next film the franchise should take some notes from Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and concentrate on a single brute who wishes to rid Gotham of the Dark Knight.The public's current favourite heroin, Gwen Stacey, is back looking as good as ever and certainly does not disappoint. If you did not already know (as of the writing of this review) Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield have been dating for over a year, and it definitely shows on the big screen. Webb succeeded more in creating a realistic, awkward but genuine typical teen relationship, teenage boys everywhere are still jealous of Spider- Man but now it is not because of his incredibly envy inducing web-swinging abilities, it is because of gorgeous down-to-Earth girlfriend. The whole reason this cinematic mix-up is worth watching is because the unique couple lighten up the atmosphere of the film that will make you feel you are right in the middle of them.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

He fills out the character with displays of wit and an emotional depth so in-tune with who Spider-man is that he deserves accolades. This movie shows you what it is to be Spider-man. Previous films have shown web slinging, Spidey-sense, combat, and his relationships to varying degrees of success, but never so greatly as this one.The flapping fabric of the suit, the sheer vertigo (can't wait to see it in 3D), and sense of speed all combine to make you feel what it's like to be Spidey. It's awesome! When things get too hectic, the action slows down letting you soak it all in. The style is spot-on and nothing feels over done, which is fantastic because Jamie Foxx as Electro is quite the visually demanding villain. His performance is superb, as with all the starring cast. The writing and editing, combined with A+ actors, creates a believable, naturally progressing story line. One that draws you in for the ride and then, to really hook you, add Hans Zimmer's soundtrack on top of that. It's the frosting on the cake, and it's so good that you go for a corner piece. The only way the this movie disappointed was the fact that there wasn't more (also, I could have used more Paul Giamatti). Definitely a set-up for future movies, so I can't wait to see where Spidey goes next. Highly recommend!","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The Amazing Spider Man 2 and this whole reboot series sure seems like a big question mark","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3020209/?ref_=tt_urv","alexcomputerkid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44939296/?ref_=tt_urv","21 May 2014","In 2012, the first Spider-Man came out from the new reboot series and it came out in a very ""out of the blue"" way. I can't say I never did appreciate a Spider-Man film though because Spider-Man is for sure one of my favorite superheroes out there. Why though, would they create a Spider-Man series five years after the last film in the original series?The Amazing Spider-Man of 2012 still was a positive even with all the hate I give it. It brought in new rising stars who we got to know and it played well in the summer market. The film got a new audience for this famous Marvel character and it generated sequels.In this movie, following the events in last movie, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is really up in the air (no pun intended) with his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and a new villain, Electro (Jamie Fox) comes into the spotlight. Peter Parker also must deal with an old friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) who is now in charge of Oscorp and who's emotions turn him into the villain the Green Goblin. Parker is sure dealing with lot of stuff and it's starts to show.Andrew Garfield is again likable which makes you wish he was around more often in films. He has very good chemistry with his co-star Emma Stone but the story of them trying to solve their relationship is surely past done by now. Still though, they make this film and I don't know where this film would be without the two of them together. Electro is nerdy and not a mentally stable guy and it's quite interesting for him to be in this film because he is not the most known villain in the Spider-Man universe which makes him original. The special effects with him are quite quirky and of a different vibe than what we have seen before but like the most characters in this film, his pacing is way off. Rising star, Dane DeHaan known for the forgotten but solid film Chronicle is just as silly as Electro but it's Dehaan himself who eventually who ruins this character for us. He can't develop the character himself making it a mundane character nor is his acting really up to a par. Even the usually lovable Sally Field as Aunt Jane is nowhere to be found and really adds nothing to film even when she is around.There also isn't much of a plot here. Sure, these characters do add something but a large portion of the film wanders around going nowhere and the movie has some really bad pacing. You would expect the typical long, action battle scenes to end the story and here the last battle scene sure does change the whole series. The main settings is New York City which it had to be but really you know what you are getting with this setting by now. It' a plot that has a lot to it but doesn't really go anywhere with it. I give the substance here a barely passing grade.These are probably some reasons why this is movie is getting hated on after only one week at the top of the box office. You have wonder what Sony Pictures thinks of the future now for this series. This reboot continues to introduce us to new things to this character that we never thought would come to us but still fails to deliver the necessary stuff to make a really good Spider-Man film. I can't even say that I'm even looking forward to the likely sequels coming in the next few years and I never said this when the original sequels were coming. The Amazing Spider Man 2 and this whole reboot series sure seems like a big question mark to me.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"6","/10","While certainly one of the weaker films based on the wall-crawler, and with its share of flaws, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is able to pull through. A very decent sequel.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3011131/?ref_=tt_urv","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4669024/?ref_=tt_urv","6 May 2014","Marc Webb's ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is one of those movies that was destined to conjure up mixed reception from critics and fans. The key ingredients are all there. But it just doesn't quite gel together as it did in the prior film, and certainly not as well as it did to the prior film trilogy that Webb's movies serve as a reboot of. (The Sam Raimi trilogy of 2002-2007) But even when it doesn't gel together perfectly, this film is able to salvage itself and elevate itself beyond its flaws thanks to its abundant strengths.Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is at an uncertain time of his life. Struggling with his feelings for girlfriend Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone), while still feeling guilt over her father's death, we see him going through the stages of make-ups and break-ups repeatedly, as he is worried his dual-life as Spider-Man could hurt her. At the same time, he attempts to re-connect with his childhood friend Harry Osbourne (Dane DeHaan), who is going through a troubled time in his life after inheriting Oscorp from his late father. These matters are made even more complex by the arrival of a new villain- Electro (Jamie Foxx), a troubled and socially awkward man suffering an unhealthy obsession with Spider-Man who is transformed by a tragic accident into a powerful being made of electricity.The film has been highly criticized by many, and I will say it is with good reason. The trouble really all comes back to the script by Roberto Ocri, Alex Kurtzman and Jeff Pinkner. (With addition contributions to the story by James Vanderbilt) This movie is one of the most over- complex and over-stuffed juggling acts I've seen since, well... 2007's ""Spider-Man 3"", which yielded some similar criticism. Too much is happening in the film, causing a lot of development to go out the window. Key plot lines (of which there are many) often only have 2-3 scenes devoted to development and resolution, and it's not very satisfying. It also doesn't help that it feels like a large amount of content was cut from the film for pacing reasons. It feels like there's a lot missing here. I also think our writing team made some bold but foolish choices with how some of the plot-lines and characters are developed, and how, well, cartoonish some sequences come across. I hate to say it, but the writing sucks.HOWEVER, the film is able to save itself from completely imploding from the poor writing. Yes, the film is salvaged and actually made decent and entertaining thanks to the wonderful cast, fantastic direction, competent production and top-notch visuals and action. I've always firmly believed that a flawed script isn't a death sentence... if the rest of the production is strong, weak writing can be forgiven. And this is a case of just that.This cast is just plain magical. Garfield really is in his element here. I wasn't a huge fan of his performance in the prior film, but here he absolutely shines. Stone is just lovely in her portrayal of Gwen, making her so likable and so human, you'll fall in love with her almost as much as Peter has. Jamie Foxx is a lot of fun as Electro, making him tragic (albeit not necessarily in a likable way, but in a way that you can pity him) and also quite intimidating. Dane DeHaan is perfectly cast as Osbourne, giving him a lot of depth and pain, yet also a faint glimmer of light and hope inside. And supporting roles by the likes of Chris Cooper, Sally Field and Paul Giamatti are just so much fun and very well-played.Marc Webb's direction is also a huge step-up. His visual storytelling is so slick and pitch-perfect for this sort of material. I wasn't sure about his earlier work, as I wasn't too impressed by ""(500) Days of Summer"", but here he shows how capable he is with handling a variety of material- from the pure emotional to the intensely action-packed. I have to say, he has particularly grown in how he directs his action, as I believe this film probably has some of the best action out of all five ""Spider-Man"" features released during the past 12 years.The rest of the production is top-notch. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and even awe-inspiring at times. The set design is great. The costume design wonderful. (I wasn't sure about the new Spider-Man outfit, but it totally works on-screen) Hans Zimmer's score is a good match for the material. (And thankfully, this is probably Hans Zimmer's least ""Hans-Zimmer-sounding"" score.) And the visual effects are among the best I've seen this year.I also have to comment on the 3D. I'm not a huge 3D fan. For me, it's a take-it-or-leave-it gimmick. I don't care whether or not I see a film in 3D. But this is definitely one film I'm glad I saw in 3D. While dialog and plot scenes don't benefit much from the added depth, the action sequences certainly do. During the action and web-slinging sequences, I actually felt like I was swinging along with Spider-Man, and I got that same lovely light feeling in my chest, belly and head that roller-coasters me. Easily one of the best 3D viewing experiences I've had.I do think that the script unfortunately bogs the film down, and sadly makes it arguably the most flawed entry in the franchise. (And probably the second-weakest after ""Spider-Man 3"") But I cannot deny how strong all other aspects of this production are. The weak script is mostly forgivable thanks to the other elements at play.I am giving ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" a slightly above average 6 out of 10. It's very flawed, but still quite entertaining. This is a web-swing of fun that is still worth taking for some fans.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This second installment comes with a gigantic thud of awesomeness, surpassing the previous 'The Amazing Spider man' to a devastatingly far extent. Although I don't know much about the comics, this really was a marvellous movie, a definite must to see. Greatness can only merely be told online, but not effectively enough, especially for a movie of this caliber. Besides every other element of this movie, it truly is a 'visual spectacle'.

The Amazing Spider-man is to me a quite good reboot. If previous movie was more about the origins, this is much more for a super-hero clash-down movie, mixed with a romance-plot enough sturdy and believable.What definitely makes this movie is again the theatricality of the villain, and of most of the battles.Something that with the previous trilogy could not be done, is a huge expansion that makes possible the making of more than a trilogy, I could explain with this the reason that the Avengers plot-line is not matching with spidey's anywhere.I'd say that comic-fans might like this, and also people that haven't grown up with the old trilogy (I myself was too young at the time).Music is something very electro-tecno like, and I wondered that Hans Zimmer actually worked on that. I guess he did the job taking a bit of his free-time, while working on that gorgeous score that he did for Interstellar.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

He's been my favourite ever since I saw the Nicholas Hammond movie length TV pilot as a child. Since then, there had been periodic rumours about a Spidey movie, but nothing until Mr. Raimi's Trilogy that blew Spidey fans out of the water.....and many others! (Well, 2 movies of that Trilogy did anyway, but that's another review) Then a new incarnation came along via Mr. Mark Webb.The Amazing Spiderman was a great re-invention of the Raimi raised franchise, great cast and crew seemed to give us Spidey fans.....and the many others yet another winning Spidey flick to love.......So?.....What happened here? Amazing Spiderman 2 has mostly the same cast that appealed to fans of the first one. It has the same director, who I must say, done a terrific job directing. The problem is not HOW he directed, but WHAT he directed.The action scenes are the fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants, roller-coaster stuff that we have come to expect (rightly so) and love in modern action cinema. Webb's direction makes us feel, on more than one occasion, that we ARE Spidey, or at least hanging on to him for dear life as he swings his way through the city. It's great stuff and if watched in 3D there are some nice effects thrown in at times also. The action sequences are all done well and raise the heartbeat a little. Exactly what we want in a super-hero flick. Only problem is, these scenes are way too few and far between.Way too much time is spent on character development. Back-story takes up some time also, but nowhere near as much as the characters relationships with each other. Plus the back-story is interesting to watch, whilst the relationships, especially that of Peter's relationship with Gwen, seem to drag on and hold up the pace of the movie significantly and we are left almost praying for the next action scene to hurry up and grace us. But the action scenes seem to arrive late each time. Yes, they try and make up for their tardiness, but 'Too little, too late' is an emerging motto as this slow paced movie progresses.Of course character development is important in any film, but not at the expense of the more important elements. This is, after all, Spiderman and super-hero movies are kinda meant to be primarily action based. At times The Amazing Spiderman 2 seems to forget it's a super-hero movie. It's a pity, because it had the potential to be a great sequel to it's great prequel.","9 out of 31 found this helpful.

I am a big Spider-man fan and this was by far the best film yet.The film was very fast-paced; there was never a dull moment. At first, the movie seemed to progress too fast, but in the end I enjoyed this aspect because it made the film constantly exciting. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone do a very good job acting in general and portraying the love interest. Although there are a few bumps in their relationship, it is not overly dramatic like Maguire/Dunst in Spider-mans 1, 2 and 3, which was a relief.People complain that there were too many villains, but this was not a problem at all. This film did well incorporating and introducing both villains and their action with Spider-man.The only thing that disappointed me was the action--in reviews I had read that there was a lot and that it was well-done. The special effects were very well done, but the action between Spider-man and the main villains was limited. Additionally, the action between Spider-man and his villains still was not up to par with that of Spider-man 2 with Doc Ock. Although the action was not what I was expecting, it was still a great part of the film and very enjoyable. Also, although Jamie Foxx did a good job in this film, using him seemed unnecessary, especially because he is the sparkling-blue Electro for most of the film, you can hardly tell that it is Jamie Foxx, and he doesn't talk much while he is Electro. However, Foxx did a good job and contributed to the film.In closing, I highly recommend this film. It is clearly the best Spider-man film until now and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire film. It was very interesting, engaging, and exciting. You won't be disappointed.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

Jamie Foxx was a commendable Electro, Emma Stone was the beyond average love interest, but the star of the show was Dane DeHaan's flawless Harry Osborn. All these actors and many more showed the emotional depth the characters needed and embodied the personalities from the comics perfectly.The script and story was the same old Spider-Man formula, only it was told in such a compelling way that it was a film of its own. My only problem with the script refers to Paul Giamatti, whose dialogue felt a bit flat. The pacing of the film was a bit iffy, as if the start was rushed, but it found a suitable speed half-way through.The visuals were flawless, maybe a front-runner for this years VFX Academy Award. It created such a vibrant picture, introducing epic eye- candy.I was not fond of James Horner's score for the first Spidey reboot, but Hans Zimmer, he is the king of film composing. The soundtrack was phenomenal and creates a perfect image of Spider-Man.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was a nice, visual blockbuster, but had a few issues, so I give it a 7.5/10, behind Spider-Man 2 and The Amazing Spider-Man.","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

First, the script is a jumble of several stories, haphazardly crammed together. Each plotline is rush and unmotivated, making the film constantly contrived. Peter and Gwen inexplicably breakup and makeup, people become villains for ridiculous reasons, and the backstory of Peter's parents is convoluted and pointless. Furthermore, the combination of these half-baked narratives is worse than each individually because their moods are incompatible and the overall film swiftly becomes tone deaf. Almost instantly, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 devolves into a noisy cluster of visuals rather than a cohesive movie.Meanwhile, the filmmaking of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is absent. The imagery is uninspired and ugly, the structureless editing creates emotional whiplash, and the production design is asinine. Garfield and Stone try to salvage the material but clearly have little character instruction. The same goes for the supporting cast, all of whom are lost about what tone to strike. Audiences might hope that the special effects are a saving grace, but even that looks goofy at key moments. Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 tries to do too much and accomplishes nothing, making it a chore to sit though.Writing: 2/10

"8","/10","My favourite Spiderman yet with more to come!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3000725/?ref_=tt_urv","evertonfangames","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur50178249/?ref_=tt_urv","19 April 2014","I'm just going to start off by saying I was never a fan of Raimi's films (please no hate) but my personal preference is the more Dark Knight style. The main reason as to why this is my favourite is because it's far from your cheesy superhero movie. So I never found (Raimi's) Spiderman 2 that much of a challenge to beat. However I get why people call this a movie part of a franchise rather than a stand alone blockbuster. I'll go through this by each category and no major spoilers are given away only stuff we know from the trailers.Plot: I'll start of by saying I really like the way TASM endeavours into Richard Parker and to why Peter is orphaned. The way Richard ties into the movie is quite clever and without giving too much away, we see him give an explanation as to how Peter could become Spiderman and how Harry could become the Green Goblin. I also like the way Harry was introduced and to how he came to hate Spiderman. The movie has been criticised for trying to do too much and I felt although Peter's inner conflict over Gwen is necessary, getting her to go to England was a bit much. It is a totally realistic situation (well for a superhero movie) but it felt too much seeing Peter jump from trying to help Harry, to discovering about his father and then to Gwen who's going to England. It felt a bit disjointed with the transitions between all of the dramas.Main Characters: Spiderman: Did a great job of portraying wise-cracking Spiderman without going over the top and being a total dick. His fighting was pretty badass too. After TASM 1 the general consensus was that Garfield was a better Peter and Maguire was a better Spiderman. Of course Maguire fans will still say Tobey was better but I reckon the majority will call Garfield the better Spiderman after this one. Peter:I loved Garfield's non cry-baby version of Peter TASM1 and he backed it up with another great performance here! There was a great bit of acting between him and Aunt May when talking about Richard.Gwen: I'm trying to avoid bagging out Raimi's films but its fair to say Emma Stone is far better than Kirsten Dunst. Gwen gives a powerful non naggyperformance. In Spiderman 2 MJ and Gwen have a similar problem, Petercan't date them because of personal reasons. The main difference is that Gwen isn't a naggy female dog! Yes Gwen knows that he's Spiderman but she doesn't make it all about herself. OK enough comparison to Raimi's films, Stone does amazing and has great chemistry with Garfield and she does what she can to make herself of use and help Spidey.Electro: A solid performance from Foxx but not show stealing. Max Dillon came across as very creepy (intentionally) and credit to Foxx he still made us feel sympathetic to him. He was a badass villain for sure who thrived on attention but wasn't given enough screen time! Harry(Green Goblin): One more Raimi comparison. The first time I watched the originals I really liked Franco as Harry, the second time I felt he was cheesy and over acted. DeHaan was fantastic as Harry! I even felt sympathetic towards him but as the Green Goblin wasn't given enough screen time as well. DeHaan was a superior Osborn in my opinion but his appearance as the Goblin wasn't lengthy or memorable enough to overshadow Dafoe's version. Action: The action in this movie is brilliant! The fight scenes are my favourite from any Spiderman but there wasn't enough! The middle of the movie was deep, focusing on the conflicts of Peter but it is still a superhero movie, we want action. The way the movie went they could have made a real badass classic Spiderman vs Goblin fight but other reasons did prevent it. I hope in the Sinister Six they focus less on Peter and more on fighting! The first fight scene with Electro was awesome and I loved the spidey sense slow mo!Soundtrack: I love Hans Zimmer and his soundtracks and he did not disappoint in this one! Him and Pharrell Williams made a really intense atmosphere when Spidey and Electro met for the first time! However, I thought they blew a huge opportunity when Electro rose from his Darth Vader style bed. They could have made a really intimidating atmosphere like Star Wars does with Vader but they went for a comical soundtrack instead which really didn't appeal to meConclusion: A great film but its more of a setup for bigger things to come! I can't wait for a Sinister Six film and also Venom! My fave Spidey yet but there is room for improvement!","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

He eliminates the idea that Spider-Man and Peter Parker are the same person by giving the two characters their own layers and depths worthy of respect and admiration. As Spider-Man, he's the classic trash-talking, sarcastic mischievous hero while as Peter Parker, he's the relatable teenager struggling with everything life throws at us all: his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) plays a fundamental part in this as he struggles to keep the promise he made to a dying Captain Stacy, Gwen's father. The chemistry between the two (with aid from Andrew and Emma's real life partnership) add a layer of reality to their relationship; with every scene shared between the two feeling grounded and real. Dare I say, the dynamic between the two is also incredibly cute.Other characters involve Harry Osborn (Dane Dehaan), Peter's childhood best friend recently returned from attending school away, and Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx): the pitiful, lonesome electrician who falls victim to a tragic accident transforming him into the powerful villain, Electro. Even as the electrified baddie, Max's character remains to grasp the audience's pity. However, this is changed when Max feels betrayed by Spider-Man and uses his powers to destroy and kill instead. Harry, on the other hand, continues to have a similar relationship with Peter as Gwen had: the two share great chemistry and the dynamic feels natural and fluid. Harry's been told by his dying father that the 'Osborn Curse' has befallen Harry, forcing him to do anything he can to salvage his derailing health. However, Harry's time is short-spent before he transforms into the already-confirmed Green Goblin. This makes his development feel like it's reached it's limit before his first appearance in the franchise is even finished. Had his character been drawn out more, there may have been more time to add to his character, although what was delivered from him (and Dehaan's stunning performance) was enough to make you both like and fear Harry equally.The story balances the main narrative and the sub-plot involving the mystery behind Peter's parents wonderfully and the two never feel forced or out of place from one another. Each character has their own part within the film and have the right to be there (as apposed to the overwhelming amount of clashes between Sandman, Venom and New-Goblin in Spider-Man 3). The action-packed sequences alike have their reason to be there too and never feel forced in order to create some excitement as they each play their own significant part in both character/story development.Lastly, the film expresses all kinds of emotions from the audiences that really make the viewer invest into the story and characters alike; making you love and relate to them. The film is a wonderful addition to an already fantastic franchise in which Marc Webb truly expresses his love and devotion of the character making this portrayal of the web-slinging hero one to be remembered and loved!","67 out of 145 found this helpful.

The romance between Peter and Gwen is contagious and fun to watch. I cannot overstate how much I enjoyed seeing this film and my frustration at how long I will have to wait for the next one! It seems as though it will definitely be worth the wait. I can only hope Andrew Garfield continues to play Peter Parker because he truly brings the role to life (much better than MaGuire ever did) and conveys Peter's shy and awkward personality but also brings in different characteristics like his new found confidence he has gained from becoming Spiderman. If you haven't already I STRONGLY suggest you put this film at the top of your 'must see' cinema releases. Stone and Garfield bring together the tragedy and sorrow of Spiderman's life with the joy of being truly in love. I will anxiously be awaiting the next in the film series and the DVD release. I completely loved it.","28 out of 55 found this helpful.

Not only effects were great, but also the storytelling, humor, relationships and much more. They gave enough time to the important parts between the characters. I thought, having more than one main villain could cause problems like in the 3rd part of the first Spider Man movies, but it was different this time and surprisingly well solves.A great mix of action, humor, love and pure fun. From the story about Peter's father, over to aunt May and the love to Stacy - everything fitted so well together.I can't really find a lot weak points.

It had a great cast (Jamie Foxx was amazing as the pitiful dork) with truly believable performances. The score fit the movie so perfectly, and the way the movie was captured, it was awesome. I saw it in 3D which just made the experience of watching this movie, incredible. The script was funny and heartbreaking, and I left this movie with mixed emotions.I have no idea if this is just me, but once I got home and really thought about this movie I felt really depressed after the events in the movies. One particular scene, which I'm not going to spoil, everything about it was devastating and heartbreaking, I was on the verge of tears. Thats what makes a good movie, scenes like that where you just feel so deeply for the characters and you want them to win. If you've seen the last movie and you liked it, you're going to love this movie. If you hated the last one, just watch this one anyways, its definitely better than the first one (even though the first one is brilliant). This movie definitely puts the amazing in 'Amazing Spider-Man'.","47 out of 99 found this helpful.

First reason is visually how awesome it was to watch spider man fly- it was spectacular, especially in 3-D!There is a fair amount of romance between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker who have a great chemistry on screen that worked! It wasn't a silly love side plot; Gwen Stacy wasn't a mere fair maiden Spider man had to rescue, she was a useful character and allowed the viewer to see peter/Spider man on a more personal level- definitely much different to the romance in the old spider man series!The action- now this is where the review really starts- was certainly satisfying. Spider man fought with three villains, they had a great buildup (the rhino not as much) and unlike other superhero movies the main two villains don't enter the show as pure evil characters. They have some sort of relationship with Peter/Spider man which created an excellent story line, you tend to feel more when the fights actually take place. The fighting itself was just awesome. It wasn't cut short and took up much more screen time than the action had done in the first film which is ideal for sure. The producers made the fight scenes looked tactical and skillful, at the end you think ""alright now THAT was cool."" Other films take action as guns are bashing and confusion and this is why I prefer spider man, his maneuvers were unpredictable and although they were fast paced it was directed so you follow EVERYTHING- this is done particularly by slowing down some scenes- (such as when electrode and spider man meet for the second time.) This made the movie easy to follow and thoroughly engaging. In terms of the casting, Andrew Garfield looks like he hasn't aged since he turned 17- pretty convenient as he plays a a college student! Thinking back on it I can say damn, the boy sure knows how to act. A challenging role, physically demanding I imagine but also needs to convincingly express a range of emotions- all which I think were executed to standard. He's even British! This was pretty shocking to find out after I had watched (well, for me at least). Oh he's pretty god damn hot too. Emma stone looks like the character in the comics, which is always a plus- the blonde hair biologist, it's fair to say she looked the part. Also, can I just say how much better a movie can be when the female character ISN'T annoying? Jamie Fox's character electrode was frustrating and yes, slightly unrealistic- although it is bound to be because it's classic Science Fiction, I mean more his personality. He was needy, it was actually hilarious at some points (surely done intentionally) but at other times it was a bit like, ""really?"" His character was a weak minded guy, who got unfairly treated, gets corrupt by power- oh and was totally obsessed with spider man which then just changes because... yeah, wasn't worth remembering (some trivial misunderstanding.) However, the character Electrode did look terrifying so if anything, they scored an A+ on the visuals. Osborns- I feel the Osborns were better done in the previous spider man series (perhaps the only thing done right.) Norman Osborn we all know in the previous one LOOKED the part. Harry Osborn in this one acted well but his character, again, was frustrating. The friendship between Peter and Harry wasn't emphasized enough- I didn't really care about harry, and once you do watch this movie (I truly recommend you should) I didn't full grasp why the green goblin hated spider man.Overall, if it wasn't clear from my excessive use of the word awesome, it was AWESOME. Nothing inappropriate, people of all ages will love it and definitely was a night well entertained, and what else can I say besides I'm counting down the days until the sequel?","36 out of 74 found this helpful.

I loved the original trilogy, but I did like the first reboot even though it was the same origin story all over again. If I wanted a sequel, it would have been Spider-Man 4, but instead we get the Amazing Spider-Man 2. I won't lie when I say that I expected a complete disaster. I actually....liked this film even more so than the first one. It has plenty of strong action and I actually liked the romance between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy this time around. The biggest fault I found with the movie is the overuse of villains. Sure, the Rhino is a good character, but save him for the next film! Marc Webb's returns Spider-Man/Peter Parker to the big screen as he and Stacy are graduating from high school. Peace in the city isn't to last as Oscorp plans on taking over the city. Peter has to face such villains as Electro and Rhino as well as balance the delicate duties of Spider-Man and Peter Parker.I think Andrew Garfield makes for a very good Spider-Man. He is more cocky than Maguire's take on Spider-Man, but I find his character more likable. Speaking of likable, Emma Stone makes for a fine Gwen Stacy and she has great chemistry with Garfield. Jamie Foxx does well as Electro, although his role bears strong resemblance to his role in the Soloist. Paul Giamatti has a good few scenes as the Rhino and likewise Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborne.Overall, the Amazing Spider-Man 2 is actually an entertaining superhero movie. It's not perfect of course since there are some flaws within the story, but I found the film to be just a tad better than the first reboot film. The action is there, the romance is there, and Spidey being a hero is of course there. The film also has a little bit of an surprising emotional charge. A good film to watch and better than I was led to believe.My Grade: B+","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Raimi's original films were so highly praised by critics that these new films, despite holding a different taste, are victim to the burden of comparisons. Raimi's films were exaggerated and cheesy, when Webb focuses more on psychological principles. That's why I loved the first film so much, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is a superhero sequel superior in almost every aspect. While being 2 hours and a half long the film keeps a steady, and fast pace where it always has a conflict building to keep you invested. Each scene feels important to the emotions emphasized in the film so no minute is wasted. Peter and Gwen are one of the most believable couples in cinema and their relationship is the core of the story, and it never gets overshadowed by the main villains or sub-plots. A major complaint I hear of the film is that the reveal of Peter's parents backstory is disappointing, but the movie explains it's only a tidbit of information, and that Marc Webb is building up the whole truth within each movie. Therefore, it builds the suspense immensely in this film and we get to see his parents as fully breathing and living characters rather than a plot catalyst. The strongest aspect of the film though is the theme: No human deserves to be alone, and isolation and abandonment costs immense psychological damage. Every main character has this theme imposing them somehow, and it really adds to the relatability of the characters. Even the villains have humanity in their motivations due to this theme, and that is very rare for a superhero film. The directing is almost Stanley Kubrick-esque in some senses. Action sequences rely on musical cues and tones for movement and emotion, which has not been implemented well in superhero movies until this film. It makes the fights all the more memorable and impressive, as my heart was racing during the climax of the film. Several scenes possess an almost dream-like quality, with dramatic lighting and celestial-like movements. It drifts you away from reality, unlike other superhero movies which usually emphasize upon the realistic world. Spider-Man's world is advanced and foreign, yet familiar in emotional comprehension. Only real issue that holds this film down is that it perhaps drags on a bit after the climax, as the following scenes don't flow together as the rest of the film does, making the ending perhaps a bit overdone. This is definitely a more artistically-directed film than the first one, and it accomplishes that well. Overall, I must exclaim that it replaces ""The Dark Knight"" as my favourite hero flick. It's a universally emotional and significant film, with a more meaningful and overlooked theme than the Dark Knight offered. It made me realize how much others do impact who we are and how it defines our virtues; a film that is emotionally powerful rather than philosophically can just sometimes mean more. This movie is the only one that has EVER made me shed a tear. Hate me all you want, but I love artistic liberty in film and interpreted the themes in this movie personally. You can make this film your own, and that makes it all the more fun and meaningful. I give ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" a solid 8/10.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Jamie Foxx as electro was really really good but the biggest let down was that even though he is the villain mostly seen in the movie, he is not the main villain.i didn't expect this movie to be fantastic but i didn't expect it to be as bad as it was.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

I normally just go if it is in the right time slot. I feel like it just hurts my eyes sometimes. Captain America 2 contained some action sequences that really bothered me in 3--D. I think they finally got it right in this film. I really enjoyed the 3-D action sequences in this film. The final action scene with electro was very aesthetically pleasing. That is all I will say because I don't want to give anything away.I also thought that Andrew Garfield did a great job. He seems to fit the role of Peter Parker naturally. The team did a great job casting this film. The acting was very believable. I loved the cameo by Paul Giamonti. I felt like the story could have been a little more interesting, but sometimes it is best to keep the plot simply in these blockbuster super hero films. Overall, I would say that my son and I had a great time at this movie.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Honestly, no-one should watch this movie, but there is a long sequence in this move where the screen flashes colors rapidly. I'm not even someone who is easily bothered by flashing lights, and that sequence hurt my eyes. Plot - This movie is really boring. Honestly I was hoping that it would be so stupid that it becomes funny (like the first movie) but at no point does it get to that level of ridiculousness. There are several pointless subplots (like the romance) that only seem to be in this movie to waste time. The only scenes that I kind of liked were a few of the scenes with Spider-Man, but even then they were kind of dumb. I'm glad that this franchise ended. Every other version of Spider-Man that I've seen so far is so much better in nearly every way. I know a lot of people didn't like ""Spider-Man 3"" but at least that movie had believable effects and a coherent story.Effects - This movie has pretty terrible effects. Electro never reaches the same level of goofiness as The Lizard, but he's still bad. Unfortunately, all the bad acting, action, and effects in this movie end up just being really dull as opposed to funny. Again, the action is really bad. I'm pretty sure that nearly everything in the fights is CG and it looks really bad. Acting - Like I said, most of the acting is pretty bad. I don't know if its the bad script, the bad direction, or if no-one cared. Probably all three. No-one in this movie gives a convincing performance.Overall this movie is the worst thing that a movie can be - boring. I'll give the first movie credit, it had me laughing. It was at the movie's stupidity, but at least the first movie was creative in how dumb it got. This sequel is just poorly made, cliched crap. Also, and I'm not even making this up, this movie put my little brother to sleep. He was fast asleep on the couch about an hour into it. That is how boring it is.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

We both enjoyed this sequel to the Spider-Man reboot series. Andrew Garfield once again is fine as Peter Parker and it's nice to see Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is still full of spunk as his love. Jamie Foxx is quite compelling as the main villain, Electro. Having a somewhat different background for Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) was also interesting. Quite lots of great action abounded but there's quite a touching denouement concerning Peter and Gwen that made both of us cry. I, myself, was thrilled to both see another Stan Lee cameo and hear the Spider-Man theme from the '60s TV animated show represented as a cell phone ring. So on that note, yes, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is highly recommended.","16 out of 29 found this helpful.

All what was missing from the first ""Amazing"" is now there (including the old cartoon theme...) and better action with a strong story line.We see here how Peter Parker/Spider-Man is tangled between his promise to Gwen's father from the first movie and how to be the hero at the right place and time.However, OsCorp has no respect for employees breaking the secrets, either for Max Payne, Gwen Stacy or even Harry Osborn. And we know the truth about Richard Parker's secret, something Peter had to discover despite his Aunt May's objections.For the rest, great villains like Electro, a new Green Goblin and Rhino complete the picture.Again, a door is open for the sequel. Spidey's great power will bring more responsibility in the next instalment...And hope again Stan Lee will do a cameo, as he does here.","27 out of 54 found this helpful.

I am not a big fan of the actors in the roles at all - I just don't connect with them and couldn't care if they live or die. The action scenes were far too short and did not take up much of the movie at all - 20 minutes maximum. Even my daughter who is a huge fan of this genre of movie thought this effort was poor. I am sure that this review is in contrast to the vast majority of reviewers who seem to have been kind so far but I certainly wish that I had waited for the DVD and even then it would only have been worth a rental.

Worse still, as much as he desperately wants to fix everything, keep everyone safe, not everything will work out that well – there is tragedy in the air. This takes the form of the return after a decade of his troubled childhood friend, Harry Osborn(DeHaan, lost between a psychotic determination and a charming accessibility, doing justice to both), and the deadly new face, Electro(Foxx, obsessed fan turned dangerous villain, compelling as both, and largely sympathetic).Boring origin retread out of the way, this can go into the nature of our protagonist, and deliver on the sad, ""chin-up"" aspect of him. This is the Spider-Man I grew up reading. The best aspects of this are the drama and character dynamics. Real people with actual problems that don't have easy solutions. There are troubles from the attempts to Avengers this franchise, with a lot of setup for the Sinister Six to appear down the line. Do not get me started on the disappointing reveal to the conspiracy/mystery parents plot, which should have been resolved in the first, not to mention never introduced in the first place. This adds up to too much going on, taking away time for the better elements. We get a fast pace that both helps and hurts the whole.Production is, indeed, amazing. Truly captivating is the musical theme, synthesize-voice-enhancement and chilling look of our genuinely lethal electric baddie. Swooping, intense and fun action keeps us entertained throughout, and the 3D is fantastic for it – even if it is the only place that visual effect is applied. The tonal shifts can almost lead to whiplash. Humor is great, with ad-libbed dialog, tons of small gags, none of it forced.There is some violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of everyone's favorite web-slinger. 8/10","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

I didn't care enough to even bother reviewing it.But after seeing the brand new Tom Holland, ""No Way Home"" film, I thought, ""You know, I'd like to see that Andrew Garfield guy doing his thing, and the origin of Electro and all that.""And I'll be..! Maybe I've gotten dumber in the last few years, I don't know, but I REALLY liked the movie this time around. A lot!I was surprised to discover that Gwen Stacy stood out as the first of Peter Parker's on screen girlfriends who I 'got'. Emma Stone was fantastic! She had ""It"", whatever ""It"" is. I'd fall for that girl too. And her chemistry with Garfield was believable and fun.I think there's also another element to why I really enjoyed TASM2 this time around. It's the same reason Age of Ultron went up in my estimation from a 5 to an 8 on re-watching it years after its release as well. And the reason is this...Tapestry.Comic books are good at this, too, and it seems the format of having lots and lots of chapters and interlocking parts works for film as well.After years have passed and more episodes have come and gone, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is no longer standing alone at the head of a line, but is now a part of a whole. The mythology of Spider-Man is larger today. The big moments hold more meaning.When watching Garfield in this film, you don't just get what you see, but you also remember, he's the guy who ""Always wanted brothers"", holding up a wounded Tobey Maguire. -Who managed to save the girl from falling to her death this time around, and feeling heart break when remembering Gwen.That stuff fills out the mythology, inflates this film beyond its original moors with extra meaning and depth.Today, watching it with all the other films fresh in mind, makes it the difference between a story about a guy who is Spider-Man, and a guy you know and like, a friend you have traveled with, who is Spider-Man.Tapestry.For anybody curious, who may not have thought much of this movie on the first go-round, I strongly advise giving TASM2 another try. Like me, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

The good thing is that they pulled it off quite nicely. The truth about this movie is it focuses on the struggles of Peter Parker more than it does Spiderman, and this is a good thing because it draws you into the movie and makes you give a damn about the characters involved. The Villains are okay with out being great, how ever it is striving for something more than its own movie which i think will have great continuity with the next film in the series. Having said that there is still plenty of action to be witnessed as expected from a Spiderman movie and it looks quite good but are very noticeably heavy on the CGI. Over all The Amazing Spiderman 2 is striving for something bigger than its own movie and succeeds whilst at the same time having humorous parts as well as being quite dark at some points. Go see it!","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Not only the action sequences were great, I do think even the screenplay, the acting and even how the story evolves thru the film is way superior than it's predecessor.Jaime Foxx is superb on his role, and as it usually happens when you finished watching a good action film... you probably will ask for a little more, but what you just watched was good enough anyway! Just as the Batman/Dark Knight reboot, this new delivery of Spidey is a Little more ""dark"" than the previous one from Sam Raimi, not only because on this new series, we learn something about Peter Parker childhood ( re:their parents), but because as Uncle Ben said once, Mr Parker starts to really ponder that with great power comes great responsibility, and that a superhero lifestyle is not always so nice... (ask Tony Stark-IM3)If I have to compare SM2 vs. Captain America- Winter Soldier, the good 'ol Captain might win the battle for half a point, but Spidey will have people smiling at the end of the movie... and just as Batman, it would be nice if a third and final installment can be already in the works to close this latest update ""refresh"" on our friendly neighbor...

Somehow, the film still shot my expectations straight through the roof and blew me away. As readers of comics, or big Marvel fans will know, this really stays true to the comics, unlike the Tobey Trilogy. One thing they did with this film which I loved, was they spent a large chunk focusing on the origin of villains in the most interesting way. Plenty of nods to other Spidey villains not-yet- appeared to give you a few nerd-gasms, and the essentially cheesy but brilliant line - ""Let's go catch a spider.""I was amazed at how much emotion I felt from the actors, and from myself, through several scenes. My whole theater reacted the exact same way to each key scene, and I think that's impressive filmaking. Go see TASM 2 for action, emotion, comedy and lots and lots of fun.","24 out of 49 found this helpful.

Everything you loved about the previous movie is here. The action is exciting but doesn't outstay it's welcome, the humor is fresh, the romance is very heartfelt, Andy Garfield absolutely kills it as Spidey and Emma Stone is a great Gwen Stacey. Another great thing is that almost every character has a redeeming quality, even those that you're supposed to hate. Although the villains are evil, you feel sympathy for them in some way or another. For instance, Harry Osborn despite being evil, just wants to cure himself of his disease and Electro simply wants to be loved and notice. It's great to see villains that don't wanna take over the world for the sake of taking it over or just take over the world period. That being said, the villains are surprisingly scary for a goofy spider man flick. You can definitely tell that Electro is damaged and was even psychotic before he got his powers, giving him quite a gollum-like feel and Harry is portrayed as the conniving, calculating and methodical villain that he should be.As I mentioned before, this film seems to let Spider-man take a backseat for a story that is mainly about Peter Parker. the film mainly concentrates on Peter's demons and his desperate longing to know who is father really was along with trying keep Gwen safe, which is fantastic to see. Not many superhero movies do this, opting to focus on the man behind the suit and ultimately giving him more depth. I don't know about any of you, but when I go and see a spider-man movie, I usually like to see a little more than just people beating the sh*t out of each other, so this film definitely delivered on that. After all, would the superhero be there without the man that embodies them. As I said, Andrew Garfield is a fantastic Spider-man, and I think he might very well become the actor with which the character is most identified. He is the Spider-man that the world needs to see: wisecracking, confident, cocky but vulnerable, caring and with a deep love for those around him. Not to demean Tobey Maguire's performance, but I always thought that his portrayal was always a little bit bland and at some times, dislike-able. However, the film does have some faults which were a little bit of a disappointment. For instance, sometimes the fight scenes are a bit stale and don't flow as well as they did in the Sam Raimi trilogy, the film does focus a little too much on the romance side of it and I wish that Spidey was in the film a little bit more. But all these faults aside, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a great film, a great sequel and does what ultimately all superhero movies should do: Show what the man behind the mask is really made of.","29 out of 61 found this helpful.

When the Toby McGuire movies came out, I enjoyed them, but there is much room for improvement.When the Amazing Spider-Man came out, I saw it in the cinema, and was, once again, impressed, but a little underwhelmed.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 hands down wins the title of the Best Spiderman movie ever made, in my books. It combines great visuals with the classic personality of the Spider-man in the comics, where the older films made him seem too serious and dramatic. It captures the excitement of the Animated Series, and makes many references to other Spider-Man plots, such as Felicia Hardy, Smythe, The Vulture, Doc Oc, and many more. This really appealed to my inner fanboy.The plot is well constructed and interesting. Rather than focusing on a single linear story about Spidey fighting a villain, this movie is about WHO Spider-Man is, and what he stands for. It explores his personality well, aided by some very emotional and well-delivered scenes throughout.I highly recommend this movie.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

It could have been great. But no he takes us in this incredible boring journey too fight a nerdy black guy. A not so threatening goblin.

Now I'm seeing the same pattern with this sequel and it makes you wonder whether the whole rating system should be abandon until a movie has been in the theaters for at least 2-3 months. With that being said, Sony made several mistakes with this reboot and frankly, Andrew Garfield isn't a convincing Peter Parker/Spider-man. This movie is focusing too much on introducing the much rumored ""Sinister Six"" movie and less on the character development. We didn't need to be re-introduced to Spider-man and as long as Sony stays on this course, we're going to continue to get bad spidey movies. Marvel should have taken the reigns but that's not possible anytime soon because of rights owned by Sony. Webb is a terrible director or at least for this franchise and admits to many mistakes from the first film and admits trying to make up for those mistakes in this sequel.

Some big, some small, either way, it makes for one average film. Andrew Garfield returns as the web swinger, and if you liked his wise cracks and sarcasm in the first one, then you won't be disappointed here. He's actually better at making up wise cracks then actually taking his job more seriously than he is. Honestly, he plays a much better Spider-man in this one, not immediately jumping on someone's face, but instead trying to reason with them, which makes him seem more like a nice guy. Gwen Stacy returns as his love interest, which makes for the main focus of the film. It's so on and off in the film since Peter is guilty over the death of Gwen's father in the first and the promise he made to him to leave his daughter out of it. Even though that's kind of interesting, they still kind of replace it with ways to make it humorous in scenes. Their affection, while touching, is cut short by the 50 other plots going on, making you just want the film to take it slow.Jamie Foxx as Electro was an unique design, but an ugly effect. I thought his motivation was weak and the delivery was forced. Harry Osborn, aka the Goblin was also a sh*tty villain. The kid is a bad actor in general, and he brings the Goblin to shame. Oh, and Rhino? Well, once you see the film you'll know why he's not worth discussing.The main focus of the film, like I said, is the romance between Gwen and Peter. I honestly think it worked out for the most part, it was the only part of the film that didn't feel crammed or forced, it felt necessary. Even though some parts were sappy or silly, I still enjoyed their interactions.That's this film's best compliment is one particular scene, and the relationship, that's about it. The rest of the film feels cluttered and crammed with all these different things going on that felt forced, I'm just like ""can we please just see him fight somebody or interact with Gwen Stacy?"" It's almost like Peter Parker is bipolar. One second he's obsessed over his parent's secret, then he's all cheery about Gwen Stacy in the next scene. Better than the first? Yes. Decent movie over all? No, was watchable but would still not recommend unless you're a comic book fan.","6 out of 22 found this helpful.

I have been so excited to see this movie for months. I must admit that it has lived up to every expectation! The performances giving by everyone was just fantastic. The chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is just so amazing and believable. Which it should be because they are going out in real life. Andrew owns the spider-man role now, this movie has convinced me so. Also, Jamie Foxx nails it as Max Dillion. He gives such a killer performance as awkward and sad max. He doesn't let you down as Electro either. Also, a worthy mention is none other than Dane Dehaan as Harry Osborn. This guy really got the acting chops! He can be friendly and charismatic when needed. But, he can also pull off intimidating and demanding without even breaking a sweat. Not to mention his Goblin Laugh that just gave me shivers down my spine.The Sound track was also really good. This is one of the few movies that make me want the album. Many people thought this movie was going to be to villain heavy not at all. All the villains got their fair share of screen time. The action was up to pare as well especially the final electro battle. The only real gripe that I have with this movie was that I thought the action sequences were a bit short. But, they were still pretty epic please don't get me wrong. I think this also may be the most emotional super hero movie I have ever seen in my life. I will just leave it at that without any spoilers. Now that is a good thing in my book. That is one of the many reasons why I can't stop thinking about this movie.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is probably up there in the 5 spidey movies that are out there. This movie was a joy ride from start to finish. The action sequences were intense but short, everyone had a purpose and the movie didn't feel over crowded, it was funny, it was sad, in was intense. You will not go wrong putting down 11 bucks to see this movie trust me. I hope Marc Webb comes back to direct the 3rd one, he is making a good name for himself with these movies.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong: we love CGI because it makes possible to see truly amazing unrealistic things. CGI is NOT evil!The problem here is that they (the filmmakers) always find an easy thing to just leave the CGI do its part for all of us, nerds. So they never even bother considering making a good movie. They come up with a quick, dull, bad script, one that ""will do"".Does that mean a superhero movie cannot be good? By all mean, no! We all saw the Dark Knight trilogy (surely, with a few reserves for the final one, but the 2nd movie was pure art). So yes, it is possible to make an awesome superhero movie. How? -> TREAT IT LIKE ANY OTHER FREAKIN' MOVIE. Hire some good script specialist to make a very good story, with some interesting and mind-blowing plot points, have them deliver outstanding dialogs and find talented actors to perform effectively.I won't give any examples, but you can find plenty exceptional movies that did NOT contain superheroes, or any supernatural for that matter. But they were awesome because they had all the details.So why on Earth do those pesky filmmakers keep refusing to make a good movie out of a superhero movie?That is the question. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 sucked because its creator chose to. They did not bother to make it interesting. Why did they do that, as I said, remains a mystery.Now on to the actual movie: an unlucky guy with mental issues suffers an accident that grants him super powers. Very quickly he turns into a bad guy and starts killing people and destroying the city. Of course, we don't see any actually good reason to do so... but it's awesome to see that blue guy shooting electrical energy all around, right? No need for character development here.The Harry Osborn line (we all saw it coming) was pretty much the same. Send a rich child away from home to travel study at the most expensive schools around the world, and be sure that he'll come back evil. The lack of affection from his father always turns little boys into evil men who need no good reason to start killing people. I liked the actor and how he did his best to play this role. But he did not write the dialog, nor the story, so it's not his fault that his character was so incomplete and inconsistent. Also no need for character explanations here... Harry Osborn HAD to be evil, everyone knew that so let's swallow it.Then there's the romance between Peter and the girl. Peter seems pretty happy at first, then he sees her father's ghost and remembers he's putting her in danger. Right away he goes and breaks up with her. Although he states he's been seeing the ghost for awhile, I guess this time was special enough to instantly turn his mind around.Oh well... overall these two characters actually did have a little bit of chemistry... that's just my opinion. All the time though, you feel their dialogs are so forced and unrealistic... They made a pretty good ending though. Hopefully, I thought that would set a nice darker tone for the 3rd film, but the film's ending somehow gave me the impression it won't.And also, there's the crowd. Those people who seems to find time to clap and enjoy the show whenever there's a killing maniac on the streets. They are never afraid they might... I don't know... die?! If Spiderman is there fighting terrifying monsters, he needs support doesn't he? Let's cheer him up.Overall, the plot was straight and simple: there comes the villains, there's some fight that destroys half of the city, and in the end Spiderman takes them both down at a cost of a personal loss.That's the freackin' problem of this movie. Why do they always have to show us the same things over and over... why can't they make up some interesting, intriguing plot and action, with some twists along the way and a breath-taking finale? We knew all the way how this movie would end. The movie brought absolutely nothing new. Sure, I agree it was different from the other trilogy. But really, is that the only purpose of these filmmakers?We saw Spiderman jumping, fighting, flying, loving, crying, saving the day. That's all folks.I conclude the comment with a spoiler: whatever you think will happen in this movie, it will!","6 out of 22 found this helpful.

"5","/10","What a flop!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3077951/?ref_=tt_urv","siderite","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3146136/?ref_=tt_urv","30 August 2014","I've read some of the reviews for the movie at IMDb and I am absolutely convinced that a lot of them are paid for. There are so many things wrong with this film that I cannot imagine someone liking it, not to mention calling it ""amazing"" and ""electrifying"".The problems start from the very first scenes. You have some thugs stealing nuclear material from an armored truck, all the while driving in a huge tow truck that smashes through everything: police cars, normal cars, buses, you name it. What does Spidey do? He comes swinging and starts talking with the guy, making jokes all the while. Then we spend a quarter of a movie seeing him trying to push away the woman that he loves because she wants her safe, then coming back because he loves her too much. Meanwhile, all the people that he cares about or that he saves their lives seem to turn to pointless villains that want to kill him.Are the special effects nice, then? They start off nice enough, but then they go so far into CGI land that it all feels like a Road Runner cartoon. Is the acting good? No! All the dialogues are so bad that you can actually see actors cringing while saying them. Action scenes? CGI overload. Logic? nonexistent. Science? Raped repeatedly. Moral of the story? Not there. There is no point in anything anyone does in the movie. They don't even have a post credits scene.Bottom line: I like superhero and comic book fantasies and I think I can get in the spirit of things quite easily. After all, I watched every Spiderman movie so far, and they are all about a guy in pajamas swinging from building to build (when he is not whining - or dancing). I also realize that the concept itself is both difficult to promote in a modern world and to put in a live action film (that is why so many of them turn into CGI cartoons most of the time). However this film I couldn't not hate it. It is so bad in so many ways that I feel anger for having watched it. It's how I imagined the Mutant Teenage Ninja Turtles movie to be when I decided not to watch it. I shudder at the thought that it might be worse. Do. Not. Watch. This. Filth.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

This is the best and when I say the best I mean the best spiderman movie ever. Some people will say it had to many villains well I beg to differ. It may seem like it but it's nothing like how spiderman 3 did it. At least they set it up correctly. I think that's why people didn't like some of it because it's sets up for the 3rd movie and the sinister 6 movie spin off. No character was a throw away in my opinion. The love with peter and Gwen Stacy is great and Andrew is a better spiderman than Tobey Miguire. Everyone in this movie does a great job with the characters. Jamie Foxx as electro is very obsessed in a creepy way and it may come off as Jim Carey in Batman forever but it works. You don't get much time with him in the movie but he serves a purpose and he is menacing as a villain and you start to feel very sorry for him at times. But Harry Osborn played by Dane Dehann is great he may not be a James Franco but he plays green goblin better. And the movie may seem long but never was I bored or unentertained the action is phenomenal and the CGI work was great you should see this in IMAX 3D if you can spend the extra bucks. I'm seeing the same thing that happened with man of steel with this movie. The reviews are low for some odd reason who knows but the movie is epic. The only thing I could think as a negative with this movie is that you don't get much time with the villains but I only think it's because you have to explore the dynamic with peter and Gwen because of what happens at the end which is the most well known comic book thing to ever happen through out comic book history. And it is done well and I won't spoil but comic book people may know what I'm talking about. But other than that this movie was great forget the haters I think it did a way better job than the last amazing spiderman it explored the untold story about peters parents and still more to come with the sinister 6 movie and I can't wait.","37 out of 81 found this helpful.

Everything about this movie was very unconvincing, from the annoyingly hyperactive Peter Parker to Jamie Foxx as villain to car chases that seemed to come out of some teenage adventure series. I had enough after 45 minutes and believe me I have only ever walked out of a movie once. The next Spiderman should be made grittier and mature.

Sony really needs to let this franchise go, because true fans are not going to continue to come out for or support this kinda crap. Very little humor, the action went no where and the liberties taken with character back story just made me wish this ride would end.Best thing about the movie was the CGI, worst this was every last actor in the film. If you are older than 12, save your dime and your time, this is just another in the long line of comic book let downs.I don't plan to see this again unless I'm being punished.","6 out of 23 found this helpful.

"10","/10","An absolutely flawless film that is, far better than its predecessor. The best Spidey movie, yet!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3007970/?ref_=tt_urv","Anurag-Shetty","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31646645/?ref_=tt_urv","1 May 2014","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 continues with the story of Spider-Man/Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield). After the events of the first film, Peter Parker is finally getting comfortable & starting to enjoy being Spider- Man & saving people's lives. He's in a stable relationship with Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone) & everything in his life seems to be perfect. Enter Electro/Max Dillon(Jamie Foxx). Dillon, is a mild mannered scientist who is saved by Spider-Man, during one of his crime fighting routines. After this, Max becomes a huge fan of Spidey, which slowly turns into obsession. After a fatal lab accident, Dillon is transformed into super-villain, Electro. Peter's life becomes even more complicated when his childhood best friend, Harry Osborn(Dane DeHaan), returns to New York City after being away for ten years. Harry asks Peter for an unusual favor. Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop Electro & comply with Harry's request before he gets into further trouble. Peter also wants to desperately find out what happened to his parents, Richard Parker(Campbell Scott) & Mary Parker(Embeth Davidtz), after they suddenly abandoned him as a child and left him in the care of, Aunt May(Sally Field) & Uncle Ben. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was, simply put, amazing! Director Marc Webb neutralized all the flaws that bogged down, The Amazing Spider- Man(2012). Webb learned from his mistakes & delivered an engaging, emotional, heartbreaking & action-packed sequel, from start to finish. Webb focuses more on Peter & Gwen's relationship, like he did in the first one. However, this in no way slows down the pace of the film. There are fewer action set-pieces compared to the previous Spider-Man movies. Nevertheless, whenever Spidey faces off against the villains of the film, the action packs a punch & the 3D adds more pop & zing to the proceedings on screen. The 3D has been put to good use throughout the movie. Apart from the web-swinging & action sequences, the 3D has been put to good use in the dialog scenes, as well. Thanks to the 3D, we actually feel like we're web-swinging from rooftop to rooftop, like Spidey does in the film. The special effects are incredible. Electro doesn't look computer animated at all. The CGI looks realistic throughout the film. Electro looks as realistic as a guy surging with electricity can look! The plot was realistic & fast-paced, simultaneously. 2 hours & 22 minutes goes by, in a flash. The performances add to the magnificent experience of an already, flawless film. Andrew Garfield is outstanding as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Garfield surpasses his performance in the first film. Garfield transitions between, Peter Parker's vulnerability & Spider-Man's sarcasm & wit with ease & grace. Andrew Garfield doesn't play Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield IS Spider-Man! Emma Stone is brilliant as Gwen Stacy. Stone is beautiful, charming, funny & intelligent, all at once. Garfield & Stone's chemistry is more electrifying than in the first film. Andrew Garfield & Emma Stone's real life relationship, translates really well into the film. Peter & Gwen's love for each other feels natural & genuine. Jamie Foxx is awe-inspiring as Electro/Max Dillon. Foxx easily switches, from mild mannered Oscorp electrical engineer, to menacing leather-clad super-villain. Dane DeHaan is spectacular as Green Goblin/Harry Osborn. DeHaan's Goblin is evil & menacing. However, I liked James Franco's portrayal of Harry, better. Although I loved DeHaan, Franco was able to garner the viewer's sympathy more than DeHaan's Harry. Don't get me wrong. Dane DeHaan portrays a wide array of emotions as the conflicted Harry Osborn, effortlessly. Colm Feore is impressive as Donald Menken. Felicity Jones is effective as Felicia. Paul Giamatti is perfect as Aleksei Sytsevich. Sally Field improves drastically as Aunt May. Campbell Scott & Embeth Davidtz are excellent as Richard & Mary Parker, respectively. Max Charles is flawless as Young Peter Parker. The supporting characters are effective too. The Amazing Spider- Man 2 is a must watch, especially on the big screen. It's an EPIC film, whether you love Spider-Man, or not.","24 out of 50 found this helpful.

Even by super hero movie standards this movie is flawed. However I did enjoy this movie more than the 2012 reboot. What I enjoyed about the movie basically boils down to a handful of things. #1 the action. I thought the action set pieces were well done and they actually looked pretty cool for the most part. #2 I really enjoyed some of the music choices that they used in the movie. For example during spider-man's fight with electro they used dub step which I personally really enjoyed. #3 a good chunk of the jokes had me chuckling and some even had me laughing pretty hard. It is unfortunate that for all the things that were done extremely well that there were just as many flaws in the movie. #1 The story was extremely predictable. I mean my brother and I guessed what we thought would happen in the movie just based on what we saw in the trailer and we were spot on. We didn't get a single detail wrong. #2 The whole will they won't they dating game that Peter and Gwen played in the movie felt like a huge waste of time. #3 there was about 30 minutes of film that just felt pointless. Stuff that didn't lead to anything in the movie and took up time that could have been used to develop the villains/ set up other parts of the story. #4 the ending of the film should have taken place earlier in the film. If it had then we could have gotten some real development in spider-man's character. Instead all that ""development"", if you can even call it that it happens so fast on screen, happens in a montage. At the end of the film the list of good and bad things that I noticed in the film were about the same. I recommend that you manage your expectations of the film. If you do I believe that you will enjoy yourself. I give this movie a 5/10","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

I'm a fan of dubstep too, but trust me, it felt out of place here.The ending, while preposterous, follows the old comics, so avid fans will already know it. But it will still be shocking for others. Jamie Foxx is an awesome actor, but frankly his role in this movie was idiotic. And I am no fan of Dane DeHaan's acting, which in this movie was visibly overdone and almost poor.

The first Spider-Man came out when I was 11 so I said to myself that was the best movie ever. When number 2 came out, I was sorely disappointed so you could imagine my expression when I learned people thought that was the best superhero movie ever (the less we say about SM3, the better). It was a movie that showed that its director, Mr. Sam Raimi, loved the character and the mythology but the script failed in many different ways (that I will not summarize for this being the space for another movie). Maybe it applied when it premiered in 2004 but not anymore. And, sadly, that is what diminishes the impact of this new Amazing Spider-Man.The first Amazing Spider-Man can be accused of being a remake of Raimi's and with some reason. But, luckily, sits among the good ones. Fortunately, this sequel throws everything away to become it's own beast. And, boy, what a beast! Successfully avoiding the curse for ""too many villains"" and being lighthearted fun in it's action sequences without being campy (I only can think of one character that fails in this but still can't really understand there are critics comparing this with Batman & Robin) it still manages to tell a heartwarming (and, eventually, heartbreaking) love story, wrap up plot threads established in the first film and present interesting villains with compelling arcs on their own. And, even with all this, Webb manages to find time to establish the new Spider-Man cinematic universe to come.Rushed at places? Maybe. Scenes that didn't survive the cutting room? More than likely. And, even knowing how it would end (thanks to a spoilery ""spoiler-free"" review I read in a magazine), it still packed the same punch. That is a testament to the storytelling skills of its director and screenwriters (the underrated Kurtzman/Orci duo alongside Jeff Pinkner of Fringe fame), and also of its actors: Garfield, the definite Spidey to whom every future Spidey would be measured against; the lovely Emma Stone, who delivers a great female companion to the hero, and Dane DeHaan as a, at the same time, endearing and frightening Harry Osborn. In a world where you have The Dark Knight and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not the best superhero movie of all time. But it is a great time at the movies and the best Spider- Man movie so far.Rating: A=9.5/10","29 out of 63 found this helpful.

I have seen the original films, and quite frankly, my disappointment was incomprehensible. This movie on the other hand was one of the best movies I had the satisfaction to watch in cinemas. It's good, and everyone who says it's bad are not real fans.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Too Intent on Building a Franchise, ASM2 Forgot to be a Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3285354/?ref_=tt_urv","drqshadow-reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26266323/?ref_=tt_urv","27 July 2015","A confused, overstuffed follow-up effort that's strangely empty, given the classic stories inside. *ASM2* plays like a very good, well-intentioned script that was watered down and padded by too many cooks in the producers' kitchen. That leads to a rough, inconsistent tone, which often parades directly from one plucky bit of light banter straight into a dark, brooding, heavy plot development, then back again. Imagine if Adam West's Batman had rounded a corner in the 1960s and stumbled into Jack Nicholson's Joker parade from the first Tim Burton movie.It's a wasted effort from Andrew Garfield, who's as close as we've had to a perfect rendition of the wisecracking Spidey everyone knows from the comics. His rendition of Peter Parker could still use some work, feeling a bit too ""bro"" for me, but a strong, essential bond with Emma Stone - his Gwen Stacy - smooths over most of those ruffles. Jamie Foxx is a puzzling choice as his main foil, too, in a limp-wristed role that's more pitiable than fearsome. Still, they march him out to a climactic fight scene, which rings as hollow and meaningless as the rest of his arc. More wasted acting chops.The film can be a visual treat, especially when we're sailing through the skies on a zipline and Spidey's contorting his body into all manner of inhuman poses, ripped straight from the glossy covers. During the heat of battle, though, heavy doses of strobe, shakycam and jump-cuts can make it downright painful to keep up. I wanted to like this much more than I actually did. In all sorts of ways, it feels so much more authentic and grounded than the four efforts that came before, but it tries to do too much, drastically changing speeds and moods far too often. Let's start over again, I guess.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

"10","/10","The Best Super Hero Movie Ever!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3010695/?ref_=tt_urv","aryaman-meeshraw","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52546775/?ref_=tt_urv","5 May 2014","Marc Webb's second outing behind Sony's crown jewel definitely lives up to the name. The Amazing Spiderman 2 was just that, amazing. TASM2 proves to be a thoroughly entertaining, emotional, silly, adept world building film all at the same time. Not one to shy away from it's quirky comic book roots, The Amazing Spiderman 2 does a tremendous job of cementing Spidey as one of the premier superhero franchises on the market .By far the best element of the film is the relationship between Gwen and Peter. Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield have the perfect on- screen chemistry; their portrayal was par perfect. Every time the two of them got together,emotions ran high, the way they transitioned from moments of pure happiness to deep sadness, and then to moments of regret and guilt was nothing short of phenomenal. I can honestly claim that this relationship was the most believable on screen coupling I have ever witnessed, the fact that it happened to be in a comic book film was just icing on the cake. Stone and Garfield embodied the characters in every way and brought intense emotional gravity to an already fantastic film. Marc Webb had already established his prowess of on screen romance so it was no surprise to see him hit it out of the park once again. The way he managed to balance the flashy set pieces with the more intimate, personal story was quite a commendable feat. Had he over tipped his hand in favor of more villain time the climax would not have held near enough emotional weight to justify the severity this development has going forward. That being said, the villains were a miniscule flaw in this otherwise masterful comic adaptation. Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon (aka Electro) was a huge goofball and I loved every second he was on screen. I can understand people's complaints with him but I ate it up. Obsession can be a dangerous thing and if handled poorly the consequences could be dire, Spiderman finds this out in the worst way possible and it leads to some truly splendid fights. The way Spiderman moved and quipped mid battle was truly a sight to behold; Sony really nailed the essence of the comic books this time around. Electro's dialogue was just as cheesy as his appearance, while it did result in some cringe worthy lines, ""it's my birthday, time to blow out the candles,"" it never took me out of the movie. The problems begin with ASM2's second villain, Harry Osborn (aka Green Goblin). While his motivations were sound and his portrayal was impeccable (shout out to the always-incredible Dane DeHaan) he did seem a bit rushed. All of the basics were there. He was established as an old friend to Peter, there was a scene dedicated to further exploring their connection and there was a scene in which his dependence on Peter/Spidey turned into loathing. All of the essentials were there. I thought Harry was handled quite well, and the fact the he is undoubtedly returning in further installments is spectacular. The nods to the extended universe were very welcome additions. Setting up plots to be touched upon in the future while giving hawk-eyed fans something to look for in repeat viewings. Dr. A.Smythe (played by The Office's BJ Novak) was a pleasant addition and added to Electro's early struggles making him a more complete character in my eyes. The other major comic book Easter egg was the Rhino (Paul Giamatti). He didn't play a huge role but I think his cameo, albeit cool, could have been handled a little better. However, the fact that he only appears for about 4 minutes makes this a non-issue. The Amazing Spiderman 2 elaborates on loose story threads from the first outing while introducing a plethora of new elements implying spin-offs and sequels. Webb manages to balance the bombast and the personal with pin point precision and ends up with a fantastic, or shall I say amazing, film. While certain things could have been handled a bit better the end product is definitely worthy of its title and leaves audiences on the edge of their seats. I can't wait to further explore the inner workings of Oscorp and see what mess Peter Parker gets himself into next.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

Then as Peter, he has to be a good boyfriend to Gwen (Emma Stone), please his Aunt May (Sally Field) and tell his best friend Harry (DeHaan) that Spiderman cannot give his blood to help save his (Harry's) life as that could kill him. Where does he find the time? Inquiring Minds want to know. Here we go again. How they can do another ""2"" is confusing since they have already had ""3."" Go Figure. Must be the newer Math. Anyway.. (Hey, it's all in the spelling). Okay. Most of us have heard the saying: ""there is nothing new under the sun."" Well, that is not entirely true. CGI is new under the sun and we see it all the time in movies. This movie revels in CGI (the 10-yr olds love it) and yes, it is fantastic, but truth be told when it goes on for too long we become sleepy. And, yes, it went on for too long too many times. See? Actually, the entire movie went on for too long. There were too many scenes that seemed like the dialogue was dubbed in (unless you had a bad DVD) and it was so distracting I had to rewind to see what I missed. Turns out the dialogues were so lame, I didn't miss anything. Also those dialogues between Peter and Aunt May and Peter and Gwen early in the movie was amateurish and basically silly. They leveled out later on. But, make no mistake, this is basically a love story between Peter and Gwen with Spiderman swinging all over and fighting the villains when he has the time. Coming up later on there will be a very big surprise and you may not like it. Yes, this will be the new thing. One would NOT think that an Oscar nomination could come out of a Spiderman movie, but I believe that Sally Field as Aunt May deserves one for Best Supporting Actress. She was very good. Another Oscar nomination could be for the CGI and the 10-year olds agree. Although Paul Giamatti, as Rhino, didn't have much screen time, I believe he had the time of his life and enjoyed his stint. You go, Paul! You did good. I know they will do another Spider-Man movie in 2018 and if my sock drawer doesn't need reorganizing, I might watch it, or maybe not. I am coming to believe there is no Pull for me in these Spiderman movies; they are the same thing over and over and over.. The only Pull is the CGI and the 10-year olds can't wait. I can.

Not only are you learning about Spider man but also Peter Parker himself. The audience can link with the character of Peter Parker and the situations he is going through. Also you get to relate with the movies main villain and his back story on how and why he becomes a villain. Not only is it action packed but also is very funny. There is several scenes through out the movie which make the audience laugh.

Anyways the acting was excellent as well as the story if you pay attention there are a ton of references to a ton of stuff in the universe. The action was top-notch in every way possible it blew the 1st film out of the water in that respect and I can't wait for the next film.

With its predecessor butchered by Spider-Man 3, I fear the same thing has happened again with this movie.I found myself wanting to look away at times because I found the Peter/Gwen relationship so drawn out and painful to watch. The sideshow villains are comical with none of the comedy. The main villains on the other hand, are extremely underdeveloped, which is surprising given the length of the film, and just plain irritating at times. Spider-Man's jokes are cringe-worthy and predictable, much like the rest of the film and the soundtrack went down the cliché route as well.There is also not as many action scenes as one would expect in 142 minutes.With other franchises like X-Men (the last stand aside) and the marvel cinematic universe films consistently churning out solid movies, the bar is set so high for super-hero movies nowadays and this is nowhere near it.At the time of writing this has an IMDb rating of 7/10 which I can scarcely believe. The only reason I have given it 4/10 and not lower is because there is actually some quite cool visuals in it and I have seen worse films than this recently. But I will certainly not be watching it again any time soon.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

There's also no tonal consistency, with Webb lurching ineptly from quippy comedy to brooding drama to high tragedy in short spaces of time.There just seemed to be too much emphasis on CGI rather than a compelling story, the acting was abysmal at certain points throughout, although the Marc Webb reboot is a vast improvement on the Sam Raimi trilogy, they are still a far cry from the Spider-Man movies we want, or deserve.Although this movie had some incredible actors and actresses like Andrew Garfield, Dane DeHaan,Sally Field, Emma Stone and Jamie Foxx, the on screen chemistry was not what we needed for this movie, with the exception of Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield.The casting choice for Rhino was horrendous even though Paul Giamatti is a fantastic actor I feel like he should have sat this one out, and even though we only got a glimpse of Paul as Rhino at the end of the movie, putting Rhino in a mech-like suit will not sit well with fans of the comic.To summarise, this movie was poorly executed and was a huge let down from Jamie Foxx as Electro to the excessive CGI, if I was to rate this movie out of ten, I'd give it a solid 4.5.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I also enjoyed the previous Amazing Spider-man film, and quite frankly I liked all three of the previous trilogy as well. Okay, I am a huge Spider-man fan so almost anything with him in it is going to be something that in all likelihood I am going to enjoy. Heck, I even liked that live action series they did back in the 1970's featuring our favorite wall crawler in Los Angeles where he essentially shot huge ropes and fought criminal types. So yeah, I am probably not the most unbiased reviewer when it comes to our friendly neighborhood Spider-man. Still, I really like where this particular series is going, though surprisingly, this series seems like it is you either really love it or hate it. Kind of like last year's Man of Steel film. Still, to me, this film and the last one kind of capture the essence of Spidey a bit more than the previous three, in that when Spider-man is doing his thing, it just seems more like out of a comic book. Then again, the previous films were well done too and were first, so often times first trumps for no other reason than they were our first experience.The story has Peter Parker/Spider-man fighting crime and having an on again and off again relationship with Gwen as his strong love for her and his need to keep her father's promise keep colliding. A man who for the most part has gone unnoticed takes an extreme liking to the wall crawler and then there is also an extreme shakeup at Oscorp as Norman Osborn's son has returned into the picture. All are linked by Oscorp as an accident will soon spawn a new deadly Spider-man foe as well as a father's gift to his son.The villains were done very well. I liked Jamie Foxx's Electro whom many complain did not look like the Electro from the comics they read. He most certainly did not look like the Electro from the main series, but he does look a lot like the one from the ultimate series. There is also the Green Goblin and the Rhino for Spider-man to contend with as well, but Electro is by far the main one this time. All looked cool, but the best part were the fights, where James Garfield just does a better job at trash talking the enemies. Tobey made a good Peter Parker, but he never exhibited Spider-man's constant prattle that in the comics at times unhinged the enemies and lead to many a victory for Spidey, or made the enemy explode in a rage that made his trash talking backfire big time! I am enjoying this new series of Spider-man films; though, even I admit they came a bit too soon on the heels of the first trilogy. I also hate it that the first set of films never had any closure, and I hope that will not be the case here. I find this series is doing a better job of establishing super villains, as there is a source and reason for them that is tied together, while the first one it was all pretty random and the coincidences just a bit too far fetched. However, I enjoyed those Spider-man films a lot and I am enjoying these a lot. Would it be cool if Spider-man could be in the universe of Marvel characters Disney and Marvel is establishing, absolutely. With that said though, I think Sony is doing a pretty good job. The main thing I disliked about this film is the strange inclusion of an X-men clip in the credits. I saw no point to this as it had no ties to the film I had just viewed, I read what was originally supposed to be included and it was a lot better than the very random clip I got.

(both ultimate and amazing ones)* if peter parker works in the daily bugle, why we don't see it working as a photographer? what about Jameson?*what is the purpose from peter to create a wall with oscorp details in his room?* if peter parker is a genius why he need to watch youtube tutorials? (not a joke)* how Osborn manages to control the glider? why the medical suit as a glider in first place?* Andrew Garfield cries about six times in this movie, i actually don't get the reason: is about his father death? even through he didn't give a crap in the first film? about break out with Gwen? aunt may? i just i don't get it.* so the spider kid... did he told his mother to take him where is the rhino, while he was dressed as spiderman? and the mother says yes?","6 out of 24 found this helpful.

"4","/10","It was the Best of Spidey's; it was (almost) the Worst of Spidey's","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3009576/?ref_=tt_urv","damonous","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19630602/?ref_=tt_urv","4 May 2014","Here we are again: I wrote a similar headline for the similarly-frustrating Skyfall a couple of years ago. I didn't expect to find another overlong, hopelessly uneven movie I had such high hopes for this soon. Maybe I shouldn't say ""high"" hopes: I had my fears going-in based upon the trailers and the abundance of villains, so my expectations were pretty well-metered before the opening scene. TASM2 is, at the end of the day, a fairly punishing, draining watch. Unlike the stellar Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which precedes it by just a couple of weeks and had me instantly wanting to see it again as the credits closed, TASM2 left me dreading the thought of ever sitting through it again...DURING the big battle scene in the final quarter of the film.Was it ever as bad as Sam Raimi's King of All Bad Superhero Movies, Spider-man 3? Thankfully, no. I WOULD watch this again any day over that fine mess. But TASM2 is just so up-and-down, yo-yo, through-and-through. There are so many great action sequences & web-slinging rides through the city, which really make IMAX 3D the only way to see this (if you're not going to heed my warnings). There are absolutely wonderful Spidey quips & small heroic touches ripped out of the comic pages just for you (I wont spoil these gems; they're part of the ""best of Spidey's I refer to). The interaction between Garfield & Stone as Peter Parker & Gwen Stacey is even better than the first TASM, and really seals their great love affair with a silly smile on your face. Also, I enjoyed the briefly-played, but well thought-out friendship between Parker and Harry Osbourne. Dane DeHaan gives a great performance (at least, before he rather abruptly transforms).But, amidst all that, we get the lamest villain origin in Electro since Jim Carrey as The Riddler in Batman Forever. Why did Jamie Foxx have to play Max Dillon as a total societal outcast, complete with overstuffed pocket-protector? And, considering how sleek everyone else who works at Oscorp is, how in the world did he ever get hired? If he's as intelligent as they make him out to be in very short, broad strokes, why is he ultimately such a painful imbecile? Add that dreadful portrayal to the big fight scene at the end, in a location apparently impervious to damage. Spidey swings his way to it in a few minutes with ease, but another character is able to DRIVE there through a city in a blackout gridlock in what would have to be comparatively LESS time. Immediately, you are able to sense the sucker punches to come as some of the absolute worst of plot-contrivances.Some people are commenting that Giamotti as The Rhino is the most interesting villain in the film, for all of his very brief scenes. I was not that enthralled, since his performance is so way over-the-top. But, it does showcase an element which consistently makes Sony & Fox & most DC films bad, whereas Disney Marvel & Christopher Nolan Batman films consistently shine: Rhino is a real villain. He likes to steal, has no shame in it, and he's just a bad dude.I challenge you to name a single other Spider-Man movie villain (from ANY of the five films) that isn't 'reluctant' or a victim of unfortunate circumstance. From Iron Man to Thor to Captain America to The Avengers, Disney Marvel films are unafraid to depict REALLY BAD GUYS. No apologies. They might be multi-layered, but that comes more from their general (twisted) belief structure, and less because life just handed them a raw deal.TAMS2 sets up a lot of threads for more big-name villains in the next installments. Here's hoping we get at least one with a character who with full knowledge and with no regrets, decides to 'don the evil'; because the ""villain takes unadvised serum or makes unadvised mistake""-routine is way last its prime in the Spidey films.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

You know Spider-man is just doing his spider-man stuff. I really like his web swinging in this one when he is swinging I can see the webs attaching to buildings and his costume is flapping while he is falling it awesome. Spider-man actually wise crack more than he did in the amazing spider-man or the Raimi's trilogy. Peter Parker in this movie was spectacular, Garfield was amazing as spider-man.Gwen Stacy was an amazing love interest, yeah Gwen and Peter had their cute moments in the movie. So spider-man is just having his regular spider-man life. Then you see Electro (Jamie Foxx) come in and start a chaotic problem in times square. I feel like that scene in times square was the best scene in the entire film. Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) was spectacular as that role. Im not saying James Franco role as Harry was bad, Im just saying Dehaan performance was better I fill the things that harry is going through. In the end the movie was awesome, Andrew Garfield was awesome, Jamie Foxx was awesome as electro, Emma Stone doing very well with Gwen Stacy.

It settled questions from the first film. I didn't like electro at all,just a lame character I wanted Spidey to dispose of him sooner. Electro was the cliché black man who was filled with hate. Not the complex character he was in the comics or 60's cartoon. I must say,the scenes were Spidey is swinging by his web thru the city and fight scenes were amazing! I liked Spidey's quick wit. I wasn't crazy for the re-imagining of Harry Osborn father in particular to his demise. Sadly,the first film was much better. I was truly hoping for a much better and ramped up 2nd film.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

I watched it in the world's largest Imax, in 3d, and boy it was amazing. Everything was just so awesome. The music was amazing, the effects were a million times better then expected, and the cast was fantastic. Dane Dehaan was fantastic, and I couldn't have thought of someone better then Jamie Foxx to play Electro. Andrew Garfield was awesome- he fits much better into the roll then in the previous movie, and Emma Stone was also great. All in all, I had an adrenaline rush the entire time.To start off, the plot is amazing. Its not just action, stuff happens. Very, very dramatic at some bits- 10 or so minutes was really hard to deal with, you know what I'm talking about if you've watched it. I was very teary after wards. There are a lot of creatures and enemies, but unlike what I think the original Spiderman 3 did, it did not introduce them straight in. I think one reason why people generally didn't consider Spiderman 3 that great was because of the dive in, all-creatures-introduced kind of plot. There was not really any description given, and things weren't introduced well. This definitely is not the same with this movie. There is tons to battle all the way through, but Marc Webb does it so well. The structure of the movie is awesome, the dialog is well written, and I came out wondering how could anyone, dis this movie.Moving more into the sort of music this music has, it's very electronic and very heavy dubs. It simply makes this movie not even comparable to the old Spiderman 2. I like both in different ways, but this really kicks ahead of it in so many ways, starting with the music. It was really over the top actually, but thats what made it so modern, so clean, and finished. Its a combination of both beautiful soundtrack (Hans Zimmer, thank you) with a blast of fresh electronic music. The beats entwining with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack were beautifully mixed. Great idea, and credits to all the music department. I will definitely buy the soundtrack.Now to the graphics. Well OK, I doubted it entirely after watching the trailer which looked like someone had overloaded the saturation bar, but they were amazing. I admit, the 3d probably did it for me for once and things just seemed perfect. Not sure if the experience watching it was affected for most people not having this massive 3d view, but it certainly made me more adrenaline rushed. Credits to the visual effects. Well done.The cinematography was really great as well. Some of the birds eye shots were really arty. It must have been crazy getting some of the shots they did get- I know a lot of them are probably animated or cgi, but they really looked very real. Great camera-work- really stylish, quick and jumpy, but it was pleasantly done. I came out feeling dizzy, and that combined with just what I'd seen kept me speechless for a while. It was a good experience, and I came in with a sad, yet good feeling.Amazing, 10/10- no joke, I think it earns it. Marc Webb has overall done a brilliant job. This movie does receive a lot of hate, but hopefully people like me won't be put off by it. I quite frankly think the makers are copping quite a bit from some of the haters, but hopefully you will know if it's for you or not.","32 out of 73 found this helpful.

It's not that the actors are bad. It's not that the story is weak. But execution always trumps the previous two elements. It does have some good things going for it. Andrew Garfield, Emma Thompson, Jamie Foxx and Sally Field have good talent and work well with what they have. Also, towards the end of the story, we have good action laced with good battles, and good conflict. The problem is it takes way too long to get there with uneven and hackneyed direction. The story begins with Peter Parker on top of the world, chasing bad guys with the public of New York mostly behind him. In one scene, he saves a nerdy Oscorp employee, Dillon Max (Jamie Foxx). He is so eager to be liked, he assumes he and Spiderman are friends and develops an unhealthy admiration. But when Oscorp kicks him to the curb - or rather into a vat of eels that is hit by power rods, he turns into Electro. When his powers spark (no pun intended) fear, Spiderman steps in and he is shocked (no pun intended again) that Spiderman is not the friend. Meanwhile, Harry Osborn returns home to see his father die from a debilitating disease. He finds out he has it and needs help. Unfortunately, the things he needs are not available - and he is forced out of Oscorp. At the same time, Spiderman/Peter Parker is discovering the truth behind his father's disappearance. Gwen Stacey is interviewing for a chance to go to Oxford Peter and Gwen's relationship is rocky - and so is the friendship between Peter and Harry. Understand the problem? All these stories fold unevenly, and behind way too many special effects that try to dazzle the eye. Then, plot holes pop up so large, Spidey could never plug them up with enough webbing. Hospitals and airports have their own emergency generators off the grid. In the end, we have a dark, violent Spiderman, far apart from the Raimi/Macguire Era. Moreover, Garfield does not have the nerdy quality that the original star had to nail the role. Frankly, too many villains, too many special effects, too long a movie all make The Amazing Spiderman 2 too terrible to watch. It might even make you prefer Raimi's final installment to this one.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

But it has its moments mostly between Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield their chemistry is basically all this movie has going for it. This movie decently entertaining, good action scenes but not enough of them though with a very non epic final battle. I liked the introduction of all the new characters, and I like the idea of where it's going as a series but this movie just felt like a 2 hour filler to prepare us for what is next to come or at least a universe they were ""trying"" to set up. I mean I've seen a lot worse movies as far as superhero/comic movies go, so I'm not even gonna hate as hard as i want too, I just expected a lot more as far as comparing it to other superhero movies that marvels pumping out recently down at Disney. They put out an amazing new captain America movie with winter soldier and Fox did it with X-Men Days Of Future Past, this movie is no where in their ball park but it's good enough for a one time watch just at laugh at the cheese factor acting job from Oscar winner Jamie Foxx who gives us one of the worst performances of his career playing a lesser version of Jim Carrey's Riddler from Batman Forever its almost not watchable, Dane DeHaan is also frigin terrible playing a worse version of the same role he plays in Chronicle, and don't even get me started of the phoned in cameo by Paul Giamatti, who even admitted he thought the role was a joke. Another thing I'm tired of with spider man in general is the teen angst if I wanted to watch Breakfast Club I would watch Breakfast Club. I'm also tired of how all the characters come off as awkward losers that just don't fit in. and for god sake I wanna see some blood enough with the pg ratings even the comics are more graphic then the movies. anyways. 5 out of 10 if anything at all because it was cheese watch","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Ever since a young age I've loved the comics and the Raimi movies were a big part of my childhood. Although I was a big fan of 2012′s 'The Amazing Spider-Man', I'm not afraid to admit it had some serious problems, but for the most part I thought it did a better job with the origin than 2002′s 'Spider-Man' did. This sequel was where director Marc Webb had to really hit the nail on the head though, because Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2′ is one of the best comic book movies ever made. After all of Sony's awful marketing for this movie, I was sceptical, but still very excited. I'm incredible happy to say that my scepticism wasn't necessary, because 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2′ is truly amazing.The script of this movie is arguably its weakest component, but it's still far from bad. My favourite part of 'The Amazing Spider-Man' was the character development and relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, and this sequel pulls it off perfectly as well. The dialogue between the two feels so incredibly natural, it's like we're seeing an actual relationship folding out on screen. In terms of the story itself, I found it engaging but certain elements often feel fairly contrived and roughly scripted. I found this forgivable however because everything else is so damn good. The movie doesn't suffer from having too many villains (which I feel proves that 'Spider-Man 3′ didn't suffer from too many villains, it suffered from an awful script), as the character of Electro is really good; he's not just a psychopath who wants to destroy the world but instead has believable motives. Harry Osborn is also a well written character, and it's hard to judge the Rhino character because he's in the movie so little. One worry I had was how desperately Sony seemed to want to expand the Spider-Man universe by casting so many well known characters (like Black Cat, Vulture/Menken and Alistair Smythe) for this movie. It turns out it works pretty well, because they aren't any overly obvious references to who these characters will become if you weren't already aware.The cast do a phenomenal job with their material as well. Andrew Garfield absolutely kills it as Spider-Man/Peter Parker, he's far better than Tobey Maguire and does an excellent job carrying the film. Emma Stone is incredible as well, she and Andrew Garfield have amazing chemistry (probably due to them actually being in a relationship in real life) and seeing the two of them on screen together is an absolute joy. Dane DeHaan is great as he always is, I had worries about him after seeing the trailers but he does really well with the character. Jamie Foxx is a lot of fun to watch, his Electro character is just so amusing to see on screen and he does a good job of making the character a sympathetic villain. Paul Giamatti is also a lot of fun to watch for the few minutes he's on screen, and the rest of the supporting cast was good as well, there were no notable bad performances.Marc Webb gives wonderful direction in this movie just as he did in the first one. He gives perfect direction on the previously mentioned character scenes in particular, but I also found he seems to have become a much better action director with this sequel as well. Some of the action in this film is truly incredible, a lot of the scenes are very heart pounding and are all wholly entertaining. There is also a phenomenal score to accompany the the action. The VFX in this movie are absolutely beautiful, one of 'The Amazing Spider Man""s biggest problems was its mediocre CGI, but there's no worry of that in this movie because it looks great. This movie feels like a comic book movie. It doesn't go dark and gritty like other superhero movies feel the need to do, and I respect it so much more for that. The colours are bright and gorgeous, and I'm so happy to finally see some good Spidey swinging around the city scenes that are exhilarating and incredible to experience. I'm just so happy after seeing this movie. Is it better than 'Spider-Man 2′? I'm not sure I can decide yet. Having seen 'Spider-Man 2′ countless times I think it would be unfair to compare it to this just yet. 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2′ isn't a perfect movie, but it sure is a hell of a lot of fun.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

So in spite of hearing negative things, I had to watch this.The first scene in it, which doesn't have Spidey in it, is pretty decent, with a bit of mystery and an exciting take on uploading a file. Alas, the movie lost me as Spider-Man appeared. First off - and I know this isn't an easy task - the special effects looked unconvincing. Spider-Man's movements were too fluid, as though he were fully animated (which he probably was).The movie starts with a chase scene, with a wise-cracking Spidey taunting the bad guys and rescuing a bunch of people. It was just okay, and there was a bit on Spidey trying to corral some dangerous test-tubes that was too close to slapstick.I watched almost an hour of the movie, and while that included a couple of action scenes, some banter, a character introduction, and the oddly serious, Montgomery Clift style Peter Parker, none of it caught my interest.In fact, the only really good scene was Peter and his girlfriend flirting and making rules for each other. It was a nice little scene that suggested the producers should have just cast the principals in a little romantic comedy. When the best thing about a big action movie is the love interest, it's not a good action movie. So I gave up on it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The Osbornes are just boring and you won't care about them until the end, Gwen Stacy is only a Damsel and doesn't give any sort of fun or entertainment to the plot.The plot. It has so many holes, characters randomly meet in elevators or in the street to provide the next objective of the characters.The villain is awful, Jamie Fox tried but he isn't the man for this movie, Eletro's powers are OP and not at all based on the original one from the comic books.The dialogue is annoying, predictable and a lot of times stupid. Andrew Garfield proved once again that he can only play one kind of Spiderman, he is starting to be the Kristen Stewart of this franchise.In the movie you will get some references for future movies, but that will drive anyone insane because of how bad this one is.There is almost no action in this marvel movie and the battles are forgettable. One fight doesn't even end and the movie gives a big ""Thank you for the money now go home"" to the audience.This could have been the movie that made a new and awesome Spiderman with good one liners for cool characters, but they are horrible in every way. Your head will explode because of the big amount of ""WTF just happened"" moments in the movie.A solid 5/10 for The amazing Spiderman 2, it could have been a Captain America 2 but it ended being more like a Fantastic four fail, kind of movie.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Poor plotting and weak characters","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3011080/?ref_=tt_urv","rcolgan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20595945/?ref_=tt_urv","6 May 2014","Once again Sony has tightened it's grip on the Spider-man franchise to stop the likes of Disney getting a hold of it and expanded on the amazing spider-man franchise. Unfortunately whilst they may have this power over the character they do not live up to their responsibility to make a decent franchise, instead creating a lack luster film with weak characters, poor designs and an overwhelming lack of a coherent plot structure. The weak structure largely comes from the fact that the film is stuffed with far too many sub plots with each villain and supporting character seeming to get one leaving little room to develop any of them. But the film's main focus though is on the relationship between Gwen and Peter as after the events of the first film Peter is uncertain about being with Gwen and putting her in danger. At times this relationship is extremely effective, largely due to the natural chemistry of Garfield and Stone which does help the romance work. Unfortunately the romance does suffer from some weaker elements such as when Peter tells Gwen that he's been following her around. This is thought of in the film as romantic, but it's not. It's creepy and makes spider-man a stalker! If someone were following you without your knowing, would you consider it romantic? Another problem with the love plot taking up the most time it also means we get more Parker than we do Spider-man. This is a problem because just like the first film it seems like Garfield does pretty well as Spider- man, being very funny spouting one liners in the most dire situations, but fails as being Peter Parker, being annoying and awkward on screen. Also the only relationship of meaning that's developed in the film is with Gwen, his interactions with the other characters don't really go anywhere. He doesn't even get that much screen time talking to any of the villains, making there relationships feel fairly genetic and lacking interest. One of these villains that the film introduces is Electro, who's design looks like a reject from the blue man group. At first the film tries to develop his character and show him as this innocent person who has an obsessive nature, but then in the midpoint of the film deteriorates to a bland ""I am evil now and must kill Spider-man"" with little build up or reason for such a sudden character shift. Also, whilst in the adverts he was hyped to be the main villain, the reality is that he doesn't have much impact at all on the plot. You could have removed his character from the movie and it wouldn't have made any difference whatsoever other than removing some fight scenes. Then there's Harry Osborne and his alter ego, the Goblin. He has some good scenes early on, particularly one scene where he's talking with his dying father which is probably the best scene in the film, but then he becomes weaker as the film progresses with he film seemingly uncertain as to whether it wants us to sympathise with him due to being alienated by everyone or hate him for attacking evil. Also the relationship between him and Peter feels very unnatural and forced since we don't see them build any relationship to begin with with only one or two lines of dialogue giving any explanation as to why they could be close. Then to top it off you have rhino. If you thought Venom didn't get enough screen time in spider-man 3, wait till you get a load of this five minute cameo. He is only there for 2 scenes and becomes the Rhino off screen. Worse yet rather than trying to give him any character whatsoever, he's degraded to an angry, shouting hired gun who would seem more suited for a role as a side villain in a Schwarzenegger film from the 80's. His character serves as nothing but a cheap ploy to fill more cinema seats and to tease a sinister 6 movie. To top this off, the ending to just about every story in the film ends up feeling either unfinished in an attempt to lure in viewers to the next film or rushed in an attempt to create a forced conclusion. This film feels too focused on building a franchise and because of it the individual films feel less complete. For example the back story to what happened to Peter's father gets a big build up, but then after one small revelation the film just drops the plot, becoming more interested in getting some more mindless action in the film for the last few minutes. Though the film doesn't get everything wrong. Seeing Spider-man go to his best to save every citizen is cool and a nice call back to the likes of the original Superman film. This is helped even further when we see how kind he is to everyone he saves, at one point saving a kid from some bullies and then complimenting his arts and crafts project. These scenes are probably the best since they nail the character and make him extremely likable. Also at times the mixture of comedy and action feels just right, being a good reflection of the comic books. But these small positives do not stop Amazing Spider-man 2 being a great disappointment being a significant step down in comparison to the recent standard of Superhero movies. It has a few decent moments, but these are mixed in with far too many badly written characters and a plot that goes all over the place, lacking focus and not gauging an interest for these characters. The franchise has a lot more potential than this is given and I hope the potential is met by future instalments, but so far it is not looking good for this franchise.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

I believe Jamie Foxx's performance was good until he became Electro. A little too-written maybe, but he had his charm. And it is a superhero movie. Cheesy dialog, but gotta expect that I suppose. I say, choose one villain and make a captivating story about that. That's how this movie could've worked. High 5/low 6 out of 10.

Or maybe I just want MY Spiderman to convey a tiny bit of why I loved the comic book so much. This emo, sad, downtrodden Peter Parker with huge hair and no real character just does not cut it for me, nor do the liberties taken with the entire comic book universe. Of course I never liked the ""Ultimates"" versions anyway. Ten years ago, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 was released and quickly became perhaps the most critically acclaimed and popularly beloved comic-book superhero movie since Richard Donner's Superman in 1978. Spider-Man 2 had it all: a great villain in Alfred Molina's multitentacled Doc Octopus, a realistic romantic connection between leads Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, and a script by the Academy Award–winning screenwriter Alvin Sargent that balanced the action and special-effects. Cynical minds and business suits ruined it all.One of the biggest misfires of this and many other films is the overuse of CGI. Where they could use real, practical stunts and effects, they take the cheap, easy and franky, lazy way out. Time and again the crowd groaned at the terrible effects that would seem bad even on a Playstation 3. The whole thing seems to have been assembled by filmmakers tone-deaf to what constitutes compelling, exciting super hero cinema. Everything the people involved could think of seems to be thrown into the film. It is an overlong mash up of several better films, populated with too many characters and a zillion plots all in a battle to be understood.In the end, it is time to put this mess to rest. They finally got the suit right... it looks great. The cast tries in vain to save a film that refuses to live. This bad boy is DOA.","8 out of 36 found this helpful.

With the villains involved, I had higher hopes for a better, more action packed sequel. And there were things I appreciated. But for the most part, this sequel suffered from some disappointing sequelitis, the same kinds of things we've seen in numerous other comic book flick sequels. Suffice to say, while I wasn't too disappointed, with lowered expectations, it is sad to see this film fall short. But let's talk about what's good first.The best part of the film was easily the scenes between Garfield and Stone. Both actors are excellent in their roles and have fantastic chemistry together. When they share their scenes, their relationship is believable and it's something you can completely get behind. It's the one area of the film that Webb improves over the Raimi trilogy. There's also some decent action. The action involving Electro especially is great, with a fantastic display of special effects and an exciting sense of motion. However, unfortunately, this is where a lot of the good stuff ends. Much of the rest of the film ranges from mediocre to bad. Pretty much anything involving Harry Osborne is cringe worthy, particularly when he starts losing his sanity. While the action involving Electro is excellent, everything about the character seems to lack depth and interest. His plight isn't the least bit interesting, and his motivations feel flimsy. While he may be sympathetic in a sense, it's a cheap kind of sympathy. He feels like a villain who is there merely to be a villain for Spider-man, with little in the way of actually being a meaningful character. Paul Giamatti makes two very brief appearances, and his character feels like little more than a nod to a future film that will probably, hopefully be much better. The story itself isn't terribly interesting either. It's the same kind of inner conflict stuff we've seen in most other comic book films, but in particular, we've already crossed this territory. While Stone makes for a much better love interest as Gwen Stacy, it's still the same tried and true story of Peter Parker having to juggle his real life and his love for Gwen and his role as Spider-man and the danger that brings. I will give the film props for a twist at the end of the film that I think is a somewhat brave and unique thing to do in a comic book film, but it's one plot point in many other retreads that we've already seen. And the stuff involving Peter's parents still isn't all that interesting. It's a nice attempt to add changes to Peter's origin, but they're just not that interesting, which is too bad considering how much of Peter's inner struggle comes from that.This outing of Spider-man feels much like the first: uninteresting villains, needless changes to the origin story, action that, while decent, fails to be really memorable. The biggest problem here is that it feels like the middle part of a bigger story. We've seen this with films like Iron Man 2, but there is no backing here with a larger cinematic universe. Instead, we just have to hope and wait for a better Spider-man movie to come.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

I have no idea where all this fuss is coming from, all this hatred? I don't get it... It was a damn fun movie, I had a blast watching it and, come on, this is the most emotionally demanding Spider- Man as well. Everything upon both series has been improved upon in my opinion. Sure it wasn't perfect, but I do like it more than Captian American 2 although slightly. The tone was perfect for the earl 90s spider-man and ultimate spider-man thrown together. Its a new take on everything and I am enjoying it just as I honestly enjoyed Superior Spider- man.I will be honestly, I've enjoyed all of them for what they were. They were fun, no reason to take them so dang serious. Its a fresh take on Spider-man and not just a rehash of old ideas, this was the one that has now officially set it apart from the previous franchise and all other Spider-man cannon. Face it, Spider-Man has been rebooted countless times and all of them are different iterations from the stories told before with some new sprinkled on top. This is no different. Raimi was its own thing too apart from all other cannon, nothing escapes this. So there is no perfect iteration anymore, just individual opinion. This is no where near Batman and Robin territory that's ridiculous. In my opinion its up there with Iron Man and Spider-Man 2, even The Dark Knight. In fact I would rather watch this than The Dark Knight if not only because it is a much more fun film. Calm down. Its a great movie.

Absolutely phenomenal! I am usually not a fan of Marvel movies, as they lack a deep plot and try too hard to wow the crowd with special effects, but this movie made me believe in Marvel once again. All fans of the first trilogy were a bit worried about the reboot. I was one of those people...until I saw the first production. Not overly impressed, but it managed to send me to the second.Probably one of the best decisions I've made in movie aspect of my life since (again) the Dark Knight Rises. Anyone who is anyone should take the time to see this flick. Be careful though, as there are very solid plot twists involved.","14 out of 29 found this helpful.

Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man / Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is back on the big screen in this gripping story about a boy who has the powers of a spider. He's up against Electro / Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), a man seeking attention, Harry Osborn / Green Goblin (Dane DaHaan), Peter's best friend and Spider-Man's foe, while still having to keep a promise and not uncover his parents' secret. In this film, the writers allocate more time to show the alter-ego of Peter Parker without making it run too long or lose the action. The strong relationship between all the characters, whether it's love or hatred is all 3-Dimensional. It helps when you have capable actors filling these roles. The story creates a darker look at being a hero and throws in some comic book jokes once in a while. This movie had a chance of becoming too unfocused. It has two villains to establish, the romance between Peter and Gwen, Peter trying to figure out the truth about his parents' past and more. However, with the help of a very talented director, Marc Webb and wonderful writers, Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Jeff Pinkner, they pick a goal for the plot and follow through with it, while bringing all the actors' story arcs together naturally. The special effects in this film are beyond amazing! Electro's design makes him the most unique villain. The special effect's department really gets creative on how Spider-Man moves and fights, especially when he's in spider-sense mode and everything slows down. I gained a new respect for Jamie Foxx who portrays my favorite character Electro / Max Dillon. He plays a menacing villain, but also shows the tragic and even pathetic side of Max Dillon. On the Google+ Hangout which I was fortunate to be part of, Jamie confided that he ""based this character on a person he knew."" Behind all the CGI you see Jamie honor this person. The battle in Times Square between Electro and Spider-Man in my favorite scene. It encompasses all the incredible CGI effects mentioned. It's where Max finally gets attention, once he gets his powers and he sees himself on T.V. When Electro says, ""You see me?"" You genuinely feel sorry for him. The moral of this story is, ""It doesn't matter how hard you fall, it matters how fast you get back up."" Peter goes through a life changing event and can't move on. However, in a clever and Marvel way, Aunt May gives Peter some advice that changes things.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 10- to 18-year-olds. There are violent and intense scenes that some kids may not be able to handle, but this is a marvelous adaptation of Spider-Man. It will be released in theaters nationwide on May 2.Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

When I heard that they were not gonna make the 4th installment of the Spider-Man series, I felt quite down. I loved Spider-Man. He's one of my favorite Marvel heroes. And then they announced that they were going to make another Spider-Man trilogy with a whole new cast, story, and director. I was not that excited because I liked Sam Raimi's work. They even changed the title Spider-Man to The Amazing Spider-Man. I went to see what it was like.Well, I was NOT disappointed. Marc Webb did a good job rebooting the series. I also loved the new actors\actresses. Especially Andrew Garfield. He stole the show. I kind of thought that he's a better Spider-Man than Maguire. Then, they announced they will make a sequel. I definitely had high hopes for the The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I went to theaters to see it.In fact, it was better than I thought. Once again, Marc Webb did an even better job than the first installment. The actors were great at their roles. Especially Dane DeHaan. He made a great portrayal of the Green Goblin. I enjoyed his performance in Chronicle. Jamie Foxx did a great job too. He was the perfect Electro. I just wasn't a fan of Electro's suit in this film but that's not important. The story was interesting and unique at the same time. They did something that made this the best Spider-Man movie to me. It had humor, some emotional scenes and action.Extremely recommended.","25 out of 58 found this helpful.

No, but there were all too many times that I wondered if the story board people realized just how boring the scenes had become.The characters and plot just fell so short of taking the viewer on an adventure worthy of the comic book. If there should be a 3rd in this series please get the writers of the comic books to put forth a really exciting story.

It's fascinatingly good which brings a lot of excitement. There's no Spider-Man without good action. The composition, by Hans Zimmer and The Magnificent Six, is extraordinary.

"5","/10","Mediocre movie made watchable by the SFX action","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3082726/?ref_=tt_urv","p-jonsson","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23949705/?ref_=tt_urv","8 September 2014","It seems that Spider Man is doomed to receive mediocre to abysmal implementations on the big screen. Well, at least in my opinion. The Amazing Spider Man 2 currently have a rating of 7.1 which quite surprises me. This was not the worst Spider Man movie. The 2nd instalment, Spider-Man 2, in the first series with Tobey Maquire still holds that title firmly.There are some nice special effect fireworks going on and there are some funny parts when Peter Parker puts on the mask and goes to action but apart from that I found the movie uninspired, with a mediocre plot and sometimes downright boring. The plot is perhaps suitable for a comics magazine with its standard set of unlikely events, backstabbing big-corporate employees and disgruntled scientists becoming super villains but on the big-screen one would expect a wee bit more effort going into the plot.The main villain, Electro, was  well not really giving much of an impression. He never lifted above the pretty silly scientist letting everyone walk all over him and doing really, really stupid things like trying to put two high voltage cables together without turning off the power. Sure he tried to give a menacing appearance towards the end but to me he never really managed to elevate himself to a real super-villain. I almost got the impression that the director actually realized that Electra was not good enough and so decided to come up with some convoluted scheme to throw in The Green Goblin at the end. None of these villains are really bad, just mediocre.Then of course there is the obligatory Peter Parker wallowing in self-pity that every director seems to just have to put in these movies. It is not funny and downright boring. And for the ending cliffhanger they throw in the Rhinoas some jerk in a monster mechanical suit :-( . What the f? The Rhino is supposed to have a polymer bonded to his skin and augmented strength and speed. Not be running around in some silly mechanical Rhino toy! The entertainment factor of this movie comes almost entirely from the SFX action and a few select scenes. Otherwise the movie was fairly (yawn) mediocre as far as I am concerned. Having said that, being the sci-fi and super-hero fan that I am, I will probably buy the next instalment anyway if one comes out.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

I like the fact that it's a love story at its core, although the love story ended horribly (still can't get over it. Even though it was expected)Loooved Peter and Gwen's chemistry. I felt it more compared to the last movie. Finally, we know why Peter's parents left him. There're a lot to love about this movie I just can't put it to words but I'll be talking more about what I hate.First thing I hate, Electro. Ugh, another die hard superhero fan turned into an enemy bc of some misunderstanding (The Incredibles, Iron Man 3, etc). Second, Peter and Harry's friendship came out of nowhere. Yes, they were friends before and maybe they hung out for a few weeks during the time span TASM2. But imo they should have showed their closeness more.As far as I can remember those are the only things I hate about the movie. Great effects, love story (and chemistry), characters, back stories (i think the back stories opened tons of possible plots for the following movies). But the action parts were a little cliché and overdone while the introduction of the villains were half baked.As an all around superhero movie it's good (i find great) but as an action movie idk, lol, how ironic. HAHA! PS I gave it a 9 because of the VFX and how the actors fit their own characters PERFECTLY (if it weren't for the spot on characters i think it'd be a complete mess).","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The premise of the film sees Peter Parker dealing with his difficult relationship with Gwen Stacy when Oscorp causes more issues for Spider-Man.Main Character
Andrew Garfield plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he is really good. I actually think this is a really strong performance and he delivers really well as both characters. Peter goes through a lot and really struggles with the consequences from the previous film another thing I really enjoyed was seeing Peter actually as a genius which is done really well here. After the first film Spider-Man is now seen as a positive part of society and that leads to his own issues especially when it comes to his connection with the villains.Supporting Characters
Emma Stone is back as Gwen Stacy and even though there are elements of the plot that I didn't enjoy about her I can't deny how good she is in the role and how good the chemistry between her and Garfield really is. In terms of the romantic element they are easily my favourite one out of all The Spider-Man ones and it adds so much to have a couple you actually care about. Sally Field is pretty good as Aunt May, her character is the most oblivious in film history but I liked her dynamic with Peter as they do have a good chemistry. But the rest of the cast aren't particularly good and I am looking at the villains, Jamie Foxx plays Max Dillon/Electro and this is one of those performances that is so bad that you end up laughing at it, he plays this nerdy guy who gets turned into a supervillain. He is just filled with awful one liners and laughable motivations that just really doesn't work. Dane DeHaan plays Harry Osborne/Green Goblin and he is also pretty bad. He is really shoe horned into this film, and it starts off okay but he just becomes really over the top and cliché and then things get even worse when he turns into the Goblin.Story
The story is easily the worst part of the film, it is all over the place and makes no sense. The film tries to focus on so many different story arcs but none of them get the time for the audience to get invested in. The ending is also terrible, the film has a clear ending but it decides to go on for another 10 mins or so and it really drags down the overall quality of the film.Script
The script is just about passable, the humour with Spider-Man is really good and it is nice to see a confident version of the character on show. The dialogue between Gwen & Peter works well because the two of them have natural chemistry, not because of the actual writing. The overblown narrative is a huge issue and the drama just doesn't land as much as it should apart from a couple of moments.Style
There are some very entertaining action scenes here and web swinging has never looked better. The Spider-Man costume is brilliant and seeing him in action is a lot of fun. But the looks of Electro, Green Goblin and Rhino are all awful and make a mockery of these characters. The pacing of the film is really hindered because of the amount of story arcs and length of the film.Overall
Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is an average film. There is just way too much going on and it over reaches which is a big reason why this version of the character ended the way it did.Rating - 5/10.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

There are way too many characters wrapped up in an overall decent plot, but that never tells too much - This new reboot on the franchise always feels like a backstory to me, I guess the huge production values and the fine acting makes up for all of it's major flaws. The main problem with the movie though, is that it is a constant attack to the viewer's intellect. You'll have an hard time swallowing some of the scenes, and some of the characters, if you're not a 10 year old kid.I wasn't expecting much of this, and still, I left the theater disappointed.","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

While very visually impressive, the story line for The Amazing Spiderman 2 falls just about as short as the first. Outside of Sally Fields ""who plays Aunt May and Dane DeHaan ""who plays Harry Osbourn"" the acting is very sub-par. The villains in this movie come off very corny, Jamie Foxx did the best he could with a horrible script and even worse re-design of a comic character. Paul Giamatti is introduced in the beginning and only again at the end to set up the 3rd film as Spiderman's nemeses Rhino. Dane DeHaan is probably the most impressive in this film, he plays a much better Harry Osbourn than James Franco ever did, the problem being The Green Goblin character was just done not long ago in the other Spidey franchise and it feels forced. Too much time in this movie is wasted on setting up sequels for movies 3 and 4 then focusing on material at hand. The visual effects in the movie are done amazingly well, and most of the actions sequences were very entertaining, just too far in between scenes that left you asking why they were even shot.","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

BergerAbout five weeks ago I moved to Japan for a one-to-three year contract as a chaplain's assistant and conversational English teacher.Less than a week ago, I found out the new Spider-Man movie was being released early here. Turns out tonight I got to go see it with a friend, and these are my―spoiler-free―initial thoughts on the movie.First of all, the character development in this film is quite a relief from the last multi-villain installment of the Spider-Man saga, Sam Raimi's infamous Spider-Man 3. This is, once again, a spoiler-free review so I won't go into detail over the who, what, and when, but suffice it to say that the important characters have adequate backstory screen time and enough ""three- dimensionalness"" to keep the action sequences from seeming forced and unimportant.Spidey gives a real showstopping performance with his trademark antics, acrobatics and the usual hero-angst, but he does so without ever becoming overbearing. The animation and choreography of the rescues and fight scenes are spectacular, and the new, more classic suit looks really good. The action is reminiscent of the agility and grace of Spider-Man 2's battles with Doctor Octopus and maintains a consistent thread of meaning and (relative) believability throughout.Peter Parker, in his eternal search for the balance between being a hero, and being a human, bleeds emotion and quirky humor like the fun yet deeply relatable character that he's become so well known to be. The dialogue scenes with him and Gwen are some of my favorite moments. Beautiful chemistry between the two of them.As one can tell from the catchphrase on the movie posters for The Amazing Spider-Man 2, our web-slinging hero does face quite the battle: on emotional, physical, and superhuman levels. Jaimie Foxx plays a great new take on Electro, and proves to be a more satisfying villain―in my opinion―than the Lizard from the previous Amazing Spider-Man movie. Also Harry Osborn as a foil, and Gwen as his damsel-in-and-of-distress each prove to be engaging points of personal conflict in their own way.Overall, I enjoyed the film quite a bit. As a mild critique: I would say the score, though very succinct and cool, felt overdone in more than one scene. The overuse of music gave the whole film a slightly theatrical feel, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on how you look at it. The rest of my critical comments will have to wait for a ""with spoilers"" review.Again though, I laughed, gasped, and had my hands grabbing the armrests of my chair multiple times throughout the well-filled 142 minutes of the film.Towards the end there is some indication of what might be featured in the next film, and I'm very much on the edge of my seat to find out exactly what that will look like!That's it for my ""night of,"" first impressions on the new Spidey movie, true believers. It was amazing.'Nuff said.―Erik","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Had it been on TV I would have switched off but being in the cinema I stayed awake in the hope that the ending would be worth it but it was as predictable as the rest of the film. I connected with none of the characters at all and couldn't care less what happened to them, the plot had no twists in it that I could see and the acting was dire. Garfield as Spiderman was annoying, Emma Stone was horribly made-up, the ELectro character had potential as a phenomenally powerful villain until you discover he can be made useless with a bucket of water and the only convincing performance was given by Sally Field as Aunt May.

Much better in terms of visual effects compared to the previous spiderman series, of course, the reason for this is the difference in years.If we look at the beginning of the film briefly I liked the first plane scene in the first film they continued the subject.
later battle scenes visual effects according to the first film did not develop much in terms of, in fact, the biggest difference of amazing spiderman we watched too many spiderman, but I didn't see much of peter parker's own life so I think the first three Spiderman movies more beautiful than this series.
just focus on the action and forget the Peter Parker I felt like Peter Parker was just investigating his family.I didn't like the bad character it should be used another bad character in my opinion instead of Electro.
Harry Osborn was also a very short battle scene as the goblin came to the last scene of the film, and it seems to me that they wanted to keep it in the sequel, just like they had a preview and we don't enough see harry and peter friendship.They've skipped too many topics and focused more on the action instead I think they could have done better than the first series.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Also the overacting of Paul Giamatti.3rd villain: The Green Goblin was brought in last minute for a small final fight after Spider-Man defeats Electro. To be honest, the design of Green Goblin is terrible and definitely not the design from the comics, also Dane Dehaan's acting can go over the top as Harry Osborn/Green Goblin.Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are still good as adult Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Gwen Stacy, I still like Peter and Gwen's relationship but sometimes it gets annoying.3 villains, Peter looking for his parents again, Harry wanting Spider-Man's blood, random side villain taking over oscorp, introducing new characters, teasing more movies and hoping for a Sinister 6 movie that assume they will get.--------SMALL SPOILER WARNING--------Gwen Stacy dies in this like in the comics which is surprising but it feels like it was rushed in after the quick Green Goblin final fight, she brings this on herself by using foreshadowing and running into danger. So now I feel like I won't be able to see it done right which is sad.-------------SPOILER FREE BELOW THIS POINT----------What made me even more disappointed in this is that they are forcing a Sinister 6 story/storyline into another movie that is not happening. Which made me a little mad because it's my favorite storyline in the comics along with the Black Suit storyline in the comics.Spider-Man 3 had some of the Black Suit stuff from the comics but didn't spend more time with Peter and the Symbiote and Amazing Spider-Man 2 didn't earn the Sinister 6 storyline, they just assumed if they try to get the villains together and if you liked the action then you would want to see another movie.If they wanted to do that storyline then they should focus more on it then cramming everything into one movie, it's not the actors fault it's the script they put together and how they decided to have it play out.This was really disappointing as a Spider-Man fan myself because I liked Andrew Garfield's adult Spider-Man.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So this time around, Peter Parker is on the cusp of figuring out why his parents left him all those years back, meanwhile, his relationship with Gwen Stacey is shaky and he has to decide whether it's safest to break it off or continue on with her. ALSO, Jamie Foxx plays Electro, the statically charged new villain who is causing mayhem AND things with the Osborn family and Oscorp are taking an insane toll, physically and emotionally, for Harry Osborn. There is A LOT going on in this movie, but is it good? Well it's definitely not bad, the best part of the movie is Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man; he can perfectly balance being a funny smart ass, and also tone a strong emotional side for the more dramatic moments. The chemistry between him and Emma Stone (also pretty good in the movie) is really good as well, you really believe the love between the two, even though it can get a bit much at times. Jamie Foxx as Electro was also really cool, which brings in mind the special effects and action scenes. The movie looks good and sounds great. Anything scored by Hans Zimmer is awesome. Now there are a good amount of problems; like I said before there is A LOT going on in this movie. It feels really condensed at times, mostly during the end, which was intense, but so much happened so fast. And the previews for this movie are the exact reason why I stay away from previews as much as possible, like %70 of the movie is in the trailers, that's not cool! The villains, other than Electro are seldom used, literally. This is obviously a build up for part 3, so I'm not gonna whine too much, but there was still a cluttered feel to the movie. It's still very fun, with some really good acting, Dane DeHaan was gold. It's just as good as the first Amazing Spider-Man, but still not as good as Spider-Man 2 or other comic book movies.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Peters parents have not been very large in comics and haven't really blown up in the stories they've been in. It was an intriguing thought. But the way they used him was so inadequate. They said that Richard Parker specifically made it so that the powers could have only affected Peter. This is really annoying and I honestly think Stan Lee would hate this movie. When Stan Lee created Spider-Man (Miles Morales, Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy) his intention was to create a character where anyone was able to get bitten and become a superhero like race, gender, sexuality, beliefs. And this film decides to crap on Stan Lee and makes it so that it was Peter's destiny to become Spider-Man. They even made a whole film based around it - Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse. Peter Parker had a soft change. Not a big thing, just a minor nitpick. Andrews voice for Parker is a New Yorker accent, and this movie it got more aggressive. But unless you watch the movies immediately back to back it is quite unnoticeable.They have improved Spider-Man but now he is more Deadpool than Spider-Man. What I mean by this is that he goes with more making people laugh than saving people. So an example is at the very start of the film is when he starts to annoy Rhino but instead of stopping him he just makes jokes. Especially since you see him rampaging and killing people on the street. He has improved but they replaced the fact that he was a criminal in the last film, with Deadpool like personality. Every scene with Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield made me want to rip my eye out. They were boring and repetitive. They were both quite. Them two in the same scene acting wise has not really improved.The beginning was probably the best ever shot I have seen in a film. The cinematography in the flick was incredible. There are so many plot holes in the film. People are running upstairs which at the end of them are blocked, and they ran to get away from the bad guy. Green Goblin is ill and his father is just dying and same with his grandfather. In that logic that means to any simple-minded human being, he would die at the same age as his father. There were three antagonists in the movie and that's if you count Rhino as one. I liked Rhino and that was it, although I hate how much of him they used. He is a big part of Marvel comics. Electro and Goblin are both dumb. So Electro's origin was fine but his intentions were unclear.And the thing that was so unintentionally funny was that when he was getting his power in a fish tank. His tooth gap disappeared as his teeth attracted towards each other with electricity. And there was so much earnestness that went into that 5 seconds moment. Green Goblin had a bad actor, looks when he turned into the Goblin, and his character development could have been grown more. The reason I thought the Rhino was so great was the CGI concept and the actor. People say there were too many villains. I think it's fine but to make it work, you have to develop them all together otherwise it turns into a villain origin story. The audio was as I said, the same as Amazing Spider-Man 1. The ending was actually good because I'm tired of Emma and Andrews relationship with their characters. The end fight was also great. The end credit scene left me excited despite the fact that we won't get a third. The ending also showed the Rhino in a huge suit and fired rockets at Spider-Man. And somehow he redirects the rockets towards innocent people. The bad things I said despite how many there are, are a very big deal. So that explains the rating.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I did not expect DeHann to do justice to the Harry Osborne character previously done by Franco but he did very well. Now as most of us know that there are complaints with regards to too much stuff and the movie just rushed, I would agree on that when it comes to Electro, he could have been given some more screen time but then again wasn't. Probably because I found him too powerful for Spidey to handle for long (him shooting all that electricity around like thunder). On the other hand, me feels that Goblin was given little time about which I have no reservations because the Goblin already got its full movie (Spiderman 1 and 2). All in all a great movie and most spider-man fans will enjoy this one.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I really love Spider-Man. He's my favourite superhero of all time. And to have him in a cluttered, passionless, boring, and anger inducing movie makes me depressed.This movie is such a giant mess. Subplots are everywhere, villains are lazily written, the decision making in this movie is questionable, logic is thrown out the window, and I forgot that Peter Parker was supposed to be Peter Parker.Andrew Garfield may have done an okay job as Spider-Man, but he did a terrible job as Peter Parker. When I think of Peter Parker, the last thing I think of is a hipster with attractive looks and angsty emotions with a hot girlfriend. Sure, the Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker romance comes off as genuine, but is it because the script is forcing us to see how much in love they are or is it because Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield are dating?Max Dillon. wut why how could they what even Electro, I mean, the Riddler, hates Spider-Man because he's an attention seeking whore.Dane Dehaan was a great actor for a role like Harry Osborne. I loved his performance in Chronicle as an angsty teenager. However, in here, it felt heavily overacted. Whining, evil for some reason, killing people?On a related note, the movie never explained the motives of the super villains. In every Spider-Man movie, they clearly explain what the plan was for them being evil or dominant. However, once they reach their goal, what happens next? When Harry and Electro team up, they want to kill Spider-Man, but they never explain why. They never explain what to do next. It's so cluttered.This movie is just a cluttered mess. The movie jumps from subplots including Peter and Harry being friends, Max becoming Electro, Harry having a disease and being in charge of Oscorp, Peter and Gwen having a problem, Gwen going to college, Aunt May having a job, Rhino being there, Peter's parents and their disappearance, Harry turning into the Green Goblin, the death of a main character, and then two unrelated planes about to crash in the final battle.There is no time to breathe. There is nothing of substance that is good form this movie. The action scenes are quick and don't mean anything. I know who is going to die. I know who is going to live. It's so boring. Everything is happening at once and I can't help but to not care.If this review felt like a mess, this movie is worse.And the worst thing is, everything, every single sub plot, every single cliffhanger left in this movie, every teaser and easter egg, is just build up for a sequel that will never happen. Again, why should I care about what's going on if it doesn't mean anything in the end? As for a movie with nothing going on while everything is going on, this movie is just really really really not good. I detest this movie. It is personally the worst movie of all time.","5 out of 24 found this helpful.

But yesterday evening, when i started to watch this movie, after 30 minutes, i was so disappointed for everything i saw. This new Spidey, Andrew Garfield is really bad actor, he also doesn't look interesting, he doesn't wake up any emotions when i see his acting and also Emma Stone for sure not suit in serious roles, because she is same time overacting and looks like semi-dirty hooker. For her, only suitable movie-roles is comedy roles for example ""Easy-A"" etc.IN Spider-Man movies (NOT ""The Amazing Spider-Man"") Tobey Maguire as spidey was perfect choice to be spidey. Nerd guy, who looks credible in his part (funny, serious, emotional). But of course all good comes to the end and writers/producers destroyed Spider-Man-trilogy with Tobey Maguire goofy and insane dancing and filled those movies with cliché after cliché. And when you compare Willem Dafoe's and James Franco acting to TASM2... well, they did theirpart as villains perfectly. Dane DeHaan is just ridiculously bad actor. He is in my top 5 worse and most annoying actors in DC comic movies.I have to ask, what is happened for the audiences? Why people rank these movies so high in IMDb?!? Have you really lost your capability to rate acting, script, twists, overall story etc. If you look this TASM2 again with time and focus on actors, script and everything else, you have to see and understand that these new spidey-movies has bad script and story, terrible actors, for example Dane DeHaan, who looks like discount young Leonardo DiCaprio IN VERY ANNOYING way and takes overacting to completely new level. DeHaan and especially his ""acting"" is so annoying, that when i see his face, i wanted to punch him and stop watching this film. Only actor who makes decent work is of course Jamie Foxx as Electro, but WHY he had to be some kind of cliché GOOFY-CRAZY genius? WHY!?!? We have seen this so many times, and it never suits for these highly talented and spectacular actors. I just have to ask, why he couldn't be just talented, intelligent and genius lab-rat (Bruce Banner/Edward Norton style), who became Electro after accident. Why they need to make Jamie Foxx look like retarded-monkey?!? Fight scenes was boring, and also new Rhino is ridiculous. To destroy one of the most interesting super-villain in Spidey movies they had to made him as machine, not monster-mutation as he is in cartoons. What else?!I don't accept that these highly hyped and over 100 million budget movies are made as bad as TASM2. I hope they launch one more time new Spidey-concept and this time they choose real actors and makes perfect story etc. This movie was just BIGGEST disappointment and only made to cash out money as much as possible((","6 out of 31 found this helpful.

After going out of the movie I realized that this is my favorite Spider-Man film (Spider-Man 2 was close), the reason for that is that while the movie is far from perfect it showed me what I wanted to see. The movie was kind of rush and you can easily tell that Sony just try to hurry up to get the sinister six film, but thanks to perfect acting from Andrew, Emma, Dane, and Jamie and perfect directing and writing from Marc Webb and some really beautiful looking shots and CGI (although some of the CGI looked like it's out of a video game), all those stuff save this movie from falling like a Spider-Man 3 and while the movie could have been way better as a Spider-Man and comic books fan that was good enough for me.","18 out of 41 found this helpful.

The special effects were outstanding,but with this type of film,you would expect nothing less.And although it is laden with special effects,I thought this was a very character driven movie,with some wonderful actors. I think Andrew Garfield is a very good actor,and I am so looking forward to him giving a performance as good as he did in Boy A(2007).I was impressed with Dane Dehaan(who reminded me of a young Leonardo Dicaprio)and I will have to check out some more of his films this weekend.Jamie Fox made a very good villain.I was wary when I heard there was going to be three villains in the film,but it works very well.Shame we have to wait till 2016 for the next spider man film,but I do hope they keep the same director,Marc Webb on board,he is another talent to keep an eye on.","18 out of 41 found this helpful.

However, this movie does not do the hero and comics justice. I believe it was a waste of money because of all the plot mistakes it had. From simple things like Electro not wearing a costume and instead being made of electricity to messing up characters and making them the wrong villains. The ""impressive"" cgi was really nothing special and took away from the one thing that makes Spider-man movies fun to watch; the web-swinging. There are only two three second burst of seeing Spidey doing his sky-high parkour and they consist of him swinging to the roof of another building before it cuts to more bad plot. (i.e Harry going power crazy) Lastly, the acting is obviously bad, with Garfield's imitation of a New York Teen being very stereotypical and sometimes hinders some of Spider-Man's best quotes. This movie was obviously a ploy to earn quick money by Sony. Please sell the royalties to someone else.","6 out of 32 found this helpful.

I saw it 5 times, I really love this movie. I want to act in this movie, I like Spider-Man since a little child. Andrew Garfield is the right play role for Spider-Man he act very good and very powerful. Electro was good creature in Spider-Man. Next Spider-Man should have some new creatures and more powerful creatures. Spider-Man is for all ages. Many people say that the spider-man is just the same, the same story, he fight with some creatures and then you know that he will win. He will stay alive. I don't agree with that. I think that every Spider-Man has different story. But to see that different story, you have to look inside the movie.","22 out of 52 found this helpful.

Electro went from loving Spiderman to hating him in like, a second for absolutely no reason. The movie was two and a half hours long and I felt like tons of it was unnecessary. Shaky-cam was almost constant in the action scenes. Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker get back together and break up so many times it made my head spin.

"10","/10","Extremely satisfying!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3011379/?ref_=tt_urv","Hellmant","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15977902/?ref_=tt_urv","7 May 2014","'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2': Five Stars (Out of Five)Big budget sequel to 2012's 'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN' (which is a reboot to director Sam Raimi's film trilogy, released in 2002 through 2007). It's once again directed by Marc Webb and stars Andrew Garfield as the popular Marvel Comics character. Garfield's real life girlfriend Emma Stone also returns as Peter Parker's main squeeze Gwen Stacey. Scenes were shot introducing Shailene Woodley as his other main love interest, from the comics, Mary Jane Watson (but they were cut in a decision to save that character for a later film). Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan and Paul Giamatti all play new villains in the movie and Sally Field, Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz return as members of the Parker family. The screenplay was written this time around by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner and James Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt also co-wrote the last Spider-Man movie and Krutzman and Orci are known for co-writing lots of popular sci-fi flicks (like the first two installments in the 'STAR TREK' reboot series and 'TRANSFORMERS' franchise). This installment is meant to setup not only two more planned sequels (in the next four years) but two spinoffs as well ('VENOM' and 'SINISTER SIX'). I found it to be immensely entertaining and (being a huge fan of the characters) extremely satisfying as well! As the film opens Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man (Garfield), is taking down a Russian mobster known as Aleksei Sytsevich (Giamatti). In the process he rescues a nerdy and extremely insecure OsCorp electrical engineer, named Max Dillon (Foxx), who becomes a huge fan of his for it. This is all on his way to his own high school graduation, in which he misses his girlfriend Gwen Stacy's (Stone) speech. Due to his constant guilt, over a promise he made her dead father (Denis Leary), Gwen brakes up with him. Parker then continues to fight crime while stalking Gwen, dealing with his Aunt May (Field) constantly pestering him and further investigating what really happened to his parents. At the same time Max has an accident at OsCorp that turns him into an electrically charged supervillain and Peter's old friend Harry Osborn (DeHaan) returns to Manhattan to see his dying father (Chris Cooper). Things get really messy when Harry learns that Spider-Man's blood might be the only thing that can save him from his father's same fate.The movie has received a lot of mediocre to negative reviews from critics but has mostly been praised by comic book fans of the character. I never read the comics regularly but I've always been a big fan of the superhero (due to his relatability) and this movie is everything I would want from a Spider-Man flick (I've heard that it's the most faithful of the entire franchise as well). I thought the filmmakers did a really good job of developing each character (as well as their drama) and all the actors are great in their roles. Giamatti's villain isn't developed at all but he's not supposed to be (he's just introduced as setup for a later installment/spin off). Foxx does something comedic with his role, at first, (that's kind of reminiscent to what his former fellow castmate on 'IN LIVING COLOR', Jim Carrey, did in 'BATMAN FOREVER') but he turns into a really frightening and equally sympathetic bad guy as well. DeHaan continues to bare a striking resemblance to Leonardo DiCaprio and he shows a lot of talent while doing so. It's Garfield that really shines though; he is the perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he and Stone do have awesome chemistry together. Webb's direction is cool, the script is clever and well thought out and the action scenes and visual effects are to die for! I really loved Raimi's first two 'SPIDER-MAN' movies but Webb's films (so far) are equally as impressive. I can't see why any fan of the character or film franchise wouldn't be more than thrilled with this installment.

But these days, CGI effects have become a routine and basic element of any action movie. Hollywood simply forgot how to make movies in a natural environment. It's so easy now - just put a group of 3D artists in a room, and they will do any movie for you in a short period of time with almost no expenses. There is even no need for good acting, the CGI effects will completely suppress good scenario, good acting, everything that once had values in cinematography. The tendency of Hollywood production is very clear - brainless, saturated with impressive CGI effects films, just to brainwash the audience. The modern audience like it because the majority of the modern generation does't want to think, to focus, to feel something, just relax with the bucket of popcorn and keg of coke. Watching such movies like Amazing Spider-Man 2 allows easily to browse and chat in the Facebook during the show. That's what the Hollywood ideologists want to do with the modern and future generation. This is how they see their own nation. And now we see the rating for this terrible movie - 7.5! I think Coppola and Spielberg rest already. Seriously, if you don't want to loose the great American nation in the nearest future, you should do something with this extremely low-quality flood; even censorship in this case, as a last resort, may work well.","6 out of 34 found this helpful.

Action. Adventure. Fantasy.Is indisputably the most misleading genre description of any movie I've ever seen. (to be fair I, like millions of others went in expecting the same).The Tags of this movie should read more like..Epic Romance. Drama. Tragedy.with sub genres of action, adventure, comedy.I a closeted Rom-com lover but AP2 has the kind of romantic background score, and dramatic pauses , which are not to be found even in chick Rom-Com's like Notting Hill.The romance is neither cute nor funny and is always laced with a hint of heaviness that everyone who's ever been in any doomed relationship will feel.And the drama, ooohhhhh the drama if the romance wont bring you to tears .... We have the fact that each and every character in this movie can be described as.... sad. borderline demented. disturbed. confused.suffering, or more likely a combination of the above.As for tragedy, those who know spider-man know what I'm talking about (but wait there's more), and for the others ...take my word there are multiple tragic elements to be found.Each and every character who has more than 5 minutes of screen place in this movie can be seen crying including the villains, bringing me to tears for watching this movie (not in a good way).Technically , there's a lot of hamming (and not in the cool way of the earlier batman movies), the special effects are to the high standards of todays blockbusters, and the background score and music is good for the genres that I believe this movie should fall under.A few may like the various directions in which comic-book movies are heading, but give me the less complicated fun of Thor, Iron Man and The Avengers any day.-s lots of hamming, misleading genres.+/-s drama, high promises from the sequel.+s stellar cast, great special effects (IMAX 3D hmmm), Emma Stone yummy.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I am just too tired of criticisms. (though I still would've loved it even if Sony would've let go of the rights and give it to Marvel, where it rightfully belongs, then we could see Spiderman together with the Avengers).ANYWAYS!! I gave this a 10 because I love Spiderman!!! And this is me sending up my gratitude to Marc Webb for trying his best as well as for the realistic chemistry and portrayal of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.However... Like every other movie, this one has flaws. Electro being a villain is simply has not enough history as to why he became that bad and hateful. Spiderman didn't do anything to him (even saved his life). All I'm saying is maybe it's not enough to want fame and be recognized to be as hateful as Electro. And too much CGI! I didn't even recognized Jamie Foxx in that scenes. Maybe it will be better if they made Jamie Foxx a little recognizable under all that much effects.Another one is Harry Osborn. He just strutted to the movie. We don't know him and we are not even sure if he walked in at an appropriate time. If they wanted Green Goblin in the movie then they should've took Electro out. That way its all Spiderman vs GG. The timing for Harry's comeback isn't thought of carefully and it felt like it was rushed. They should've included some flashbacks of 10-year-old Peter and Harry so we could see the real connection between the two characters and we ought to know where Harry came from.This is just my opinion though.I bawled my eyes because of Gwen's turnout. Oh well, it couldn't be helped because they all focused on ""sticking to the comics"". Maybe they shouldn't have and made their own twists and all that. Either ways, I can't think of watching another sequel of this ""The Amazing Spiderman"" set if Emma Stone is out of the picture. I couldn't even imagine Andrew being paired up with another girl, because Emma portrayed Gwen very well and both of them have this undeniable chemistry that you don't see in any other movie. Pairing Andrew's Spiderman with another character/actress is just GAHHH!!!","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

Rhino, well yet another pointless addition to the movie as he was only in it for about 3 minutes.The other 2hrs were spent with Peter Parker trying to decide whether he should date the woman he loved, there was far too much of this and not enough action, when will movie directors make a Spiderman film that focuses on the action and not the love interests of Peter Parker.You only need to see that in Spiderman 3, which had Venom in it, Venom was again not seen enough in that movie.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

People love to point out the flaws in everything and tick off the points from a 5/5 rating until you get a semi-decent score which reflects that you liked the movie but you have higher taste and don't want to waste your appraisal on so clear an action-superhero movie. These ''people'' i so so name are most of the movie critics you read about on the internet or watch on TV. I spit on them and their ''taste''. I loved the movie, it was a mixture of comedy and pure awesome moments to make even the crankiest of movie goers swoon. Now I'm not saying it was the best movie ever made or that it had no flaw, but I'm just saying that we keep underrating everything we love in hopes for something better to come along. Because if we admit that something is so joyous and amazing, it leaves the hope for all future prospects bleak and dim. Like a faint future. But in doing so we disable our ability to appreciate what we have, I am putting a stop to that and rating this movie a 10/10, because thats how much I enjoyed it. F*** the taste, F*** the class. This movie had both and it's time for the critics to open their eyes a little and expand their mind beyond movies regarding physically disabled poor and down trodden men and women fighting against race and poverty based on a true story in the middle of a war with a tragic rape scene somewhere in the middle. Those movies are special in their own way, but so is Spiderman 2, and even when I'm old i may very well show this movie to my kids and there's not a damn thing anyone can do about it.","16 out of 37 found this helpful.

It seems like every tween/ teen movie has to have some tortured love affair, that isn't really tortured at all, but is made to be by the overly dramatic and emotional protagonists who create all their drama. Just because they have to be agonized over something. So, the story line is dumb. Just dumb. Not too much thinking involved here whatsoever on any kind of level. I mean. They didn't even try to sound smart. Characters, dumb. They didn't even try to make them realistic or cool at all. Just a bunch of unnessesary drama.. And exaggerated emotional response. Like a Soap Opera . But at the movies. The Villains are usually good in these big budget air headed cinema fast food, but even Electro let me down. Spider-Man / Peter Parker is just an obnoxious and arrogant kid, played well by whoever played him.. Just not appealing. At all. His girlfriend, same. Just another really skinny blonde girl in a movie .. No charisma. At all. I'm figuring these two must've known somebody or be related to someone to have landed these parts at all. Both not bad actors, just nothing else.. And I didn't want to stare at them. The script is irritating , juvenile, and overly confident, bordering on arrogant for all of it's mindless fluff. Don't watch this movie if you've taken high school science.. I know, I know, it's a fantasy; at least I believed Iron Man. That is essentially the problem with this movie.

Too much drama, quite a few nonsensical scenes and too little action for an action movie. Key word: action. Been some time since i last took two smoke breaks while watching an action movie. People say the cast was great. Maybe. As in names. But the acting was wooden. Struggled. It just wasn't there. On top of that, if i ever want to go on a diet, i would put a poster of Andrew Garfield on my fridge and whenever i see his face i will instantly loose all appetite. That's one ugly fella. But that's just me.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I felt the reboot done a couple years ago left too many things open, but I was very hopeful for the sequel. Boy does it deliver, and has passed every single other Spider-Man on my list. This, to me(for now), is my favorite movie in the entire Spider-Man line of movies. It has amazing action, great acting, and it has some balls that a lot of superhero movies don't have. I was very leary going in that it would be like Spider-Man 3 with the Sandman and Venom, where it would have too much going on with the different villains. But even with the Green Goblin, Electro, and Rhino, this movie is not overstuffed. It all works and all makes sense. I really like where the story goes and where it's heading. Andrew Garfield to me, IS Spider-Man now. His chemistry with Emma Stone is fantastic. Jamie Foxx was great as Electro, BUT, it felt way too cartoony. Reminded me a lot of Jack Nicholson when he turned into the Joker in the original Batman movie. Dane Dehaan is one of my favorite young actors and is a great pick to play the Goblin. He reeks of rich and evil, and does it perfectly. The movie has some flaws, but overall this is a very entertaining and continues the story perfectly. Great way to start the Summer movie season. The future of the franchise is VERY bright.Watching The Amazing Spiderman 2 Full movie online visit http://gg.gg/amazing2","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

If you're like me you'll probably have to see this for yourself anyway...and I understand! But PLEASE see the amazing Captian America: The Winter Soldier first!I like the Spider-Man character, I liked Sam Rami's Spider-Man 1, loved 2, 3, and Amazing 1. I've loved the animated Spectacular Spider-Man and the 90's animated show (at least at the time). And I've loved the graphic novels...I certainly WANTED to like this despite the reviews, but...wow.It's not 90's (live action) ""Batman"" horrific, but Electro could have stepped straight out of those. I winced every time he was on screen...he's that bad, and doesn't feel like he comes from the same universe as anything else in this film, or any other Marvel related film. INCREDIBLY poorly written and acted...I'll trust that the acting isn't Jamie Foxx's fault, that he's just doing what they told him to do, but it's truly horrific. After writing that I realized actually the other...villains are either bad, or really terrible too.Not every moment is a disaster. I'm sure everyone will have some fun here and there, but I don't even think Emma Stone nor Andrew Garfield were that good here. They have way too little screen time together, and when they do it's mostly the same mumbled conversation over and over again. There are chunks of the film where Peter and Gwen could have been together, going through the motions of the plot TOGETHER, so at least they'd have more screen time and you'd see them having a relationship.Going in to this film I was baffled how Sony thought they could spin off much from it. The ONLY Spider-Man spin off I'd actually like would be a May Parker (i.e. his daughter from the alternate Marvel 2 universe). Would love to see her on the big screen (if it was WELL WRITTEN), but I have no desire to see a bunch of bad guys teaming up. Now that I've seen it, I have even LESS desire. The bad guys in this ranged from bad and rushed to embarrassing...more often cringe inducing.They want to spin this off but they haven't come remotely close to making the core Spider-Man film work...If this is the best Sony can do with it, I wish the rights would revert to Marvel. As it is, I'm worried the VASTLY superior Marvel films actually made by Marvel are going to be damaged by having this around.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

The action sequences are breathtaking and despite the running time, the film doesn't drag. Garfield and Stone, in the scenes where they are together, have a palpable chemistry. This Spider-Man serves up both pathos and power. The performances, story-line and pacing of the film are great, but what really sets it apart is the direction, choreography of the action sequences and the next level visual effects. The film is a well written, true to the comics, adaptation of one of one of Marvel's on the ground soldiers. Fans of the first movie, and superhero movies in general should definitely go for this one. PS: There's an ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" scene at the end of the movie you wouldn't want to miss.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

I'll admit it had some pretty cool action sequences but that just isn't enough for a movie.The cast in this movie is not the best, the Green Goblin is played by some feminine boy, and Electro played by Jamie Foxxx is not good at all. The transition of scenes are also terrible as they just shift from one scene to another, talking about something new. There's hardly any real build up of the characters as well. The acting isn't bad, but whoever directed it needs more work on his skills, because everything is badly placed.

The visuals and audio are stunning, to the point where you can practically feel pleasure by watching it. You could be forgiven for thinking that it can feel corny at times, but to me, they embraced the super hero feel to the point where you either reject it, or let it consume you and pull you along completely. I was pulled in. Not only that, but the action sequences are not in-your-face, like other movies. They took some of the tiniest elements and expanded them in an elaborate dynamism that is truly hard to match, and will never truly be overcome because this is the pinnacle of movie-making. Many of the scenes feel like Spider Man is in a stadium, performing for people, but the best part is that the action sequences get chopped up and slowed down to show everyone's personalities, which simply pulls you in even further. It's playful and enormously entertaining. Some people have criticized the constant music that plays in the movie, but again, if you just let yourself go and get into the movie, it pulls you along and gets you emotionally invested. The whole movie feels like an grand symphony. What else can I say about it? Incredible, just incredible. It is hard to explain, you just need to experience it.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

I,ll start with the cons . Okay the movies pacing a better than its predecessor , but still it moves from being fast as heck to being slow too much . Next the movie is a bit crowded with characters and subplots . Now on too the pros first the movie has great performances , except for Paul giamatte he just acts like a goof ball . Andrew is amazing and Emma stone is great . Jamie Foxx really makes you feel for max but it loses its sympathy once he gets lost in the 1,000 plots . Dane dehann in my opinion did an amazing job , that kid can act . He be pathetic and terrifying at the same time . Sally field is great and Chris cooper has one scene as Norman and his presence is chilling . Next the film has unique tone i thought , the movie has some really funny moments i enjoyed , there kinda awkward though . But the movie also has this very dark drama in it . And in my opinion it balances well , although i think the drama outweighs the humor . Next the directing by Marc Webb is solid enough , im surprised he was able to cram this much into the movie . The action scenes are top notch . They are much more exciting than the first films . The score by hanz zimmer is very contemporary but amazing , it fits what they were going for very much . And it doesn't feel all generic and uninspired like horners score for the last film . Over all i loved the amazing spider man 2 , even though it feels a bit bloated its still very good . I've seen terrible super hero films (steel,superman 4, cat women , and batman and robin .) this isn't bad by any means in my opinion .","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Andrew Garfield, one the most intriguing young actors around, and Emma Stone, that old-school sassy and husky-voiced beauty who effortlessly charmed in Easy A (2010), were an almost dream couple, and their romantic scenes sparkled with chemistry. But when Garfield put on his costume and went spinning webs across the city, the film owed everything to Raimi's eye for crazy, energetic camera-work, and failed to thrill enough as a re-imagining in it's own right. Raimi's influence seemed unshakeable.Yet the film was a success, and two years later we have a sequel. The story moves on and Peter Parker (Garfield) has grown too, though he is still caught up in a reluctant relationship with Gwen Stacy (Stone), having been warned by her dying father at the end of the last movie to leave her out of his superhero business. After apprehending a criminal named Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) who was trying to run away with some plutonium vials, he saves nervous young Oscorp worker Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), who becomes infatuated with Spider-Man, believing them to have a special friendship. Parker's old friend and Oscorp inheritor Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) is also back in town, and learns that his dying father's illness is hereditary.With the first having shared so much with the original trilogy, it's surprising that Webb and the writers have made the same mistakes as the one that killed Raimi's baby in it's tracks. Thankfully, there's no emo Peter Parker dance scene, but there is an over-abundance of villains. Okay, Giamatti's Rhino barely registers (thankfully), but Jamie Foxx's Electro and DeHaan's emerging Green Goblin battle for screen time, and DeHaan is far too exciting an actor to feel like he's being squeezed in. Having watched Marvel's Avengers dominate the box-office, Sony are clearly starting to set-up something bigger, but they do so at the expense of the film at hand.In fact, there's an over-abundance of everything. With a hefty running time of 140 minutes, the amount going on in the film should justify it's length. But Parker spends most of his time being angry at his parents for being dead, similar to the angst done better last time around, and his plucky conversations with on-off girlfriend Gwen soon loose their charm and quickly become annoying. The action scenes, although they look beautiful in hi-definition as Electro causes havoc, suffer from seen-it- all-before syndrome, and some of the dialogue spouted by Giamatti especially, caused me to worry that Joel Schumacher had perched his a**e back on the director's chair. It's sporadically fun but mainly just a bore, but I fully expect a third instalment to turn up in two year's time.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.co.uk","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Saving the city is still easy for him though. After Norman, the head of Oscorp dies and his son Harry is forced out villain after villain is created and Spider-man faces threats both physically and emotionally. I have to begin be saying that I have never been a big Spider-man fan. When it comes to comic book movies I like the darker ones like Batman and the newest X-Men series. To me Spider-man has always been a little too angsty and cheesy for me. This movie did nothing to change my view. This movie dealt more with the relationship between Gwen and Peter then Spider-man vs. bad guys. For some people that may be OK but I am also not a fan of teenage love- dramas. Jamie Foxx was good in this as usual but he also seemed wasted, like they just wanted a big name actor for a bad guy and he was put into a role beneath his talent. My biggest complaint was the main reason I wanted to see this was for Paul Giamatti. He is one of the best and most underrated actors around today. Not to spoil anything but he is in the movie for about 3 minutes total. Car chase in the beginning and a scene at the end that served no other purpose then to set up a third movie. All that said though I again am not a Spider-man fan. If you like him you will like this movie, if you don't then like me you probably won't. Overall, a cheesy comic book movie that was basically Gwen and Peter break up, Spider-man scene, they get back together, Spider-man scene, they break up, Spider-man scene...over and over. To me this was just long and hard to care about. I do think that fans will love this though. I give this a C+.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Not only was the film full of incredible action packed scenes, its humor, wit and charm, particularly with regards to Garfield's portrayal of the beloved superhero, makes this film a must see.'The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Rise of Electro', begins with Peter Parker and his love interest Gwen Stacey (played by Emma Stone) graduating from High School, with Gwen receiving the prestigious Honor of valedictorian.Cracks begin to appear however, as Peter struggles with the promise he made to Gwen's deceased father, that is, to leave her alone, ultimately keeping her safe from all the dangers that come with Peter being Spider-Man.This battle between his head and heart, paired with the pressures of balancing his ordinary life as Peter Parker, with that of his extraordinary life as Spider-Man, means things get a little complicated for the superhero.Not to mention that fact he now faces two new and terrifying villains in Electro (played by Jamie Foxx) and friend turned foe Harry Osborn aka The Green Goblin (played by Dane DeHaan).The internal struggles that Peter faces with regards to his past is also magnified throughout the film, particularly as we learn more about Peter's father and the mysterious company Oscorp. Andrew Garfield and Emma stone's in 'the amazing spider-man 2'.All of the performances given by the lead cast were consistently strong and impressive. Jamie Foxx was almost unrecognizable, and to be honest a little frightening, as villain Electro, while Dane DeHaan brought a real sinister edge to his character the Green Goblin.Garfield's portrayal of Parker/Spider-Man however, was my favorite. His comedic timing and clever wit was heartwarmingly genuine, which when paired with his adorable demeanor and charm makes you want to melt (well for the ladies that is).A special mention must also be made with regards to the on screen chemistry between Garfield and Stone. The sparks between these two were truly electrifying (pun intended).Marc Webb did a fantastic job with directing this film, and his deliberate foreshadowing of what to expect in the next film made for a real cliffhanger.All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would definitely recommend it. However if you are unfamiliar with the Spider-Man story/franchise, I suggest watching the first film before this, otherwise you may be a little lost.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

Jamie Fox's part - due to the script/acting ability or both - was ludicrous. I shut this film off after 15 minutes of viewing. One of the top 10 worst films I've seen in years. As per my earlier comment - even when I was 10 - I would have walked out of the theater in this case. Something must have happened at the executive studio levels to completely ruin a film with this much capital and resources behind it. Getting rid of Tobey Maguire was a fatal error.","5 out of 31 found this helpful.

We get so much information concerning the Peter Parkers' parents (I don't think that saying this is a spoiler). I was really glad that they included this part as the first movie left us confused about what Peter's father had really done. But after that the movie quickly deteriorates into one stupid action sequence after another interspersed with an annoying love story between Peter and Gwen. It's really too bad because Gwen was a decent unobtrusive character is the first movie but in this movie you really want her to go away. There were a few good things Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn. The introduction of Harry Osborn could have been better as I think his story was really rushed. I have mixed feelings about Jamie Fox's Electro, he certainly is much less annoying as Electro than the stupid Max character. All in all this movie is just average just like many of the sequels have been. On another note I really think we're getting into superhero saturation, too many movies with the same plot over and over, enough already.","3 out of 15 found this helpful.

"10","/10","A solid movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2999881/?ref_=tt_urv","johnboyjunior","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30456642/?ref_=tt_urv","17 April 2014","As someone who really enjoyed the first Amazing Spider-man movie I was really looking forward to this and I can safely say its a good movie, not brilliant but good.The movie opens by showing us what happened to Peters parents after they left him with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben.The first glimpse we get of spider-man is as he is free falling through the air in response to the sounds of sirens chasing after a hijacked truck carrying highly radioactive materials. The CGI is incredible and Spider-man has never looked better. Although the actual chase scene isn't anything you haven't seen before. There are some quite funny moments with Spidey trying to collect vials in the back of a moving truck being driven by Paul Giamatti and Peter talking to Gwen on the phone.Speaking of, Paul Giamatti is awful. Miscast would be an understatement, he is utterly terrible. He is over the top and his accent his ridiculous. I predict a Razzie nomination for him in this role. Thankfully his role is very minimal. Which surprised me, as I was expecting Rhino to play a larger part.Jamie Fox doesn't quite fit here either. He plays an Oscorp employee who just wants people to take notice of him and develops a slight infatuation with Spider-man after he saves him. There is a very cringe inducing scene where Jamie Fox's character has an imaginary conversation with Spider-man. It actually reminded me of Jim Carey's rather over the top portrayal of Edward E. Nigma in Batman Forever. Im not sure which is worse.The main draw of this movie is Peter and Gwen and their relationship. If you're a comic fan like myself then you'll know why this relationship is important.Peter is still trying to keep the promise he made to Gwen's father by staying out of her life to protect her from his enemies. The scenes between Peter and Gwen really stand out thanks to the amount of chemistry these two share on screen. Their scenes are playfully intimate and really succeed in portraying the love they have for each other.Dane Dehaan plays Harry Osborne, a once childhood friend of Peter's who was shipped off to boarding school while they were still young and returns to New York for family reasons. Dane Dehaan is great in this role and its shame he wasn't introduced in the first movie as he takes a bit of a back seat to Jamie Fox's character for a large part of the movie.There are some truly great moments in this movie from Spideys battles with Electro to a scene showing Peters loneliness through the changing of the seasons. I would of liked more of Dane Dehaan as Harry and the Green Goblin as it feels like Electro was shoehorned in to keep this movie from feeling like a rehash of Sam Raimi's first Spider-man movie with the Green Goblin.I enjoyed the movie but hope the next one can focus more on the characters that matter rather than trying to cram in as many new ones as possible.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Andrew Garfield is a perfect actor to play the Spiderman role and they were wrong to replace him for Tom Holland. Andrew could really bring out the true colors and emotions that Peter Parker had and it was an amazing job! The movie is too harshly criticized and there should be an Amazing Spiderman 3 with Andrew Garfield. Though the plots lines are a bit twisted and unique for what would have been the next two movies, the edge that was put into these versions of Spiderman from the three previously played by Toney Maguire. I would much rather watch Andrew Garfield play the wall-crawler than Toney Maguire and Tom Holland combined. I desperately want the movie producers to worry more about the quality of the actor and movie than how much money they're getting. Aren't you rich enough already?! I want Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield to play their original roles of Gwen Stacey and Peter Parker. The duo made the movie that much better. If you were so worried about the actor, why give him the role? Don't change out Andrew Garfield just because Amazing Spiderman 2 made $4 000 000 instead of $10 000 000. Those aren't the exact numbers, but don't fire an amazing actor who plays the role of an iconic superhero perfectly.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Stone and Garfield blow McGuire and Dunst out of the water in terms of believability, acting, charm and just overall watch-ability. These movies are also more serious in tone and darker than the originals. After seeing this sequel, it just solidifies this as the better series by a mile IMO. I'm not sure how most people can still argue it. McGuire was such a mopey faced, pathetic spiderman, where as Garfield plays the role perfectly showing cockiness at times, emotion, struggle... Elektro surprised me... I thought he would be horribly overdone and laughable from the previews. But, I thought his scenes were great and he was a pretty powerful adversary to Spiderman in the film. The Green Goblin was fleshed out much better in this film as compared to the originals also. No stupid metal Halloween costume this time around. It was legit, real, and very dark. Well done.Stone and Garfield carry the movie with their amazing chemistry, though. I know they're dating in real life and I""m sure that really helps, but these 2 just really click every moment they share the screen. It really gives the movies heart... I've said it all along that the relationship in the movie is just so much better than Spidermans and Mary Janes in the first. In that movie, it was so clichéd with Mary Jane only taking an interest in Parker once he developed the Spiderman traits and humiliated her star QB boyfriend. This relationship is so much more believable and better acted.There were a few things that kept this movie from being completely perfect. They needed to develop Max a little better before he became Elektro to make us care about the character a little more. He was great as Elektro, not so great as the pathetic Max. Paul Giamati (A great talent) was really bad as Rhino(although for a VERY small portion), they could have left him out of this movie. I don't understand the harshness about too many villains?? Rhino was literally in the movie for 10 minutes maybe, and never perceived as a major villain... Green Goblin comes in at the very end and ties everything together IMO. He also brings some good emotion and surprise from his scene that really give this movie the emotional punch towards the end and even makes it better a whole. Perfect? No, but pretty damn good!... Bad like some people are saying? Just crazy..Hands down better than the originals, and one of the best Spidermans to date","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

No one's going to read mine. So I can say what I want. It's very freeing really..OK. I was disappointed. I can qualify that by saying that I wasn't expecting realism or depth of story or anything. I was expecting bad animation, comic-book style fighting scenes, cgi everywhere.Hey! I got it. Right? So why didn't I enjoy the film? Mostly because the rushjob that this movie considered ""character development."" Almost every character in the movie was very shallow and behaved like a child. You have the characters who change their minds at the drop of a hat. At least two of them were like, ""I love you spider man! Unless you disappoint me, then I will MAKE YOU MY NEMESIS AND HATE YOU TO MY GRAVE!"" The flip-flops were almost dizzying. It was very elementary school. You know, this person is your friend one day and then not the next. Kids pick and choose their friends rather easily and honestly, but adults usually practice the art more subversively.Then you have the character of spider man himself. I think it's worth noting that Peter Parker was originally envisioned as a fairly normal fellow, maybe a little bit shy. You know, the classic nerd who becomes a man through somewhat extra-normal means. It's a well used cliché and people identify with it because everyone feels like the shy nerd sometimes.But in this film, the spiderman was not a shy little nerd. No, he's a talky teen, a ladies man, full of himself, with snarky comments for everyone. I actually have no problem with this, I found the change rather interesting. I'm just mentioning it because it is different.Overall, I feel that the movie was made for teens. It has precious little appeal to mature adult audiences, even those who grew up with the comic books.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Or rather they captured it for the Millennial attitude rather than how Spider-Man has ever been written.In both Amazing Spider-Man movies, he mocks and openly ridiculous and belittles the people he's fighting. He bullies them from low rent thieves to the Big Bads.That isn't how Spider-Man has ever acted save for when he was possessed by Venom in the comics.True, he has always had a mouth on him, he's always been comical and run off at the mouth, but it's never been to belittle his opponent. Spider-Man has never been a bully.The depiction in these two reboots tend to take the sense of humor of the guy in high school that shoved nerds into lockers.There is a marked difference in the attitude and humor portrayed in Garfield's Spidey and the more true to form Spider-Mans of both Tobey and Holland.There is a maliciousness here, in the Amazing Spider-Man movies that I just can not get behind as a fan of the character. He gloats when he takes down people weaker than him.It leaves a bad taste in the mouth and should for any loyal fan of the Web-Slinger both in the movies and in the comic books.","3 out of 17 found this helpful.

The action scenes did not have many kick- ass choreography, but that's because Spider-Man mainly uses strategies and shoots webs to fight his opponent. That was still pretty cool. The slow-motion scenes were a good addition too.I feel that the characters matured a lot from the first film, and that the actors/actresses grew more comfortable playing them. Spider-man (like Superman) is one of those heroes where their stories are mostly based on them juggling being a hero as well as a boyfriend, and this conflict was portrayed well by Garfield and Stone.Garfield's Spider-Man is known for being witty and making comedic remarks in the face of seriousness. His humour really adds to the character and makes him seem more human. Maybe that's why he wasn't included in The Avengers; because he's more human than the rest of them, and has had no proper training. Well, I hope they do include him in the next Avengers film, it would be so much more epic.One thing I did not quite like, was how there was more than one villain in this. It felt like it was building up to something with this one villain, and then a few others turn up. It just felt a bit rushed at the end. The other two villains had short screen times, but I guess they'll turn up in the third movie. But it also seemed so convenient that these villains would just appear. Like one bad encounter with Spider-Man and they would instantly turn into the bad guy. I don't know. Maybe that's how humans think, through recent events rather than the past.This film also showed quite a lot of background story and that helped me to understand more of what happened. That was a good touch. Many good touches in this film, and was pretty amazing overall. I cried twice throughout the movie. I don't know why, it's just the feels.Read the full review at championangels.wordpress.com","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

Some even say the cast wasted their talent, the truth is this movie divided Spider-Man fans, although most people liked it! I think it was a great movie, the introduction of Electro really moved towards the story, and now people are expecting the Sinister Six and Venom in the next movie! I also think the new Spider-Man suit is much better than the one in 2012, it's more like the one from the comics. In my opinion the movie had some influence from The Ultimate Spider-Man comics because of the design of Electro and the big eyes in Spider-Man's mask. About the story, it was good but not very solid, it had its gaps, but overall they managed to introduce 3 new villains and continue Peter Parker's story correctly. Acting was good, not great, I think Andrew Garfield is a great actor, he did very good. Jamie Foxx did good too, some people think he did bad, I think he played a unique character, a fanatic that felt betrayed by his hero. The movie introduced another important character which was Harry Osborn. This one looked more like the one from the comics comparing to James Franco in the trilogy, and I think he really mattered by being the Green Goblin, which looked better than I expected. The VFX were very well done, it looked really authentic, they made it look even better!

Having graduated High School and preparing for the next chapter in their lives, Gwen tires of Peter's indecisiveness regarding their relationship and breaks up with him. Matters are further complicated by the return of Peter's childhood friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), who has recently taken over the company from his terminally ill father, Norman Osborn (Chris Cooper), only to learn from his father's dying words the terminal disease consuming him will soon consume Harry. Matters are further compounded by Oscorp electrical engineer, Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), a meek, softspoken, self-described ""Nobody"", who develops an obsession with Spider-Man after being saved by him. Max had his ideas stolen by Oscorp and is routinely abused by the company and his co-workers and culminates and him having an accident involving electric creatures that turns him into an electric powered threat, Electro, driven by years of frustration and repressed anger. Now Peter must investigate his father's links to Oscorp while also squaring off against Electro, Harry Osborn's desire for Spider-Man's blood to cure his terminal illness, and Gwen Stacy's decision on whether she will leave for a scholarship to Oxford in England.In 2012, following breakdowns in discussions between Sam Raimi and Sony over Spider-Man 4, Sony successfully rebooted the franchise with director Marc Webb and star Andrew Garfield. While the movie didn't make as much as the film's in Raimi's Spider-Man series and was a step down from the grosses of Spider-Man 3, it was seen as a reasonably successful start to a new era on Spider-Man. However despite ending up as the 7th highest grossing film of the year there was a proverbial ""fly"" in Spider-Man's ointment so to speak with fellow blockbuster and superhero film, Disney/Marvel's the avengers which was the culminations of 4 years' worth of build up to result in a crossover of prior established characters Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and other ancillary characters from Iron Man 2 to result in a film that grossed $1.5 Billion worldwide. Wanting a piece of that emerging ""universe"" pie other studios attempted to follow suit on imitation with 20th Century Fox using their legacied X-Men series as a jumping off point for other spin-offs associated with the X-Men, Universal building a universe around their movie monsters, and of course Sony building a universe around its Spider-Man characters with Amazing Spider-Man 2 intended to lay the groundwork for not only forthcoming sequels but also a planned Sinister Six spin-off with a ""phased"" release plan similar to Marvel's MCU that would culminate in a Web Warriors crossover a la Avengers. Amazing Spider-Man 2 got mixed reviews from critics and saw a dip from revenues of its predecessor that were already down from the last Raimi movie and rather than risk building a universe on such a shaky foundation Sony opted to cancel the planned spin-offs and sequels which resulted in the unique ""sharing"" deal between Disney and Sony. Amazing Spider-Man 2 has a reputation as the worst Spider-Man film in some circles and it's honestly hard to disagree.The movie when it begins starts with a lengthy sequence focusing on Peter Parker's parents Richard and Mary Parker played by Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz respectively, and it leads into a lengthy action beat aboard a private jet that doesn't feature any new revelations or information that we didn't get later in the movie and could have been easily cut from the movie. We're then thrown into this elaborate chase with Russian mobster Aleksei Sytsevich played in an over the top performance from Paul Giamatti with Spider-Man late for graduation and lying to Gwen Stacy about where he is despite her knowing he's Spider-Man so he has no reason to and also seeing visions of Gwen Stacy's father George giving him disapproving looks that have since become memes. The action sequence is really overdone and with a lot of corny jokes and usage of the '67 cartoon Spider-Man theme on ringtones or in the background it feels like someone was directed to cram in elements from the Raimi films into the Webb films and it feels jarring in comparison to the previous film with the tone considerably more scattershot. The movie also uses Peter's visions of ""disapproving Dennis Leary"" as a contrived excuse to ratchet up ""will they, won't they"" drama that ending of the last film gave the impression they'd avoid so not a great impression.Then we have the villains. Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon is played the familiar archetype of abused ""meek"" nobody pushed too far that we've seen with Michelle Pfeifer's Selina Kyle in Batman Returns, Jim Carrey's Edward Nigma from Batman Forever, or Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian from Iron Man 3 down to the fact he has ""that scene"" where he's stumbling with a bunch of papers that scatter while mumbling to himself that you saw with those other three characters. Jamie Foxx doesn't feel at home with this character who's very broad in his portrayal down to the added gap in his teeth that looks incredibly unconvincing. But Dillon isn't our only antagonist as we also have the shadowy Oscorp conspiracy still going on as well as the arrival of Peter's long absent friend Harry Osborn who goes through the ""fast forward"" version of what took three movies for this character to do in the Raimi movies and it feels it. When Peter and Harry reunited it doesn't carry the weight it should because it's the first time we've seen Harry and we have no investment in him as a character or his relationship to Peter because we're only meeting him for the first time. Not only does the movie have to introduce Harry, but it has to give him the ticking clock of his terminal illness, re-establish his relationship with Peter while also straining it, setting up his conflict with Oscorp's board of directors, and finally turning him into a villain for Spider-Man.There are some good moments littered throughout the film such as the exchanges between Peter and Gwen that still have that charming chemistry that was present in the previous film and continues here. There's also a solid scene in the climax (technically second climax) involving Gwen Stacy that strikes the right emotional chords and is well set up. While the scene is a good isolated piece of filmmaking in the context of the movie, the rest of the movie leading up to it as well as the ending of the movie proper (that isn't even really an ending, it's half a fight sequence) doesn't give that feeling of closure and makes the film feel incomplete. The movie with its cluttered narrative due to needing to establish other characters and projects while rushing through its own plot is basically a repeat of the problems from Spider-Man 3 here's where the difference lies: Spider-Man 3 despite being a mess had elements of a great film that were suffocated by bloat, Raimi wanted to tell a story about revenge and forgiveness with Peter's grudge against Flint Marko and tying that into Harry's arc established over three films regarding his grudge against Spider-Man for the death of his father. Raimi tried to tell a story that was about something and was effectively crippled by Sony's insistence at having Eddie Brock because they desperately wanted their spin-off series. Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn't about anything, it's a mess of plotlines and hanging threads that go nowhere because they only lead to other movies and projects that don't and won't exist. The priority of Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn't to further Peter as a character, it's to spin its wheels while outlining more spin-offs and sequels.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has individual moments of the charm from the first film, but now stuffed to the gills with not only the initial Oscorp conspiracy background plot, but now several others the movie loses a lot of the appeal it created with the first movie in favor of bloated excess that isn't for justification of itself and instead justification for other films that ""might"" exist.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

If you are looking for a fun movie to go to, go see this.Most of the haters on this are the ones that are still bitter over the reboot and won't let the Raimi films go. Don't listen to the critics, they are just nitpicking, because that's what critics do.If you are going into this expecting a Dark Knight or an Avengers, this isn't for you. Spider-Man is a fun character and this movie is like a comic book come to life and it's a really fun time.I'd say go check this one out. It's a really good popcorn flick and it doesn't take itself too seriously most of the time. There are some darker scenes but again, that is what Spider-Man is. A lot of the things that happen to him are dark. I think the Raimi films lacked that aspect.This film isn't perfect, but out of all the Spider-Man films, I'd say that this is one of the better ones.

But something evil is lurking beneath the waters or should I say electricity. As we see our hero balancing life and staying away from the girl he loves, he is forced to make a choice between the one that he loves and the city that needs him the most.On the other side of things, an old friend comes back into Peter's life, Harry Osborn (DeHaan), whose father has just died of an incurable disease (which by the way is untreatable) and apparently genetic and it has gotten Harry as well. I don't want to spoil the movie for those of you who have not seen it yet, but I would bet my money on a third installment.This movie defied all odds against the original 2nd movie – no thanks goes to Willem Dafoe, James Franco, Alfred Molina – Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Dane DeHaan, Jamie Foxx, Paul Giamatti – and the incomparable and talented Sally Field gave the performance of their lives. This movie will go down in Marvel History as one of the greatest super hero movies of the 21st century.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

Green Goblin was also good, but wasn't given enough screen time. The Rhino was actually bad, because Aleksei Systevich is too loud and seems mad at times. The climax at the clock tower, which has already been revealed as a spoiler in many reviews, can be extremely intense and sad, and shouldn't have been done like that.

Not financially, of course - it did so well that the inevitable sequel is now in cinemas, just two years later, and a third film and spin-off are all currently in the works. But there was something missing in that first film in a new trilogy: a little of Peter Parker's soul, and a cohesive, streamlined plot that made full use of its cast's talent and chemistry. While hamstrung by a few of the same problems (notably: a painfully overstuffed story), The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is considerably more exhilarating and rewarding an experience - rich, dark, and brimming over with romance, thrills and emotion, this is really the movie that should have kickstarted a new franchise.Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is now a full-fledged superhero/vigilante, even as he struggles with his personal romantic dilemma: he's crazy in love with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), but promised her dying dad that he will stay away from her to keep her safe. As he tries to reconcile the conflict between his heart and his head, new threats emerge all around him. Lonely, love-starved Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) fixates on Spider-Man and believes them to be best friends - which becomes a problem when an industrial accident transforms Max into the literally electric Electro. At the same time, Peter's childhood buddy Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns home, suffering from a debilitating genetic disease that he's convinced can only be cured with a transfusion of Spider-Man's magic blood.As if that wasn't enough story to chew over, the film also dwells at length on Peter's history with his birth parents. We all know that Mr. and Mrs. Parker left young Peter with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) and never returned for him. Here, that fateful decision is explored more fully, as we come to understand how Richard Parker's (Campbell Scott) research is more intimately tied-up with his son's present and future than anyone knew. Frequently, the film feels as if it's bursting at the seams, its many narrative threads jostling for attention in a most frustrating way. It flits restlessly from the creepy adoration Max has for Spidey, through to Peter's need to fend off Harry's demands to meet his alter ego, before it morphs into the re-telling of his origin story. And it aims to set the stage for Sinister Six, the supervillain spin-off that Sony's already putting together. Frankly, none of it should work at all.The odd thing is how Webb manages to blend and elevate his big, clumsy chunks of story with some truly excellent character work. Ultimately, this film succeeds because it's tapped properly into the heart, soul and spirit of its title character: whether it be his cheeky wise-cracking in the face of mortal danger, or his deep, abiding love for Gwen and his steadfast Aunt May. Whenever The Amazing Spider-Man 2's over-abundance of story threatens to overwhelm, its delicate, heartbreaking web of relationships enable it to power on through. There are even some nice grace notes in his interactions with Max, who goes from adoring stalker to unhinged supervillain; and Harry, whose introduction into this particular franchise is oddly abrupt but kinda-works because of the chemistry between Garfield and DeHaan.Most winning of all is the tender, spiky and very affecting relationship between Peter and Gwen. The first film ended in an oddly downbeat and sour way, with Peter deciding to break his vow to Gwen's dying father to stay away from her. Fortunately, the sequel makes up for that strange lapse in character, allowing Peter to struggle with the morality of being with Gwen. It makes for a fascinating interplay between the two characters, as Peter tries repeatedly to avoid dragging Gwen into his super-charged life, while she insists on getting to make her own decisions and living every day on her own terms. It's nice to see a female character in a superhero film - especially one with no superpowers but her own personality and intelligence - take charge of her own destiny in so firm and unequivocal a way.In effect, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 really is entirely about the relationship between Peter and Gwen - watching the film makes it far easier to understand the decision to cut Shailene Woodley's Mary Jane Watson (the supposed real love of Peter's life) out of it. Her inclusion in an already overstuffed plot would have greatly distracted from the film's core themes of love, loss, sacrifice and fighting on in the face of devastating heartbreak. It's a good thing that the chemistry between Garfield and Stone is so off-the-charts fantastic - together, they lend the film an emotional depth and resonance, particularly in its spine- tingling and game-changing ending, that its predecessor sorely lacks.Truth be told, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn't a perfect superhero film. Objectively, it's trying to do too many things at once, and many would argue that it doesn't succeed on most counts. But, emotionally, the film works so well and so powerfully that it helps smooth over many of its narrative road-bumps. Add the heart and chemistry of its central relationship to some cracking action sequences and a final scene both enormously manipulative and effective, and this really does mark - finally - the very welcome return of everybody's friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man.","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

It was exciting to see the big chase scene in the opening sequence (that was filmed right here in Rochester, in front of the building I work in).But beyond that, the movie was a great follow-up to the first Amazing Spiderman. Spidey (Peter Parker) is still just a High School kid dealing with the loss of his father, the responsibility of being Spiderman and trying to fulfill the dying wish of Gwen's father to stay away from her to keep her safe.The action scenes were great and exciting and we really get to see Spidey grow as both a person and a superhero.Dane DeHaan portrays a chillingly creepy Harry Osbourne, who suffers from the same deadly disease that all of the Osbourne's have. He becomes obsessed with finding Spiderman, believing a cure to his sickness is in his blood.Jamie Foxx plays a very electric Electro.

It was funny, dramatic and had this action sequences that were mind blowing. I truly, truly loved it and even when i thought i hated it i Loved it.The fact that this one is based in the comic books gives the movie the best script, the real story of Peter Parker. I'm not saying that the other spider man movies were bad but they weren't true to the story, but the truth is, i never liked them. There's always gonna be people that say Tobey Maguire was better as Peter Parker but for me is not the case, i think Andrew Garfield is perfect he portraits the young conflicted and vulnerable Peter that makes Spider-Man a real human hearted hero.Andrew and Emma were so into their characters, they draw me into and I'm still into the spell.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Ignore the Critics; This is the Best Spidey Movie Yet.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3036193/?ref_=tt_urv","baragon94","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur43811113/?ref_=tt_urv","19 June 2014","It would be an understatement to say that I was never a fan of the Raimi films. Whether it was the lazy kidnap Mary Jane plots, William Dafoe in a Power Rangers outfit, a miscast Tobey Maguire, or Kirsten Dunst turning everything into a superhero soap-opera, I failed to understand the universal acclaim surrounding Raimi's first two movies (we shall not speak of the atrocious Spider-Man 3) in which the source material was largely abandoned for a more conventional movie approach.With Marc Webb's direction, we finally have a film that understands the essence of Spider-Man. Its predecessor in 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man was a fine effort, but with Peter now fully immersed in the role of Spider-Man, things get more interesting. There's plenty to love here, and fans of the comics will no doubt be pleased. The cast is outstanding; Andrew Garfield deserves an Oscar for ""Best Actor to Ever Portray a Superhero."" From his very first scene where he's knocking on the truck window of a Russian terrorist, the wisecracking nature of the Spidey we know and love from the comics is in full swing. Also returning from the previous film is Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, who once again provides dynamic chemistry with Garfield that is light years beyond Maguire/Dunst. The two of them shine on screen together and it's delightful to watch.Electro is clearly the main villain in the film, but it is Dane DeHaan who really steals the show as Harry Osborne. Desperate to save his life, he believes Spider-Man's blood is his only salvation to his deteriorating condition. And this is what makes his portrayal so intriguing; he's essentially a tragic villain spawned by desperation and we sympathize with him. Though his Green Goblin is largely set up for the next film, he is infinitely more menacing than Dafoe's campy portrayal, and generates excitement for the future of the franchise. Complaints of a bloated plot and an unfocused narrative have been common criticisms from film critics. This sequel picks up where the first movie left off on the origin story surrounding Peter's father, which is cool, how they've evolved the mystery of Peter's parents into an enticing back story. Meanwhile, we delve into Peter's trauma regarding the ghost of Gwen's father, his deteriorating relationships as a result of his responsibility in being Spider-Man, all while a slew of super- villains are served up by OsCorp (Well really only two). Sure, there is a lot going on, but some slight disorganization is certainly justified by the sheer level of ambition.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is everything I've ever wanted in a Spider-Man movie; it is the most faithful, thought invoking, and entertaining adaption to date of bringing the web-slinger to the big screen. The cast is phenomenal, the ambition is Dark Knight Rises caliber, and there's no shortage of heart; I was reduced to tears twice. Ignore the critics; this one is for the fans. And let's face it, we deserve it.","11 out of 27 found this helpful.

I fully expected Spider-man to go head-to-toe with Electro, Green Goblin, and the Rhino, as it seems to be so in the trailers. However, I was, unfortunately, mistaken I thought this movie was garbage. This is my sincere, personal opinion. I didn't like the first one too much, but this one was almost painful to watch. The cinematography and visual FX are quite stunning, although that's about the best thing there is.The entire movie seems like its a ""rough draft,"" so to speak. The story has potential to be great, but it's really not.The acting is generally sub-par, the writing is terrible, the character's circumstances are illogical (by this, I mean that the placement of certain characters at certain times does not make any sense), the story is too fragmented, there is WAY too much unnecessary dialogue, not enough action, and odd conflicts which do not usually make any sense.I do not believe that anyone should expect this movie to be ""amazing,"" and, although I thought it to be garbage, other people have enjoyed it, so if you feel inclined to give it a try, feel free to watch it.","4 out of 28 found this helpful.

I think it may've been helpful in just letting the story be absorbed. There's something about Marc Webb's storytelling that really hits the adolescent side of me. All the good parts of it. The first love. The lost love. He just is very tuned into the pain of that loss and the ability to move forward. That's how I felt about AMS2. This was an gentle rendition of this series that added a lot more character development in a storyline that is all too familiar. I really enjoyed that Garfield's Peter Parker is an authentic teen. He is trapped in a vortex of whether or not his desire in life can outweigh his responsibility. Something that echoes, without being overbearing, in the voice of his dead uncle. You get that he is a very haunted person.I feel, for the most part, this isn't really a comic book movie. It's got comic book characters. But it seems to be more a great drama. Very well done and a nice puzzle piece to the new rebooted series. Can't wait to see what's next.","11 out of 27 found this helpful.

The dialogs are boring and it feels that they are taken from a very bad intimation of twilight. the Two main Characters Emma Stone is a great actress but it seems that since the start of this movies her acting level has really gone down and that is coming from a fan.Her partner in life and crime which is this movie Andrew Garfield who is our hero should really take some acting classes because he is single handedly destroying spider man's charter for everyone, why doe's his spider man charter always cries but always, Tobias Maguire spider man never cried what's with the sissy attitude,the amazing spider man is the crying spider man and he needs some spine and fast, not against his enemy's but against the lady in his life. with out the special effect's and Jammie fox and sealy field to save this movie, all of us at the theater would have walked out and demanded our money back. I hope the studious will save face and stop this remaking of spider man because if a third installment goes out, there will be no hope for our friendly spider at all.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

But something evil is lurking beneath the waters or should I say electricity. As we see our hero balancing life and staying away from the girl he loves, he is forced to make a choice between the one that he loves and the city that needs him the most.On the other side of things, an old friend comes back into Peter's life, Harry Osborn (DeHaan), whose father has just died of an incurable disease (which by the way is untreatable) and apparently genetic and it has gotten Harry as well. I don't want to spoil the movie for those of you who have not seen it yet, but I would bet my money on a third installment.This movie defied all odds against the original 2nd movie – no thanks goes to Willem Dafoe, James Franco, Alfred Molina – Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Dane DeHaan, Jamie Foxx, Paul Giamatti – and the incomparable and talented Sally Field gave the performance of their lives. This movie will go down in Marvel History as one of the greatest super hero movies of the 21st century.","15 out of 40 found this helpful.

Spoiler Free!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3002772/?ref_=tt_urv","elmeeksio","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15275669/?ref_=tt_urv","22 April 2014","When Mark Webb first relaunched the Spider-Man franchise, there were many who criticised that it was too soon after Sam Raimi's originals. With Spider-Man 3 spelling the demise of the original trilogy, Webb stepped in to tell a new set of stories of our beloved web slinger. One thing Webbs movies have done so well is to introduce new villains that we haven't seen on screen before, and for me that is what i was most excited to see with this movie!Amazing Spider-Man 2 picks up some time after the first (the actual time frame isn't really acknowledged)and we see Peter (Garfield) is still loving being Spider-Man. He joins in on Police chases and whilst being his usual wise-cracking self, he still manages to kick ass and save the day. We see that despite Peters promise to her Father in the first movie, he and Gwen (Stone) are back in a relationship. She knows he is Spider-Man and so the movie doesn't waste time with silly plot points about him having to be secretive towards her.(it saves those for Aunt May). There are sub narratives a-plenty, including the introduction of Harry Osborne, as well as Peters on-going search to find out what happened to his Parents.The Bad Guy/s: We are introduced to Max Dillon aka Electro who is given the usual Supervillian intro. We see that he is an outcast and that no one at Oscorp even knows he exists despite him being a seemingly important designer. Cue massive accident involving electricity and Electro is born. This for me was one of the Highlights of the film. Electro is BADASS!! Not only did they completely nail the look of the character, but the power he has, makes you genuinely question just how Peter will defeat him. Jamie Fox plays him with vulnerability (at first)and then pure anger. It's a great performance for a comic book villain.The film was not without faults however...a few things that annoyed me slightly were: 1) Rhino was billed to be one of the villains, yet his screen time is less that 5 mins. plus Paul Giamatti's Russian accent is awful! 2) The whole plot around Harry felt very rushed. Maybe some elements could have been saved until the next film. 3) On several occasions Gwen helps Spidey out of bad situations, both physically and intellectually. Peter is supposedly a child genius, now with Superpowers..he didn't need her help!.. it felt like Gwen helping was forced in to give Emma Stone more to do.All in all it was another great addition to this new franchise. The final showdown on the power grid and in the clock tower are worth the admission price alone, even if the film takes a while to get there. Garfield is great, Fox's Electro is awesome and the movie has many little nods to expanding the Spidey universe (look out for whats behind the glass in the 'Special Projects' wing).Top notch entertainment.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

When Spidy is taking hits of Electro's blast which have been cleverly mixed with dubstep, so every fight scene i was banging my head along to it, was really entertaining.in fact every scene with spiderman fighting or just web slinging is simply fun.Not the same for Peter.There is some mildly fun scene where Peter is investigating his fathers past and some smile moments which you can see most of in the trailer when he back chats to his aunty and Gwen. Electro's(Jamie Fox) back story and how he gets/keeps his powers is non existence, but still he plays the character rather well and i did enjoy seeing him kick spidermans ass. It was getting better when Harry Osborn (Dane Dehann) popped up and hinted at his interesting back story/on going story. but those scenes are just rushed to get back to the back and forth of 'i love you Gwen, but i don't want to hurt you' , 'i love you Peter you wont hurt me' and so on. it feels like the action was getting in the way of the love between these two, even though they did all this in the first one. all in all Defiantly better than the first one, If you liked the first one you'll like this one. Ill tell my friends to wait for the DVD, so they can talk about more interesting things while they wait to see the next fight.

We have a lot of superhero blockbusters coming out these years and most of them have a good combination of action/drama/comedy. It's hard to top that, but TAS2 does it loud and clear.The story about what happened to Peter's parents when they left him is revealed in this movie, a new evil is created, an old friend full of grudge returns, the love story between Peter and Emma develops and Spider-man/Peter is trying to cope with all of this. In between the action scenes there is plenty of room for drama, character development, comedy but it never distracts from the story itself. They all serve the story and makes it more and more exciting to know what happens next. Because it's so well written, directed, designed and acted you shift from excitement, bursts of laughter, tears, enjoyment and back and forth. Andrew Garfield is perfect as the nerdy, sexy, troubled, dauntless Peter Parker and Emma Stone delivers a great intelligent, brave, sultry, strong, struggling Gwen Stacy. And all the other actors around them deliver great performances as well. And with an exciting cliff-hanger at the end I can hardly wait for the third amazing installment.The Amazing Spider-man 2 is an amazing trip and I loved every second of it. 10/10","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

He is a smart-ass and is constantly cracking jokes during battles. Also, his emotion throughout the movie, make you emotional and feel for every character. The chemistry between Andrew and Emma was incredible! I always looked forward to having them on screen together! The action was great! The plot had a couple of issues, but nothing to get all mad about. The way the three villains were used was perfect! The storyline was intriguing and left you wanting more which is the idea!

When I first saw ASM2, I pretty much hated it. I thought it was slow, overstuffed, and mediocre. That being said, there are some aspects of the movie that are good, that I enjoyed, and make it worthwhile.One significant improvement is that Peter/Spider-Man's character is much more likable this time. That's not to say Garfield hasn't always been good in the role, it's more to do with the writing in the first movie. In this film, they really capture the humor and wisecrackiness of Spidey, (whereas in the Amazing Spider-Man it was much more sarcastic and mean-spirited). On the other hand this film, like many comic book flicks, doesn't entirely succeed in creating fully-fleshed out, convincingly motivated villains. It does to some extent with Electro, but his transformation from pretty nice, if weird and nerdy, guy to evil mass murderer is pretty abrupt. However, that isn't all that unusual for the Spider-Man films, as the series' villains' psychology and origins have all been fairly cheesy, (aside from Norman Osbourne in the first Raimi movie). There were some moments in the film I thoroughly enjoyed; particularly an opening chase scene with Peter foiling a heist and immediately rushing to his graduation, arriving just in time and changing into his gown while forgetting to remove the mask. There are a lot of entertaining and funny moments, particularly in the first half of the film. Somewhere in the middle though, it gets even more melodramatically forced than Spider-man 3. After that point the film really drags for about an hour until it kicks back in for the climax. The film has a serious focus issue, as there are pretty much 3, (maybe 4) story lines. Peter's arc of learning the truth about what happened to his father, Electro's arc, Harry's plot line, and the Peter/Gwen relationship. Harry's story isn't really connected to the others at all, and could've been a whole other movie. So the Amazing Spider-man 2 is a mixed bag, with some real strengths. The action scenes are well-executed, and the humor is good and very characteristic of Spider-man. As for performances, Fox is fine, Garfield and Stone are still good and share fantastic chemistry, and Dane Dehaan is great as Harry Osbourne. On the other hand, the movie is plodding, unfocused and occasionally pretty dumb. Is it better than the unnecessary retold origin film? Yes. But director Mark Webb and co. still have a ways to go toward refining this series. 6.0/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The Amazing Spider Man 2 offers incredible action, drama and comedy all in one. Andrew Garfield has played Spider-Man much better than Tobey Macguire in my opinion. Garfield offers much more action and comedy and better web swinging than the old spider man ever did. I thought Jaime Fox would suck as electro once I saw the design but I was 100% wrong. Electro's new design is much more threatening than that of the comics and I thought it was a good update. Same with Paul Giamatti as the Rhino near the end and Dane Dehaan's new version of the green goblin. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was just as good here as she was in the first movie. There is also a major twist but I won't give anything away. Overall this is a definite must see.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Almost every aspect about, from the pacing to the antagonists (of which there are many) to even the protagonist, spider-man himself, is done badly with little to no thought. The only reason I can give it anything remotely higher than a 2 star is the swinging in the moving. The scenes where spider-man is swinging through the city is some of the most satisfying and well-made spider-man swinging scenes I've ever seen on the big screen. Even the new ones with Tom Holland and the old ones with Toby McGuire were not nearly as good as the ones in this film. Regardless, there is no denying that this movie is terribly in almost every regard and cannot be redeemed simply by the fantastic swinging sequences.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The character development was rich, the action was far better, and the movie 'somewhat' moves away from the horribly overdone origin storyline. The movie gives us more insight into his internal struggle between finding his path as a person and his responsibility as a superhero. That is where the phenomenal chemistry between Stone and Garfield comes into play, they are so believable it's incredible (just might be the best love story in the comic book film genre). But Amazing 2 does have plenty of faults, most notably it focuses a ton of time on Harry Osborn and in the final climax of the film we get to see him shine......for like 10 minutes (what a waste). All that build up and no payoff.The movie also carries over the dreaded parent plot line just like the original 3 Sam Raimi films which have completely been beaten dry. I don't understand why they keep attaching this sub-storyline to each film, they want it to be more important than it should be. The only redeeming quality of the film has the be Jamie Foxx's Electro, a standout villain who sadly is not given enough screen time.There are far better comic book movies out there!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

From fantastic visuals that include easily the best Spidey swinging sequences to the potent chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, the film possesses plenty of absorbing elements.The character of Spider-Man is in his element in this version; more confident, in tune with his abilities, and constantly reaching for that comic banter. As Peter Parker however, he is more conflicted as he constantly battles between abandonment issues of the past and progressing forward with Gwen Stacy. The latter relationship is in fact the heart of the film; there is some cheesiness but both Garfield and Stone are so adorable & genuine together that it's easy to let them carry on falling over each other. Garfield is probably the best actor I have seen along with Robert Downey Jr. & Christian Bale to play a superhero, showing a tremendous range of emotions & earnestness.The villains of the film are a bit too comical for my liking, especially in their motivations. But hey, at this point I'm not sure what I want to see from them as long as their powers allow them to put up a decent fight. Jamie Foxx is given an excellent sequence at Times Square when he first comes head-on against our titular character. Marc Webb's direction in that scene is excellent as he creates an epic showcase using slow motion and wide-shots. He also manages to form a dramatic finale and one 'big' moment in particular that many superhero movies fall short on in terms of impact and resonance.Overall, The Amazing Spiderman 2 never felt over bearing to me despite all the characters involved. It got me excited for the grander Spider- Man universe with the help of gripping story-telling, exhilarating action sequences, and emotion.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

And the relationship drama that seems to have been taken directly from an MTV ducusoap. Peter Parker and Gwen is together, they break up, they are together again. In the end it's like you want to scream out ""I really don't care, give me some action please"". And aunt May isn't the usual nice and easy to like character we are used to see in the comics. Here she is annoying and irritating and take up way too much space. Best actor in this movie is clearly Dane DeHaan who can look really devilish sometimes, but there isn't much for him to work with.I don't know if Marc Webb deliberately tried to make it into a teen love drama or if it's just badly written, but in comparison to the super hero sagas we have been fed lately on the screen, this is sub par in every way. Way too long between the action sequences and taking the story's very thin red thread in consideration the length of the movie could easily be cut in half.The special effects is good and well made, but the action sequences are much to local. They take place in specific areas, between 1 villain and 1 Spider and never really reaches the heights you have seen in other Spider Man movies. And then of course it's the constant bullet time effects whenever Spider Man does anything, which is nice the first 10 times but gets a bit dull after a while.So all in all..a dull and not very fun move super hero movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Granted this film isn't horrible by any means, but it's easily the worst Spider-Man film to ever make it to theaters so far. Besides the storytelling being all over the place and the constant set ups and references to other things in the Spider-Man universe, the film also fails on an emotional level- taking the humanity and belief out of the film and making it seem too silly to bare at times. I was frustrated with this film, because although it was borderline campy at times, I did have some fun with it at the start. But as it went on, the film became duller and duller and truly missed any opportunity to bring its extraordinary events to life and settle for an original but poorly executed attempt at a superhero tale. I also have to say a lot of the acting in this film is just not very good. Actors feel incredibly mist cast throughout this film, and truly just off their game. Even Academy Award Winner Emma Stone seems to phone it in from time to time, and it's just heartbreaking to watch such a talented cast be forced into a mediocre film. By far the worst acting though comes from the dreadfully miscast Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn and the overdone performance from Jamie Foxx's Electro. Both actors mis the mark incredibly and I hope that if they are later brought into the franchise again, that the MCU can do them the justice these actors deserve. In the end, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a lackluster superhero film at best- squandering its potential. It has some campy fun moments, but somehow does a worse job at correcting the mistakes from Spider-Man 3 into a forgettable and at times painful watch. All in all, it's a disappointment at best, and may not deserve the hate that comes towards it- but I can certainly understand it.My Rating: 3.8/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A Structured, Impressive Attempt to Bring the Comics to Life","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3009190/?ref_=tt_urv","ThePROGMind","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44164871/?ref_=tt_urv","3 May 2014","Spider-man has had many a movie now. As a kid, I wanted a Spider-man movie so badly, and when Sam Raimi fulfilled that desire, I immediately loved his movies. Except now, I look back and realize how crappy those movies really were. While I still love Spider-man 2, the original and especially #3 were campy, far removed from the comics, and lackluster in story. In short, I loved them because they gave me Spider-man, and that's about it.Fast forward to now, and we've been given two Amazing Spider-man movies. The first knocked my socks off, as I didn't think a studio would ever come so close to giving me the character as he should be. There were flaws, but not many. This second Amazing Spider-man movie is more than just a fun ride. It's more than just a bunch of fight scenes. There are four things that I love about this new movie.First, it focuses on Peter Parker. We get to see his tears, his relationship flaws, his fears, and his problems. This film features some intensely emotional scenes between Peter and Gwen and also Peter and his Aunt May. These scenes are on point, with amazing acting on display. Secondly, it focuses on Spider-man. This might seem like a strange point, but the first three movies focus on Spider-man by showing fights, by showing him swinging endlessly, and the like. However, Amazing Spider-man 2 gives us Spider-man as the comics portray him. A. He's really smart and uses his intelligence fluidly in battle. B. He's a smart ass. As much as I've heard that this movie's script is junk, I myself found it hilarious. C. We get to see the pain and the joy he experiences in being Spider-man.Thirdly, the actions scenes are phenomenal. Not only is the CGI incredible, but the cinematography and choreography are graceful, impacting, and even a little scary. This film finds balance in providing some truly shocking and massive moments and in giving us Spider-man's cockiness and humor. It contrasts the darkness and the humor so well, and hits really hard with the ballsy action. The 3D added so much to all of this, too, as we are taken on a roller coaster as we follow Spider-man's acrobatic moves. The villains are pretty good, neither the best nor worst that we've seen. Jamie Foxx does an admirable job of being crazy, basically. Now that I think of it, both Electro and the Green Goblin are pretty mad. The Rhino is a bit of a disappointment, though, as I hoped for more screen time and perhaps a more personal look at him, instead of this hired muscle ploy. Either way, the battle scenes with these villains are fantastic.Lastly, this film is structured like a work of art. It starts and ends with a battle versus a specific villain, and we get to see his attitude as it changes. He matures during this film; spiritually, personally, even physically, I think. He learns about true hope, true bravery, and even dealing with the past and future. The pinnacle event of the film will effect him forever, and the film masterfully tells the part, as they pull it almost exactly from the comics. It really impacted me as a viewer, even though I knew it was coming.So, is Amazing Spider-man 2 the best superhero movie I've seen? No. Captain America 2 was significantly better. There are some pacing problems, some letdowns (especially the end), and some things I would have done differently. However, despite these small (and nitpicking) flaws, this is the best Spider-man movie yet. With a hilarious script, imposing and hard-hitting action, a wonderful tribute to one of the comics' best stories, and a fascinating look at Peter's past and his shaky present; Amazing Spider-man 2 exceeded my expectations.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was the same feeling after viewing The Dark Knight Rises.The movie was long winded for all the wrong reasons. There was too much exposition regarding things that stalled out as soon as that particular scene was over. For the length of the film, things tied together so loosely there was not much I felt invested in toward the end. The film was lacking in writing, cohesion, pacing, and structure.There were a few scenes that just came off as annoying. Most prominent in my recollection was the segment where Gwen was about to commence with her school interview and Peter showed up. All he did was act spastic, and speak incoherently for three solid minutes, all just to end up wishing her luck. I was done with the film by the time Electro was creating dub-step music when coming into contact with the electrical equipment during a battle.There was no character I felt compelled to care for, or a character I could relate to. By the time any real gravity took place in the story I was distracted with the possibility that the film was almost over. Which, to my dismay, it was not.I did enjoy the cinematography and camera work during action scenes from Spiderman's point of view. But in all, along with my Father-In-Law, we couldn't help but feel that all of the gimmicks and cliché occurrences took away from the strength of pivotal moments in the movie. I am hoping for a Director's Cut! It worked for Daredevil.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

There is something just too good about this character to ignore. But Sony did what they did with Spider Man 3 , ruined it!!The film adopts a much more colorful and brighter tone and look unlike its predeccesor and has more goofs, humour and romance than before. Spiderman is much more friendlier and goofier and comedic, truer to the comics and it feels great to have him back and save a whole bunch of people and inspire a few kids along the way.The romance though is also heavily amped up, and for some reason takes up the whole film!They break up, they are friends now, can't live without each other, back again,
and so on....... It undermines everything else in the film ,as the whole film becomes a backdrop for their romance. Our villains Electro and Green Goblin are shoved in the background along with everything else.The villains motivations are all contrived and unreasonable despite the writing trying really hard to get you onboard.It doesn't take too long for the film to fall into complete mayhem and disarray as we move from one character to another, one sub plot to another , one villain to another, one setup to another, until disorientation grabs you and smacks you dead.The film has so many beats and tones , plot threads that just contradict each other and never really aloow you to comprehend the plot and story at all, it never really settles down to accept one and adopt that particular tone and story, instaed it tries doing several things at once. Resulting in a confusing mess of a story that offers little moments and glimpses of real quality and interest.Andrew Garfield is great as Peter Parker , he handles every range of emotion perfectly, but sadly the script sends him on these ludicrous quests and makes him carry out overly stupid, nonsensical tasks that leave you scratching your head. Jamie Foxx hams it in and goes all out as the Electro, Dane Dehaan as Harry Osborne also gives everything he has, but the writing creates these unreasonable, awfully planned out situations and motivations which just make you lose your interest in them.The dialogue is awful most of the times making you cringe heavily when it can, the cinematography is just flat, the music feels bordeline experimental so be your own judge of it, the action feels ambitious but pretty underwhelming (except the New York Times Square scene), the effects are great once again, but the ludicrous script that seems to be a mix mash of several ideas and scripts destroys and derails everything resulting in a Spiderman film that feels
more like a product designed to appeal to everybody.The film is unfocused, apparently Sony interfered heavily in the process(Not a surprise!) With an entire alternate ending scene, around 45 minutes of deleted scenes on the blu-ray to account for it. There are some glimmers of quality, which probably are the leftovers of the director(Mark Webb) trying to make a competent sequel, the deleted alternate ending scene was his preferred ending
It certainly would have been better than the one thrown in the actual film.Ovearll, The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a disaster, watch it only for the performances and the effects and one really good action set piece.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

If they keep making them like this they will save the spiderman franchise indefinitely. Jaimie Foxx was excellent as Electro and Dane DeHaan played Harry Osborn with so much heart you literally like him even more when he becomes a villain. His own company messes him over so bad they deserve everything that happens to them. The love story in this movie is so moving you will fall in love with it. I went into this movie expecting a good hero movie and they delivered an astonishing creation of filmmaking excellence. Spidey is back the best he's ever been since the first Raimi film.

This film is normally aimed at the teen generation and not the adult, old and loyal fans of Spider-man who have been seeing him on television since the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's.Ted Raimi was the guy that I feel damaged the franchise by casting Tobey Maguire who I feel was not mature enough to play the part of Spider-man. The later two sequels to Raimi's film confirmed this. The character of the 60's and 80's animated Spider-man was the best because Peter Parker was a scientist at heart and he used his brains - not agility to get out of sticky situations. If you own the original 1967 animated Spider-man DVD, than you should be very happy, as this were the best Spider-man episodes ever made. And in addition to this you could add the 80's and 1994 animated Spider-man series to complete your collection.In this film a new super-villain is introduced known as Electro (played by Jamie Foxx) who has never been seen in a live action movie but has only appeared in the animated version. The Green Goblin also makes his appearance, but he is so similar to Hobgoblin played by Willem Dafoe in the Ted Raimi directed film. Plot: Peter Parker is haunted by visions of Gwen's deceased father, police captain George Stacy. This does not bode well, as similar visions by a well known soothsayer predicted the death of a well known Roman emperor. Call it a sort of premonition. Peter ends his relationship with Gwen as a result of a vow made to her father.However he can't hide the fact that he loves her deeply and that she is a part of his life, and so he returns to her.In all this confusion, OsCorp Industries employee Max Dillon has a horrendous accident with some genetically altered electric eels(in the same way like the Spectacular Spider-man Episode). He becomes Electro. Add to this the passing of Norman Osborn who before dying tells his son Harry that he has a rare hereditary transmitted disease. Harry takes the formula which was funded by his father, but created by Peter's father who was a genius in the field of bio-genetics with disastrous results to his personality. Watch the film to find out what happens next.I found the script pathetic, but the special effects were good. Andrew Garfield's acting and attitude in the film is like that of teenager. His acting in the previous installment was better and he should have improved upon that. I'm not a fan of Emma Stone and I have seen much prettier actresses in my life: Kari Wuhrer, Valentina Vargas, Angelina Jolie and Julia Roberts. How they can cast her when there are a lot of beautiful women in the U.S.A., is a mystery. Jamie Foxx is suffering from apparent hair-loss as seen in the film. He should either shave his head or resort to hair transplants if he wants to keep looking as good as he was in earlier days. His plus point is his acting, and he is definitely getting better and better with age. Dane DeHaan gives a solid performance as both Harry Osborn and The Green Goblin. Verdict: Not one I'll want to see again, as I've a lot of better films in my DVD collection. So I'll give it a score of 5/10.You can now build your own home cinema for a lot less than in previous years as LED TV's are cheaper. By a HD GRAPHICS CARD: Radeon HD5450 with Hyper-memory and a 32"" Sony Bravia Smart W674A Led TV and creative A100 SBS 2.1 speakers and you're set to go. You can hook this up to your desktop or laptop if it has an HDMI port and play HD movies directly from your PC.I have the above setup and I enjoy my films immensely.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Such was never done before for any movie. Expectations were running high until Rottentomatoes gave an average rating to this movie. Why? What went wrong with this movie? NOTHING. This movie is amazingly beautiful. The franchise went to its core; to the heart of Spiderman's original story. Stop judging movies on the scale of Nolan's or Bryan Singer's. Who is Spiderman? Answer: A teenage boy. What do you expect from a teenage boy? To be serious as Batman or want him to feel out of place like Captain America. When you go to the original story of Peter Parker, or to say Avengers, he befriends Tony Stark. They get along because they both are almost same in their heart. Childish. Amazing Spiderman 2 is all Rock and Roll. There is speed, there are great one liners, but the one thing I loved about this movie is the story of Gwen and Parker. In the first three movies Spiderman franchise did horrible mistakes with the storyline. Now, what they are doing is to trace the origin of Spidey before Mary Jane enters his life. They did exceedingly well this time. Watch the first clash between Electro and Spiderman at Times Square. Fighting in between all those billboards and neon signs, the reason of spending such a huge amount on this movie became visibly clear that Sony has its faith on Spiderman as a brand. It will attract people as does the hyperspace of Times Square. The other thing that I liked about this movie is the background score. It is so refreshing and different from all those drum beatings that are going these days in the Superhero movie genre. After The Dark Knight, everyone wants to make one akin to it. This one is so sublimely different. I loved this movie, but I can't bet the same for others. This one is a little different from what we have become accustomed to watch these days in this genre. This one is the best movie of Spiderman made till date. I hope others will enjoy the same as I did.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

There are three villains with one barely getting any screen time, one shoe horned in out of the ashes for a single fight sequence, and then there's Electro who probably doesn't get enough screen time due to this movie lacking a focus.

There's more drama, suspense, some dark moments, but perhaps the same comic-book like feel; something that Sam Raimi's films had, but never really delivered on it's premise. Thankfully however, Mark Webb and co, gave us a film that will be remembered for ages.Even though there are three villains in this film, they are all superbly developed and well acted, something Sam Raimi's infamous Spiderman 3 SPECTACULARLY FAILED TO DO on SO MANY LEVELS. This film when you watch it gives you the sense that the movie is more understandable and therefore plausible in it's premise and execution. True, there are some rough spots in the film, but that does not in any way, shape, or form, take away from the experience.One has to feel bad for Shailene Woodley, who was supposed to appear in the film as Mary Jane, Spidey's love interest for the uninitiated, but given how many characters and subplots are in the film, this was a wise decision on the film -makers part; after all, we wouldn't want to suffer through the same fate as Spiderman 3, would we? And unlike James Franco's take on Harry Osborne, Dane DeHaan gives a MUCH better performance. With his menacing stare and cold, blue eyes, he felt really intimidating as Spidey's future foe.The action scenes are really spectacular and no pun intended, AMAZING!!! Never once was I bored throughout the entire runtime of the film. It's properly paced and intrinsically plotted with hints and bits of pieces for die-hard Spidey fans to discover; with some Easter eggs thrown in for good superhero measure. Tight direction and well choreographed, there's a great sense of tension and excitement to behold the on screen hijinks. I liked some of the slow-motion shots and they highlight the action; giving the film depth in it's perception of character and action-driven scenes and although not everyone will find them to their tastes, I think they work wonderfully in showcasing Spidey's acrobatic abilities which are greatly taken from the awesome source material.So is The Amazing Spiderman 2 better than the first one? The overall answer is an AMAZINGLY enthusiastic YES!!! Mark Webb has done a really good job on giving us a sequel that goes in-depth of Peter Parker's psyche while also giving ample screen time to the villains and other character's involved in the titular hero's life. If the ending is anything to go by(which I will not spoil by any means) then we can expect more greater things to come in the overall narrative of this rebooted series. For once, three villains on screen are given screen time of character development and to be fair, it was a huge risk, but the risk payed off thanks in part to the well-written(and at times, humorous) plot and screenplay.

Maybe its just me but the manner in which the movie ended, I sort of anticipated that in the first 15 minutes. I think the choice of actor for Spider-man is great and Andrew Garfield does justice to a younger version of Spider-man. But i felt that the main bad guy for the movie was Electro but as the movie went on, I was disappointed because I wanted Jamie Fox to have a bigger involvement in the movie than it actually was. Overall I think it was a good edition to the Spider-man series and I would look forward to more sequels with more mainstream spidey villains.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, and Sally Field who return from the previous installment, while introducing a whole bunch of Super- Villains including Jamie Foxx, Dann DeHann & Paul Giamatti (in that order of importance). The movie is packed with strong CGI, and some very good action, but there's also enough room for characters to grow withing the movie. The score is strong (except for one tiny scene) with Hans Zimmer doing his thing again & the story element is at it's best. The only things that could bother you are, the short running time, along with a certain action scene which was made way too short that it's original script. Some of the dramatic scenes are extended but don't add much depth, only taking up more time.All in all, I was screaming my way all through the movie, and if you're one to go enjoy a movie for what it is (Comic Book Fun)You're in for a treat. IMO for me, Spider-Man 2 is shaping up to be the movie event of the year.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I love how the brought Spider man's acrobatic skills and web swinging. I also love how the writers are bringing out more villains in the movie. Another thing would be the costume, I love that the writers decided to stick with the old fashion spider-man and the lenses are big how it should be. It's like they ripped the costume out of the comics. Also, it focuses on the struggles that Peter is going through as Spider-man, and his friendship with Harry Osborn. It's a great obstacle for Peter if he can protect those he cares about or get them hurt. Therefore, I believe it's a great movie, the writers did covered everything how Spider-man should be.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The plot was little bit shaky with director trying to accommodate too many characters in 120 min entwining their fate together and around our favorite Peter Parker . The stem of the movie is its love story of Gwen and Peter with things getting spiced up by super villains like Electro , Green Goblin & lastly with Huge armoured Rhino. The action sequences are fantastic with 3D effect which compliments them rather than taking all the credits . The slo mos are perfectly incorporated in fight sequences . With Wits and Humor just like you find in spideys comics ,the movie provides a peek inside Peter's family history also with describing the death of his parents at the beginning and Peter's search for his parent's past and untimely demise. However, the story Is little shaky as it tries to adrift from Peter to Max aka Electro , Harry Osborn, his aunt , but every time the director has dragged it strongly and beautifully to Peter & Gwen to make it a good movie that gaurantees you everything : Action , romance, comedy , fantasy & entertainment .My Verdict : Get your a** up and go watch the movie.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's a confectionary creation that's likely to drive kids wild, and plenty of adults, too. As an adult, I've rarely fallen victim to my inner 10 year-old, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" consistently broke down the critical barriers that I've honed throughout the years. It's a sugar rush of a film and, quite simply, I liked what it did to my brain. It's often not able to see past its own nose, content to exist forever in the moment, but it's popcorn filmmaking in its purest form, and Marc Webb deserves all the credit in the world for making such a delectable cinematic cake from a line of incongruous ingredients.

I can draw on my youth when I remember reading the comic books, giving me a perspective that not all people have, as I have followed Spidey for a number of years. To this day I love movies and the many Super Heroes that are written about, and especially those that make it to the big screen. All of that to say this.....there was something that was lacking in this version of Spider-Man, and even my Grandson noticed it as well. Kids have an amazing perceptive ability, and are an amazing little barometer for truthfulness. Both of us were wondering early on what happened to M.J.(Mary Jane), and he even asked me why the Green Goblin was changed up. He even commented on the change to Electro. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst & James Franco delivered a certain innocence to the characters that more resembled the way Stan Lee wrote the original story-line. In this version, Andrew Garfield seemed much less innocent, Dane DeHaan was a poor replacement for Harry Osborn, and lest we forget, Emma Stone instead of M.J. was really far-fetched. Her make-up made her look anything but innocent. One of the biggest draws to Spider-Man is in his transformation from an almost bumbling photographer, into his still somewhat innocent alter-ego as the masked hero, Spider-Man.All of that was gone in this version....begging the question..Why change up a winning formula? A lot of action....but empty on most cylinders.","2 out of 14 found this helpful.

Like I said before, I really don't think anyone cared about these movies. At least that's the way it seems to me. I'm really trying to understand the motive behind these reboot films, I've racked my brain trying to somewhat comprehend the reasoning as to why Sony decided to reboot the Spider-Man franchise. Keep in mind, that the Sam Raimi films brought in a lot of money for Sony studios, and while Spider-Man 3 was indeed panned by critics and fans alike, it was by no means a financial flop. Worldwide, it brought in a whopping Nine-hundred million dollars! In fact, both Sam Raimi and Sony studios were all-set to make a Spider-Man 4. However, Sony insisted that Spider-Man 4 would be done by the summer of 2011. Sam Raimi did not want to rush into making the film, and make the same mistake as Spider-Man 3. (Which wasn't his fault by the way!) So Sony scrapped Spider-Man 4, and began making the reboot film(s). That's one reason why, but it's not the only reason. Sony obviously saw the massive success and profits that Disney/Marvel studios was raking in with their Marvel cinematic universe, and decided to try the same thing with Spider-Man. I think everyone knows, that duplicating someone ELSE'S success, won't make YOU successful. The plot of this film, or should I say what little plot there is, isn't very good either. The films just jumps around from one thing to the next, and loses all focus on the story. The villains of the film lack charisma, and their motivations are paper thin. To sum it all up, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" Don't feel like comic book movies. (at least not to me.) They feel like romance movies. I don't know about anyone else, but when I go see a movie with the name ""Spider-Man"" that's the last thing I want.","3 out of 26 found this helpful.

I'll never get tired of them, and their costume and make up. The ending is heart breaking, as many others agree.What really takes me out it how silly the Goblin looks. I definitely prefer the Green Goblin from the first series. Electro before the eels wasn't so believable for me either as I feel like the make up and costume tried too hard. Talk about adding stereotype layers to ones appearance.I understand that one villain uses each other to get what they want, but Electro doesn't feel like a true villain. I felt more empathetic towards him than saying he's a real villain. Goblin on the other hand feels so distant and spoiled which is the whole point, but doesn't seem to be a real reason to go after Spidey.Rhino is such an after thought, that is doesn't feel memorable when we close with their fight.The personal highlight is the small boy who stands in the street which kicks Spider-Man into gear.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The action was gripping and intense. The villains(especially Dane DeHann) were compelling if not a little bit cheesy. The character interaction was pure Spider-Man, from Peter's quips in the suit to Gwen's and his conversations it all felt organic and genuine. Not to mention the powerful chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.I'm not going to spoil anything here, but the plot moves a surprisingly brisk pace despite it carrying a fair amount of story threads. Only dragging in a handful of moments, but other moments seemed to make up for it.I keep seeing complaints that the film was too CGI heavy and that just seems like an odd thing to point out since while yes there are a lot effects in the movie they all look amazing. No one can tell me with a straight face the opening scene where Spidey is swinging around the city wasn't gorgeous.Let's not forget the soundtrack which was a major step up from the previous film's bland flavorless garbage. Each character had a distinct theme and clever instrumentation to accompany it. While yes the infamous dubstep is implemented it does it in a way that makes sense and doesn't feel tasteless. Not to mention the new Spider-Man theme gave me chills.One of the things I keep seeing is that focus on the romance between Peter and Gwen is very Twilight like. I feel like the people who say that haven't seen or read Twilight, in Twilight the main character cannot be self-sufficient and needs man to come hold her and make all the bad feelings go away. In this film while yes there is a central romance involving teenagers it's a healthier relationship in which both participants have other obligations they must tend to thus killing their relationship. They aren't dependent on each other as they more are simply clinging to the only bit constant in their lives as everything changes.That all being said yes this film as some problems and isn't perfect. Electro is pretty bland for as far as villains go, but he's still interesting. Jamie Foxx just hams it up every time he's on screen which really is odd compared to DeHann who plays a much more subdued character. And when the story drags, you can really feel it. This doesn't it make it a bad film or detract from the really well done scenes.Overall don't believe the hate, it's fun and more importantly better than Man of Steel and Spider-Man 3.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The main character should have been someone else, Garfield's acting is superficial, his voice induces feelings of nausea, and he is not believable as Peter Parker. It seems they attempted to TRY and prove him as being Peter by making most of the movie have him being Peter rather than Spider-man. The CGI doesn't look believable also; and the scenes are boring and uninteresting in most cases. Gwen and Peters scenes make me want to fall asleep, they don't have a bond between them at all. The plot was also not to my interest. It was very cliché. The first movie was OK, and even watchable. This movie however fell completely flat, neither one can even stand by the original Spider-man movies.","2 out of 15 found this helpful.

All of my friends said this movie was awesome at school. But after watching this movie, I was not impressed. The main character was an idiot play boy being too young to act like that. This movie was unrealistic, totally not full of the action department or acting. Though the music was very catchy, so I'll be giving you my thoughts of the pros and the cons.Pros- The music was good, nice quality graphics. And they were amazing at the costumes, the plot was easy to follow. Whenever there was an action seen it pumped me up. Cons- The main character is a play boy, which is never the way to be.... He is an idiot, he is very not-smart. I just thought the acting was just brutally terrible, it was sooooo cheesy. The action was good, but it probably the only action scenes were at the beginning and the end of the movie. This movie was a drama for ya mama... Just one final thing to say about these cons.... Who would put 9mm loads in 5ft armor of a robotic rhinoceros?

I have a few quips about this movie that I just didn't like.1. Peter Parker is suppose to be a genius, unfortunately for us, the only thing Andrew Garfield shows us he is good at is reading someone else's research and citing it verbatim(Amazing Spider-Man). Here in this movie, he forgets the basic concept of electricity. 2. Spider-Man's quips were always sarcastic yet witty. Unfortunately Andrew Garfield's jokes comments off as a douche. 3. Electro is an electrical engineer here, yet his genius is never shown. We only get to see his mental illness, while the ending fight was decent it never wowed me. 4. Aleksei Systevich is suppose to be an intimidating strong force. The only thing that the Aleksei Systevich got right in this movie is the dimwittedness. I do not like the fact that he uses a large mechanical suit to be ""The Rhino"", meaning that if anyone else can get their hands on their suit they can be the rhino. 5. Harry Osborn, played by such a hipster douche, I rather take james Franco with his lazy eye. Again, the director gets it wrong. Harry is supposed to be using goblin serum, in here, they make it a hereditary disease that he becomes a goblin? Not only that, but his strength comes from Spider Venom? The movie is decent, is it worth the price of admission? I say not, but if you can go see it at a discount theatre like I did, then yes it's worth the $5 and 2 hours out of your life. There's just so many things wrong with this movie that I didn't enjoy, the only thing they got right was the romance between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker, which was a lot better than the romance between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson from the Tobey version, but that's not Tobeys or the Sam Raimis fault, that was Kirstens, she made it very public that she did not enjoy the role and didn't want the role.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie ended up with Spider-man saving the city from an epidemic infection sparkled off by Dr. Kurt Connors/Reptile/The Lizard. Well The Amazing Spider Man 2 (2014) sparks off from where its forerunner left and ends with a good note for all leaving with some shocking surprises and twists.The movie opens up Richard Parker (Campbell Scott) doing a self video recording about a major conspiracy which has been running in Oscorp and also shows us why Peter's parents had abandoned him during his childhood leaving Aunt May (Sally Field) to take care of him and also keep the secrets intact. In the present time, Spider Man has become the foster for New York as their Crime Fighter and Savoir of justice when needed and on the other edge Peter Parker is keen on balancing a normal life along with his girlfriend Gwen and also trying to stay and move away from her for the promise which he had made to Gwen's father before he had passed away when trying to save Spider Man from the Reptile/The Lizard. Events get electrified when Spider-Man gets to meet head-on with Electro who happens to be Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), an Oscorp employed electrician who after meeting a fatal accident gets mutated with powers of absorbing, living in and unleashing electric power from various sources and is ready to wreck mayhem in the city. Then later Peter has to battle his friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), who turns into Green Goblin after injecting a so called cure to save his life only to know that it turns him the other way around and now wants Spider-Man as his cure for the same.The movie keeps you hooked from start to end and director Marc Webb had done a efficient job not only in presenting the life of Spider-Man with action and drama, but also the life of Peter Parker who is shown battling his inner sanity to make sure that none of his kith and kin are endangered due to Spider-Man's vitality. The romantic/emotional scenes between Peter and Gwen have been portrayed perfect and they blend with the racy screenplay in such a way that they are related to all the events happening throughout the whole movie. Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, and Dane DeHaan play their roles to the best and their characters do not seem to cease at any point in the movie. Chris Cooper makes as small cameo appearance as Norman Osborn, father of Harry Osborn.Nothing would be more eye catching in a superhero movie other than the Action Sequences and here too we get to witness some fiery and edge of seat action sequences powered by stunning Visual Effects. The battle confrontation scenes between Spider-Man and Electro happens to the main highlight of this movie, especially the raging climax fight sequence which takes place in the city's power grid. Needless to say, Hans Zimmer has done an admirable job with the Music and Background Score for this movie and made sure that each scene lives up its genre be it Action, Drama, Thrill and Emotions.This movie might not be the very best to come in Spider-Man series from the Marvel Comic Universe, but on the whole is a Promising sequel for its predecessor and a satisfying movie for all Spidey Fans which ends up with note for a sequel to come with more web-slinging action. Stay till the end credits for a shocking surprise.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"5","/10","The Amazing Spider-man 2 A Mixed Bag","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3022491/?ref_=tt_urv","tburke85","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19956219/?ref_=tt_urv","25 May 2014","The Amazing Spider-man 2 is a mixed bag there are some things I did like and others not so much which I will get into later. First off I'm not sure if Marc Webb is the right director for Spider-man. There was a lot of talking in this movie that didn't really go anywhere and not much action. Andrew Garfield really does embody Peter Parker/Spider-man. They got that aspect of the character down right. Emma Stone puts in a good performance as Gwen Stacy in her limited screen time. Jamie Foxx does what he can as Max Dillion who later becomes the villain Electro. Same goes for Dane DeHaan who pulls off a convincing performance as Harry Osborn. The rest of the cast including Sally Field and a brief appearance by Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn do the best they can with what little they were given. The action scenes are well staged when there is some but are very short and there isn't many of them. Maybe 5-6 action scenes tops throughout the film. Now onto the bad. Some of the dialogue isn't the greatest but this is coming from the writers of Transformers so don't expect anything like Nolans Batman trilogy. Electro was a cool villain visually development wise not so much. He did resemble Dr Manhattan from Watchmen I liked it nonetheless though. Unfortunately Electro spends most of the second half locked up after his first fight with Spider-man during the Times Square sequence. Foxx tried to elevate the material and gain sympathy from the audience but I blame the script and was given a couple cheesy lines. He did have godlike powers and they could have done so much more with the character. What was the point of having a powerful villain like that just to sideline him for the most of the movie till near the end. Just didn't make a lot of sense. DeHaan's Harry was actually well developed throughout the film but his Goblin is rushed and only gets at the most 3-5 minutes of screen time near the end. It's nothing more than a glorified cameo. He gets a brief fight with Spidey and then he's rather easily defeated like Electro. It's a shame because his look and laugh as Goblin was quite sinister. I didn't feel much of anything when Gwen met her fate because I just wasn't emotionally invested in the characters. They should've saved that for the next film and perhaps had Harry become the Goblin in a mid credits scene or something. I understand they're building up to the Sinister Six but it seemed like they were trying to hard to set things up for future sequels instead of just focusing on telling a coherent story. Paul Giamatti who I consider to be a good actor in other movies hammed it up way too much as the Rhino. He was just kinda stupid to me and his attempt at a Russian accent is dreadful. I couldn't understand almost a word he said luckily his character is limited to just 2 scenes. He wasn't pivotal to story besides providing the film with a few quick action scenes and to show the type of criminals Spider-man has been facing since the end of the first film. I really wanted to enjoy this movie but after it was over I was like that's it and just felt disappointed. Even though I had no expectations it was still a major letdown but that's just me.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Who wrote this script? The one who did simply took different Spiderman enemies and contents and mixed this up to a terrible movie, of course including the usual difficult love story and parent/aunt relationships, both burdened by the suppressed past and thus, more or less sick. I can understand that Gwen died in this awful Spiderman incarnation, I guess because Emma Stone had enough being part of this s*** (what kind of words are ""prohibited words"" here is more amazing than Spiderman, by the way). So, if you just go to the movies to see the ever same action sequences in slow motion, this is the one for you to go, but don't expect any real, consistent story, some sort of niveau or whatsoever. With this movie, they finally buried Spiderman; part one was bad enough, but part two really puts the nail into Spidermans coffin and messes up completely.","3 out of 29 found this helpful.

Unfortunately that third movie was bad. Too much villains, too much everything. I was little nervous to see this 2010's Peter Parker. I hadn't seen the first one. So I went in to the movies and was pretty glad when I came out. The movie was pleasant, not perfect but worth of your money. Although the ambitious plot is this movie's weakness. First the visual styling were great. I really enjoy the cartoon like environment and Spiderman's climbing/flying in the sky. Andrew Garfield was surprisingly good in his role. I liked his arrogance and how he mocked his enemies. He brings also little energy for Peter character, more enthusiasm but in my opinion you can't compare Toby and Andrew. They both are great and unique. The enemies were alright but I think they had more potential than writers gave to them. Especially I liked a lot of Jaime Foxx's performance. You could empathize his character and the way he will be changed to super villain, I was positively surprised that they had tried to work out something accident styled situation which would be the reason how he will get his powers. What about Harry... I think Dane Dehaan made it alright. Compared to William Dafoe he didn't shine but I think the problem was the writers. Because there were so many enemies they didn't get a chance to change something more. But the acting was good and I loved that the director and the writers were surprisingly faithful to the original story. It was pleasant and even if I lost little of my enthusiasm in the middle of the movie I really enjoyed the end. It was exciting, and those who are very keen on to the cartoon details will be satisfied. If you have time, I recommend you go to see this movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's either bad writing, or bi-polar, but he depressingly tells her he can't be with her a scene later. Andrew Garfield plays things a bit too hyper and smug, when he's going for charming, but the boy does a fantastic American accent. We are then introduced to a mumbling and campy Jamie Foxx, who feels like he wondered off a Joel Schumacher superhero film set - and there's even an evil German scientist hamming it up with Foxx. This cluttered mess then throws Harry Osborn into the mix and some poor writing tells us he and Peter were friends as kids and not a frame of these two feels authentic. Harry needing Spidey's blood to survive and the strain it puts on Peter, doesn't earn any emotion and feels artificial, like everything else in this film. We are also spoon fed revelations about Peter's father, which are just one giant contrivance. The whole film has a connect the dots feel, with plot points that never feel developed, just forced into a screenplay that feels like studio executive notes not an actual piece of writing. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is an empty piece of committee filmmaking with no vision behind the camera. In this day and age of these types of films being pre- visualized with animation in their entirety before a frame is shot, Amazing Spider-Man 2 resembles coloring book filmmaking, all designed and pre-packaged with no artistic flair or soul. Even the music score is dreadful.","2 out of 18 found this helpful.

I think this movie was highly entertaining and delivered the goods. Some of the scenes including Dane DeHaan (who steals the show with an amazing performance, btw) are perhaps some of the most intense scenes I've ever come across in a superhero film. Only complaints are that I wish a teensy weensy little less was focused on the constant on-off relationship between Peter and Gwen and that Electro was rather underwritten (how he obtains his powers is clichéd). However, those are just tiny nitpicks. With a good plot filled with emotion and intensity, and power-packed action sequences, this movie is officially my favorite Spiderman film and is also one of my favorite films ever.

Many new characters are brought forth for your viewing pleasure. The movie has just the right amount of action and dialog. This movie is much better than the new transformers movie in my opinion because of the equality between the action and more dialog scenes. Where as the Transformer movie was riddled entirely with action, so much so that I feel it pulled away from the movie and became more of a distraction. If you have seen the Transformers movie you will understand what I am talking about. Spiderman is much better in my opinion. I am not a professional film critique just your average movie lover.

While there may be some factors unclear to a lot of people, some are very clear to me. The first, and most important factor, doing it right. This movie, and the first one, both did the comics great justice. Peter is way more like himself in these films. The old films were filled with a bunch of Hollywood drama garbage, where as in these films, they nearly copied the comics word for word (Exaggeration). Don't get me wrong, it wasn't word for word, but compared to the old films, it might as well have been. The Special effects in this film were amazing. I recall myself blurting out in amazement at certain scenes. I just do not understand why so many people hate it so dang much. I guess some people gotta have there soppy love stories to keep them happy.

The only fact that made me watch the sequence was the interaction between Garfield and Emma Stone, basically the only good point of the first one.In the beginning, I really thought this movie could be good, but with the bad development of important characters as Electro and as Green Goblin, the circular plot, in which every bad thing is connected to Oscorp, and a terrible soundtrack, the only thing that came in my mind was that this movie was a complete waste of a good opportunity. They could have based it, at least, in another comic-book story, a good one.Sadly, seeing where this movie wants to get probably mean the next movies won't present better stories. Avi Arad and his crew should understand that the Spider-Man's universe is not so large as the Avenger's. That's why they should stop trying to expand it. A simpler story, with less villains, would fit better the hero so loved for being common and simple.P.S.: I'm looking forward to seeing Spider-Man back to Marvel Cinematic Universe.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

After debuting with a solid first entry, Sony announced plans to create a cinematic universe of its own within the confines of just Spider-Man property. Enter The Amazing Spider-Man 2, a film with some occasional issues, but the best adaptation of Spider-Man to date.Now when I say that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the best Spidey adaptation yet, I don't necessarily mean the movie as a whole, I'm referring to the character Spider-Man himself. The absolute largest strength of this film is watching Spider-Man in his true comic book form. Complete with all of his wit and humor, super strength, incredible spider sense and even his wonderfully executed costume, this is the best depiction of the superhero Spider-Man in cinema history. My eyes were glued to the web-head every moment he was on screen. It was like he was pulled him right from the comic books, nailing the way he cracks jokes, fights and swings through New York. It goes to show that when your title character is as purely entertaining as Spidey is in this film, your audience is going to respond very positively.Now backing Spider-Man's great adaptation is a solid plot, which portrays deep themes, and arguably the most emotional climax ever in a superhero film. The story of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 picks up where its predecessor left off and the film does a great job of filling in the audience with the first film's story without slowing down the movie too much. With so much going on, including the movie's main plot which revolves around the mysterious and threatening Oscorp, the terrific romantic subplot between Peter an Gwen, along with a slew of characters in the film, the movie is mostly well balanced. The theme of hope is a major theme in the movie, one that is displayed excellently, giving the film a level of emotion few superhero films can match. There is some inconsistent pacing at some points, and I was disappointed by another lack of a true appearance by The Daily Bugle. But outside of a couple pacing hiccups, and the embarrassingly ridiculous ending with The Rhino, the movie flows well enough to keep your attention throughout.It wouldn't be a superhero movie without action, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 delivers on that front. The action is exciting, intense and often very vibrant and colorful, thanks to some incredible CG effects. Also, the hilarious wit of Spider-Man makes almost every action encounter entertaining on a different level.The main villain of the film, Electro, is portrayed in his Ultimate comic book form, and this challenged the special effects team to create a memorable CG-enhanced character. Electro is a good villain: powerful, smart, and full of rage and he posses as a heavy threat to everyone's favorite wall crawler. However, Electro often is underwhelming and underdeveloped, and has some laughable dialogue. Could have had a better written Elector, but it could've been a lot worse.For our second villain, we have Spidey's arch nemesis in the Green Goblin, a mediocre portrayal of the character, at best. Despite very minimal screen time, and underdevelopment, Green Goblin was a dark, dangerous and mostly enjoyable enemy. However, Goblin was undoubtedly rushed into the movie for spoiler-filled reasons and to get the ball rolling on the Sinister Six film. Green Goblin's alter ego, Harry Osborn, is done brilliantly and integral to the film, but Goblin himself was brought in too quickly to pull any weight behind the character. Overall, Spidey's villains are fun enough to watch, but struggle to maintain consistency throughout the film.The cast of the film is loaded with star power and the talent on screen is not wasted. Andrew Garfield reprises his role as your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, and his performance of Peter Parker was also fantastic. Garfield does a stellar job in displaying all of Peter's emotions, as well as capture his comedic side, giving a much better performance than in the first film. Opposite Garfield is the beautiful and talented Emma Stone, who once again plays Peter's love interest in Gwen Stacy. Stone's performance gives us the sense that she's in her prime, giving a spectacular performance. The relationship between Peter and Gwen is a strong one indeed, displaying numerous different emotions throughout the film. The chemistry is top notch, as dialogue flows seamlessly between the two. I could go as far as to say that this is arguably the best all around romance in a superhero film yet. Star Jamie Foxx plays Max Dillon, AKA Electro, and gives a solid performance with what he was given. Foxx plays Dillon well, despite the characters lack of depth. Finally, Dane DeHaan plays Harry Osborn, Peter's old childhood friend who has returned to New York. While his performance as Green Goblin was decent, his presentation of Harry Osborn was even better. Harry plays a large role in the movie's story, and DeHaan gives a mature, enticing performance. The cast is great to say the least, the emotions drive the movie, and the actors giving off these emotions are splendid.Spider-Man is easily one of the most popular comic book superheroes of all-time, and most would argue he ranks among the top three along with DC's two juggernaut heroes. It was essential that Spider-Man got the movie that he and his fans deserved, and while the film occasionally stumbles on poor dialogue and off-beat pacing (like the atrocious Rhino ending), Spider-Man himself and the action and wit he delivers catapults the film into greater territory, with just a few issues holding The Amazing Spider-Man 2 back from being the best Spider-Man movie of all-time. 8/10","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This is really a shame, because Andrew Garfield really embodies the Spiderman character and Jaime Foxx tried with what he was given. Even though nobody would ever believe that Peter and Gwen are 18 year-olds, that isn't the main problem. The real issue stems from trying to jam too many characters into a single movie. Three villains were not really necessary, and movies can seldom handle 2 main villains (Excluding TDK). The volatile relationships of Peter Parker at this point have become too cliché, and is a reoccurring plot point in every Spiderman movie. The action scenes standout.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Thankfully, the movie delivered.The movie continues the plot of Peter's family and shows more about his dad in this movie and what happened to him etc. It also continues Peter's relationship with Gwen. I thought the plot was good. Sure it felt like it was just a set up to SOMETHING BIG that we will get in the sequels but still, it was good. Some pacing issues here and there but didn't bother me that much. The movie has a humorous tone most of the time but it does get Dark and emotional at times. Adrew Garfield just kills it as Peter Parker/Spiderman. He upped his game from the previous part and it really shows here. The gorgeous Emma Stone also upped her game as Gwen stacy. And as the movie focuses A LOT on their relationship, it was great to see how awesome their chemistry was, improved from the previous part. Hell, I'll even say they are probably the best comic book movie couple. And that is a great thing because much of the plot relied on it. As for the villains, well Jamie Fox was pretty good as Electro. Dane Dehaan was awesome as Harry Osborn, he is a great actor. Wished there were more of the Goblin though as he only had a cameo of sorts in this movie. Seems like the next part will be pretty BIG. The action is awesome in this movie. Best looking spidey scenes in the franchise so far. Loved everyone of them. Spiderman humor made them more awesome. Great CGI. Electro looked pretty cool.Soundtrack was good. The track that was used whenever Electro was on screen was great. That techno/dubstep flowed greatly with Electro as he himself is electricity. :pDon't really get the hate it got from many people. It is in my opinion the BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE to date. The Amazing spider 2 is indeed AMAZING. 8.3/10","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

The script and pace of the reboot were good with a great new cast. Based on the trailers I expected the sequel to be even better.The cast is as great as ever with Andrew Garfield being perfect as Spider-Man and Peter Parker. Emma Stone is still great as Gwen Stacy. She and Garfield have great chemistry going on. Dane DeHaan does good work as Harry. Jamie Foxx feels a bit miscast as Electro but also acts quite well to make up for it. Marc Webb knows how to direct the actors and their scenes feel warm, funny, sad and real.The movies problems lie with it's slightly too long and uneven script. The script could have used some trimming and polishing. The side plot about the past of Richard Parker feels fairly unnecessary and the pace of the movie is completely off. Sad things to notice as in the first movie the pacing was top notch. In the end Electro feels somehow under used and quite mediocre as the villain. I'm also a bit disappointed at how the Green Goblin looks in this incarnation. He needs to look more monstrous and goblin like. The final fight with the Goblin is decent but I expected slightly more from this important scene. All in all the battles range from decent to pretty good. The 3D is good and the effects look great.The most interesting thing about the movie is where it leaves our hero, the other characters and what doors have been opened now. Sadly that in itself tells about the flaws of this movie. It feels like the good actors are prisoners of a mediocre and uneven script. Apart from introducing Harry and few plot twists this movie feels somehow like filler material. It's an extremely flawed film but not without it's merits. Hopefully Amazing Spider-Man 3 will have a better and more balanced script.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

This film had me sitting on the edge the whole way through. I don't usually write these but I thought I just had to get across what an amazing film this is. I was a bit sceptical at first because of how perfectly Toby Maguire executed his role as Spider-Man. At first it seemed to put me off how cocky spider-man was but it seemed to grow on me. I feel that Jamie foxx an unlikely actor to be a villain in spider-man absolutely stormed it. He played his role absolutely effortlessly. The special effects with his character electro had got to be the best to date I really think it made the film something special. I am rather quite saddened that I didn't pay much attention to this film and didn't get to watch it until now and in the cinema because I think that would have been absolutely incredible. I never got to watch the amazing spider-man 1 but if it is anything like this one it has to be incredible . I can't wait for number 3 to come out I will surely be the first to go and get my ticket.

The costume looks awesome (most of the time, some times it's waaay to shiny) The relationships between Peter and Gwen and also between Peter and Harry, feel real. Interesting visual palet. The Gwen climax is pretty good.The Bad: The Max character is just plain stupid, and feels like something straight out of Batman and Robin. The Electro character lacks any real personality or motivation. The Rhino character is perhaps even more stupid than the Max character. Both before and after becoming Rhino. The romance between Peter and Gwen can be a bit too much at times and almost feel like a twilight movie covered with a little Spider-man paint. The doctor Kafka character is also insanely stupid. The movie is so busy building up to the sinister six movie, that this movie forgets to have a plot of it's own and all the interesting story lines that are started in the movie, never reaches a fulfilling end. The little kid in the spider-man costume, feels ridiculous and annoying. People constantly lining up right next where Spider-man is fighting the villains, with no concern for their own safety, and the villains never attack them...apparently because they are standing behind a safety railing...and who the hell puts up all these safety railings so fast every time Spiderman fights. All of the sinister six characters are just some equipment created by Oscorp, essentially making all the characters behind the villains completely irrelevant, as anyone can be the Rhino or Doc Ock. Peters mother and father flee and leave Peter behind to protect him, which makes no sense as in more danger left alone.The worst part is that I could easily keep listing bad things.The movie gets some things right, but also takes hugs steps backwards towards the stupid campy superhero movies like Batman and Robin.5 out of 10","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The film doesn't have a convoluted story. It's very neatly executed and the narration is very easy to follow. This film, in short, is a complete treat for any SPIDER-MAN fan.There's always a lot going on in the film, and the director avoids usage of pointless subplots, which makes each and every sequence integral to the story. There are a lot of touching moments as well. For instance, one brief scene in which Spidey walks along with a young boy is bound to stay with me forever. It made him so lovable and kind that I found it to be one of the best moments in the film. Similarly, the way his web has been shown in slow motion, in one sequence is simply heartwarming.The action is really entertaining. Every action sequence dazzles, and the sprinkling of CGI on it makes it much more fun. The web-slinging sequences have been shot extremely well. The story is very simple and straightforward. Every single performance is remarkable, especially that of Andrew and Emma, while other actors also put up decent acts. The final shot is quite energetic and concludes the film on an epic note. Last but not the least, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is simply an entertaining superhero movie which has loads of entertainment and light hearted fun.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker finds that a greater conflict lies ahead. It's great to be Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). This movie is not as good as the first because most of the villains are just there just to push the plot along. The visual effect's in the movie are okay and the green goblin was just wasted in the movie and that was just a shame. The movie wants you to feel for Jamie Foxx character Electro but the movie fails at trying to make us feel for this guy, why can't there have a scene like in the Lego movie when are main hero has to talk to the villain with one of beautiful and the most touching scene is when he tells the villain that he is amazing person and he can do amazing things without being evil.

It's one of those movies I really, really want to like and sometimes, if I haven't watched it in a while, I can delude myself into believing it was better than I remember. But then I watch it again and it all comes rushing back to me; this movie is unforgivably lame. I wasn't a massive fan of the first AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, where Sony rebooted the series with director Marc Webb and Andrew Garfield stepping into the title role. It was entertaining enough not to discourage me from continued interest in the franchise but failed to recapture the awesome of Sam Raimi's first two films. Leading into the release of AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2, I was excited. Now that we'd gotten the origin story out of the way (again) we could dive into a meatier Spider-Man adventure without the repetitive exposition. Plus they'd scored Jamie Foxx as the main villain and it was apparent they would be bringing the Rhino (one of my favorite Spider-Man lower-level baddies) into the mix with (no joke) Paul Giamatti in the role. The level of excitement was high as May 2nd approached, and then the reviews began to trickle out. The movie was being torn to shreds, but it was all right. I didn't always agree with the critics and summer blockbusters are always polarizing, especially comic films. There was still a chance it could be a fun time. Then I watched it.There's just so much wrong here, I don't know where to begin. Well, for starters, if you want to get an audience excited to settle in for a nearly two and a half hour long comic film, start with an exciting action sequence featuring your hero. You know, Spider- Man. Not his father. The movie opens with an almost ten minute long action sequence with Peter Parker's father on a plane where the movie reopens a plot thread from the first movie that I never got around to caring about: what happened to Peter Parker's parents. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is, amongst many other things, a continuation of this plot thread. Maybe if the movie focused solely on this thread, it would've kept my interest but the movie drops it immediately after this scene and doesn't return until sometime later in the second act when we've already stopped caring and want to see more of the Electro plot. Oh, rightthe Electro plot. We've got Jamie Foxx as our main(-ish) villain! How could this go wrong? Oh right, the writing. I'm not even sure how to best describe how underwritten Electro is in this film. His primary motivation for becoming a super-villain after acquiring his electricity-based superpowers (following an admittedly cool re-awakening scene in the morgue) is that Spider-Man is more popular than him. Prior to his accident, Max Dillon was a non-entity who went through life as a stepping stone in the path of others. A chance meeting with Spider- Man in the midst of a car chase in the beginning of the film spurs a psychopathic obsession with the web-crawler where Dillon is fully convinced that Spider-Man is his new best friend. Then he gains superpowers and decides he wants to kill Spider-Man because he couldn't remember Max's name. Oh, and he's more popular. Seriously, that's it. Electro's motivation in the movie is to kill Spider-Man because he's jealous.Oh, and Paul Giamatti as the Rhino? Man, they really pumped up his character in the trailers and TV ads. At least we've got Rhino, a character who's got to be fun because the concept of a man in Rhino armor is too crazy not to work. Well, Giamatti's role in the movie amounts to little more than a cameo. All that time spent pumping the Spider-Man/Rhino battle in the advertisements and we never actually get to see it. It's the opposite issue with the Green Goblin. First, I think it's a little too soon to be returning to the Harry Osborn/Green Goblin well. We got three movies worth of Harry Osborn in Raimi's series and Willem Dafoe was a fantastic Goblin in the first SPIDER- MAN. So I've already got a little bit of Goblin fatigue. Then we shoehorn Harry's reappearance into the new series with absolutely no foundation and we're expected to accept these two are life-long friends when we've never heard Peter so much as mention Harry before. Yes, people who are familiar with the franchise will know of their history and all that, but as a film it's just lazy to cram this new (supposedly deep- rooted) friendship in and expect people to buy into it. The problem is that the filmmakers were more interested in mimicking Marvel Studios' universe-building than putting out a good movie. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 isn't interested in telling a good story or entertaining youthey want to set themselves up for spinoffs and sequels and spinoffs of sequels. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is nearly two and a half hours long and it can be summed up in one scene. There's a moment near the end where Harry Osborn discusses establishing a team. A small team (hmmsix members, I'm guessing) to do, I don't know, bad guy things. A sinister team. Yes.SINSTER SIXcurrently scheduled for release in 2016.I wouldn't mind so much if the studio had crafted a fun, exciting movie to make us actually want a new spin-off. I'm not exaggerating when I saw that nothing of interest happens in the first hour of this movie. Nothing. You could jump into this movie at the 60 minute mark and you wouldn't have missed anything important. Jamie Foxx and Paul Giamatti were inspired casting, and the effects (especially the Electro effects) were actually pretty good. But THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 never had a chance when the filmmaker/studio went in with the wrong priorities and lazy attitude.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

All the actors in this movie were perfect fitters of their individual roles. I mean like Andrew, Emma, Jamie, Dane did a great job in this film. Each actor's acting was natural even though it was released in 2014.Now talking about the story:
All the chapters in this film were good like Peter meets Harry, Max turns to Electro, Harry and Max teams up, Aleksei escapes from prison and battles Spider-Man. All of these were like just amazing but there was a bit problem in the sequence of this chapters. They can have do better than this but it can be ignored.The direction was also good however it differed from the first film, 'The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)' but still it is an entertaining film.

We spend most of the time, not with Spidey facing off with the bad guys, but working on his relationship with Gwen Stacey. Garfield and Stone still spark off of each other making the whole relationship angle interesting without being sickly. We also get more information about Peter's father and his work with Oscorp which gives this version more depth than the original trilogy.And onto the bad guys. The trailer has given us a glimpse of three villains and there has been some concern over bad guy overkill. Rest assured, while Rhino and the Goblin do make appearances, this is the Electro show. Jamie Foxx's transformation from super geek to super villain is a marvel (sorry) and the special effects for his look are outstanding. At one point in the film I was worried we were going to be treated to a Dr. Manhattan (Watchmen) moment, but thankfully this film is a 12A so a suit is mysteriously added to save everyone's blushes.The new Harry Osborn is an improvement over the whiny James Franco portrayal. Dane Dehaan is suitably cast as a poor little rich boy who shows his true colours when he doesn't get his own way. By the end I wanted to give him a good slap, the sign that he played his part well.Sally Field returns as Aunt May and, although in only a few scenes, she acts others off the screen. When she has a heart to heart with Peter I could feel myself start to choke up (but we'll keep that between ourselves).Garfield and Stone truly shine yet again. Stone's Gwen Stacey is feisty, gorgeous and intelligent, giving the audience a girl who is a believable equal to Peter Parker and Spider-man. Garfield has a tough job having to give us a sarcastic, lovable hero whilst also portraying a young man with relationship troubles and daddy issues. He manages to pull it off, although I admit to preferring his spandex clad Spidey.Fans will be happy to know that there are several hints concerning the future of this franchise as well as spin offs... just keep watching.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Andrew Garfield portray as 'Spiderman' is still watchable but the main and only reason I enjoyed this movie is because of Dane DeHaan. His portray as Harry/Goblin was perfect. As soon as I heard his laugh as the goblin was spectacular. But considering that his portray as the goblin was only about 15 minutes long, I thought that was shocking that this new villain with amazing acting skills and bringing the goblin to life only had over 15 minutes on the big screen was disappointing. As for electro I am not even going to comment on his performance, lets just say how disappointing it is.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I always find Andrew Garfield (smart, witty and funny) and Emma Stone (beautiful, smart and charming) better replacement to Tobey Maguire (a bit dull) and Kirsten Dunst (nagging and crying). These two make whole and soul of Mark Webb's version of Spider-man engaging and more enjoyable. Whenever you see these two leads sharing scorching chemistry, the screen just lights up. This movie uses the advance technological geniuses in Spider-man's flight scenes and action scenes and awesome 3D adds icing to the cake. Dane DeHaan as Green Goblin or Harry Osborn gives a chilling performance and he will be the one to watch out for in next movie in the series. But this amazing experience does not end on a high note. Last 20 minutes into the movie and you are given as many as three climaxes to absorb. Jamie Foxx playing Electro is not given right finish. Rhino makes a very late entry. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Amazing Spider-man 2. Despite its over stretched climax, this one makes a terrific superhero movie experience because of its casting and enjoyable characters.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

There are unnecessary illogicalities and, to me, the drama was more pathetic than upsetting. I didn't feel the chemistry between the leading couple and most of the main actors were irritating to me, except for Sally Field, who was the only one that left a positive impression. The film does not stand out in any way, not even in the visual aspect and CGI, which are usually Marvel's strongest trump card. It's not boring, but it didn't hold my attention and it left me completely indifferent.

He said, ""There are times where we feel obligated to follow the source material, and there are times where we feel the need to deviate from it.""However, personally this thing doesn't really bother me. Spider-Man's costume, especially the eyes, is made more similarly to the original comic costume, unlike the other Spider-Man movies.I really like the villains that are made using combinations of Marvel Comics universe and Ultimate Marvel universe. Electro appears with the background story as in Marvel Comics, but with costume from Ultimate Marvel. Green Goblin is also a mutant as in Ultimate Marvel, even though still keeps his glider from Marvel Comics. Rhino also appears at the end with background story as in Marvel Comics, but without superpowers, rather wearing some kind of iron suit from Ultimate Marvel.As the biggest film production ever made in New York City, this movie entertains viewers with cool metro cityscapes, supported by good visual effects.I also like the cinematography, which made me feel the sensation of falling free from such heights when Spidey swings between skyscrapers, that is the sensation of having butterflies in my stomach.Dub step music that plays during Electro scenes is quite enjoyable too.I certainly like Andrew Garfield more, because he can portray Spider-Man's playful and naughty characteristics, unlike Tobey Maguire's nerd, crybaby, and stupid persona. And of course Emma Stone's superb acting, even as Gwen Stacy, she can create a likable chemistry in their romance, one that can touch your heart, unlike that between Peter and MJ in previous Spider-Man trilogy, which honestly get on my nerves.The appearance of three villains in this movie does not feel too heavy or too rushed. I know that Electro is the main villain, that Spidey's fight with the Green Goblin is very short. But in fact, there are some scenes that are cut to be able to make it for PG-13 rating. Very different with Spider-Man 3 which also features three villains, but the movie feels too fast and forced.Highly recommended!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

A good job was done by all parties involved given the movie's modest (by today's standards) budget. Emma Stone, Sally Field, Jamie Foxx and Felicity Jones round-up a good cast.Andrew Garfield though, truly is the centre piece of this movie. Without him as Emo Spiderman, I doubt that the movie would have been as good as it ended up being.I have not read the comics, so this review is solely based on the movie itself. I found it strange that a lot of people bring up ""Harry Potter"" as the movie they most compare ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" with, but fail to also bring up Stephanie Meyers's novel ""Twilight"" or Hollywood's take on Battle Royale, ""The Hunger Game"". I rather think that ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" has undertones of those stories, and that is a positive thing! Based on this first instalment, I will be in the theatre when the next chapter comes go the big-screen.

So much so that one could easily decry that this is a Chick movie and destroys the Guy elements in it's efforts. Sure there is much excitement, action and story line, but it gets buried in too many branches of the Spiderman myth. Andrew Garfield returns as Spider-Man / Peter Parker and Emma Stone is Gwen Stacy his girlfriend. Theirs is a cursed relationship but they do try and hold it together with a lot of web action sequences. In addition, a new villain, Jamie Foxx appears as Electro who I think was a waste of great talent as the director cloaked him behind way too much makeup which we lose during his transformation. However were it not for the dark settings, audiences could keep track of it all. The best part of this movie is the reappearance of Stan Lee, the creator of the Marvel characters. Sally Field also returns as Aunt May Peter Parker's remaining relative. The most interesting part of this movie waits till it's conclusion and then it awakens audiences with a new villain called Rhino for a the movie itself is concern, it remains a let down and I hope the next will be more cohesive. ****","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

At times I'm fully engaged, and at other times I'm wondering, ""Is this the worst superhero movie ever?"" The spectacle and intrigue are present, and the comic-booky look of the film provides some theme-park-ride-like fun. Nonetheless, TASM2's chaotic editing, over directing, and misguided stylization left me in a web of frustration. TASM2 catches up with Peter, aka Spider-Man, as he's settling into his hero-role, all the while dealing with regular teenage life (girlfriend, graduation, etc). But as is wont to happen in superhero tent-poles, a few big baddies show up to ruin Spidey's day. Giamatti cameos as The Rhino; DeHaan plays Harry Osbourne, heir to the evil Oscorp fortune; and Foxx is mild-mannered Max, who falls into a vat of eels and becomes Electro because, ya knowSCIENCE! Nothing and no one is given any amount of time to develop with simply too many stories and too many characters to manage. Worst of all is the atrocious score. For one glaring example, Electro's theme music is composed of goofy bumbling horns, backed by sinister choir vocals singing his very thoughts (""What's happening to me!"" ""I hate Spider-Man!""). A score shouldn't be overtly noticeable, but especially not overtly bad. Again, some stuff works. Garfield is still a better Spidey than Tobey Maguire ever was, and the icon heavy imagery during the final big battle is beautifully handled. Unfortunately these positives only serve to add to the irritation, that there is a decent reboot to be made here. Regrettably the spidey senses weren't tingling for this one.","2 out of 20 found this helpful.

After Amazing Spiderman, I was very excited to see what Mark Webb had in store next for Peter Parker. My expectations were at an all time high for this one, and for the most part the movie delivered.As with the Amazing Spiderman, we get a wonderful performance by Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker. I know some don't like him but I think he does a great job of embodying the young carefree cockiness I have always loved about Spiderman. Jamie Foxx is also excellent as the villain Electro. He does a great job of making you feel sorry for his situation. The rest of the cast did a fine job and there wasn't anyone that stood out as having a poor acting role in this one.What I think the movie does great, is deal with some very heavy things. I won't go into detail as I don't want to spoil anything but there are no punches pulled in this one. The film tackles some of the biggest moments in the comics and does so head on.What I feel ended up bringing this film down for me was the fight scenes. Although movies don't have to be jam packed with fight scenes, I feel the ones in Amazing Spiderman 2 were just too short. Fights seemed to last seconds and we never really got to explore any of the characters fighting strengths.The movie does clearly set its self for the next film in the series which to be honest I am a little worried about. I didn't like the look of some of the villains who are teased for the upcoming film but as they are barely in this one, I didn't let that sway my opinion of this movie.Ultimately, if your a Spiderman fan you owe it to yourself to check this one out. It may not have fully reached and exceeded my expectations but it is without a doubt an excellent summer blockbuster.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Like an astute artisan, he seamlessly weaves together a stupendous plot replete with equal amounts of action, drama, emotions, romance, and mystery, to dish out one of the most enthralling summer blockbusters that memory can serve. Lending huge gravitas to Webb's opulent vision are the brilliant performances from Garfield, Stone, Foxx, DeHaan, along with terrific editing ,cinematography, and some of the most amazing visual effect and CGI rendered on screen.If you thought that Webb's first cinematic rendition of Spidey was head and shoulder above Raimi's trilogy, then his latest film knocks all three of Raimi's mildly entertaining but poorly adapted movies right out of the park. Those who don't agree with this reboot of Spider-Man, need to view both the films against their predecessors and then perform a little research by way of the source material from the comics and the classic animated series, to see for themselves which versions stack up better against each other. Casual, impassive viewers who might feel that this would constitute as a waste time just for the sake of a film, would be quicker and more capable at differentiating between which is the better made franchise.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Based on those, I was expecting the movie to be unfocused and wandering, and Gwen Stacy to be marginalized as a character.Did those critics even see the same movie? The thematic plot was all about Spiderman and Gwen Stacy, in the episodic form of the original creation. One critic claimed that Peter's wry, subtle joke from the first movie, to the effect that the best promises are those you can't keep, was ignored in this movie. This simply missed the point entirely. The drama is consumed with Peter's conflict between his affection for Gwen, and the danger to which he is exposing her. It's actually rather tightly focused. It is also true to one of the major themes of the original, the media controversy over Spiderman's character (hero or villain?) But most of all, the screenplay manages to capture the considerable wit and badinage of the characters as they first appeared in the 60's.Need I add it was visually spectacular? All in all, a really nice achievement.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The action is loud, the acting is obnoxious, and the overall story is so jumbled and fractured that it is hard to keep track of what is going on. Andrew Garfield delivers a solid performance as Peter Parker while Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx and even the great Paul Giamatti fall flat...right on their faces. Marc Webb confidently directs his action but leaves the actual story and character development for the sidelines. While it is far from the most important thing a Spider Man movie should have, it would have been nice to have a coherent storyline to adhere too. The technical aspects of the film are somewhat mediocre, the CGI effects often look cheesy (ie. Jamie Foxx as Electro), the editing is very choppy and jumbled. This makes for a frustrating watch to say the least. I would say the biggest problem I had with this film was Dane DeHaan. DeHaan is a gifted and talented individual...but this film makes him look like a soap actor. Marc Webb seemingly fails to direct him as Harry Osborne with any confidence or competence, either or, it remains as the most disappointing and frustrating aspects of this film. Overall, the kids are going to enjoy this one, which isn't saying too much. Between the dozens of trailers they released online, when you walk out of Amazing Spider Man 2, you'll see every beat coming from a mile away. If you have kids, they will love this film and be thoroughly entertained...if you have a brain, you might want to switch it off when watching this and try your hardest to enjoy it because I know I didn't.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

For a 2 1/2 hour long movie, TASM2 was not able to tell a very coherent story, nor was it able to really develop any of its characters in a believable way, with the possible exception of Gwen. Both villains went through too quick of a transformation for me to suspend belief. While the romance between Peter and Gwen had some merits due to the real-life chemistry from the two actors, it over-saturated the film and was a major distraction from what the movie was actually about - Spiderman. The action scenes were too short and sparse in between for the number of villains present in this movie (3!!!) I came away not really knowing what this movie was about. Is it about the love story between Peter and Gwen? (But how does that make it a superhero movie) Is it about the evils of corporations? (They referred to it, but it was mostly in the background) Is it about the dangers of self-absorption? (yes, it was the cause of both major villains, but again, point not emphasized). Compare with the Marvel Studios movies that came out recently, one is able to pinpoint to exactly their themes: Captain America - a clash between ideologies on how to achieve world peace, emphasizing on American freedom, with very clear villains (Hydra); Thor - a fantasy story where previously evil defeated creatures try to plunge the world once again in darkness and must be overcome by the good guys, not as deep as Captain America, but nevertheless entertaining because it follows a clear plot line; Iron Man - the struggle of someone who's coping with PTSD and struggling with his identity, exploring the ideas of people wearing masks and deception. Not to mention that the Marvel Studio films were jam- packed with action and keeping the viewer absorbed throughout the entire run-time. Compare that with TASM2, where I was wondering where the villains were and what the conflict was half way into the movie and thinking that it was way too long. This movie could do itself a lot of favors by sticking to just one villain (Electrode) and develop him further, and cut out the romance by half. As it stands, while this movie had some beautiful effects and cool first-person views of Spider Man, it falls short in the story department.","1 out of 13 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The romance is winning, the action thrilling, and the emotional beats moving – in other words, it's a sequel you can safely say is amazing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3009045/?ref_=tt_urv","moviexclusive","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23415028/?ref_=tt_urv","3 May 2014","Despite the inevitable comparison with Sam Raimi's marvellous 'Spider-man 2', Webb's 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is an excellent follow-up to its 2012 predecessor in almost every regard, combining a heartfelt teen romance with thrilling superhero action for a truly vertiginous spin in and around familiar landmarks of New York City.Last we left Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, our favourite couple's relationship was strained by Peter's promise to her late father (Denis Leary) to leave her alone for safety's sake – and despite the obvious giddy chemistry between them, Peter finds himself haunted by visions of her father. Yet there is no shortage of tender intimate moments in their on/off relationship, and let's just say while some of their exchanges will leave you grinning and others will leave you tearing, there is just no denying that their romance is very much the emotional backbone of the whole movie, culminating in a shocking twist at the end which we suspect will leave few viewers dry-eyed.The other part of the movie's emotional core lies with the mysterious disappearance of Peter's parents (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz seen in expanded flashback roles), tied to the shady corporation Oscorp run by Norman Osborn (Chris Cooper) which was also responsible for Curt Connors' mutating Lizard seen in the last film. While his Aunt May (Sally Field) has tried to keep the truth from him, Peter can't quite find closure without knowing why - and the return of his childhood pal Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) to take over the Oscorp business reignites his curiosity how his parents' fates were related to some top-secret experiment that his father Robert was working on with Norman before the former's death.Oh and did we mention that Gwen also happens to be an employee of Oscorp while awaiting her entry into Oxford? That reeks smack of narrative convenience, but it does engender one of the most delightful meet-cute moments between Peter and Gwen that takes place in a broom cabinet in the Oscorp building no less. The necessity of weaving together the multiple story lines has Gwen digging into a former Oscorp engineer named Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), who is transformed after a lab accident involving a loose fuse and a tank of eels into the electrically charged villain Electro.Of the numerous characters which inhabit the movie, Electro probably stands as the most redundant. There is something fascinating about the lowly and unappreciated Max at first, an individual so resigned to his own insignificance that he becomes obsessed with Spider-Man after a chance encounter on the street. Nonetheless, his psychosis – as well as his defining characteristic – fades into convention upon his transformation, while a surfeit of CGI take over to emphasise the extent of his destructive powers amidst an electrically-powered urban backdrop.The more fascinating villain here turns out also to be the more familiar one, as Harry's frustration with his inborn frailties lead him on a path of rising animus with Spider-man and by extension Peter. While Harry's character arc is not much different from that in Raimi's version, DeHaan's chilling turn as the increasingly deranged Oscorp heir is far superior than what James Franco ever brought to the role. If you don't yet know him from 'Chronicle' or the Beat-era drama 'Kill Your Darlings', this is as notable an introduction as any, an initially sympathetic figure whose tragic circumstance leads him to become cynical and sinister within the same breath.Notwithstanding their respective motivations, Webb exploits both his villains for some hugely entertaining action showdowns. Electro's descent upon Times Square midway through the film marks one of the definite highlights. No less impressive is Electro's climactic battle set amidst New York's key power grid, that makes thorough use of the numerous electric stacks for some mesmerising luminous shots from cinematographer Dan Mindel and a pulsing sub-dubstep score by Hans Zimmer and the bespoke collective known as The Magnificent Six for an electrifyingly gripping finish.But Webb saves his most distinctive sequence for the last, with Spider- man confronted with the rise of the Green Goblin who knows his identity as Peter and therefore also his soft spot for Gwen. Symbolically set within a clock tower whose gears and ticking hands take on a whole new meaning by the time the dust settles, it reps one of the most tough- minded but simultaneously poignant endings in a superhero movie that we have seen, thrusting our titular character in an entirely new – and ultimately very exciting – direction. Webb's forte as a director was always in his ability to forge affecting relationships between his characters, and the emotional payoff he delivers here is truly something to be reckoned with.Certainly he has his actors to thank for that. British actor Andrew Garfield continues to grow ever more comfortable in the role of Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. He starts off goofy, cocky even, but ever more conscious of how he might be power-ful in saving the citizens of New York but power-less in protecting the ones close to him. There is little more we need to say about the spark that Garfield shares with his real-life girlfriend Emma Stone, except that they make an irresistibly winning couple. Foxx is better portraying his character's tortured psyche as Electro than as Max, but Giamatti absolutely chews up the scenery in the few scenes he has playing the Rhino.Arguably, neither prove as compelling as they should be, with DeHaan's Green Goblin the only interesting villain that the movie has going for it. But what it lacks in malevolence, this crowd-pleasing sequel makes up for in teenage sass, unexpected poignancy and oh yes good old- fashioned Hollywood spectacle. It may not top Raimi's benchmark, but it is mammoth summer popcorn entertainment of the highest calibre, finally living up to the addition of the adjective 'amazing' to this trilogy's title.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

""How bad was it?"". To be fair, I've seen Spider-Man 1, 2, 3 and the first Amazing Spider Man. So far, they were all great (except 3). I had very high expectations for this to be decent enough. What can possibly go wrong? As soon as the lights went down in the movie theater, I was excited.The first 10 minutes were catchy. It's getting interesting with back-story and appealing visuals. All of sudden, it goes downhill. First thing's first, the actor who played Harry was completely wrong and miscasted as this character. This Dane DeHaan guy makes James Franco's portrayal of the same role look like Al Pachino! Next, it started getting really slow after the 30 minute mark and it felt like an eternity until the credits started rolling.It's pretty clear that Jamie Foxx (who is a talented actor) couldn't refuse the paycheck. Also, that Rhino dude was unintentionally hilarious to the point where the film literally took itself way too seriously. Now I know that Andrew Garfield is a fantastic actor but sometimes, the confusing writing forces him to do things that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. For example, Peter stalks Gwen to her appointment for admissions to this college she got accepted into. He then fraudulently poses as a college staff member to the woman at front desk and it isn't even clever/believable. Here's another issue I had with this over-hyped superhero flick. Peter dresses up as Spider-Man at Harry's request. Out of nowhere, Harry tells him that he's dying (I'm guessing that the cause of it is alcohol poisoning) and asks for his blood. ""Spider-Man"" makes up excuses, leaves, and sends Harry in a drunken rage making it a pointless filler scene for Harry to be shown as a a villain for less than 20 minutes of screen time. Overall, the special effects were impressive but the script was obviously rushed and it was surprisingly boring. Even in 3D, this was a flop!","1 out of 16 found this helpful.

I watch these Movies because I want to see Action. Fast cut scenes, bombastic explosions, amazing special-effects and breathtaking Fightscenes - if possible in Slowmotion. This kind of attrition war fares attract the young audience - me included - and this is what they want to see ( which is also the reason why we soon will be literally flooded with Superhero Movies by Marvel and DC).And in exactly this point ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Rise Of Electro"" convinced and surprised me equally: The entire Optic looks amazing, especially in 3D. Slowmotion, spectacular tracking shots and the fight- scenes with the villain Electro are a feast for eyes and ears, especially if you watch the Movie in Dolby Atmos! The soundtrack fits perfectly and supports the appearance of Electro fantastic - goosebumps guaranteed. However, besides of the gimmickry the Movie offers something else, which differentiates it positive from the plenty of other Superhero Movies: Humanity. Then unlike other Movies of this type, is Spider-Man no Billionair nor a Mastermind; Spider-Man alias Peter Parker is a normal guy, how it could be everyone: With normal problems and in a difficult stage of life where he has to face multiple inner conflicts. This should especially address the younger target audience, in some scenes maybe even pierce to their heart. The movie manages it surprisingly well to make the cluster of human problems tangible for the viewer, always with the right balance between the emotional confused Peter Parker and the with Electro confronted Spider-Man. The chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is beyond perfect and creates a emotional connection with the love couple and the audience.Anyhow, the Movie is absolutely entertaining and delivers Action, Drama, Romance and the typical Spider-Man slapstick humor. The viewer gets his money worth.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Due to all the mixed or negative critics that the second Marc's Webb adaptation to the cinema of the superhero had received, I didn't have any special expectation. When the movie started, I felt nervous, and when it finished, I felt at ease with it. I think that it's the best Spider-Man movie ever made, even before those marvelous Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 of the Sam Raimi's trilogy. Personally, my favorite hero is Batman, so I'm used to that kind of dark and gloomy superhero. And this has been the first time that I really enjoyed watching a funny superhero in action, excepting Kick-Ass'. Tobey Maguire was a good election for the character, but soon he became a boring interpretation of Peter Parker (you can see a good example in his continuous debates with Aunt May or Mary Jane, a character that I never liked, and his stupid 'bad guy' actuation in Spider-Man 3, the worst movie in my opinion). I liked him, but Andrew is the real Peter Parker. Shy with girls, funny , clever and always clumsy. The special effects of the new feature film are outstanding, as well as his slow motion 'Spider Sense' sequences, a thing that I think Sam Raimi used as less as possible in his trilogy. Emma Stone brings a new kind of girl that we could discover in The Amazing Spider-Man, but we can feel in this new film. There is not an overabundance of characters. Instead of that, the screenplay plays with a lot of different histories, so that the effect caused is similar to the one is Love Actually. You cannot get bored with this film! The villains, both Electro and the Green Goblin are better created than the ones in other films, like that awful Venom, the ridiculous Sandman and the boring Lizard. This film, in my opinion is the best of the saga. I can just say that it deserves at least an 8 out of 10, and from there going up. Better than Sam Raimi's saga, Captain America The Winter Soldier and The Amazing Spider-Man. Worst than The Dark Knight Trilogy, by Christopher Nolan. Thanks.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I just wished it got over.Too many characters (not as many as X-men has though) - but still the production team seems to be unable to weave those into a nice thrilling experience.And I know, movies don't care too much about scientifically possible facts - but the things shown (small things) in the movie made it totally ridiculous.

However, in my opinion, the sequel came out much bigger, and at the same time the picture became much darker. ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is trying to exceed the expectations of viewers, but the reviews are still contradictory. As a result, this project is still one of the most controversial films about a friendly neighbor.Mark Webb raises the stakes. He explores new facets of the possible in the genre of superheroics. His new film looks much more colorful, but at the same time much darker than the previous one. Something noir is added, and the poisonous blue colors of the new Electro villain get along perfectly with the dark picture that dominates this project. Especially if you compare this movie with its predecessor.The plot and one of the antagonists, Electro, look rather dubious. I love this picture for something else entirely, but now I have to come to terms with such a clumsy villain who does not undergo any evolution on the screen, literally turning from a corporate employee beaten down by everyone into a wild and violent monster in the frame, which for some reason blames Spider-Man for his troubles. It looks far-fetched, but you have to put up with these facts.There are several other storylines in the film, one of which is the appearance of Parker's childhood friend named Harry Osborne. This is undoubtedly the decoration of the painting. Actor Dane Dehaan did a great job with the role, showing a very different hero in this project. I would especially like to note the dubbing of the picture. Anton Kolesnikov undoubtedly gave the hero depth for the Russian-listening audience. The dubbing actor subtly felt his character and became the nerve of this person, keeping the audience in suspense until the finale of the picture.The relationship between Peter Parker and Harry Osborne is interesting and plausible. Childhood friends are simultaneously happy to meet again, but at the same time they are wary of each other. It feels like they are not ready to trust as they did in childhood. It is understandable. A lot of time has passed, each of them has changed. The evolution of their relationship is particularly interesting in the picture. But the growing conflict will definitely make you follow what is happening on the screen with interest until the very end.There is a special interest in the picture in the relationship between Peter and Gwen Stacy. They're together, but it's not that simple. Garfield perfectly shows Parker's experiences, and a competent production makes it clear how hard it is for the guy, because in the last picture he made a promise that he can't seem to keep. The scales are tipped one way, then the other, and the main character can't make a choice. Parker is Spider-Man. But at the same time he is also Peter, a guy who is no stranger to human feelings. And one of those is love for Gwen. But for a superhero, there is always a danger that his loved ones will be the target of numerous villains. However, Gwen makes her own choice. She wants to be with Peter. He is ready to follow the girl to the other side of the world, if necessary.Gwen Stacy is the soul of the film. Beautiful and smart, responsible and independent, she is ready to make fateful decisions, is guided by good intentions, wants to help the Spider and save the residents of the city. Her arch in the film evokes warm feelings. The heroine becomes a native, and Emma Stone, who plays a girl, is gorgeous in this role.The film exceeds two hours of timekeeping. However, all this time is needed to reveal the stories of each hero, which turned out to be a lot in this picture. The pace of the narrative and the picture lead to an inevitable ending, which is especially difficult to observe. The denouement is pressing, the events in which the creators of the picture put the audience are alarming, and competent staging does not allow them to forget this picture for a long time. The finale is fascinating, makes you rethink your life. He teaches you to enjoy every day, to love your loved ones and never forget that every person's life is a whole world with its own difficulties, joys, insults, grief, wounds and many others.The second picture about Andrew Garfield's Spider turned out to be controversial, but for me personally, this film is one of the most beloved and memorable. This is a different level of superheroics. The painting teaches us to appreciate life, friendship, and love. After all, it is impossible to exist otherwise.10 out of 10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

After opening with a pretty good prologue, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a downhill trip from there & follows Peter Parker enjoying his life fighting crime as Spider-Man but having hallucinations of Gwen Stacy's deceased dad whenever he is with her. But soon he has other things to deal with as new villains in town arrive starting with a Spider-Man obsessed fan who after a mishap mutates into Electro. Next comes Harry Osborn who later transforms into Green Goblin & last we have Rhino but the less I talk about this ass-wimp, the better it is.Director Marc Webb tries to do so many things at once in this sequel that the movie as a whole becomes entangled in its own webbing & not a single one of its sub-plots come out as well as one would've liked. The screenplay is dull, camera-work is more focused on 3D experience than contributing to the story, editing leaves so many unnecessary scenes in tact, VFX is where most of its quarter-billion budget seems to have been expended, the entire plot has no sense of direction, characterization is poor & even Hans Zimmer's music fails to deliver this time.The very few things likable about it is the new Spidey costume which now closely resembles the comic books look, the Gwen/Peter chemistry that's on or off throughout the film, Peter/Harry friendship that should've been further explored & the scenes involving Aunt May which feel most authentic on an emotional scale. The recurring cast has done the same job they did in the last film, adding nothing new to talk about in this one. Jamie Foxx hams his way through as Electro, Dane DeHaan has better moments as Harry than Green Goblin & Paul Giamatti's Rhino is far worse than imaginable.And don't be blinded by the false advertisement going on here as Electro plays the main villain, Green Goblin is present only during the final moments but not for too long & Rhino almost doesn't even exist in this film. On an overall scale, the 2nd chapter of this needlessly rebooted franchise delivers another lackluster cinematic experience & proves that the team has learned nothing from the mistakes it made in the last movie. Adding more extravagant elements into its production only to later end up choking on it, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is far less amazing than what it's selling itself as. Do yourself a favour & waste your money on something else","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Last Sequence of the Movie , Pretty BADASSSSSSSSSSSSS!!Overall, it's a great start to the summer as it's a fun entertainer.Don't Compare it with CA 2.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This series excited me from the moment the reboot was announced because I felt like I might get more the the comic book feel Spider-Man. And the first one The Amazing Spider-man delivered that but was hindered by small problems mostly due to trying to retell a familiar story in a fresh approach. I knew the sequel would probably be better and Im happy to report that it is in almost every way. First the 3D is better than ever let me just get that out. The romance this time around felt way more believable and kept me interested. Unlike the soap opera feel that Toby and Kirstin had this romance feels fun and interesting. People have been complaining the movies tries to juggle too many villains. I can say for sure that this is Electro's show and Green Goblin has a minimal role as well as Rhino. Jamie Fox as Electro is a genuine creep. The kind of guy you want to know about when he moves into your neighborhood. He is such a lonely man that it has twisted him into a man who is too weird not to be alone. The fight scenes between him and Spider-Man are truly awesome to behold. Andrew Garfield is having more fun here and he has fully settled into his tights. His Spider-Man continues to be more fun than Toby's spider- man. I felt Spider-man seemed even more appreciated in the movie than any of the other films and that combined with Hans Zimmer's new score make for a movie that is hard not to sit there smiling.There is more heart to this sequel. For a movie boasting bigger action and special effects and villains I found this to be up there next to Spider-Man 2 for having a heartfelt story. Although I still rate Spider-Man 2 as my favorite in all the Spider-Man movies this is my second favorite. It almost feels unfair to compare the 2 series as they are both trying something different. This sequel is defiantly the most fun I've had watching a Spider-Man movie. At the end of the day comic book junkies will complain and critics will complain about the comic book qualities but if you just want to have fun and see a great Spider- Man film this wont disappoint. Don't walk in expecting an Oscar movie and you wont walk out disappointed. If you do then its your fault for not liking it and who cares about your ranting wont change anything. When the credits rolled I was upset knowing I had to wait 2 more years to see the next. 8 out of 10 for me. Thanks for reading.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Everything looks so big.The plot is a known story. Electrode. Another super villain made of electric eel ! 3D is amazing and watching yourself to go jump and swing like a Spiderman is just great. Story makes you stick to your sits for most of the movie. Action scenes are just great, thanks to the skills of director. Love story between Spiderman and Gwenn is romantic and a plus point. The background score is another plus point of this movie.Though there are some negative points to the movie as well. Electro role is bit confusing, you don't sympathize him neither you hate him.

Plus Jamie Foxx was terrible in this, he is a terrific actor when given good material, but this was awful. Sony really does not know how to make a good Spider-man movie, which is a pity cause it should be very easy to do with all the source material and history of the character.

This must be the strongest point of the movie. If you love Visual Spectacles and don't care much for anything else, you'll love this. + Dane DeHaan is without doubt the best actor in the movie portraying Spidey's arch nemesis Green Goblin once again in the form of Harry Osborne + Andrew Garfield is again solid as Peter Parker with his quick witty jokes + Emma Stone! + The Action Sequences (especially with Electro) are unique and cool in the sense they are like straight out of a comic book or a video game!This obviously leaves me with less interest in the sequel, but I'll be keeping an eye on the spin-off Sinister Six movie!★★★☆☆ 3.5 out of 5 stars","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

He feels real somehow and i really like Gwen in it, she is full of sparks and a girl any man would fight for.The antagonists on the other are trash. They lack deep, and when u look at them all you can think of are lost kids stuck in puberty with no strong character whatsoever. You want a supervillain to be strong minded with purpose and real hate pulsing through their veins, not this. They are simpleminded and all you do is pity them.Real hate doesn't just pop up one day all of a sudden. There is no sense of evil around, just deluded fools with no psyciatrist to help them walk with both legs.I still liked the movie despite the the trash antagonists. Peter parker meeting up in his past was awsomely done. Also his affection to Gwen and the struggle in his heart due to the past felt real.the only thing bad was the supervillains..they are on same level as jar jar binks. clowns to get younger people be able buy a cinema ticket.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If Horner scored TAS2, then this picture would have been a ten out of ten. Despite the music, this film has great action, heart stopping performances from cast, and earns a solid A + for the flawless visual and special effects.

The soundtrack is outstanding, but how can you expect less when the great Hans Zimmer is involved? Everyone in the cast was a great fit for their roles, especially the insanely talented Dane Dehaan, who you should definitely keep an eye on. Jamie Foxx was a good choice for Electro, the action scenes with him were absolutely superb and definitely the best part of the movie, however the average and corny writing kept his character from truly shining. The mystery behind Peter's parents and his relationship with Gwen are deeply explored in the movie, although there were many moments where those scenes actually felt more like unnecessary fillers instead of investing you emotionally into the characters and the story. There were however some truly unexpected moments that will definitely surprise you, but without giving any spoilers away, i just want to say that the second half of the movie is definitely better and leaves you wanting to see what the sequel brings.To give a quick summary of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, it was a movie with very interesting villains, visually stunning action scenes and a superb soundtrack, but it also contained some unnecessary filler scenes that were mainly ruined by poor writing, and even with the 2hr+ runtime it still felt rushed and left me wanting more. I give this movie a 7.5/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was very impressed. It did have a lot I did not like, but overall it was still good.-The story was good, but super packed. It was not really packed with the villains like it looks, but there's the two main villain stories kinda going at the same time, and Peter and Gwen drama on top of that, and some kinda unnecessary parent drama that added nothing to the story but worked for character development.-Still though, the film's over 2 hours and there is not a lot of action. But add a darker tone which I thought was great and a much better story that stays really true to the comics. So true. No spoilers guys, but there was the second most nervous I have ever been, and then the film got deep. Yeah.-Also this movie had some bold moments! That one scene in the trailer with time square blowing up? Yeah you bet some innocent people probably died, which adds a level of realism to the film.-Zimmer delivered a great score! Best Spider-Man score, easily. It is very updated and almost dub-step, but also fun and heroic, but also 12 Years a Slave deep. Yeah I'll buy it.-Also CG was on par. Could be an Oscar contender, but won't win for special effects.-The acting. Meh. Jamie Fox did great and Andrew Garfield was amazing. Get it? Amazing? Anyway. A few of the other cast members had their good moments and their iffy moments. I cringed at least once or twice.-Content was fine. It was action packed. Also deep. That's kinda it.-So, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was good! I liked a lot of elements and I did not like a lot of elements, but overall, it is my new favorite Spider-Man movie and I would recommend it! Unless you don't like Spider-Man or have not seen the 2012 reboot.-I will say The Amazing Spider-Man 2 gets a 7.5/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Smh idk 🤷
Garfield's almost equally cring worthy attempt to be comic book witty, cute and charismatic comes off as simply cheesy and over done.Among a whole host of other poor qualities this film exudes that I don't have the energy or movie phile vocabulary to convey, all I can say is protect your sanity and avoid this train wreck.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The actor .. who I later found out to be British and that explained A LOT (Andrew Garfield) blew every line, every moment, stilted, and apologetic over every scene and he should be. I have been to Britain (4 times and worked with brits (over a year all in... smart, clever, rude (it's OK to be rude if you are clever about it ... in Britain)) and ALWAYS apologizing for ... the air they breathe. Big hair does not make great acting. He may be a great actor and I wish him all the best in Shakespeare, self effacing apologetic, colonialism, wedding funeral movies ever made. .. but Spiderman ... a GOOD soul given superpowers ... conflicted over his family and future family choices .... American ... and they cast Andrew Garfield.. in a word NOPE.Please pay Tobey Maguire to do the next one or let the Franchise just DIE. Toby's awkwardness, hesitation, honesty (but never apologetic) approach IS SPIDERMAN. His natural flow (fun) countered by his dating nightmare moments IS Spiderman (from the comics -i.e. the real story line).The writing was different and some say worse. But the real crime ... and two wrongs DO make a right ... please (I am kidding for read-atorial drama - please do not arrest me) Someone shoot the casting director and every exec accountant who approved the actor and the haircut.Other reviews stated this was an accounting corporate film studio formula... just gone wrong. I am an accountant ... and can believe that was the tragedy that caused this film. But I tell my clients use accountants as spice in your business. For GOD's sake, never let us run your business. If we had the vision, drive and insight to run your business ... we would. But let us run it ... and watch it die BY THE NUMBERS.","0 out of 15 found this helpful.

Plus I saw it in 3D which made it SO much better! My review won't be biased in that sense however.Spiderman is a story/universe that has SO much going on in it... apparently Sony and Marvel know that but don't know how to deal with it. They couldn't make up their minds on what to include in the movie. Love story between Gwen and Spiderman? Sorrowful absent father story between Peter and his dad? Beginning intro for the sinister six story line? An ""I feel bad for you"" story between the Osbornes? ANOTHER ""I feel bad for you"" story with Aunt May and Peter?? It even ended in a way that had the studios probably telling the director to cut it because it could've easily gone on infinitely...It did have its good points... just the visuals were amazing. I got chills seeing Electro do his thing and hearing the menacing dubstep music every time he appeared. But again, there was just too much... SO MANY things could have been left out of the movie.Also, I'm not a fan of Andrew Garfield. He's a good actor but just doesn't do it for me as a Peter Parker/Spiderman.I'll still leave a 9 stars for my own grading but for anyone else that reads this, for an overall movie grade, I give this more of a 6 or 7.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This sequel is a nice addition but also a bit disappointing. It starts weird as the humor level is amped up a lot since the previous part. I guess someone said the last part was too dark, so they tried to make it more humorous this time. Eventually the story becomes a bit more serious again but I get a little bit ""desperate to be funny"" kind of feel from this movie. But I do like how it deepens the Peter Parker's story about how he tries to find the truth about his parents. But the action side is a bit mess. I think the digital effects are bit overused... I try not to be a ""cgi always sucks"" kind of guy but this movie is a good example that too much is too much, just flashy effects all the time. The villains are not very good, I don't so much care about Electro. Harry Osborn is a cool character but his part falls a bit short. The ending suggests that a third part of the trilogy might be coming but it did never happen. That's a pity actually because there was potential.It's not too bad movie but not my favorite either.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Well, I didn't like The Amazing Spider-Man and part two may have been worse.There were just way too many slow tearful moments. I mean... who didn't cry in this movie? This was a soap opera with some action. I've never seen the Twilight series, but this movie is what I imagine the Twilight series is like.The fight scenes were OK but nothing that hasn't been seen already in the four prior Spider-Mans. There was a nice tie in to the first The Amazing Spider-Man, but story-wise there was not much there. Summertime is for action and oohs and aahs. TAS2 provided some action, no oohs and aahs but instead plenty of melodrama and give-me-a-break high school romance. Not a good follow up to the first. I'm sure they'll do a third installment, but it needs to be significantly better.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

Web slinging action, teen drama, action, more drama. Their was some comedy, but that doesn't really matter. GOOD plot, GOOD villains, GOOD cast. The plot in the first one was smarter and just better. The first one wasn't as intense as this one though. The only reason that I like the villains in this one better was because they really had an impact on Spiderman. The Lizard had a dramatic back story to where you feel bad about his character, but so did Electro, who actually turned out to be a cooler villain than I thought he would be. Plus if you add the two other villains in you realize this is going to be an intense movie from the start.

For the first half we get, a reason Pete's parents left, introduction and origin of Electro, Harry Osborn introduction, showing Oscorps inner evil, what Aunt May, Gwen and Peter's relationship woes and a 15 minute action sequence that adds nothing to the film. There is so much crammed into the first half I'm surprised I didn't get whiplash, some of the set up works like Harry, Electro and Oscorp but the rest is just so unnecessary. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy Peter's parents but it actually set the ending up in quite a smart way, the action sequence was good as well but apart from kind of connecting to the ending doesn't add anything the narrative of the movie. There are some weird things in here like the relationship with Gwen, it worked so well in the first one their chemistry was on fire but here it just felt very clunky and didn't really mesh too well with what they portrayed in the first. Gwen is given a little bit more to do but much like the action sequence it doesn't really add much to the movie, there are other way to show their feelings.I will say Jamie Foxx was awesome, granted what he was given wasn't the best. His character takes a massive leap for no reason but there is never a dull moment when he's on screen though, he just chews the scenery. Dane Dehaan does similar thing but there isn't a negative with anything he does in fact I'd say he's probably the best written character. Which is weird because he was such a vital part of the original trilogy, you'd think seeing him again wouldn't be compelling but it was. There two are easily the reason to watch this, everything else is just fairly ok with some good parts.The ending of this was fantastic, it gets me every time. Just wished they'd mixed this and the alternative together then it'd bring 2 subplots to a close nicely instead of having to choose between the 2. That's a small gripe as it only effects 2 minutes of the ending overall but doesn't subtract from it too much.Much like Spider-Man 3, there was a lot of studio interference they wanted to do one thing whilst Marc Webb wanted to do something else. This could have been great if they had let him take the reins, shame though as they just over stuffed the movie with fluff.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Stuff you're actually supposed to laugh at instead of Toby Maguire's stupid dance in the black suit just being funny for how truly bad it was. The story arc they choose to develop in the second installment is a much better choice than the original as well. Looking into the lives of Peter's parents is something the common viewer had no clue about. I hope they continue to explore these stories in the new potentially 9 movie reboot.

From the start, the camera is swinging and twirling between skyscrapers right along with its CGI-enhanced vigilante. It's a far cry from the modest deployment in ""Spider-Man"" (2002) of the cable-suspended ""Spydercam."" There are no static greenscreen views of the Green Goblin in this one; no, he looks ridiculous for entirely different reasons this outing. Plus, the slow-motion effects move with the camera this time, are more consistent throughout, and are relevant to the climax instead of merely looking derivative of a Zack Snyder trademark. Since superhero movies are largely about spectacle, this isn't a complete failure. Now, about the rest of the movie....Vigilantes and criminals flying around and knocking each other about is only so compelling, so it helps when there's something narratively to ground it. Spiderman is promising relative to other comic-book series because it has a built-in meta-narrative, of Peter Parker's profession as a photographer, complimenting his spectacle in spandex by also being the recorder of that spectacle with the publication of his snapshots in the ""Daily Bugle."" Like Clark Kent and Lois Lane, but more visual instead of written--perfect for cinema. ""Far From Home"" (2019) succeeded in largely transferring this visual storytelling within the picture to the arch-enemy and the business of projecting images--films-within-the-film. Alas, such photographic reflexivity hardly factors in to the ""Amazing Spider-Man"" reboot. When not web-slinging, this Peter Parker spends most of his time in a will-they-won't-they teen love drama and combatting that out-of-control research lab, as well as playing with his crazy board and a secret subway car in his search of his father's work. Excessive and none too interesting.There seemed to be some promise to the Electro villain, too. While nothing came of his being black, or having apparent psychological problems and feeling underappreciated, his first big confrontation with Spidey occurs in front of jumbo screens in Times Square. The police in this one also seem to be miraculously quick at partitioning off spectators outside the boundaries of these action sequences. It's like street theatre. Shot of Spidey shooting webs and Electro firing bolts, followed maybe by footage of people in peril, then it cuts back to Gwen Stacy and other bystanders occupying the space of our surrogate movie viewers inside the movie. Perhaps, a decent plot could've been made of the superhero and supervillain competing for flattering publicity as well as for whose fastest at using their powers to overcome the other. But, no, the picture quickly diverts from this tract in favor of some petty supervillain team-up.""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) added to the photographic storytelling that of Mary Jane as an actress, so an actress-playing-an-actress. This offered the opportunity for plays-within-the-play that could compliment and reflect the outer narrative. A photo-journalist and a thespian instead of just a couple high-school grads and amateur scientists. Maybe it's just a coincidence that the will-they-won't-they of the romance wasn't as tiresome there, either.Another unique opportunity with this comic-book supe is that the movies usually portray him as a teenager. So, his discovery and eventual mastery of his powers can work as a puberty parable. Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" did quite well in this regard methinks. ""Homecoming"" (2017) added call-backs to past high-school movies. But, this Spidey is just some jerk who can't keep a promise and who is the catalyst for all this city destruction, from passing off the work his dad went to the trouble of hiding as his own leading to the lizard of the first movie, to stealing from a convenience store killing his uncle and burglarizing a lab creating his superpowers, which in this sequel inspire other wackadoos to seek revenge against him. The ""Daily Bugle"" is right; he's a menace.The only thing worthwhile here outside of the spectacle is the pun in one scene of Peter and Aunt May literally hiding their dirty laundry from each other.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The only truly redeeming part of this haphazard sequel was the casting of Jamie Foxx as Electro. His performance is stellar amidst (and in spite of) the drudging script and an ensemble of cringe-worthy performances from the rest of the cast. But that's really all it has going for it. The graphics aren't much better or any more believable than the first ""Amazing Spiderman"" of which this is based. I appreciated the overall plot line somewhat, but not enough to suggest that anyone else subject themselves to the 2+ hours of torture. This movie, in fact, isn't even good enough to have playing in the background while you are working on something else and aren't even paying attention to it. I actually would like to keep writing about how bad this movie really is, but I keep getting more and more worked up as I go along, and I'm afraid I might blow a fuse in my brain if I get bent out of shape any further.

I wasn't expecting much since I didn't think the last Spiderman was very good and I got about what I expected. And this time, I thought the special effects weren't even that good because it was just too cartoony looking. With all the Matrix slow-mo and Spidy dodging bullets and flying around, it just looked more like animation.In this sequel, Spiderman faces Electro and the Green Goblin yet again. One thing, they could have had anyone play Electro because most of his screen time is when he's been transformed and blue and not even looking like a real person. No need to give Jamie Foxx a big pay check. And could they have had anymore ridiculous, fake looking electric eels.And about half the film is Peter and Gwen's ""sticky"" relationship situation. It just makes for a boring storyline. Also Electro has no real motivation for hating Spiderman other than Spidy forgot his name. Just silly. At least Harry got a good costume for the Goblin this time.FINAL VERDICT: Don't pay to watch this. I saw it on cable. I think it is only good for background noise. I wouldn't recommend anyone run out to see it.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

While Tobey McGuire's Peter Parker was more similar to the comics, his Spider-Man was lacking the humour and charm that Garfield's really nailed, especially in this sequel.The story to this was gripping, while some parts were a little more unclear than others, I found that for the most of it, I was on the edge of my seat tensed up. As the film plays out and you see how hard it is to be Peter and Spider-Man without making huge sacrifices make him more sympathetic and it also makes him more susceptible to mistakes, which is shown more and more as it goes on that balancing his life and his ""side job"". The way that they made the major villains so much more vibrant and made them stand out better than their original creations visually, while sticking somewhat to the root of their evil upbringings.Jamie Foxx was a great Max Dillon and an even more engaging Electro. The way he looked was unbelievable, making his glowing skin with the current of electricity circulating through his body is so beautiful and is extraordinary to look at, without being too distracting from his character.Spider-Man's new suit, is also very reminiscent of more recent comic books, particularly the Ultimate costume. The raised webbing on his suit, his web shooters blending in more and looking more sleek and best of all, the way his eyes look. By far my favourite look for the web head.All in all, if you're a comic fan and love creative deviations, without straying a long ways away, then give this a shot. There isn't a lot to lose, and you may even be surprised how this holds up to the previous trilogy. Personally, I'd love to see Webb and Garfield continue the series and continue to top themselves.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story is lackluster, and has so many plot-points that are either dropped, or go nowhere. Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Spider-man is much more lighthearted and fun but confusing on his motivations. The story continues from the also dropped plot points of the first Amazing Spider-man movie and does nothing satisfying nor entertaining with it. Jamie Fox's Electro is the only fun part, he tries his best with the dumb cartoonish character he is given. The green goblin is a wasted villain who only exists to be put on the poster, as with Rhino who is awful and cartoony in this film. The music is awful, Hanz Zimmer doesn't seem like he put any effort into the score, and Pharell Williams puts out of place songs everywhere. The special effects are amazing with the Spider-man web slinging shots looking the most realistic, and are overall fun. The plot is dumb, the writing is atrocious, but it's the best looking Spider-man movie ever made. This film has a little bit of style, but no substance. If you're a die-hard Spider-man fan, than just turn your brain off, or watch it out of curiosity.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I never found her annoying in other movies. Jamie Foxx nails it as Electro, but his character is never fully fleshed out - from pushover geek to powerful villain in 5 minutes. Dane DeHaan and Colm Feore are great and fascinating actors, and I liked their scenes. Still, they deserved a better script. Aunt May is tired, aging and hustling for double work shifts to put Peter Parker through college, yet I never saw him in one class. Later on, Peter Parker mourns someone at a grave site through winter, spring, summer and fall - it was a bizarre and depressing montage. I grew up on the Tobey Maquire Spider-Man movies.

Music, settings, costumes, sounds, sfx.... all flawless. I was happy to learn that Hans Zimmer can still surprise me. I knew that he can annoy me but here I have nothing but compliments for the score. -------------- Under the line : Part two felt a bit more sound than the 1st part and I'm still under the impression that I had an enjoyable time in cinema and that the money was well spent.

The three films, featuring Toby Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman are the fifth, sixth and seventh highest grossing superhero movies ever – a testament to their popularity.While Webb did introduce a few new elements into the story, including a more confident Peter Parker played by Andrew Garfield, and a continuing subplot concerning Peter's parents, it did not reach the heights of its predecessors.That may also turn out to be the case with The Amazing Spiderman 2: Rise of Electro. If so it will be through no fault of those involved in the film, for they have done – if you'll pardon the pun – an amazing job.The chemistry between Garfield and Stone was one of the positives to come out of the first film, and that has continued, and even improved in the second. So too has the performance of Garfield. His honest portrayal of Peter Parker, of the highs and lows he goes through as a teenage superhero, have you investing in the character as the movie progresses. He takes the time to talk to those he has rescued, even while chasing a truck through the city, and when he catches up with the criminals is never short of a wise crack. Despite this sometimes teenage brashness, Peter Parker is a nice kid, and warming to Garfield was not difficult.A scene in which he protects a young boy from bullies is a fine example of this. His conversation with the boy could easily have been condescending, instead it was as I said – honest.There are better villains, and more of them. Jamie Foxx is a bit over the top as Electro, but as the whole concept of an electrified glow in the dark villain is too, that can certainly be forgiven. Dane Dehann is suitably creepy as Harry Osborne, and later the Green Goblin, while the always delightful Paul Giamatti makes a short, but memorable appearance as the Rhino at the end of the film. Both should be back for the third installment.The special effects, as expected are excellent, and not particularly overused considering the genre. The story is cohesive and interesting, giving the cast something to work with, and they all do their jobs well. Too often, a decent story is neglected due to the overuse of CGI. That certainly isn't the case here. In fact the two Marc Webb films are two of the few I would actually recommend seeing in 3D, particularly when Spidey is swinging through New York.While Marc Webb's first foray into the Marvel universe was not as successful at the box office as both he and Marvel would have liked, I am certain this one will do a lot better. It certainly deserves to.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It is not the dark, evil, sick, disgusting movie too too many seem to love. It is just pure enjoyable fun, much like Guardians of the Galaxy. Just a extremely well done movie, and Andrew Garfield's timing is fantastic, he improved so much from the 1st Amazing Spider Man it was not even measurable.What a great, fun, enjoyable movie in every aspect. How anyone can come away not enjoying it says a lot about peoples ability to just enjoy fun. Why so many want dark, evil movies is beyond comprehension.If you love life, enjoy laughter, root for good over evil, want more good than bad, enjoy great special effects, want to feel good and smile more, watch this movie. Better yet buy this movie and enjoy it many times for years and years!!!!!!! It appears the powers that be want a far more dark and evil Spider Man in the future. Makes a lot of sense to have a dark, evil, ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider Man"", or does it?How this movie could be considered poor by so many is really a puzzle. I have not smiled while watching a movie so much since, well I can't remember. All I know is I could watch a lot more movies and TV if they were more upbeat, fun, funny, family oriented, and focused on the good in life instead of the bad. I can get the bad every day on the news, the newspapers, any Hollywood tabloid, radio, and more. I wish people craved good news and good times, more than they crave the darker news and bad news. So again, this movie is upbeat and just plain FUN!!!! Could that be why so many seem to dislike it??? Wow, what a great time to be alive.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Well, they decided that The Amazing Spiderman 2 was going to be Spiderman: And The Set-Up Of The SpiderVerse Or Something.

This spiderman feels more like the ultimate spiderman rather than the typical peter parker we are used to. In that he has confidence, he is strong without guidance (naturally talented), and head over heels for gwen stacy. Without spoiling, this movie tackles spidermans greatest sacrafices with his home/hero life balance and how terrible both become once they begin to bleed into each other and it does so perfectly. The casted actor for Harry Osborne is beyond perfect in his role and almost gives you more of a glimpse from his performance from THE CHRONICLE. Jamie Fox's Electro dialogue was abit corny and flat in a bad way, he was supposed to be a nerd but it just didn't meet the bar in terms of how fast his characters EGO transitioned upon the events in the film. In totality, this is a great spiderman title and will go down in history for its unique take on the friendly neighborhood web-head.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Is this actually all Spider-Man has to offer? Just the bare minimum is that it?Like all I want from Spider-Man is side characters I actually care about, that have layers, are fully developed like he's meant to be and matter by themselves not that they're around Peter.Yet it just seems impossible to deliver that and all I can get is something barely average or painfully mediocre, this movie being the second one.These movies actually aren't any different from the Raimi movies at all.Both of these movie series are underdeveloped in some form and don't learn from what has come before and improve on it.I'm just numb from this same old thing here with Spider-Man it has actually become a routine of how underwhelming all his movies are.I'm tired ofHow interesting, compelling stuff always ends as soon as it begins.How side characters are always underdeveloped.How the plot is never consistent.And how constantly contrived and artificially made events, motivation and character action are.So yeah no real surprise for me with this movies mediocre, half baked delivery with everything.This just blend in with all the other Spider-Man movies cause every single Spider-Man movie can only give the very bare minimum.All these movies only have like one single scene that's kind of nice but can never get an entire movie to work as a whole to connect everything to satisfying level.4/10

As for the rest, there were so many scenes that could and probably should have ended on the cutting room floor. There's simply too much uninteresting drama and unnecessary humor. And whenever Peter Parker and Gwen are together, their scenes drag the film down. Their relationship is boring and rather annoying, actually.The many character introductions are too comical, and mostly a waste of time. I felt like hitting the 'forward' button more often than not. I enjoyed the fact the film finally showed us what happened to Peter's parents, though.'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' only really gains momentum at around the 80-minute mark, when it becomes mysterious and a lot more interesting, with a lot going on all at once. Harry - Peter's best friend - is back (why he was left out in 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is still completely beyond comprehension). Only, Harry is not the same character Harry used to be in 'Spider-Man' (portrayed by James Franco). Harry is a devious character in this film - as if there are not enough villains already... (Dane DeHaan's performance as Harry is nevertheless very good).The film features some amazing visuals and photography, but ultimately way too much CGI - and I mean way too much! The villains also destroy things without purpose, simply for the sake of destruction. It didn't feel realistic and was merely an excuse for more CGI.As mentioned, the second half of the film was far more interesting than the first, and if I were to watch it again, I'd probably start watching around the half-way mark.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Yes, that certainly sounds oblivious and even moronic, but I don't mean it in a sense that it's a story about a comic book superhero. Well, duh.No, the connection here runs deeper.The movie essentially shapes its identity around being a comic book story, taking all the good aspects and, well, the bad ones.For example, when you see some grand and thrilling frozen still shots of Spider-Man finding himself in a barely escapable peril, with everything moving at a snail's pace around our hero, you can't think of anything else but a comic book panel. That one magical moment when you're about to flip the page and see if he managed to ""do it"" or if he did not. This movie pulled that off gracefully.Next is the story flow. And again, it is portioned like a comic book series, when one single story line is moving from one issue to another. Sometimes it can move a bit too fast, or too slow, and get side tracked with some smaller scale events. But if you ignore the occasional bumps it can be a pretty enjoyable experience. And also, while the story has its serious and rather tragic moments, just like its origin it doesn't afraid to be silly and childish - and not with the sterile kind of gag humor that MCU is infamous for. It's the kind of experience that you'd say ""it's so stupid"" about, but would smile while saying so.The main villain chosen for this movie works well for a big screen superhero story - a man with electric powers is guaranteed to entertain viewers with things zapping, and blowing up, and sparkling - they have a lot of fun with it. Aside your usual hero / villain dynamic, Gwen Stacy's story and character are surprisingly good too. She brings in that human element that brings variety and grounds the whole story.For something completely different, the music here is a blast. It's exciting, it's fresh, and Electro's theme will probably get stuck in your head.As for the negatives, the movie sometimes lacks coherence - it's one of those ""bad elements"" inherited from the comic book origin. It has to waste screen time hastily closing awkward story lines started in the previous movie, as well as doing an embarrassing sequel hook for the future movies that never came to be. And finally, let's be honest, the silly aspects might be too much for some people here.But honestly, even despite some occasional stupidity, this movie is really worth seeing at least once. It's pretty unique in handling its source material and does something that honestly wasn't emulated so well by other Spider-Man movies, for better or worse.It's the most to the letter ""comic book"" Spider-Man of them all.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's awesome, it's hard hitting, it's action packed, dark, gritty and just so good. Easily far superior to the first Amazing Spider-Man movie where there was never a dull momentThey did a great job with the opening scene by expanding more on Peter's parents as originally shown in the first movie, the corruption within Oscorp with one power hungry executive looking to take control of the company by framing Harry Osborn and Electro. Oh man, Jamie Foxx really surprised me the first time I saw this movie as Electro, he was so good in the roll I really enjoyed his performanceAs for Harry Osborn/Green Goblin's role in Amazing Spider-Man 2 I loved it. It was good progression of him coming in, inheriting Oscorp then learns he is dying from the same illness that killed Normal, his struggle to find a cure and transformation into a monstrous Green Goblin. It was great but I do think harry should have been included in the first movie just to add a bit more depth to the friendship between him and PeterIt's a shame MJ was cut from this film but it was understandable as there was way too many characters and juggling their stories to begin with which by the way Amazing Spider-Man 2 did a great job in juggling them. It's a shame these movies will never continue and honestly I loved Andrew Garfield's Spidey since the beginning and not just when he returned in No Way Home. He was greatOnly thing I disliked in Amazing Spider-Man 2 was Rhino and the Rhino suit. Easily should have scrapped Rhino because he really brought nothing to the table, only in the first and last scenes of this movie and the suit is trash. Not even the proper classic Rhino suit, just a robotic suit.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This was until 2014's 'The Amazing Spider-man 2' came along, which proved to be a heaping, hollow mess.While Marc Webb's follow-up to the only slightly better 2012 reboot was flashier, it was also less authentic and less fun. There were too many villains packed in here (even introducing a new one within the final minutes?) and the character development was lacking. Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon/Electro was probably the most interesting thing about the film, while Dane DeHaan's portrayal of Harry Osborn felt pedestrian. It was also a waste to have Felicity Jones play such a minor role, as she could have brought a lot more to the story.Aside from the obvious problems with this sequel, there was an unevenness to the storyflow and an anticlimactic ending that left a bad taste in a lot of fans' mouths. This is probably the main reason why a follow-up has never materialized, but with the success of 'Spider-man: No Way Home,' it's interesting to wonder if there might be another push to get this series back on track.For now, 'The Amazing Spider-man 2' will continue to be overlooked among its superior peers.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The previous Spiderman movies with Toby Maguire were coated in a syrupy view of life. Virgin youth fighting cartoonish villains in a rich man's landscape. This one is more of the same, just worse. Andrew Garfield portrayed Peter Parker as an impatient, sullen teen laying around his room. Then swinging about in New York with a whole different personality. Emma Stone portrays his girlfriend who graduates high school and in the next scene in a high tech Oscorp corporate job. What? The movie portrays a rich man's landscape where those to be envied are the 1%ers and the battlefield is New York where this week's monster villain sprays bullets at random, but no one is actually killed. Blocks of New York are destroyed but no one is actually killed. No one is shown homeless due to the goings on. Ridiculous. Maybe it is the intended audience they are appealing to, teens and man-children. I can suspend belief and enjoy Sci-fi movies but the landscape has to be just a bit believable. Consequences happen, except in Marvel movies.
Poor Jamie Foxx is one of the villains, unrecognizable under makeup after the transformation. He is cast as a nerd, a nobody. See nerds are still acceptable to make fun of, to be the focus of human meanness. Previously that person would have been a Stepin Fetchit or some ethnic class but that is no longer PC to do but the meanness is still there. The desire to ridicule, the need to have a justification for offensive behavior. It's fun for the audience to make fun of people. You just have to pick the ones no one will object to. So the nerd. Jerry Lewis made a whole career out of it.
Typically the action sequences were filled with CGI that ignores any real physics but are fun to watch. Human interactions are sappy, banal, and adolescent. It would be nice to see a special effects movie peopled by complex adults. I guess the audience isn't there.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I really didn't mind the first one and I genuinely thought it was decent and had some great ideas. This movie on the other hand is way to bloated and has way too much stupid stuff going on. There's a couple things I do like though, the Spider-Man suit in this movie is probably the best live action suit we have seen, it's so good, the eyes are big and the colours are so bright and vibrant. The effects, just like the first one, are really really good. I quite like the ending and how emotional it is because it genuinely feels like Spider-Man, the end fight scene with electro is really nice looking and would have been a great climax to the film if they hadn't ruined it with the god awful green goblin. It is a Spider-Man film and as a huge fan of the character I can find enjoyment from this film no matter what even though I know it's a bad film. That's about it for things I like to be honest! The story has way too much going on with way too many villains and story arcs crammed into one film. Andrew Garfield is still pretty decent in this movie but Christ his accent in this film is so so bad, it's not too bad in the first film but it's so over the top in this one and I hate it. Spider-Man just messes around so much in this movie and it genuinely leads to people dying and he just doesn't care that he's joking around all the time, he just doesn't feel like Spider-Man sometimes because of how much he just doesn't care. The story is so predictable, everyone knows that Gwen is gonna die in this because it's Gwen Stacey and every Spider-Man fan ever knows that Gwen Stacy dies and also the films foreshadowed it to death. I just wish this movie had been put together with a bit more care as it just feels super rushed and super unfinished, this film has some good ideas in it and I think with a better script and some better execution this film could have been great and then the series could have gone on. All in all this film is just a massive disappointment and it's a huge shame but it is what it is.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

For those in the loop, broken,as I know it, is a flick that its elements of the storyline does not join well and you fill that what seen you saw do not make any sense. A broken movie isn't necessarily bad ,for instance 12 Monkeys is a broken movie ,but it is quit good. No here we have the bad type, because its story lines within the movie are related with a very dumb way and they made the same mistake as Spiderman 3: too many villains. Also Andrew Garfield portrait of Spiderman is to over the top for me and to put simple does not convince me that is a true hero, just a teenager who have powers and has fun with them. And the villains ,o boy they are even more stupid than Spiderman 3, there at least they had some understandable reason to hate Spiderman, but here they were just some ugly CGI creatures. The only thing going for is the chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone and the opening apart of that is pretty boring. I understand why Sony team up with Marvel now, cross fingers for Civil War comrades.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's a lot, but it keeps the entire movie engaging and I also think they still give each character enough screen time to where it doesn't feel just thrown in.

The plot itself might not have been anything to write home about, but it was, at least, a good movie and worth the IMAX ticket price I paid to see it. Fast forward two years to the second installment of the re-booted series and I'm practically praying for terrible ticket sales in hopes that Marc Webb and his team of writers have learned from their mistakes with this one. In short, the film was spent mostly circling around Peter's internal conflict to let go of Gwen per her dying father's request as well as Peter's search for answers and some sort of closure with the sudden departure and deaths of his parents as a child. I understand these are two things that needed to be included, but to span the breadth of over two hours worth of running time? Aside from that, we're treated to the Batman Forever-esque depictions of Electro and Rhino (very briefly for the latter) and the sub-par, paint-by-number acting chops of Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn/the Green Goblin. Aaaand that's the movie. No, seriously. A few action sequences here and there to at least whet the appetites for the kids and mouth-breathers, but that's really it. I give Jamie Foxx credit for evoking sympathy for his character early in the movie, but overall it was a trudgingly-paced and uninteresting flop of a superhero movie that will either be remembered for doing nothing differently from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films or forgotten for exactly the same reason. 8","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

So you can tell why as I walked into the premier showing I was disappointed after the movie. First of all there are so many sub-plots happening that the whole plot falls apart. Like what happened to his parents, or his relationship with Gwen, and the whole OSCORP thing. So many things to think about. The plot was terrible and ruined the movie. But the biggest flaw... ELECTRO. I mean come on! Some guy who turns evil just because he got a little mad at spider-man. Also, he fell 20 feet into a pile of electric eels and all of a sudden he has super powers. COME ON! Now onto the good things. The new spider-man movie brought some amazing action scenes and a lot more comedy than the 1st one. Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield were AMAZING as always! Especially Emma as Gwen! The movie had a great cast. Also the Green Goblin was so awesome in it! If it had focused more on him than Electro it would have been a lot better.

And just about 5 years before that I watched this movie in theaters on opening day. With the new Spiderman movie I figured I should give this movie another try. I liked the first one but this one never stuck. The amazing Spider-Man 2 is not a good film, but the movie does achieve some good scenes in the movie that carries it along the way. To start off with the bad stuff, the entire introductory sequence is so out of place that back in 2014 I remember thinking it was a trailer for a movie only to find out it was the beginning. It's out of place and I personally think that Peter Parker's parents shouldn't be focused on. Also Peter Parker not knowing Norman Osborn in the first movie makes no sense because he was secretly best friends with his only son. Early in the film as Spider-Man messes around and makes jokes he lets the criminal kill people as he wastes time. There are multiple continuity errors throughout and train sequence is moronic as they try to pass off that Ben Parker making the spiders is something new. Electro is an extremely dumb villain and Dane Dehaan is wasted in this film because he's a good actor. But for good things, Spider-Man's suit as we all know is amazing and the montage that happens halfway through the film is pretty solid. Although Gwen Stacy's death is easily foreshadowed and hinted at throughout the movie the execution of it is actually quite well done. I like how Peter reacts to Gwen showing up at the fight. He knows that the area is dangerous and she just walked into it. And that makes even more sense that when she dies he is heartbroken with the fact that all of his nightmares came true, every time he put her in danger, every time he saw her dad, he knew it was a warning and that he was putting her in danger and he thought he could just stop it. However, as soon as the clock tower comes in to play in the last scene you can tell that Peter is desperate for her to be taken out of the situation so that his nightmare does not come to fruition. He even almost kills Harry just to save Gwen. I think the movie should've ended up with Peter coming back as Spiderman but not in a huge action scene, but rather a moment of reflection as he understands his role in life.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's not as good as the original Spider-Man movies, which had great action throughout, and the storyline was a bit weak. Electro was hardly in the movie and the showdown wasn't that great. As for the other baddies, they weren't that brilliant either and none of them was close to the amazing fight on the train with Doc Ock. The CGI was quite good and Spider- man looked pretty real when he was jumping from building to building but that was about it. I wasn't that impressed with the first one and this one just follows suit. They need to bring in some decent baddies with a decent storyline because I expected much better from this reboot. Disappointing!Round-Up: Jamie Foxx was pretty poor in this film, but I don't blame him. The geeky character really didn't suit him and the haircut was bloody ridiculous. Personally, I think that the main problem with the film is that there is too many things going on at once. You have this love story which becomes a bit tedious after a while, and then you've got a geeky scientist that falls in a pool of electric eels and becomes Electro and you've got another story about a teenager whose dying and needs Spider-Man's blood to survive. On top of that Spider- Man is saving the world and trying to find out what happened with his parents so the whole thing is all over the place. On the plus side, I didn't fall asleep through the epic movie and the attention to detail was quite good but I hope that the next instalment has some more action and less chatting.Budget: $200million Worldwide Gross: $708.3million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into the Spider-Man franchise. 5/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was excited for this film after watching Webb's ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" I thought Andrew Garfield did a really good job playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man and bringing much more emotion to the role. However, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" just makes things bigger and hopes that it will be better.I will admit, the visual effects are cool and seeing shots from Spider-Man's perspective are impressive, but it doesn't hold up for a film that's almost 2 1/2 hours. The storyline for the film is also weak. We're told things before we really need to know them (like in the opening scene) and there are too many villains (just like Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3). There is Paul Giamatti's Rhino (who doesn't get much screen time), Jamie Foxx's Electro (who gets the cheesiest lines), and Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn/Green Goblin (who could've been a much more effective villain if he was given more screen time). All these villains become more one-dimensional. If they just picked one, I think the film would've been better and the villain could feel much more real. Luckily, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone (playing Gwen Stacy) have great chemistry and bring life to a film filled with too many visual effects. Sally Field is also effective as Aunt May. The film has interesting themes of life, death, pain, and what it means to be a hero, but none of them feel complete by the end. Peter Parker deals with these heavy themes, but it's not reflected in his Spider-Man identity. If I didn't like the first film as much as I did, I probably would've given this movie a lower rating. There are more Spider-Man films to come and I hope that the filmmakers can learn from the mistakes in this film to give Spider-Man a film he deserves.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was in the cinema with my friend and through the whole movie, all I wanted to know was when it was going to finish. The first Amazing Spider-man was as boring as hell and I stopped watching it at about half way not and even caring what would happen at the end. Seeing this movie, it really made me hate The Amazing Spider-man and I don't think there is a point in making them. The last Spider-man was in 2007 and it should've stayed that way. I really hate how they have to make these little extra advanced marvel characters so that they can get more money because they couldn't think of their own movie to create. If you're a big a spider-man fan, I wouldn't recommend the Amazing Spider-man, they are both boring and there is hardly any action in it.","0 out of 14 found this helpful.

The second thing I love is the cast. Andrew Garfield is perfect as Spider-man/Peter Parker.In the first TASM he captured the nerdy and socially awkward side of Peter whilst also capturing the funny side of Spider-Man.In this film he shows character growth, now he is not as socially awkward because hes outside of high school whilst still being nerdy and of course Emma stone and Garfield's chemistry on screen is the heart of the movie which Marc Webb portrays so well.Dane Dehann also manages to make Harry's character more interesting by bringing a creepy element to him, even though his arc to becoming the Green Goblin was a little rushed the way he played Green Goblin was extremely scary and unsettling.The only character I had a problem with is Max Dillon, for me his motivations weren't very clear and the overall look of the character (comb-over,spaced teeth) put me of from taking the character seriously. However Electro does everything a villain should do, he was scary and menacing especially in that scene with the German Doctor also the look of the character and the CGI work made the character incredibly interesting to look at.What I was most anxious about was the increased amount of characters and plot points, what I was very surprised at is that it manages it all very well , even though there are moments where it feels we've went from relationship issues to dying dad to parent issues to Max Dillon talking to himself.Overall it works very well and manages not to be Spider-man 3. So overall this film has amazing visual effects, incredible performances from most characters, whilst having minor issues with some and even though it has allot going on it manages to handle it very well. I would definitely recommend this film.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It oozes exposition and universe building that it has now become a detriment to the film itself. Peter Parker, having now saved the city once, is entangled in another threatening situation(s) where his number one fan is involved in a freak accident that leaves him with electrifying powers. Having forgot about him, Spider-Man has now made a sworn enemy who simply just wants to be noticed. Whilst this is happening, Harry Osborn takes over his father's company but is battling his own personal hereditary disease in which he needs Spider-Man's blood to save him. Don't forget though, Gwen Stacy wants to move to England for her education so Peter must deal with his one true love and prevent her from leaving. Oh wait there's more! The Rhino is apparently in this wreaking havoc (for all of 2 minutes). Felicity Jones...wait, Felicity Jones is in this? Oh yeah, she is. Aunt May has to work double time which sounds exhausting. A blackout occurs which leaves two planes flying blind, will they collide!? Peter investigates the mysterious disappearance of his father. There's lust for power in Oscorp and to top it all off, Max's teeth get magically straightened when he turns into Electro...yes, I'm done. To say this film is overstuffed would be an understatement. There is far too much happening and hardly any of them interconnect. They are separate plot points where most feel unnecessary. Who even cares if Aunt May works double time? Who is Felicia...wait, Felicity Jones? Really? Oh yes...I see her. Having three villains in one film just doesn't work. Focus on one, or two if necessary...but three is overkill. The action scenes with Electro were pretty, and actually compelling. I applaud the final ten minutes to kill off a certain character, was a damn bold move which paid off. Just unfortunate the rest of the film is a mess.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the beginning of the movie I thought that Spider-Man was trying really hard to be that sarcastic, funny, wise-guy that Stan Lee realized, many years ago, Spider-Man was supposed to be. Certainly this franchise has come a long way since Toby Maguire's version of Spidey, but it still isn't quite there yet with Andrew Garfield playing the web-slinger.I didn't really get into this movie until it started looking, feeling, and sounding a lot more like a Marvel movie does today. Until that point, I was considering more like a 3 or 4, rather than the 6-stars I eventually gave it.I didn't see this film until 2017, so I think I was perhaps spoiled by the ""new"" Spider-Man and a host of fantastic Marvel movies that followed The Amazing Spider-Man 2's release in 2014.If you're a fan of the ""Marvel Galaxy"" of movies, see this.

Garfield was never the problem-- I always bought him as a high school/university student (looks young.) No, the problem was the direction and stories of the movies. Like with the first movie--why would you, for the millionth time, feature Peter Parker's origin story? We all already know he was bitten by a radioactive spider-- we grew up with cartoon after cartoon, comic after comic, and *three* movies directed by Sam Raimi featuring the same back story.Seeing the origin (yet) again sloooowed the movie to a (spider) crawl. The first film takes *foever* to get going, what with the spider bite, uncle Ben getting murdered for his $30 bucks or whatever, and Aunt May's secret hash addiction-- and the costume in the first movie was just bad.Not to mention The Lizard had as much appeal/personality/charisma as a plank of wood. The Lizard is meant to hate humanity-- in the comics, he hates humans like how the KKK hates non-whites-- and that's how he should've been played (as an insane, rage-fueled species-ist.) The real Lizard foams at the mouth when he sees us naked apes walking about our cities and shopping malls, paving over his green forests to make our concrete jungles. Seeing but a shred of that energy would've helped the first movie.The second movie was alright, in my opinion-- Jamie Fox(x?) played a sympathetic villain who wasn't a mad scientist like Doc Ock, Norm Osbourne, or The Lizard-- he was a company worker twisted by social isolation (something that most Internet dwellers can identify with.) Electro was cool, had a cool theme, and I'd love to see Fox (two x's? WTH?) reprise the role if there is a sinister six movie.Where the second ASM mucks up is the Green Goblin (yawn) and the Emma Stone romance subplot (tripple-whammy-with-cheese yawn.) HOLY LORD the scenes with Emma Stone dragged way, way too long. Yes-- Peter misses her, blah-blah-blah hey can we see some more of Spiderman not being a total pansy please? How about you have him tease JJ Jameson, fight The Shocker, or fight some bullies, 'k? Don't get me wrong-- romantic trouble has always been part of the Peter Parker/Spiderman formula, but it was unbalanced in this movie. Maybe they were trying to cash in on the fact Emma Stone is a bankable actress right now (hashtags #overrated #loud) but romantic troubles bother Parker at the edge of his mind, while he has to save NY as Spiderman. He was never obsessed with his girlfriends to the point of stalking, like in this second movie.Then there's the Green Goblin. He looked like an 80's rock star riddled with every STD and STI in the book. They've fouled up his design so many times-- his metal-plastic mask in the first trilogy was one of the weaker aspects. If you want to see what he SHOULD look like, watch the uber creepy animatronic mask on youtube from Studio ADI.So there you have it-- Garfield was never the problem. A tedious first movie, with an overlong romantic subplot and a half-baked secondary villain were the problems of the ASM movies. Now let Garfield go back to eating his lasagna (I'm so funny.)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

And he got so many things right. With the Amazing Spider-man II Webb continues to reinvent Spider-man. His take on Spider-man is a mature one. And one that follows the potential that Spider-man always had. He was created to be the hero who could be you. Spider-man was created to showcase a super hero who was not rich or had the powers of a god . Instead he had the powers of a Spider. And the maturity to realize that he had the power to change lives for the better after tragic cicrcumstances forced him to realize he had to Help those in need and to protect the helpless and fight evil and stop crime. Even though the cost to him at times is high. and That PEter PArker's life can become a chaotic mess. He never fails to be the hero he has to be. That's the difference between Nolan's Dark Knight Movies and Webb's Spider-man films. Webb can explore the darker issues of being a superhero but he keeps it fun.. Andrew Garfield is simply perfect as Peter Parker. When the Amazing Spider-man was first released I was a strong Toby fan. I wanted to hate Andrew but couldn't. He brought the hero to life with his quips. And his actions. Where Raimi was quick to imply the cost of being a hero. But rarely showed it. Webbb Shows us in every heart breaking detail. Where Raimi shyed away from certain details. Webb Shows us. And Because he shows us he Adds a more rounded dimension to Spider-man. The only beef I do have is omission of scenes that were shown in the trailer. but not in the movie. There literally is more then enough story for two movies and there is a major set up for Amazing Spider -man III. This movie is a comic book come to life. Webb and company do their best to transform the world of the comic book into the real world and it works. Webb proves that not all Super hero films need to be dark and full of angry avenging figures. sometimes they can be colourful figures that simply enjoy being who they are and the enjoy it to the fullest. the only advice I can give is sit back grab your popcorn and your drink. And watch the movie and to be prepared to be amazed.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","An improved version of ""Spider-Man 3"".","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3338006/?ref_=tt_urv","kevinxirau","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27881178/?ref_=tt_urv","18 October 2015","I'd never thought I'd be faced with a film that I enjoy a lot and at the same time be so conflicted on it. Critically speaking, it's far from the best Spider-man movie and I can see why some would dislike this flick while simultaneously there many things I love about it and others do too. TASM 2 has become something of a anomaly in the world of superhero adaptations and saying that makes me feel strange. Why is that? Let's take a look.To get the bad out of the way and over with, the movie makes some of the same mistakes as ""Spider-Man 3"", mainly having a story with tons of plot lines going on at the same time. We have Peter struggling with his relationship with his love interest, three villains showing up, the mystery regarding his parents, a conspiracy in Oscorp, etc. A few things get somewhat contrived and there's not only lots of product placement (a minor issue on my part) but also world building that feels thrown in, largely due to Sony trying to establish a cinematic universe to rival Marvel. It was clear that they wanted to do sequels to keep making money and keep the film license to Spidey. It's also something of a way to prevent copying aspects of the original trilogy like how the Daily Bugle is utilized. Also, if you're simply an action junkie, there's a large gap between two major fight scenes, so you'll have to wait quite a bit.Having said all that, why is it that I still like this movie compared to ""Spider-Man 3""? For one thing, I enjoy Peter's character and his relationships. Andrew Garfield really gets the hero, a smart wisecracker that does what he can to help others but at the same time he's conflicted about his chaotic life and how it affects everyone. I also like how he doesn't need to take his mask off a lot to express himself. His personality really shines through simply through his voice and body language, something Maguire never really achieved since much of the time he's mask-less, not that I blame him. Don't get me wrong, I like Tobey, but Garfield just nails his role. It's like Spider-man just leaped off the page. Peter and Gwen are a fantastic together, probably helped by the actors' real-life relationship. Their chemistry is irresistible and the drama between them is engaging. Heck, this is arguably the strongest part of the film and is worth seeing in that action gap I mentioned.The action scenes and SFX are great. The stakes are as high as ever given the scope of the threat the wall-crawler is faced with. The fights are well-choreographed with Spider-man and foes really beating the crap out of each other and flying everywhere. The use of slow-motion is excellent, with the viewer able to see the necessary details occurring in the environment, especially when Peter's spider sense comes into play, allowing him to see what's at stake and what needs to be done. Character designs are, for the most part, good with Spider-man's costume being by far the best I've seen on film yet. Electro is interesting, nice veiny make-up mixed with beautiful CGI currents flowing in his body and his electric powers are a visual delight. Rhino's mech suit is well-designed, looking both functional and powerful. Only Goblin's suit looks weird to me, though it's implied to be a prototype so it's passable, but his glider has a sleek and edgy look.Hans Zimmer outdid himself as the music is some of the best I've heard. There's several standout bits of OST, like Electro's techno suite with paranoid lyrics showing his insanity, Peter and Gwen's love music which is soothing and heartwarming, and Goblin's unsettling tone that raises to a thrilling battle music. Then there's Spidey's theme, which feels very grand and heroic, just what the web-slinger needs. Seriously, I could listen to this music all day.Despite there being 3 villains like last time, the film makes a wise choice of focusing on two. Jamie Foxx does a good job with his role, a geeky engineer treated like crap most of his life becoming a dangerous villain after going through a tragic accident and grave misunderstanding with his idol Spidey. Some say his turn to the dark side was rushed, but I didn't see it that way. I felt that he had enough establishment and being treated badly constantly is enough to make anyone mentally unstable. Harry Osborn/Green Goblin is also portrayed well. Dane Dehaan manages to make him sympathetic and his friendship with Peter feels genuine. When he is stricken with a strange illness, it's sad seeing him slowly turning into a monster and he is pretty creepy when he does so. As for Rhino, he doesn't get much focus as he's simply a part of Spider-man's everyday life. Fans may get disappointed by this, but hey the villain was like this in the Ultimate comics. Still, Paul Giamatti makes this relatively simple baddie enjoyable hammy.By all means, I shouldn't like TASM 2 but I do. It makes some the same mistakes as ""S-M 3"" but also improves on the rest. It's hard for me to give a definitive rating because people look for different things in a movie and this has so many elements that anyone can like/dislike. While I'm happy that Spider-Man will be in the Marvel Cinematic Universe now, I'll also miss this series seeing as how it's now canceled and it's a shame because it has lots of good things like the overall story and actors. I guess the best way to sum it up is that this is a love-it-or-hate-it movie, but for me, I love it and I recommend this one over ""Spider-Man 3"" to any fan or moviegoer. In the words of Stan Lee: EXCELSIOR!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are many reasons to go see this movie not least of which is the popularity and blockbuster nature of this highly anticipated film. As a movie the plot itself stands for itself, barely but does suffice. There are also a lot of great action scenes with high quality cgi based cuts which add to the visual aesthetic of the film. Jamie Fox does an excellent job playing his role which adds to the air of the film and gives a lot of purpose to the plot which otherwise focuses on Spidarman/Peter Parker's personal life. Once you get past the lack luster nature of some of the scenes and cheesy romantic overtones you can actually dive into the characters and get a better understanding of the dark overtones behind the Amazing Spiderman series. All and all this is a must see film of 2014 and a great time if you are looking for 3D action and a highly visual experience.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I am worried that there would be too many bad guys in this film, but they did it just right.One of the highlight is the soundtrack and score of the film. The music when Elecyro is in Times Square is amazingly well done. I like this film a lot because it really feel like Spider-Man I know from the comics.The action is fun, fast and so Spider-Man if that means anything. The way they use his spider sense is very cool.However, the ending is sad and I cannot understand how that could happened. I am so disappointed. n the end, Iwant to say that the drama is very high.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
