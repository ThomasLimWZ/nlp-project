"8","/10","Fun, funny and wild","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8395240/?ref_=tt_urv","FeastMode","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104603847/?ref_=tt_urv","3 August 2022","This is a highly entertaining action-comedy that oozes style. It's extremely fun and a bit on the outrageous side, not meant to be taken too seriously. It's filled with funny and memorable moments. The action is awesome, well-shot and clear, which is no surprise coming from the guy who directed John Wick, Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2.There are a ton of characters and I like them all. The cast does such a great job, especially Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. I remember first seeing Brian Tyree Henry in Atlanta and really enjoying that role. Since then, he has taken on vastly different roles and killed all of them. And I already thought Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a great actor, but the way he completely transforms into his character is remarkable. To the point where you don't see Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Literally. I didn't realize it was him until the credits rolled.If I had to come up with negatives, I would say it's a bit hectic at times, but not enough to take me out of it. And the story borders on being convoluted, but I was able to follow it all so I'll call it intricate instead.In the end I had a great time with this movie and would definitely watch it again, although I'll be turning on subtitles since some dialogue was hard to understand in a Snatch kind of way.EDIT: On second viewing, my negatives disappeared. And a couple things that stood out even more: The music is beastly and Brad Pitt's facial expressions in the reaction shots are priceless.

"6","/10","Style over substance","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8415669/?ref_=tt_urv","MUFCOK","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20509588/?ref_=tt_urv","8 August 2022","I make a point of not watching trailers prior to watching a new film as experience tells me that rather than get me excited to watch a movie, they essentially give me an overly exposed look at a film with key plot points being shown. With this in mind, it was almost impossible to not see parts of trailers for Bullet Train, whether that was on TV or YouTube advertising etc. The marketing campaign for this film is mental, I have seen it everywhere.The trailer makes the movie look like a massive bloated action piece - Think Nonstop meets Train to Busan. However, having watched a couple of YouTube film reviews, I was pleasantly surprised to see it described as not just a brainless action movie, but more of a dialogue-based film with clever writing and fast paced back and forth. One reviewer compared it to Guy Ritchie's Snatch and the classic Pulp Fiction - Two of my favourite and most watched movies. That was enough for me, I was going to give it a try and I booked a couple of tickets for opening day, something that I don't do very often.Let's start with the Dialogue. If anything, it just tries too hard, far too hard. Most of the jokes didn't land for me and the delivery of the fast-paced dialogue quite often would not hit the mark. I can't quite but my finger on why that is. Is it simply poor writing? Or is it down to the delivery? Or is it simply that a number of my favourite movies are heavy, witty dialogue-based movies and my expectations were so high based on several reviews, that I just felt disappointed by this? Either way, it didn't really work for me.As you can imagine, almost all the action scenes involved in this movie were delivered on a train, meaning that the fight scenes needed to be compact and tight. This was delivered better than I expected to be fair and plenty of the action scenes were enjoyable, if not incredibly farfetched.The characters were relatively varied but were quite generic and clich√©. Brad Pitt is essentially the lead actor and probably the best on show. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry (Tangerine and Lemon) were the characters which I was most excited to see, they played the east end cockney gangster/hitmen type characters. Unfortunately, they came across as just trying far too hard and the chemistry between them just wasn't as good as I imagine the director and producers thought it would be. The Thomas the Tank Engine metaphor also got repetitive after the 25th time it was mentioned. The rest of the cast are hit and miss, nothing majorly impressive and nothing majorly terrible. There are some strange cameos, and when I say cameos, I mean cameos. They literally get seconds of screen time.Overall, Bullet Train was entertaining enough as a popcorn flick and was an inoffensive way of turning my brain off for two hours and relaxing. I do feel that it's a slightly wasted opportunity though as I can see what the director was trying to do, but it just felt flat and missed the mark on quite a few occasions. Style over substance is the best way I would describe it.6/10.","455 out of 711 found this helpful.

It's an action movie the reads like Smoking Aces. An ensemble cast with a few different stories in it, of which, interestingly enough Brad Pitt's story as a man named Ladybug could be considered just as important as the others despite being the star.Unlike Smoking Aces, the Bullet Train in itself is a character and a very expensive one that makes it a blockbuster. On top of that the very cool Celebrity Cameos that prove this director makes friends with everyone he works with in Hollywood.The Japanese back drop was cool not just because I'm an anime fan but because it made the film and the bullet train visual amazing to look at, but Hollywood needs more Japanese actors who can speak English. Hiroyuki Sanada is become the Danny Trejo of the Far East.Its action packed and its humorous everything I want when watching a movie in theatres.","897 out of 1,151 found this helpful.

It is two hours of relentless action. It's actually a little exhausting to watch (it didn't help that the theatre I saw it in was set to about 30 degrees Celsius - but that's a different matter) - in a good way though.This is a very stylishly made film. It looks terrific. The acting is great and all the characters are very polished and cool as you would expect in a film about assassins. The train itself is an interesting setting too. It's technically a single-setting film but it never feels like it. The film moves so fast you feel like you are darting from country to country.I would say the one let down of the film was how little of the humour landed. Time and again there was an obvious attempt at a joke and I just didn't find even a smile coming to my face. There are some laughs along the way, but the hit to miss ratio is way off.It's a lot of fun this movie though regardless. There are endless cameos and twists and unexpected moments. The film certainly keeps you on your toes. 7/10.","207 out of 338 found this helpful.

Those auteurs really launched a whole class of films that mix some silliness with action, favoring lots of blood and squishy gore. At base, this film is no better or worse than those of its ilk. But the Tarantino and Ritchie films had novelty on their side. And at least with Tarantino, a sense of something richer, deeper beneath the surface. Bullet Train almost pathologically can't ever take it self seriously. Some films suffer by taking themselves too seriously; BT has the opposite problem.Pitt is fine as ladybug, he's genuinely pretty funny at times, but his hapless character is the heart of the movie, and he's a bit of a dope, a therapy neophyte trying to see the deeper meaning of things, to be a better man, but only ever in an unserious way. Nothing really matters about him. Not even his wardrobe (is he going fishing later with that hat?)Bullet Train is an action comedy, essentially, but the best action films and comedies always transcend the genre; Bullet Train does not, and will slide into the forgettable dust bin of movie history, cute little cameos or not.","19 out of 26 found this helpful.

I'm not rating it highly because it's a modern classic, i'm doing it based on wanting to see a funny and entertaining action movie and in that respect it delivers pretty much everything I went to the cinema for.The premise of the film is basic, the cast is solid, the characters are excellent including mini side characters. The humour has a few misses but generally it is a pretty funny movie throughout, they also pay off everything that is set up along the way which makes it a satisfying watch. Also if you are yet to see it, stay through the credits as it does tie up one or two of those loose ends.The slight downside for me, were that the run time does sag a little toward the end but it is over 2 hours long and otherwise moved along at a steady rate.","245 out of 383 found this helpful.

It's like a sloppy Tarantino knockoff, and it was hard to follow the overly complicated subplots at times. There were definitely holes, e.g. Why doesn't the White Death seek revenge on those who hired people like The Hornet or Tangerine and Lemon, instead of those characters directly? But this is less about a buttoned-up action film and more about comedy I think, and it made me laugh. It tried to have it both ways though, and themes like fate and luck were weakly developed.

Pitt and Leitch worked together on numerous films, starting their work relationship with Fincher's Fight Club. Over the past decade, Leitch has become a promising director in the action genre, starting as co-director (he was uncredited) of the first John Wick film, which has since become The Action Movie Franchise of the Decade. Leitch then went solo to helm Atomic Blonde, 2, and Fast and Furious presents: Hobbs and Shaw. Now, Leitch and Pitt reunite for the film Bullet Train, an adaptation of the book of the same name by Kotaro Isaka.Pitt shows off his leading man personality once again as the character Ladybug. A hitman for hire who has found a new belief in pacifism and whose self-confidence has gone way down over the years from jobs going off the rails, making himself believe that he has bad luck. His boss (Sandra Bullock) gives him a simple mission as his first job back. His job is to board a Bullet Train traveling from Tokyo to Kyoto, snatch a briefcase that contains millions of dollars, and get off at the first stop. Simple, right? Well, it turns out to be not that simple, as Ladybug realizes that he is not the only assassin on this train, and they are all connected to a ruthless Russian mobster known to them as The White Death (Michael Shannon).The assassin's on this train include Lemon and Tangerine (Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor Johnson), twin brothers hired to bring the White Death's son (Logan Lerman) back to him, along with the briefcase. The Prince (Joey King) is a young girl on a mission to kill The White Death. Kimura (Andrew Koji) is a father trying to find the person responsible for the attempted murder of his son, along with his father The Elder (Hiroyuki Sanada), an aging samurai who suffered at the hands of The White Death. The Wolf (Bad Bunny), a member of the Mexican Cartel who seeks vengeance for the murder of his wife, and The Hornet (Zazie Beetz), an assassin who uses the venom from a rare snake on her targets.Bullet Train excellences with the visual presentation, unlike the fair share of modern-day action films. The cinematography is very colorful and vibrant. Lots of care into the framing of each shot. One scene, in particular, is shot through the POV of an object, and it's beautifully executed. Leitch brings his history of stunt work into the film by providing entertaining action scenes that never feel cheap or manipulated. Every punch and kick feels real. The camera work also helps with the action, making it feel electric. Action films of modern times don't have anymore. They rely on the workings of shaky cam and editing tricks to hide the imperfections with the action but hiding this only makes the film worse because this mashup makes the film look messy and unprofessional. The action makes each scene feel fun and keeps the audience. The production design is creative as well. Most films that take place in one setting suffer from having the locations feel dull, but Bullet Train keeps it exciting by having several different locations all packed into one, and each one feels unique with its lightingThe performances are superb compared to most in the action genre. Brad Pitt isn't doing much that he hasn't already done in the last two decades, but his leading man charisma still leaves the audience loving him. Aaron Taylor Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry's chemistry is so strong that it's one of the most entertaining dynamic duos in recent memory.The film fails with its messy screenplay. The film resembles a hodgepodge of every Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino film, to the point that it feels like a ripoff. The problem doesn't come from the notion that a screenwriter would want to make a film that pays homage to his favorite writers/directors. Tarantino built his entire career by copying the style of other filmmakers and writers. The problem with this is that it lacks the originality of those films and feels like it's giving us the best moments of those movies without offering anything new and this style done wrong causes major pacing problems, making a two-hour film feel way longer than it should. The editing feels jumbled, committing the ultimate sin of modern movies: spelling everything out for the audience. It's like the director thinks the audience is too dumb to remember something that happened earlier, so his way of working around it is to keep showing us those same moments until it becomes repetitive. The characters aren't developed properly, so at the end of the day, nothing feels earned. While the characters are fun to watch and keep your interest throughout the runtime, the emotions aren't there for them to hit. When bad things happen to them, it never fully gives brings out the intended emotions that the audience is supposed to feel.Bullet Train is a technical achievement spoiled by its messy storytelling. A fun movie to see in theaters but one that isn't worth a revisit at home.6/10.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

There is protocol and procedure in Japan, when you board, and baggage checks.Impossible to have a cage that open get through.Secondly, the noise that is happening, all the crashes and broken things, the personnel working on the train would have to respond. After the Sarin gas subway attack in Japan in the 90's they have very strict anti-terrorism training,When the guy breaks the back window, that would immediately trigger a pressure/derailment sensor, and the conductor would stop the train at the next station.All of the other passengers just disappear when they are not in a scene. Count the people in the cars at the start of the movie, easily 55+. Yet non of them ever are shown to exit.They couldn't even get one of the most obvious facts right about the snake venom, ""The venom of the boomslang snake was analyzed and it was revealed that boomslang venom is highly potent and primarily is a hemotoxin.Hemotoxins are toxins that destroy red blood cells, disrupt blood clotting and can also cause organ and tissue damage. Because boomslang venom is a hemotoxin it's not surprising that it can lead to major brain and muscle hemorrhage. But the venom also causes other symptoms like nausea, headaches and sleepiness. Perhaps what is most surprising is that this venom has the ability to make the victim bleed from every possible orifice. It is not uncommon for blood to seep out of the victim from the gums, nostrils, urine, saliva, stools, vomit and even through the tiniest of cuts. This is extremely unfortunate because the victim will continue to bleed until death and death from internal bleeding is a slow and lingering process that can take anywhere from three to five days.One of the issues with boomslang venom is that symptoms emerge only several hours after being bitten. Because the venom is not fast acting, victims may not realize that they are at serious risk and require immediate medical assistance. Although records show that less than ten people have died from boomslang bites worldwide, this ought to not be taken lightly. Death came swiftly for Karl Schmidt, as he was found dead 24 hours later in his home from respiratory arrest and severe brain hemorrhaging. If Schmidt had known about the anti-venom his life might have been spared. It is imperative to act quickly otherwise Africa's most venomous snake might have the last laugh.""The snake isn't even the right color.","73 out of 149 found this helpful.

Pitt is a collector out to retrieve a steel briefcase on Japan's bullet train which he gets fairly easy & quickly but there are a smattering of shadowy figures (played by Brian Tyree Henry, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Joey King, Hiroyuki Sanada, Bad Bunny, Zazie Beetz, Andrew Koji) swirling about who engage Pitt at inopportune moments to make his cakewalk of a task anything but. Directed by Deadpool 2's David Leitch, the film finds itself in equal parts Tarantino/Ritchie land w/a huge dosage of CGI environments which give the film a particular sheen but eventually the novelty & chutzpah of the affair soon wears away & even Pitt's easygoing charm is lost in the neon colors & loud shebangs. Masi Oka (from Heroes) & Karen Fukuhara (from The Boys) show up as train employees & heavy hitters like Sandra Bullock & Michael Shannon make late stage appearances as key characters (although why the releasing studio would show Bullock in the ads kind of robs the astute viewer of a surprise).","36 out of 70 found this helpful.

I have a feeling that Brad Pitt was aided by a similar instruction and it worked really well. He shone in all his scenes.In summary, two hours well spent.

Amidst all of the dramatic and ridiculous fight scenes you're still tasked with trying to figure out who's pulling all of the strings and wondering how it's all going to play out.At times some of the scenes may drag out a little bit, but it's probably for the best so that it gives you a bit of time to process everything going on as well as recover from all of the the gruesome deaths that are frequently taking place.Definitely a solid summer comedic action movie as the summer season begins to ""die down"" (pun intended).","44 out of 80 found this helpful.

The scenes of violence can be heavy-handed, too sped up, and contrived. While the movie is packed with weapon action and fight scenes, if you blink you'll miss it since the movie devotes more film time on conversation and flashbacks than on action.

In reality, it's a complete and total farce. I usually don't enjoy farce, but this movie is an exception. It's so well done that I was actually able to watch the whole thing. With a star-studded cast -- including lots of cute cameos -- it's a pretty enjoyable if improbable two hours.Overall, everyone turned in fine performances. I especially liked Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Before BULLET TRAIN, he was unknown to me, but his turn in this movie was really outstanding. I hope to see him in another movie soon. The other standout was Joey King, who has been good in every movie I've seen her in to date.I won't spoil, but near the end, there's a scene that put me in mind of a hilarious sequence from ARCHER in which the entire ISIS crew is being shot with beanbag rounds in slow motion. I haven't laughed so hard since, until tonight.So much duplicity, tons of action, and lots of snakes inhabit this bullet train, and in spite of the full-on absurdity, it manages not to go completely off the rails. 7 stars.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

The style of the film does not reach the level of the above mentioned films and the film didn't tide all the knots that well in the end.I had, however, just before watching the film, had a dispute with the tax administration. Perhaps this is why I was looking for a film of this style.One other problem was the length of the film. The joke got old.

Undeniably, I did chuckle for approximately 12 seconds of the 2 hour, 7 minute runtime. I do recognize there was humor throughout, it just didn't land for me.Multiple strangers on a train/villain stereotype of decades past keep overlapping their stories, goals and one-liner/bullets are flying everywhere. Trying to keep up on a bullet train isn't as easy as they make it look.This action/comedy is Fast & Furious impossible. There were a few incidences in the first half that made me do a double take in this seemingly ""realistic"" film. But, the stunts and way people survive the incredible got progressively cornier.It's watchable as I was able to make it all the way to the end. I've been looking forward to this since it was released 4 months ago and I'm super glad I could watch for free on Netflix (friend pays for the service.) I would've really been let down if I had seen this in theatres. It was just meh.When the lead (Brad Pitt) doesn't even look that interested in being on the train, it's hard to have enthusiasm to get to the end.***Final Thoughts: But, admittedly, the last act was better than the first two...as long as you leave your brain right at that door. It's gonna get silly crazy.","145 out of 259 found this helpful.

In short, it gets you hooked.The plot is complex, but not convoluted. No, it is positively intelligible. I loved the way it was slowly resolved. The premise itself, while not original, makes for some impressive and masterfully directed action scenes.Visually, I think the film has some impressive shots to offer. Particularly those that illustrate the plot of the Japanese players. The explicit but intelligent storytelling that emanates from the visuals is also remarkable.I loved the musical choices in this film, as they perfectly underscore certain scenes.The humour is not always hit and miss but it is very funny.There are only two elements of this film that I feel should be addressed. Firstly, the excessively gory violence at times. Secondly and finally, from a logical point of view, the fact that the events and fights that take place on the train are barely noticed by the other passengers.In summary, this enjoyable and energetic film offers a well-constructed plot with neat visuals, songs and masterful action.It's more then a bland action-in-a-train film.","13 out of 29 found this helpful.

It is frenetic with its constant explanation of the plot from different points of view.It might not be entirely original but plaudits to director David Leitch for pulling it off and adding a few cameos in the process.Ladybug (Brad Pitt) is a last minute replacement ordered to steal a briefcase on a bullet train travelling from Tokyo to Kyoto. Ladybug seems to be having some kind of a crisis of conscience regarding his profession and is also a magnet for bad luck.The case is in the possession of 'brothers' Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry) and Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who are carrying the case for notorious mobster known as The White Death. They are also escorting his drugged up son.The train also has some other sinister types ranging from a Japanese assassin to an English schoolgirl.Ladybug finds that retrieving the briefcase is far from easy. He has tangled with some of the passengers in the past, one of whom has shot Ladybug twice.The film is deliberately zany, cartoonish violence, some of the CGI is bad. I found it all rather enjoyable. Undemanding fun and my bottle of mineral water agrees.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

And I am glad that I did, because this was a rather enjoyable movie, and there was a great pacing to the storyline, and the action was almost non-stop from start to end.Writer Zak Olkewicz managed to put together quite an entertaining storyline here, based on the book from K√¥tar√¥ Isaka. Now, I haven't read the book, so how true the 2022 movie is to the source material, I can only guess. But this movie was definitely worth sitting down to watch.There is a lot of action in the movie, and it is rather nicely choreographed and brought to the screen in an enjoyable manner. It was a visually pleasing movie in terms of action sequences and pure action eye-candy. And for this alone, actually, ""Bullet Train"" is well-worth taking the time to watch.They had put together quite a nice cast ensemble for the movie, and Brad Pitt in the lead was definitely carrying the movie quite well. And actors Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Hiroyuki Sanada, Brian Tyree Henry and Michael Shannon helped Pitt to carry the movie quite well. ""Bullet Train"" also have some great appearances by the likes of Masi Oka, Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum and Ryan Reynolds.If you haven't already seen ""Bullet Train"", and if you enjoy a good old fashioned fast paced action movie with a lot of action, then you most certainly should sit down to watch ""Bullet Train"". However, while I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, I actually doubt that I will ever return to watch the movie a second time, simply because there doesn't actually seem to be enough contents to the storyline to support more than a single viewing.My rating of ""Bullet Train"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

It reminded me of a dinner we had in a tourist restaurant in Morocco where the courses kept coming and coming until we began to despair. And yet on it went...just look like this movie.There was clearly a fair amount of technical talent that went into this turkey, but creative inspiration was noticeably absent. Instead of anything original, the viewer is subjected to an endless stream of sub-Tarantino and sub-Guy Ritchie guff that someone apparently thought was clever. Even cameos from Channing Tatum and a painfully face-lifted Sandra Bullock add zero to the experience.In sum, this expensive fiasco is like an evening gown that incorporates $10,000 worth of material in a design by a JC Penney junior assistant: gaudy, vulgar and a colossal misfire.","441 out of 834 found this helpful.

As a result I ended up watching it a second time in order to catch some key plot points I missed during the first viewing and there's a difference between watching to pick up key plot points you missed the first time and watching in order to see if you can find key details.On the positive side the trailer didn't give away all the best or funniest parts of the movie nor did they show all the action, one of my biggest concern about movies like this but it's unlikely that I'll go out of my way to watch it again or invite friends and family over for a pizza movie night. The best thing I could say about it is that it's slightly better than okay.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Makes for a solid action-packed affair that delivers plenty of fast-paced fun that one could hope for","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8398311/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","4 August 2022","""Bullet Train"" is an action comedy film based on the Japanese novel ""Maria Beetle"" by Kotaro Isaka. Directed by David Leitch (""Atomic Blonde"", ""Deadpool 2"", ""Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw"") and starring Brad Pitt, Joey King, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, it makes for a solid action-packed affair that delivers plenty of fast-paced fun that one could hope for.In Tokyo, Japan, veteran assassin Ladybug (Brad Pitt) is sent by his employer on one last assignment onboard a bullet train before he retires from the business for good. While there, Ladybug soon discovers that he's not the only assassin taking this particular train, as there are others who have similar related objectives in mind. As the train hurdles along the tracks at a ridiculous speed, it becomes clear that not everyone is going to make it out alive and that something worse could be awaiting the survivors at the final station.Since his uncredited directorial work on 2014's ""John Wick"", David Leitch has emerged as one of the most notable action film directors working today. He's one of the few filmmakers (along with Matthew Vaughn) who knows how to strike the right balance between strong violence and dry humour, which I've seen many others fail at miserably. This clever blending of stylistically shot fight scenes with comedy has helped Leitch's brief filmography stand above many of the more forgettable films in the genre. Leitch's latest film ""Bullet Train"" continues this winning formula with a good dosage of fistfights, swordfights, and comic relief to boot.There's a lot to enjoy about a film that pits different types of assassins against each other, especially ones with their own unique gimmick. We see that Ladybug's special ability in combat is that he usually finds a way to succeed through failure. For example, an adversary may have gained the upper hand over him in a physical battle but is later trounced due to something out of left field that happens to them in the surrounding environment. I couldn't help but chuckle at the sheer silliness of something like that but at the same time appreciate the creative ways these inadvertent victories were written into the story. Moments like these made me enjoy the character interactions in this film so much more, because all of them have their own funny little quirk that contribute to the overall amusement factor.Like with his previous films, Leitch injects plenty of stylised action into practically every scene, even ones focused mainly on exposition. Anything, and I mean anything, can end up being used as a weapon, from a scotch glass to a paperback book, sort of like with John Wick and a pencil. Best of all, shakycam is a rare sight, allowing for a more grounded approach to these all-out brawls. As the film is primarily set on a train, Leitch makes the most of the cramped conditions whenever characters are fighting against one another. There are very few places for people to hide, other than behind some seats, and by the time the fight has relocated to another carriage, somebody may already be dead. Additionally, the fast moving train also provides an opportunity for people to be thrown out windows or beheaded using the side of a tunnel. All of this might sound incredibly violent, and while it is, most of it is played for comedic effect. Usually whenever a gory moment occurs, it happens so fast that you'll end up laughing at how sudden the whole thing was. This is the best way to alleviate the severity of scenes like these as they don't give the audience enough time to process the brutality and instead allows them to laugh and move on to the next set of action.However, I think the main problem with the film is its cluttered second act. While everything is set up relatively well during the first third, I found that afterwards the film attempted to gel all of the different characters' stories together in a rather sloppy fashion. Instead of all the assassins meeting each other in clever ways, the film simply has them interacting for the first time via incidental means. For instance, in once scene Ladybug comes into contact with an assassin named ""Hornet"" (Zazie Beetz) by simply bumping into her inside the luggage compartment, causing a fight breaks out over a misunderstanding rather than something of personal importance. Though these parts did provide some humour, they did feel rather forced at times. Despite this, the third act almost makes up for everything. It is so fast-paced, so exciting, and so fun to watch that you nearly forget about the second act's problems altogether.Out of all the cast members, it is Brad Pitt who of course stands out the most as Ladybug, since he is essentially the closest the film has to a hero. Though you could hardly consider him to be a ""good guy"" in the conventional sense, Ladybug is not your typical anti-hero, since he has a decent sense of honour in what he does. He is aware that after all his years in the assassination business, he luck is bound to run out sooner or later. Pitt is able to tap into that sensitive side of Ladybug, bringing out some emotional vulnerability whenever the audience needs to see it while simultaneously using his skills as an assassin to attack and defend himself from anyone who tries to take him on.I won't speak too much about the rest of the cast since giving away most of their character's personality traits will spoil many great moments. But what I will do instead is say what I liked most about the way some of the actors played them. Joey King's character is a young British girl named Prince who is clearly hiding a big secret from the rest of the train's passengers. Being American in real life, King's English accent in the film was flawless and she definitely fooled me into thinking she was really a Brit. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry were an amusing pair of English contract killers named Tangerine and Lemon respectively, with the latter having a strange obsession with Thomas the Tank Engine. These two generated the most laughs for me, but I also thought the backstory for their friendship was a nice touch as well. I should also mention that there are a few surprise cameos to keep an eye out for, which for obvious reasons I am not going to reveal here.If you like cleverly choreographed action, an interesting cast of characters, and some good humour to go along with it, then ""Bullet Train"" may just do the trick. What it lacks in a cohesive story it more than makes up for in virtually everything else. Now I haven't read the original novel from which the film is based on but it seems the only noticeable liberty that been has taken is the casting of Caucasian actors like Brad Pitt in certain roles, which isn't that big a deal to me since everyone uses pseudonyms anyway. This minor technicality is causing some controversy but I implore all the sensible viewers out there to overlook this and simply enjoy the film for the fine entertainment it is.I rate it 8/10.","42 out of 80 found this helpful.

Unsurprisingly, things don't go quite as planned, with several other top assassins on board the train, their missions bringing them into conflict with each other.As a mindless popcorn movie, Bullet Train is entertaining enough, but for the first few stops, I had serious doubts. The film felt like it was trying way too hard to be cool and quirky, with a lot of the dialogue feeling very forced, such as hitman duo Lemon and Tangerine's Thomas the Tank Engine banter. It just didn't feel natural and wasn't as clever or amusing as the writer clearly thought it was (and they obviously thought the Thomas stuff was something special, 'cos they repeat it an awful lot!). The first half of the film feels like something from the late 90s/early 2000s - a bit Tarantino, a little Robert Rodriguez, with a smidge of Guy Ritchie - only it's not Tarantino, Rodriguez or Ritchie at their best.Thankfully, as the film speeds closer and closer to its destination, and the action ramps up, it gets a lot more enjoyable, director David Leitch gradually pulling all of the different plot threads together, fate, luck, coincidence, and karma all playing their part. Plus, it gets mega violent towards the end, with gory death scenes that make one wonder what a film has to do these days in order to get an 18 rating (how times have changed).6.5/10, generously rounded up to 7.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

I like action-comedy films in general, but this one is especially awesome, in my opinion. I find that a lot of them nowadays feel like the same movie, with the same kind of jokes and cliches, and they always have either Dwayne Johnson or Kevin Hart (or both) in them for some reason (they're good actors, but it is weird that it feels like they're in every action-comedy nowadays). I still enjoy them, but they feel a bit repetitive after a while.However, I don't feel this way about this movie. Some might disagree with me, but this movie feels more fresh and definitely more memorable than a lot of the action-comedy films I've seen in the recent years. All the actors were great in this movie, even the ones who had very little screen time. Obviously Brad Pitt nailed this role flawlessly. Brian Tyree Henry's character, Lemon, was fun to watch. He was maybe the funniest character, though a lot of the characters in this movie are pretty funny, and seeing him interact with Tangerine was a delight. Joey King's portrayal as the villain was great, and she nailed the British accent. Some said she didn't really look enough like a ""kid"" in the movie, but, I mean, this isn't the first time we've had an actress in their early 20s playing a teenager. None of the actors on Riverdale or Euphoria look like teens either. I think she was a good pick as Prince, if I'm being honest, and I think she pulls it off here.","14 out of 24 found this helpful.

I just revisited Bullet Train, and it's still a wild ride! While it's not without its flaws, it's still a lot of fun.Director David Leitch knows how to deliver non-stop action, and he doesn't disappoint here. The movie is jam-packed with thrilling sequences that'll have you asking for more. From start to finish, it's a rollercoaster of excitement and adrenaline.That being said, Leitch does stumble in a few places. Like with Deadpool 2, he doesn't quite capture the full potential of the film's tone. It's got plenty of quirky comedy and flashy action, but it could have used a bit more magic and drama to really elevate it.But the cast is definitely a highlight. Brad Pitt is fantastic as the reluctant assassin, bringing just the right amount of charm and wit to the role. Joey King is a scene-stealer as Prince, and Brian Tyree Henry is a blast to watch. And let's not forget about Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who delivers a surprisingly great performance.The movie does drag a bit in the middle, and it's about 10-15 minutes too long. The need to explain things in flashback slows down the pace, which is a bit of a bummer. But overall, Bullet Train is still a fun, action-packed thrill ride that's worth checking out. Leitch may not have nailed it completely, but he's definitely getting better at delivering top-notch entertainment.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 10.0

Which is fine, bonkers can be done well. But by the time the last 20 minutes come i was left feeling that the story was full of holes, boring, and I didn't really care how it ended, it wasn't all very believable.

Well versions of them (sometimes with other lyrics too) - like the ""hero"" song to name but one. Very well placed to say the least.But apart from the songs it is the genius casting and the wonderful directing that elevates this. Also while you may have issues with CGI (blood), it really helps the movie too (especially considering everything apparently was shot on sets).Cinematography is off the rails (no pun intended) and really beautiful. I don't think it was necessary to watch it on an Imax screen, but it did pack a pun(ch) or two ... so not dissapointed either. Brad Pitt may be the most zen, but also the most action packed on screen you have seen ... well at least for the length he is doing it (no pun again).As I already said, the movie has a fantastic cast. Some of the names are not revealed in the (end) credits. And I only really knew of one of the cameos - it is the lady you hear in Pitts ear (you may even recognize her, even if you don't know who she and the fact that she is returning a favor - or is it the other way around?).There is a fair amount of violence and a lot of cool dialog along the way. In the beginning the it seemed like it wasn't mixed right though and the accents may have thrown me off a bit too. Needed some time to adjust - also the fire rapid dialog does not give you much room to breathe.Cool actors playing cool characters. I even felt rooting for the bad guys. Although technically all of them were bad guys if we are being truthful. But this is an action movie with a lot of fun stuff in it. Be it visually or in the spoken text. It even has quirks such as having two masked goons argue over a trivial thing they have to do ... but the circumstances of the briefcase they have to check and the resolution that we do expect ... well all of that elevates that scene and that odd bit quite a lot ... even if you actually could have cut it out of the movie without ""hurting"" the story of the movie. But it enriches the movie and it makes it better for it.I really loved the movie as you can tell and the director already had proven he can make good movies. But he has taken it to a whole new level here. You can nitpick of course and find flaws and mistakes ... but the way it is shot and the gusto with which it is made ... the passion behind it ... there is so much that works that it overshadows anything that would shine a negative light on it - no pun intended. Now strap on your seatbelt and enjoy the ride (you know I had to do it, right?)","37 out of 76 found this helpful.

The choreography was pretty amazing and hats off to the stars and stunt players.To be honest the only thing that I felt let down by was the CGI in some scenes and the slightly unbelievable nature of certain scenes too but I'm not throwing out spoilers.I highly recommend this movie. There are a few subtitles here and there but certainly not enough to put anyone off that doesn't like them as it takes up very little of the movie.","15 out of 27 found this helpful.

This pretext is used to frame scenes, in a confined environment (a Japanese high-speed train) of indirect then direct confrontations between these different killers. We like the tone, which oscillates between cold violence and ironic humor.David Leitch, who has yet to make a remarkable film since John Wick (2014) - let's not forget that he co-directed it with Chad Stahelski -; if anything, his Atomic Blonde (2017) has a slight hysteresis.This Bullet Train is his most interesting film since John Wick. Brad Pitt's character manipulates irony. The violence is dry and brutal, and above all very bloody. The whole thing is very abstract. The film is completely unrealistic: the train carriages are empty, or the passengers are unaware of the killers' presence. And it borders on the abstract, with its large, empty tube sets. This lends a particular atmosphere to the film, which is completely implausible in almost all its sequences.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

You certainly wonder now how this is possible with all these great ratings? Well, let me try to explain:I felt it was a pinch of Pulp Fiction with each character having an ""origin story"" which lead to the finale. We had a grain of Reservoir Dogs with the made-up names. There was a drop of Kill Bill with the asian background, the revenge theme (for certains), the Yakuza and the fights. But there were quite a few other influences, too. For example Smoking Aces and Shoot'em Up for their crazy non-sense action.Still I thought it was boring. Hollywood these days is so out of ideas and uninspired and many writers think of themselves at the same level as for example Chrichton, Clancy .... or Tolkien (wink wink, nudge nuge, say no more) yet it becomes obvious they lack the same talent. Here the dialogues were supposed to be funny, but Hollywood is churning out one remake/reboot/update/modernized version/clone/plagiarism etc at a ludicrous pace that the customer - that's us - is getting fat, uninterested, bored, underwhelmed and it takes much more to get the praise these movie companies think they automatically deserve.""Consume and root for our product ... until our next product.""Sorry, this movie lacked (for me) everything the aforementioned movies have, so no, this wasn't for me ""the blockbuster"" so many people make it out to be.

It follows the interaction between, I think, nine assassins on the train at various times for related reasons that are totally at cross-purposes.The primary characters are Ladybug (Brad Pitt), a retired assassin who has rejected violence but fills in for another agent to grab and escape a suitcase of money. His handler, Maria (Sandra Bullock), is present primarily by voice. The other primary killers are Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry), British brothers hired to protect The Son (Logan Lerman), the son of mob leader White Death (Michael Shannon). Another key player is a British schoolgirl (Joey King) with her own agenda. Yuichi Kimura (Andrew Koji) is a criminal father seeking revenge for the attempted murder of his son. Yuichi's father (Hiroyuki Sanada) is also involved. Even a boomslang snake gets engaged.The film follows a convoluted story on the train from Tokyo to Kyoto. Much of the humor is broad, and although the violence is explicit, it is never really gruesome. As it proceeds, it seems more and more like a Marvel superhero movie with many special effects. Ladybug is still standing at the end, which is all you need to know.If you like action movies that border on the ridiculous, you'll probably enjoy ""Bullet Train."" The plot is a little too convoluted, but Brad Pitt is great in the lead role. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, and Joey King are also memorable.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

I guess they are going to post rather negative reviews. If you thought that ""Bullet Train"" was about fast trains in Japan you'd be wrong. It's a little bit of ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" ""Snakes on a Plane,"" and ""Superman"" where you will see guys do impossible things. It is a serious movie and it's a comedy. It is difficult to follow, but it makes some sense. It can be ridiculous at times, but, why shouldn't it be? There might be more people killed in this movie than in ""Saving Private Ryan"" in its opening scene. There is a purpose for all these deaths, or is there? There are some cameos of great actors who have nothing to do with the purpose of the story but fit into the plot. Don't leave as the credits start to roll - stay at least, until mid-way through them. The movie will not be an Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences award winner, and it isn't even trying to be. Some graphics are amazing, some gory, and the language is at many times harsh (prepare for that). Remember when Hollywood said they'd stop promoting smoking? Well, at least in this one, they kept their promise. And, you will learn about the most important and enjoyable item on a bullet train (""If I had one in the chamber, I'd rock this bad boy right now""). Oh, yeah, and don't drink the water.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Is it possibly because you didn't follow the actual dialog of the movie? For me- over the past few years- there's something 'up' with the sound in movies where the dialog is buried under sound effects or music. Drives me nuts. Ok, add subtitles on your TV and boom, you get what's going on. I wish filmmakers would get a handle on that so that subtitles aren't necessary. Besides the point.I don't think I have ever seen Brad Pitt not do something well. His comedic timing is really great here and if you pay attention (that means: put down your phone, stay awake, and pay attention for more than 5 minutes) the movie is pretty decent. His bathroom scenes were pretty darned funny.I WILL say that the trailer didn't make me want to watch this film. Not sure what was up with that, but it just didn't pique my interest, so I nearly passed. However, checked reviews and also said ""If it sucks within 1/2 an hour, we'll find something else"". Luckily, it was enjoyable.The 2 British guys were also funny. I thought the whole Thomas the Tank Engine was a weird touch at first, but if you go with it and see the brothers when they were younger, it made sense. But they were good together.The Tarantino comments review comments are probably warranted. All the gore was kind of overdone, but the movie was still a good watch.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The first 25 minutes didn't do the movie any favors as it looked like a cheap parody of Pulp Fiction with pretentious dialogue and excessive self indulgence. I began to contemplate if I was going to end up watching Machete 3 based on the initial action, but then the plot began to get interesting, combat dialed up and the train took off.Bullet Train revolves around a bunch of assassins running after a highly prized briefcase that belongs to a crime boss named White Death. Additionally, every single killer on board has their own unique objective which ends up being derailed as new characters come into the picture. After the initial drag, the film turns into a highly dynamic ride of violence with bright colors, eccentric characters and cool choreography.While most of the cast fit their parts, I can't possibly understand what did Joey King do to get the leading role. The eccentric nature of the film can feel excessive at times as half the edginess ends up being pure cringe; I mean the whole Thomas the Train went from being a fun gimmick to an overbearing annoyance. The humor is split about 50/50 depending on your sense of humor and the dialogue can be laughably stupid at times.Nevertheless, all these negatives didn't ruin the overall fun experience that progressively dialed up the action while having a nice little element of ""who-dun-it"" with plenty of cameos. I also loved the ""subtle"" Fiji advertising. Naturally, Brad Pitt is the driving force behind this locomotive and he is highly enjoyable in the role of a chilled out assassin. Not much to see in the cinema nowadays but this film was definitely worth the trip.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

But by the third act, it actually comes together for a really enjoyable finale.Pitt plays his part as a perpetually confused but still capable action lead. Think if Jeff Bridges' the Dude from Big Lebowski suddenly became the lead in one of those Tarantino ripoff action flicks. He reminds us audience members that he still has the chops as an action lead but remains charming and funny.The supporting cast is a giant one and most of them fare well in their given roles. Granted they are all playing cartoon characters but they are colorful and memorable ones at least.Hiroyuki Sanada is excellent as a wise swordsman while Joey King is a great love-to-hate villain as a cold killer masquerading as an innocent schoolgirl. Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson have this back-and-forth as hitmen who happen to be twins. Yes seriously. That is not a funny joke imo but there is a running gag about Thomas the Tank Engine that pays off surprisingly well in the climax.The movie does run a tad too long and there is a lot of CGI in the closing action scene. But it still has good jokes and visual gags like the rest of the movie leading up to it.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Even in bad movies he is delightful. He's an assassin on the job on a Japanese bullet train. And then you're wondering now how's this gonna play out. I love how he plays the slightly dissholved hit man dude. I loved how he was bumbling his way through this movie, and I thought he may never accomplish his target. Then he also has to compete with 2 or 3 more assassins, who seem to be just as inadequate. What a fun way to travel on the worlds fastest train ride. There was a lot going on, as you can possibly imagine! And quite frankly I had to watch Bullet train several times to get the whole gist of what was happening, it's a fun train ride is my answer as to not spoil the films premise.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","This is a very fun and enjoyable action/comedy - though certainly not without its flaws.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8463129/?ref_=tt_urv","christiancj19","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur148881000/?ref_=tt_urv","18 August 2022","First and foremost, I would like to recognize and actively appreciate the very thesis of this film, that of which being a high-budget star-driven original blockbuster not attached to any previous cinematic-related IP. Even if films of this nature are a swing and a miss, I think it's important to, at the very least, celebrate the effort.As far as positives go, I really enjoyed just about everyone's performance in this film - the highlights of which being Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, whom I think had undeniably strong chemistry and easily the most interestingly-developed characters of the whole movie. I also think the action sequences themselves are beautifully-creative in design. The imaginative thesis of their design perhaps overshadows the execution a tad, but not in a way that dragged from the overall presentation.However, I do think the style and editing of the film can be a bit obnoxiously-overbearing at times. While it certainly is trying to achieve a style-over-substance product in its intention, I think the very notion of such a film within itself can quickly become tiresome and slightly annoying. In my view, if every single scene is dialed to a 10, then its overall impact on the audience becomes increasingly dwarfed as time goes on. A balance should be achieved, and I don't think this film knew exactly where to draw the line.In the end, I think this is a highly entertaining spectacle that absolutely deserves to be seen in theaters. It's not perfect - I'm not sure I'd even call it great - but it's unbelievably a fun experience at the theaters, and I had a great time watching.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

By the end, I knew where it was going as the plot is straight forward but the superficial story telling did not have me bought in. The twists don't work well since we don't get enough background on the big ensemble to care much about them. HOWEVER. Brad Pitt is a phenomenal presence from start to finish. He takes a jokey script and plays it amazingly. I felt like the character was somewhat of a play off his awesome Once Upon a Time in Hollywood one since he was incredibly laid back and funny yet somehow super engaging. If not for Pitt, I would have rated this a 5. He makes up for a chaotic movie that does not have enough runtime or sharp writing to stick the landing. I would compare watching the movie to watching a random sports game on TV that has some ridiculous plays and a star talent. You're entertained but you couldn't care less about who wins.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

A former professional assassin code-named Ladybug (Brad Pitt) goes back to work with a newly positive attitude, where he is assigned by his handler, Maria Beetle (Sandra Bullock) , to collect a briefcase aboard a bullet train travelling from Tokyo to Kyoto after her normal contact, Carver (Ryan Reynolds) , is forced to call out due to illness. Unbeknownst to the mission tasked to Ladybug, three other killers are on board: hit-men brothers Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry) and deceptively innocent schoolgirl The Prince (Joey King) . Tangerine and Lemon have been contracted by White Death (Michael Shannon) , ringleader and head of the world's largest crime syndicate, who seized control of the Japanese underworld years before.. The end of the line is just the beginning!Thrilling and nail-biting movie with plot twists , violent struggles , kinetic energy , very high body-count and paced in a comic-book style. In the purest style of filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, Bullet Train is all action, with charismatic, satirical characters, extensive dialogues full of ironic phrases, explicit violence and a narrative structure with continuous time jumps. The picture based on the novel Bullet Train by Kotaro Isaka, follows a group of gangsters who meet in a high-speed train traveling from Tokyo to Marioka. Most of them do not know each other and supposedly have different targets , but nothing could be further from reality, since their missions intersect in ways that not even they suspect . It's an action-packed film with an engaging mingle of suspense , martial arts , gun-play , killing rituals with weird codes and bloody shootouts . The plot is simple and plain , as hired killer Ladybug being forced into action and steadily butchering his merciless enemies , while inching ever closer to the long-awaited bloody reunion with the boss killer who attempts to exact a relentless vendetta . This is a bone-chilling thriller with non-stop action , including impressive fighting with a lot of blood and gore . It's a mindless but enjoyable for thrillers and martial arts aficionados of the old style , but adding some new technical being made by means of digital computer generator as well as expert stunts . Abundant fist-fights and lethal fights in which arms and body parts are slice off here and there and limbs are slit open everywhere or blasted apart . Of course , highlights of the film are the impressive and groundbreaking fights with lots of blood dropping here and there. .Together with Brad Pitt, other good actors are part of the ensemble cast in the film with a lot of nice and familiar players , such as : Joey King (Wish Upon) , Aaron Taylor Johnson (Avengers), Brian Tyree Henry (Eternals), Hiroyuki Sanada (47 Ronin) , Andrew Koji, although it has numerous cameos, such as : the singer Bad Bunny, Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds, Masi Oka, Logan Lerman , Michael Shannon and Channing Tatum.It displays a charming and rousing musical score by Dominic Lewis , including some popular and catching songs . As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by cameraman Jonathan Sela. The motion picture was competently directed by David Leitch , who began his career as Pitt's stunt double in The Fight Club. In fact , on the martial arts circuit, he met Chad Stahelski with whom has co-directed some films .Leitch who was living in LA, starting his career as a stuntman. Leitch is a martial artist, skilled in several arts such as: Muay Thai, Shootwrestling, boxing, wrestling, movie fights, and was a national competitor in Kickboxing. Leitch is well known producer/director of box office films , such as : John Wick (2014) , Deadpool: No Good Deed (2017), Deadpool 2 (2018), Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw (2019) and Atomica (2017). Rating : 7.5/10 . Above average. The pic with appeal to Brad Pitt fans.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I am not trying to sound pretentious, I understand some movies are just meant to be fast paced and action-packed, but I needed something else so that it wouldn't feel just like noise by the end of it.The performances are a standout, this isn't the best Brad Pitt has been, but he is functional to the story and believable as the capable yet desperate protagonist Ladybug.Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are surprisingly great as the unlikely twins Lemon and Tangerine, the relationship between the two characters felt to me like the direct connection with the audience throughout the film, this is the only emotional arc I actually care about (did I find Aaron hotter than Brad Pitt too? Wow, never thought the say would come).","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

And yes, a lot of others attempted to follow those same master footsteps before and the majority failed miserably.This attempt, however, is also undeniably different and presents a perfect example of how it can actually work: derivation becomes an ironic yet respectful bow to the master, and same old recognisable tricks mixed in a fresh talented arrangement become a masterpiece in its own right.That's how the magic of creation happens anyway, in my opinion: everyone has the same elements to use and mix, but some mixtures fall flat and others fly off. This one is obviously the latter. This 'just right' combination of the cast, style, setting, music, plot dynamics, ratio of the silly vs funny jokes somehow works and results in a fresh, truly hilarious and engaging spectacle. Could be a sign of a true talent or a pure luck, but does it really matter?","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

But the movie looked like it could be enjoyable, and despite the less than amazing critical response, it still seemed like it had enough things going for it. Maybe it all helped to lower my expectations, because I had a good time with this overall; definitely ended up better than I was expecting.It's also difficult to write about in any great depth. It's just straightforward, fairly stupid entertainment, with a plot that's got many moving parts, but ultimately, all that matters is there's a bunch of shady criminals/assassins on a single bullet train, and they clash and fight and banter amongst themselves for two hours before the end credits roll.It's a good time while you're watching it, but it definitely dawned on me as soon as it finished that a fair amount of it didn't add up, or otherwise felt a little too silly. Still, I barely worried about that while the movie was actually going on, so I'm not even sure it's too much of a problem to realise the ride was kind of contrived when the ride itself was fun.What was more noticeable - when it comes to flaws - was the hit and miss humour. Some of the comedy worked, but some of it didn't really, and there were a few jokes I think they could have cut completely from the movie, which also would have helped with the pacing.But there's enjoyable action, simple but fun characters, and a cast doing mostly solid work. Brad Pitt is surprisingly good, and gives a central performance that is to this movie what Lebowski's rug was to his room: he really tied it all together.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I loved it's almost retro looking poster and became interested.Directed by David Leitch, this is based on the Japanese novel of the same name. The plot remains the same, where an assassin who wants to retire is brought into another mission that is secretly interconnected with missions that various other assassins are on. To avoid spoilers, I'll keep it at that.For the record, Brad Pitt in action comedies is usually gold and this is no different. On that note, don't expect too much from this and you will have a blast. There's no real drama. It's sort of reminiscent of Mr. And Mrs. Smith in terms of tone, another film starring Pitt.The action fits the tone. It's action packed but keeps you laughing and into what's going on.The cast is tremendous. Pitt and Sandra Bullock are naturally awesome but I was completely surprised by Joey King, who I thought was miscast at first, but she does a great job.The only real flaw is that the film is not for everyone. This is very much a movie that will appease action fans, but not really anyone else.So overall, it's fun, funny and action packed. Go in with those expectations and it won't let you down.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It is not a conventional whodunnit, but it shares many elements of that narrative type. In a constricted setting (in this case a bullet train), we are given clues about a murder as events progress. In that context we get to know a brief background story of several passengers and their connection to the central plot.The difference here is that the main character comes through the whole thing in a whimsical lucky fashion, rather than through his detective skills. It still shares in the spirit of Agatha Christie though, in the sense that the detective is not hired necessarily for the job, but comes across the mystery by accident. Here, however, the idea of accidents is at the core of the movie's philosophy or message, which is not really that hidden. As in the audience does not have to work to get the message the movie is trying to communicate. For it is blatantly given through the characters' dialogues: there is no bad luck or good luck, there is only fate. Don't fight or curse that fate but accept it. That kind of flow philosophy is reminiscent of many eastern philosophies, stoicism and other spiritual traditions.This is another important feature of this movie, which is diversity and globalization. The movie is set in Japan and there are many Asian actors with crucial roles. There are also Mexicans, Russians, British, etc. Several languages are spoken, references to anime and British cartoon, diverse music, etc. This all makes the movie feel international, and although this sometimes feels like it is forced, it is balanced out by the witty and whimsical nature of the movie.The dialogue itself is not bad, and extremely funny. This is an entertaining movie from start to finish. The actors are charismatic and perform their roles well. Brad Pitt plays a role that we are not used to see him in, a sort of hipster. He does it in a subtle way though that goes well with the plot.The gore in the movie is over the top and really unnecessary in my opinion. I understand that it is part of the general feel of the movie. Where it seeks to be silly by being over the top in everything, but still I didn't enjoy the level of blood. The action sequences are well done though, and in general carry the idea of luck/fate throughout the movie, almost like a looney tunes cartoon. In general, I was entertained by this movie and would recommend it for an easy watch, action comedy. This genre has been lacking for sometime, so the fact that it's done in a new way is itself impressive. Also, I like that the overall message, even if a bit forced and ignores the audience's intelligence, is a good one.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The cinematography combines cyberpunk elements with both traditional and kawaii Japanese culture. The shots involving the White Death felt like they were ripped straight from Ghost of Tsushima with its setting in traditional Japanese temples and households. Meanwhile, the shots of Tokyo in the opening sequence showed off Japan's modern technological cityscape and had a very cyberpunk feel to them. During the train ride, we see more of the modern-day kawaii culture of Japan mostly with the mascots for their most popular anime.To complement the cinematography, the acting was extremely entertaining. I especially liked Brad Pitt's comedic timing and banter with both Sandra Bullock and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Pitt's on screen chemistry with Bullock is so good that I kept referring to this film as The Lost City in Tokyo way too many times. But besides Pitt and Bullock, I really enjoyed Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry's chemistry. The two really feel like brothers and I wished I saw more of their insane adventures as assassins. Additionally, I also liked Joey King as The Prince. This is the second film that I saw Joey King in since Ramona and Beezus. And I have to say, she surprised me with how well she can hold her own among the likes of Pitt and Taylor-Johnson.Besides the cinematography and acting, the action sequences are absolutely insane! The action is tight in both hand to hand combat in addition to some really over-the-top Fast and Furious style set pieces. This should come off as no surprise as David Leitch has loads of experience in the action genre, creating exhilarating and jaw-dropping scenes whether it's in hand to hand combat, car chases or fights on moving vehicles. One aspect of Leitch's filmmaking that I really like is his use of slow motion. Leitch uses slow motion to not only emphasize certain scenes but also allows for audiences to catch their breath and truly absorb the madness unfolding in front of them before the scene snaps back into real time.Despite the insane action, the plot does feel overly cluttered. Coming in at a bit over two hours, the film does feel a bit too long for my taste especially with the multitude of backstories and characters. Speaking of which, I do feel there were too many characters crammed in. I understand that the film was based off a book, but books have the luxury of telling multiple backstories through hundreds of pages, unlike a film. Some characters were just introduced and given a backstory despite only being in the film for a few minutes.Although the film does suffer from a messy plot and too long of a runtime, I still think it's worth checking out for the action, cinematography and humor alone. Bullet Train is more like a Fast and Furious movie than anything else. Treat it as such and you won't be disappointed as you brace yourself for a fun, chaotic ride through The Land of the Rising Sun.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Just goes to show you there's only so much action that can take place on a train and they ran out of ideas. The scripts were just okay. I say just okay because the banter between the duo assassins was full of mumblings and was difficult to understand. They certainly didn't have the best writers for this movie. I don't understand why directors like to throw in a British actor with such a horrible accent that makes it difficult to know what they're saying. That's a clear indicator they're low on creativity and just need some element to fill up the space. I feel they want viewers to take the focus off the boring movie and try to decipher what the character is saying. This is another movie whose writers decided to throw in an extremely fake scenario. It brought this movie to the level of stupidity for a while. How does a train continue to speed up even after ripping out the computer that controls it? And the part where the two trains collided was just as dumb. How does one train go airborne while the other one stays on the track?? Thankfully there were scenes that didn't involve the train so that picked up the pace and energy. Despite not having the best writers it's still better than 90% of the other crap on the red N.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's an entertaining way to spend just over two hours, as long as you have a strong stomach for the frequent graphic violence, but don't expect the story to make much sense, or it to have any depth beyond the level of visceral thrill. Brad Pitt holds the plot together, and Aaron Taylor Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry make a good double act. The attempt to give it a little more depth, by introducing a theme of the effect of fate on a person's life seemed unconvincing, though.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's an instant classic!I love Mr. Pitt so I am biased, but this movie is two hours of nonstop fun. Trains are exciting already so add the element of a train that's called a bullet and you got yourself a story.The plot was very convincing. I thought they portrayed a scenario where many assassins find themselves on the same train very realistically. I don't think this is based on a true story but they could've easily added that in the opening credits and I would have believed it.The title is also very clever because bullet trains are fast and also deadly just like the story in the film. You have punching, kicking, wrestling, poison, guns, swords, trains. If you take all the fighting scenes in this movie and put them together.To quote the Tom Cruise movie, ""you had me at bullet train"". I highly recommend this movie if you're looking to enjoy a Friday night. Maybe you're by yourself, you're a little tired and you don't feel like trying to hang out with friends. Put on this movie and you'll feel like you're with friends.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The ingredients are all to recognizable: a bunch of weird characters, lots of violence, funny soundtrack and lots of flashbacks. But despite all these Tarantino ingredients ""Bullet Train"" simply hasnt got any movie magic or soul.The bad: it's not funny. They have TRIED to make it funny, with lots of silly English accents and supposedly silly situations, but I didnt laugh once. Not once.More bad: it's static. Nothing much happens. Everything takes part in the same setting of the train. That shouldnt have been a problem PROVIDED the characters and the story were strong and interesting. But unfortunately both were NOT interesting at all.Not any good then? Perhaps best suited for those who are just into a brainless ""action"" movie with lots of blood shed. Perhaps fans of that will be interested in watching it.I got bored. Really bored. Why? Because I NEED BELIEVABLE characters and an interesting suspenseful story with true to life dialogues. NONE of that was present. Big DISAPPOINTMENT.

A-listers abound, from lead to supporting on down to the one-off cameos. The performances reflect it. Brad Pitt is... well, Brad Pitt, and. Brian Tyree Henry steals the show at every turn.The production value? Absolutely phenomenal. This is what a nine-figure budget will land you. Movies like this are the future of the box office. If you're not going to feature caped comic book heroes or the seventh installment of a longstanding franchise you're going to have to dazzle audiences, and that's exactly what Bullet Train does.The story? Well... that's where we begin to falter. It's actually a great story, and I can only imagine the structure boards in the writing room. There's a LOT to pull off here narratively. And structurally they do. Bullet Train gives us all the twists, turns, script flips, flashbacks, surprise arcs, and any other storytelling methods conjureable to tell an entertaining story.But the exposition... that's what kills us and is Bullet Train's grand flaw, and why it earns seven stars from me. By the adrenaline-packed third act it's apparent the writers have painted themselves into a proverbial corner and there's not much they can do to back out of it. And then, in a single scene, writer Zak Olkewicz commits the ultimate crime: assassinating the audience with a wearisome, drawn-out expository sequence explaining, in one cumbersome session, half-disguised in entertaining graphics, what the entire plot REALLY was. It's the film's cardinal sin, and ultimately reeks of laziness.Does the film overcome that flaw? Sure, it's wildly entertaining. But from a technical standpoint it's dragged down at its most important moment by a lack of creativity behind the pen. Bullet Train never fully comes off the tracks, but it loses too much steam at its crescendo.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I figured with the cast it'd be cool. Even with that, I went in with super low expectations not really knowing what to expect.I'll agree with what I've read other places; That it takes a good 30-40 minutes before you see what the setup is going to be for this movie but man, did I love it? I had so much fun with this little flick.I do feel like some of the subtle humor flew over the audience I was with but overall, I loved it! This movie is going to fly under the radar but hopefully, it'll find a cult following. There are too many characters and parts to not have some kind of cult following.The sound in my theater was awesome too. After getting on the train, I totally suspended where I was and it felt like I was on a train for the entire movie. The train whooshing/general noise sounds and being able to look out the train windows in the background totally worked for me. The sound in my theater was that good.The last thing I'll say is that's the best theater exit I've had in a while for an action movie. Everyone seemed happy and chatty about what they had just seen. I didn't hear one negative thing about the movie walking out.","20 out of 44 found this helpful.

The director looks like wants to create a similar movie ambiance and absurd action. He may be successfully created Deadpool 2 (2018) but this movie quality is just so so than that. Jokes could be considered as pros but also cons.The movie pros are a lot of huge casts even for cameo roles. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum look like paying their debt to Brad Pitt for his cameo role in their movie, The Lost City (2022). The movie set, costumes, and music are great.Besides that, the movie's biggest pro is an abstract plot that is well-narrated.Firstly, the abstract scenario is when a bunch of chars is contracted to do their own job via bullet train, a very fast train which is ""bullet"" as a metaphor for the train speed. Then, slowly but surely every char. Are collided in the same scenario and is forced to stay on the bullet train. The great narration is the audience is easily distracted to guess how can be all chars are related to the same scenario. A bunch of jokes are provided.But the funny things just happen for some time. Sometimes, too many jokes and it is inappropriate which distracts emotional or intense moments. This becomes movie cons. Absurd jokes maybe could be the perfect thing for our world because there are so many bizarre and chaotic moments, but plz not too much. Even though, there were very absurd jokes which is a vivid ad for a brand that is also an unimportant story.In my POV, movie jokes maybe a lil bit similar to Deadpool 2 (2018), Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), and The Gentlemen (2019). Gentlemen's comedy and action quality are a lil bit similar to The Gentlemen (2019) which is tend to become an elegant and sophisticated fashion.Nevertheless, this movie is fun to watch but don't expect too much. The great cast, absurd jokes, and action are refreshing. Maybe we need that to entertain and escape our minds for a lil bit from reality. As always, I didn't expect anything before watching in the cinema. Enjoy this movie or just pass it.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The writers must've thought that ripping off far superior movies would make the viewer associate this laughable dumpster fire with them and therefore produce a small subliminal dopamine hit. They were wrong, Bullet Train just looks plain bad by comparison. We have the usual tropes, the hit man working through his ""issues"", a pair of cockney geezers talking bollocks about Thomas the Tank Engine, the deadly female assassin dressed as a school girl and psychotic Russian gangsters. These characters are meant to be quirky and entertaining, they are boring and anoying. The fight choreography is terrible, the dialogue excruciating, the CGI diabolical and the acting atrocious. WTF is Brad Pitt doing in this garbage? Surprisingly the third act is better than the proceeding two as elements of the messy plot are resolved but it's still absolute BS.","99 out of 192 found this helpful.

As the plot progresses and connections are made, the time between the aptly devised combat sequences shrinks. The director, David Leitch, showcased some nifty filming in confined locations, and the use of CGI was more restrained than the typical modern blockbuster. There are a few clever plot points, such as the difference between Ladybug and Prince's perceptions of luck, but there was more exposition than I tend to prefer, and it was far from subtle. It was also longer than needed, and I suspect the filmmakers had hopes of a far funnier final product. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant surprise to see Michael Shannon make a brief appearance at the end of the film, as he's one of the more consistent actors currently working. I could think of worse ways to spend a Friday night than grabbing a few drinks with your friends and putting on Bullet Train.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Very fast paced, aggressively quirky in a way that works and pays off most of the time. Character development doesn't stand out because it only occurs in the main protagonist, which is very disappointing because the film does a good job of getting us intrigued in a lot of the side characters, but end up doing nothing once we are made to become invested in these characters. An argument could be made that this is because it adds to the unpredictably that this movie seemingly goes out of its way to incorporate. The plot at times can be confusing and while watching this movie it often becomes an afterthought. Each character has an agenda. But, this agenda changes the longer they stay on the train. Which was hinted at in the trailer and in the movie by seemingly the theme song for this movie ""stayin alive"".Overall this movie got a 7/10 because I believe it accomplished what it was set out to do. This is a very entertaining movie, a lot is happening and it commands your attention and rewards you for giving it. Numerous times I found myself laughing and reacting to the gorey and flashy action sequences that are everywhere in this film. There is an underlying message to be received if you pay attention to ladybugs character arch and it is super relatable and will always be relevant in a more spiritualish way. This movie could have scored a higher rating if more characters were given a better arch. If the plot was more of a priority. If you're looking for something to do on the weekend and are looking for a good time and to be entertained I don't believe you'd be disappointed if you devoluted your time to this film. Is this film going to change your life. Absolutely not, is it a terrible film. Absolutely not. I recommend watching this film if you are interested but you definitely don't need to go out of your way.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Crazy Expository Train Ride","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9422079/?ref_=tt_urv","elicopperman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81864032/?ref_=tt_urv","8 November 2023","As Hollywood tends to enjoy adapting fictional works from Japan, it would make sense that they'd tackle a semi-unknown black comedy thriller novel called Maria Beetle and make it into a theatrical action comedy called Bullet Train. Released in the summer of 2022 to mixed critical responses, it was nevertheless a modest financial success and did bring some awareness of the novel to a mainstream universal audience. Coming from the director of Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2, this kind of film seems like it would be a perfect addition to the type of action flicks we're into nowadays, and rightfully so.The film follows an unlucky assassin named Ladybug whose current mission sets him on a collision course with global lethal adversaries aboard the fastest train in Tokyo, Japan. As this film has a lot going on story wise, it could have so easily gone all over the place and had no real sense of cohesion. Thankfully, the main end goal of all the characters ties everything together as each and every one of them have a different reason for being on said train, or at least in conjunction to said train's schedule. In addition to Ladybug being on the train to steal a briefcase being sent to a terrifying crime boss known as the White Death, there's ""The Prince,"" who puts on the facade of an innocent schoolgirl in lieu of her being a devilishly clever murderer, and British brothers Tangerine and Lemon having to protect the briefcase. There are so many targets and criminals coming into play with the crime spree, many of whom play a significant role in the insanity on display. While Bullet Train's themes of fate, luck and karma are nothing new, the bonkers plot still makes them funny enough to take home.Speaking of bonkers, as much as the film offers carnage and dark drama, its overall tone is much more sardonically comical and somewhat of a lampoon on this type of genre. With a good amount of absurd flashback montages, witty banter during heavy weaponed fight scenes, and mocking the generic tropes common in action packed nonsense, there is a clear influence from modern filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie. Much of this is lifted from the genuine charisma found in the cast such as Brad Pitt, Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, and Sandra Bullock. There is still some stone cold fierce acting from the likes of Andrew Koji and Hiroyuki Sanada, especially since their characters lend the film's much needed pathos in terms of where the train's heading. Perhaps the film doesn't entirely pay off in smoothly transitioning tonally, especially when some characters are more believable than others (Tangerine and Lemon have the best chemistry between each other). That being said, the abstract execution favors the comically absurd in the end.In terms of the visual direction, part of me wonders if this film should have been animated or not given how much insane effort went into crafting the aesthetic built around the train. Since the film is entirely set in Japan, the filmmakers put so much attention to detail in the country's modernesque era and utilized strong action choreography and digitally manipulated effects, partially thanks to director David Leitch's stunt coordinator background. Some of the finest effects work in the film borders on near cartoon-like psychedelia, and there is so much nonstop editing and planned out motion work that one has to wonder if this took any influence from the best animated action films from Japan as well. In addition to some hardcore Japanese covers of popular songs, composer Dominic Lewis implements a strong score that accompanies the hardcore action as much as it puts the drama in its place with heavy lifted orchestrations. It's crazy to think this film had nowhere near the budget that today's blockbusters have, especially when it pulls its effects off better than most of them.So while Bullet Train has so much going on in it, there is still enough to get into thanks to its ludicrous plot, humorous characters and nonstop action packed mayhem. If you're getting tired of all the annoyingly pretentious action flicks coming from Hollywood nowadays, this film is right up your alley as a breath of fresh air. Sure it might not differ too much from the competition due to its similarities to other soulless blockbusters, but there's too much to appreciate about it as a comically absurd take on an already beaten to death subgenre. Besides, it sure beats being on the fast train itself.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's an enjoyable movie for people who like fast-paced action comedies. It isn't nearly as witty as it thinks it is, and some of the banter and running jokes felt a bit forced (I particularly found the Thomas the tank engine refernces a bit weary). What saves it are mostly the performances by Pitt and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. They are clearly having fun, and they have great chemistry whenever they share the screen.Although I found the reveal of the actor who played the White Death a little bit underwhelming, since said actor has been playing this role for so many times.The movie is slick with slightly too much use of green screens, especially the 'outdoor' shots look a bit too fake, due to the poor lighting. Nonetheless the action is mostly entertaining, nothing groundbreaking if you are familiar with 80's or 90's Hongkong movies. The beginning is a bit rough though, since a lot of characters get introduced, accompanied by little flashback vignettes. It's not as elegant as movies like, say, Pulp Fiction but it gets the job done. And the premise reminded me a little bit of Smokin Aces.It's entertaining enough though if you're looking for a light-hearted action-packed evening. And you might want to stay until the end credits if you liked the ride.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I loved the Kill Bill-style narrative and screen-play. The Yakuza v Ladybug and the other attendees of this unfortunate Bullet Train to Kyoto.I am however extremely frusted by the unrealistic and stupid cgi from people running up a Bullet Train (not possible) to fighting on the roof.The choreography is top-level. The stunts inside the train are brilliant. It just is runined by stupidity. I love the idea and the concept but please try and make films realistic.We can do action films without the need of countless CGI usage. It is very dull seeing the same impossible action sequences from films recently.However I loved the storyline. Brad's acting and terrible Japanese was great to view. The casting was superb and I loved the interaction-of-comedy between the actors. Chemistry of casting was absolutely nailed.I however just can't get over the end which is like something a child created with a toy trainset and a storyboard. That is so disappointing as the general film was thoroughly enjoyable and a riot.Just bare in mind that adults with realistic action expecations are watching these movies. Please look back to the great (RIP) Sonny Chiba and what he did for movies as a key reference point example.I'm so sad that this is happening so much to otherwise what would be great movies. A 6/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I must have because I continued to watch it past the halfway mark, even though I had little clue as to what was going on. A lot of people have compared it to 'Snatch' (probably because of Brad Pitt's involvement), but I though its style of story was more in keeping with 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,' due to the way it had multiple characters all with their own weaving storylines which eventually put them all on a collision course with each other.However, where as 'Lock Stock' was set all over London, 'Bullet Train' is kept primarily to a single location of a train as it hurtles through Japan one night. Aboard are a multitude of hitmen and general henchmen from the criminal underworld, all with their own motives. Like I said, the narrative is quite convoluted and I have to confess getting kind of lost most of the way through. Luckily, the film pulls itself together and nicely ties up the various tales to a satisfying ending.Brad Pitt is always good value for money, but it's the two assassins 'Lemon' and 'Tangerine' who steal every scene they're in and could almost be the central characters to a spin-off of their own (and I will never think of 'Thomas the Tank Engine' the same way ever again!).About my main gripe was that the film does feel like it drags a bit near the end. It seems that it's wrapping up and coming to a conclusion, only to keep on going for a further half an hour. I'm pretty sure they could have edited it down by about fifteen minutes here or there to keep it a little tighter.I never saw the trailer before I watched this, but I understand it's cut like some sort of 'Matrix' action film with loads of fight scenes. I would warn anyone that there isn't that much of this and if you're thinking you're in for a wall to wall action epic then you're going to be a bit disappointed.Overall, if you like films with multiple (crime?) story threads that weave and twist, before finally coming together, then you should enjoy this one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's clear that he's capable of crafting a specific style conveyed mostly through entertaining, if often tonally undercut, action. He's not the most visionary director, but he injects each of his movies with enough flair and reverence for practical stunt work that they all have elements which are genuinely successful. This only makes their narrative shortcomings all the more frustrating, though. One of the main problems with 'Bullet Train (2022)' is that it just doesn't have enough action in it. It also doesn't have enough Brad Pitt. Instead, both of these elements are often cruelly sidelined in favour of an annoying ensemble of quirky characters who spend more time talking about 'Thomas & Friends (1984-2021)' (because they're on a train, I guess) than kicking butt like the premise promises. With a messy, flashback-oriented structure and often grating dialogue, the picture is honestly a bit of a chore to get through at times. The cast all do what they can with the material (and accents) they're given, but even the most charming amongst them can't stop the film from being a bit boring whenever it isn't focused specifically on its set-pieces. It's not as funny - or clever - as it clearly thinks it is and, despite looking quite nice, a lot of it feels rather hollow. Having said all that, it does improve fairly significantly as it goes on. Whether it's because the thing has already worn you down by then or if it's because it's genuinely improving in pace and tone and energy with each new scene, the final act is surprisingly enjoyable despite its use of intangible digital effects for some of its biggest moments. There are a few enjoyable sequences prior to the finale (in fact, you sort of accept the affair's flaws after its opening movement and lower your expectations accordingly), but it's near the end where everything really clicks. It's unfortunate that it takes so long to get over its growing pains, but the film is ultimately fun enough for what it is. Although it's over two hours long (and doesn't need to be), it's light and fluffy and fairly fast paced. It's kinetic when it needs to be and features a few well-choreographed fight scenes that don't make the protagonist out to be an unstoppable machine, but rather a self-proclaimed bad luck magnet who's clearly out of his depth. This dynamic makes things more interesting than they otherwise would have been, all without robbing the experience of the exciting to-the-death bouts you expect. The occasional moment of pretty extreme gore is undercut by the generally playful atmosphere, but a couple of gags still provoke a wince and act as nice punctuations to the altercations they typically end. Ultimately, this is a fun but flawed experience that alternates between being annoying and being exciting in almost equal measure. You can see what the filmmakers are going for, but they never quite hit the sweet spot and, as a result, the piece is fairly inconsequential. Still, it's entertaining enough.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I am not sure, but I saw the stereotype story structure in this film providing many foreshadows to be concluded in the last, which is familiar cases in recent Japanese drama. Maybe SONY pressed the staff to tune the story to secure consistency in real Japanese culture. However, I enjoyed slight deviations from fluency in Japanese for every Japanese characters except for Hiroyuki Sanada. This time, we the Japanese can enjoy exotics in this film, just like Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"".","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was especially positively surprised by the performance of Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Tangerine) and Brian Tyree Henry (Lemon) and the depth of their characters on screen.However the storyline, the villain and the motives for the characters are all forgettable.

That's exactly what I got!Bullet Train is visually appealing and stylized with entertaining action sequences paired with quick-witted dialogue. Characters are introduced with an almost video game-like montage and flashbacks. And honestly, some of them reached their expiration dates sooner than I would have liked them to.The movie does a good job of highlighting idiosyncrasies of some characters that make the audience see them as more than two-dimensional hitmen. Overall, however, Bullet Train doesn't do anything so well that I'd be dying to see it again, but I wouldn't mind watching it a second time if it happened to be on.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Bullet train is a prime example.Bullet Train may not be the killer thrill ride you'd expect if you watched the trailer, but it is definitely a great movie, with an amazing cast.

Yes, the characters in the book are collected and intersect at first glance by chance, but when you understand, you understand that their actions are intertwined. But what is in the book that the creators of the film did not understand - crime and punishment, what you always expect and how the book ends. A pitiful sight, the film is not about anything.

"6","/10","A sexy, fast-paced action/comedy tainted by cultural appropriation","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8552716/?ref_=tt_urv","robertrutledge","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur109556130/?ref_=tt_urv","18 September 2022","David Leitch's Bullet Train feels like a Quentin Tarantino movie with some cultural appropriation thrown in the mix. I will do my best not to get too ""woke'' here, but the movie unashamedly exploits Japanese culture despite starring a Caucasian, A-list actor (Brad Pitt). That aside, Bullet Train is quite an adrenaline rush. There is plenty of violence, as to be expected from a big-budget Hollywood action movie. However, Brad Pitt's character, a hippy-dippy, long-haired assassin on some kind of a weird self-help journey, is too comedy-driven for my personal taste. The movie would have been more memorable and in better taste had Andrew Koji's character (who is Japanese), been the main character.The setting, a Japanese highspeed bullet train headed from Tokyo to Kyoto carrying five assassins in pursuit of a briefcase containing millions of dollars, feels very realistic. The acting is believable, even if certain scenes and details are quite far-fetched for either comedy's sake or for the advancement of the plot. Also, it seems a little too convenient that one of the main characters has an obsession with Thomas the Tank Engine when the movie takes place on a train.This movie reminds me a little bit of another movie starring Brad Pitt, which is Babel, a much better movie than this one. The two are similar in that different events from around the world are portrayed that end up all being tied to each other. However, whereas Babel paints a realistic and authentic picture of different cultures, Bullet Train uses stereotypes as a crutch. From the main bad guy, the White Death (played by Michael Shannon), a Russian, playing ""roulette"" with his revolver, to the big-headed anime mascot in the train, there is no shortage of stereotypes on display. Also, as opposed to Babel, it is clear that Bullet Train was made with an English-speaking audience in mind, as the English language is the dominant (although not only) language spoken in this film.I would be very curious to hear how Japanese people have received this movie. I don't think it goes as far as being disrespectful of their culture (other than casting Brad Pitt as the lead role), but I imagine they are tired of being portrayed in such a one-dimensional way to western audiences. Director Bong Joon-ho's movie Snowpiercer, which also takes place on a train, stars an American actor (Chris Evans), and co-stars Asian actors is a better demonstration of fraternity between the American and Korean people than is Bullet Train a demonstration of fraternity between the American and Japanese people. This movie wasn't even filmed in Japan.Also, I won't get into spoilers, but it would have been nice to have seen the Mexican assassin's character, Wolf (played by Bad Bunny), further explored. They at least could have given him a non-anglicized name, ""Lobo,"" which sounds a lot cooler anyway. But that would go against the archetypal names given to the characters throughout the film, I suppose.Overall, I didn't necessarily dislike Bullet Train. There were several occasions where I indeed laughed out loud. The comedy is comparable to that of the James Franco and Seth Rogen movies. Joey King's character, Prince, is particularly interesting and gives the movie a unique vibe. She, along with Brian Tyree Henry's portrayal of character Lemon, may be the movie's saving grace. However, Brad Pitt's character is annoying and the movie shouldn't have starred him just because he's Brad Pitt. While I wouldn't be opposed to giving this movie a second watch, there are a number of things I would have done differently had I been in charge.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Chief murderer is ""Ladybug"" (Brad Pitt), whose therapeutic advice as he delivers a MacGuffin briefcase or his fists is Pulp-Fiction funny (Ladybug: ""Because if you put peace out in the world, you get peace back""). He's in therapy.Ladybug's a ""snatch and grab"" operative delivering that briefcase, hardly a peaceful activity that other assassins also participate in. No Peace Train this. The best rep for all of them is The Prince (Joey King), a sweety pie with a wicked MO. She's lured a father (Andrew Koji) aboard while her past activity involves shoving his son off a bridge. Not to worry, fate will allow the grandfather (Hiroyuki Sanada) to be aboard as well, and rest assured he has that old thriller staple, revenge, riding with him as well.Bullet Train is pervaded by Asian-type philosophy and biting dialogue to mix the sublime and the ridiculous into lessons amidst pleasant chaos. ""Let this be a lesson on the toxicity of anger!"" (Therapist Barry). One car on the train has Kitty-themed seats, a nod to Japan 's Hello-Kitty obsession. Think Eastern Pulp Fiction seasoned with characters called White Death, The Hornet, and The Wolf. It's crazy fun.The most pervasive motif is fate, which ironically doesn't make Ladybug lucky but provides facile answers to questions about the randomness of violence aboard the train. An assassin refers to Thomas the Tank Engine in an attempt to understand character, to the exclusion of Diesel from any survival technique.It's overdone action and philosophy but set in high-end visuals like Dolby and IMAX theaters. Impressive sight and sound together with a $3 all-beef hot dog and temperature-controlled comfort while you watch an out-of-control adventure. It's our own little mayhem thumbing noses at COVID and inflation-for just over 2 hours only.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

It has a bit of influence from anime, a bit from Tarantinto and a splash of Deadpool. It is from David Leitch, director of ""Deadpool 2"", and ""Bullet Train"" has a violent, dark and fast paced humor similar to that of Deadpool. How funny the movie is will vary from person to person, humor is a subjective thing. But objectively, the movie has a lot of jokes and if one doesn't work, they don't linger on it too long.The way in which the film tells the story is very clever. The movie will shift to different vantage points, points of view, flashbacks and train carts. Doing this helps create suspense, dramatic irony and feed the audience needful exposition in clear and quick ways. It is a very tightly written story, there is no wasted space.On top of the humor and clever storytelling, the movie has some great action set pieces. Despite taking place on a train, the action scenes are all shot with clarity and style. No two fights feel the same. Our hero is not invincible, he is frequently on the back foot, and this leads to some compelling action sequences.As far as the negatives, towards the story really goes off the rails towards the end and loses the grounded gritty action that it once had. There are some plot convivences that are hard to ignore, and some character gimmicks that don't work.Despite the story losing some steam towards the end, the movie is a clever, tightly written, funny action film. Don't let this train pass you by, this is one bullet you want to catch.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The graphic action is outstanding, this Netflix film is obviously not for children with it's R rating. The acting is good with Pitt leading the way & the dialogue/writing is acceptable. Mixed throughout the film are a couple vintage American pop songs sung in Japanese that add humor to the film.

Finish it off ChatGpt:""Bullet Train"" is a fast-paced and action-packed thriller movie directed by David Leitch and starring Brad Pitt, Joey King, Zazie Beetz, and a talented ensemble cast. Based on the Japanese novel ""Maria Beetle"" by Kotaro Isaka, the movie follows the story of five assassins who board a high-speed bullet train bound for Tokyo, each with their own target, only to find themselves in a deadly race against time and each other.From the opening scenes, ""Bullet Train"" sets a thrilling tone that never lets up. The action sequences are spectacular, filled with intricate choreography, stunning special effects, and explosive set-pieces that will leave you on the edge of your seat. David Leitch, who has a background in stunt work and co-directed the original ""John Wick,"" brings his signature style of kinetic and relentless action to this film, making it a visceral and adrenaline-fueled ride.The cast is phenomenal, with Brad Pitt delivering an intense and charismatic performance as the seasoned assassin ""Ladybug."" Joey King shines as ""Prince,"" a young and ambitious killer who seeks to prove herself. Zazie Beetz is impressive as ""Marmalade,"" a sharp-witted and skilled assassin with a mysterious agenda. The supporting cast, including Andrew Koji, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Hiroyuki Sanada, also deliver excellent performances, bringing depth and complexity to their respective characters.The movie's screenplay, written by Zak Olkewicz, is engaging and clever, filled with sharp dialogue and unexpected twists and turns. However, the plot can be confusing at times, and some of the characters' motivations are not always clear. The movie also suffers from some pacing issues in the second act, with some scenes feeling dragged out and repetitive.Overall, ""Bullet Train"" is a thrilling and entertaining movie that delivers on its promise of high-octane action and suspense. It's a must-watch for fans of David Leitch's work, as well as anyone who loves a good action movie. However, if you're looking for a deep and thought-provoking story, you might be disappointed. Nonetheless, with its stylish visuals, stellar cast, and heart-pumping action, ""Bullet Train"" is a ride that's definitely worth taking.""Zzzzzz - AI.","9 out of 13 found this helpful.

This your typical silly action film, with a nicely thought out script and some very likeable characters! The jokes are there too, they are plenty, they work well and don't overtake the action, thankfully. I was very happy to see that non-critical characters did not stay long, they just did the necessary part and they were killed off. So the movie was not overloaded with unnecessary side plots, which seems to be something many productions suffer from lately.I enjoyed all the performances, I can't say anyone didn't fit their role.So if you take this movie for what it is and you want to watch a fast paced, well thought out, light and funny summer action film then go watch this!Again, I would want to rate this a 7.5 but I can't.

Bullet Train is filled with exciting gags, grotesquely unique action sequences, and a charismatic lead performance from the sensationally charming Brad Pitt. While I didn't think the jokes were all that hysterical, I could still appreciate the character writing and how well acted everything was. Aaron Taylor Johnson and Bryan Tyree Henry were two of the biggest highlights in this star studded ensemble, their chemistry and brotherly bond gave the film a little heart and made the trip worthwhile. I had a bit of trouble adjusting to Joey King's character near the beginning, her presence was very insufferable to the point where I patiently waited for the character get die a horrible death. But once her motive became clear, I began to understand her purpose in the story and how it makes her character even more engaging. There's a ton of philosophical themes that I never expected such as the idea of fate being unescapable and how bad luck is essentially a common threat that every character experiences. The film does a great job reinforcing these themes in the finale and doesn't become too pretentious to the point where it completely tarnishes the action blockbuster tone the film sets up. This was the perfect movie to end the summer on; it was a witty stylish action comedy while at the same time it was a thoughtful character study.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

All visual elements Tarantino uses have been done before. Tarantinos works are all post modern work. So if a movie uses visuals mainstreamers just know from Tarantino it is their fault to not know anything about art and movies. Nevertheless this movie is more than a simple action flick with guy ritchy storytelling and Tarantino visuals. Because where Guy Ritchy uses his style to fill holes of substance, this movie is about taking control over destiny. Or the question if it is even possible and we as humans are caged in a train of predestination or determination? I for myself see it as ladybug. Things that happen happen. We just have to smile at it and grab a tangerine after our ride home got crashed. Yes, the visual style seem to have no purpose and I facepalmed at the japanese version of Hero but its not like that it makes the movie terrible.

"7","/10","Fun action with dozens of telegraphed moments.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8701211/?ref_=tt_urv","Benjamin-M-Weilert","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur100116496/?ref_=tt_urv","29 November 2022","There's something inherently exciting about being trapped on a train with a murderer. It's why Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express has done so well for almost 100 years. In this more modern take, Bullet Train (2022) fills this titular high-speed form of transportation with a half-dozen unique killers with ties to a mob boss known as ""The White Death."" Ridiculous at times, Bullet Train is fun and full of action while also being the repeated poster child for the literary concept of Chekhov's Gun.With Brad Pitt in the leading role as the ""unlucky"" assassin with the codename ""Ladybug,"" a lot of the comedy comes from the coincidental alignment of particular circumstances that pull Ladybug further into the conflict. There are almost Mr. Bean levels of close calls for Pitt's character as he finds himself tangled up in the parallel plans of his fellow assassins. Of course, the number of mistaken identity tropes in this film almost qualifies it to be Hitchcockian in nature. Because what good story on a train doesn't have at least a little mystery involved?Where Bullet Train excels is in the way it shows the audience things that become important later in the story. Sure, there are a lot of little things that might not seem important, but it wasted none of these moments. This may also be with the way this movie was filmed, with the hand-to-hand combat being John Wick (2014)-like and the big action set pieces focusing on those Chekhov's Guns just before it used them for their ultimate purpose. Granted, with so many unique characters, it was a little difficult to keep everything straight at times. But when things lined up, the result was often satisfying.Fun action with dozens of telegraphed moments, I give Bullet Train 3.5 stars out of 5.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The two don't mesh all that well for me a lot of the time though there is humor here. The constant banter between Aaron Taylor-Johnson & Brian Tyree Green is fairly enjoyable once one gets the hang of it. It's kind of like a bad joke that gets funnier the more often it's told. Joey King pulls of her odd role quite well, but the film belongs to Brad Pitt. Almost all the times I laughed were due to him. The plot? I don't know. It all takes place on a bullet train in China (oh, how far behind the US is in transit!) and it's mostly about the quest for a briefcase full of money along with something else, but it's also about other coincidental crimes going on at the same time and it's much too convoluted a plot to be all that enjoyable, but it will certainly hold your attention with so much going on. A lot of effort was put into this, but not all of it pays off.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

SOOOOO much missed potential because of overbearing editing that rewinds to remind the viewer every single time anything happens that was caused by something previous and writing that, when it's not being careless and fun, is either ultra proud of itself for anything and everything, annoying, or so incoherently stupid that turning your brain off can't prevent you from noticing. The music choices can get overbearing, the cameos were mostly obnoxious, and the entire first third was loaded to brim with momentum killing flashbacks that plagued the rest of the film, but many of the action scenes, especially in the first two thirds, were fun. The director clearly knows how to direct some fun action. The first half of the film went decently far with the style it was going for and it worked, even if it was bit too stereotypical and laced with tropes at points. The writing also wasn't all bad. Many of the characters were fun. Brad Pitt and the twins were incredibly fun and backed by very charismatic performances, with the twins probably being the closest to fully realized. At its best, it's an incredibly stylish film with uniquely entertaining characters that clash in genuinely funny, entertaining, and even tense ways. The stuff with the guy and girl wasn't necessarily bad either, but that plot through line along with the others would be lost in the shuffle of bad or absent development as the writers tried to shove in even more characters to make the plot work. The main storylines were never amazing, but they start off way better than they finish and how they interacted would become more hit or miss as the film went on, eventually becoming too much without the punch to back it up. One character genuinely felt like a throw in because the writers noticed a plot hole and needed to fix it. The ending was just bad and represented everything wrong with the film, from the editing that assumes the least of the viewer, a plot that desperately wants to be meaningful, and action that finally got too gratuitous even for me. I came in with ""I just want to have fun"" expectations and still left sort of disappointed. I really do want to say it's a fun/10, which it is at its best and why I can't necessarily say don't watch it, but there is so much undercooked, obnoxious, and flat bad parts that aren't made up for. It passes with a 6 and it isn't a movie that will be better on the second watch because they REMIND YOU OF EVERY SINGLE POTENTIALLY SUBTLE PLOT DETAIL WHENEVER THEY BECOME A TINY BIT RELEVANT LATER ON! Watch Nice Guys instead. If you've already watched that idk this could be fine for you.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Great action scenes, a complex plot that is heavy on killing, a light tone and some good punchlines make for an interesting and blood-filled yet amusing journey.On the negative side, the plot is overly complex, complex for the sake of complexity.

You know what it felt like for me... it felt like the time I went to ride The Joker at Six Flags when it was released-it gave the thrills and fun, but still ended up being underwhelming, and not something I'd wait in line for again like I would Super Man or Mr. Freeze.OOOO or like a film that could be playing on mute while in a barbershop or at gentlemen spa while getting a mani and pedi (LOL).OTHER THOUGHTS:
Highlights: Brian Tyree Henry, Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, overall engagement, Bad Bunny, and scenes involving Brad Pitt.Could've Been Better: Thematic followthrough, and character development with the father and son.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

You know what i am saying, these ""Tarantino-Esque"" movies like Guy Ritchie's movies, SMOKING ACES, LAYER CAKE, KISS KISS BANG BANG etc? Not many good movies of this genre recently. RIDERS OF JUSTICE (2020) is the only good comedy-crime movie i can remember right now.BULLET TRAIN reminds us how fun this genre is.This is not just a fun ride, but an insane ride, pure entertainment until the end. These good actors seem to enjoy this, i only wish Andrew Koji (Tv series WARRIOR) had a bigger part/role. Action is over the top. Yes, comedic element was not always spot on, some times they forced it. Yes, this is a movie that you will forget it the next day, it is not as good as the aforementioned Tarantino-esque movies. However, it is very enjoyable and the ending was satisfying. 127 minutes and never a boring moment, this could easily be a tv mini-series. If you want to have fun, watch it. Just remember, it's more unplausible than a movie with, i don't know, space zombies.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"6","/10","""Nothing Says Goodbye Like a Bullet Train.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8420480/?ref_=tt_urv","mattstone137","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur40057749/?ref_=tt_urv","9 August 2022","David Leitch has made a rousing return to theaters with his newest film, Bullet Train. Leitch, who is steadily mastering the art of sleek, kinetic action, leads a talented and capable ensemble through a John-Wick-meets-derivative-Tarantino rollercoaster. Although the script is uneven, Leitch's eye for action and dynamic editing reaches a new peak in Bullet Train. He's learned from his time directing other actioners such as Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, and Hobbs and Shaw, reinvigorating his style and trimming most of the story's fat.The film follows Ladybug, an assassin sent to pick up a briefcase on a Japanese bullet train. This simple task soon becomes more complicated, however, as a myriad of other assassins become intwined with Ladybug, fighting him and each other amid a serious of confusions and misunderstandings. The conflict is compounded by Ladybug's sincere attempts to quit the business and turn to a life of peace and tranquility among the Japanese landscape.For all its flaws and faults, Bullet Train is a lot of fun. It's never as clever as it thinks it is, but it is kinetic, dynamic, and snappily paced, on both a micro and macro scale. It's also a precarious blend of half-meaningful stakes and over the top comedic sensibilities, each vying to be the film's defining tone without throwing the entire affair off balance. It's firmly watchable and should be refreshing for action fans who crave a more cinematic, distinct outing than the typical MCU slog. Unlike most of Leitch's work, where characters run the gamut from rigid to stoic, Bullet Train's appeal lies on its ensemble cast's charisma.Performances are often near the back of my mind during a screening, but Bullet train is thoroughly focused on, and sometimes carried by, its cast, which is top tier across the board. The film often revolves around three main principles: Ladybug, Tangerine, and Lemon, played by Brad Pitt, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Brian Tyree Henry, respectively.Pitt is the standout of this talented cast, expertly balancing the sporadic inner conflict and new-age, hippy-dippy mindset of his character with the frenetic action of the film. He's a stabilizing force in the madness and knows exactly what the role is and how to play it.Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry, who play ""twin"" hitmen, work off each other immaculately, maintaining an impatient, unpredictable presence. Henry's conception is clever; he's an imposing figure with an innocent, childlike naivete. He's single-minded, dissecting others on the bullet train with comic accuracy and precision. Taylor-Johnson, yin to Henry's yang, is an acidic hooligan ripped from a Guy Ritchie film (most of Bullet Train is ripped from Guy Ritchie films, but Taylor-Johnson drives the point home) and played with a suave, boiling verve.The rest of the cast, which includes Joey King, Andrew Koji, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Logan Lerman, is also superb. Everyone is fashioned to physically resemble their persona, and every actor knows who they are, what film they're in, and how they should be perceived. While there are moments of posturing and a few miscalculations from time to time, the desired effect is usually achieved - nailing down a tone which is at once whacky and brutal.Bullet Train could've easily been disparate and hopelessly unfocused, but Leitch's steady hand congeals the film. While he should've given the script another once-over, his vision and direction of the chaotic world flavors the action and emphasizes the fun. Alongside the cast's understanding, Leitch's camerawork and trademark, neon-soaked cinematography - shot by Jonathan Sela - make the film work until it simply doesn't.Every motion feels purposeful and gratifying; most every cut, both within and between scenes, is chosen to tell a more concise, streamlined story, which could've been overblown and overwrought in the wrong hands. There will come a day when Leitch's films lose their novelty and passion, especially as his spectacle balloons and his plots become increasingly convoluted, but Bullet Train represents an impressive addition to his grittily sleek, blood-soaked, morally apathetic oeuvre.In contrast to the film's spectacular craftsmanship, the script is rushed, contrived, and sometimes nonsensical. Despite the stellar editing, the first act is bogged down by a mountain of exposition, which is both vomited out and agonizingly long-winded. Characters are either unprofessionally dense (despite their repeated proclamations as professionals) or essentially omnipotent, knocking down their objectives or enemies with boring ease.Also distracting from the fun are three nagging questions, floating in the back of the mind throughout. Why are there so few passengers or employees aboard this train? Why does every ensemble film need Suicide Squad-style graphics spelling out character introductions? Why does Leitch opt for digital, poorly rendered blood squibs in a film that revolves around constant, visceral action?Though the above problems cheapen the film, they can be overlooked in favor of the greater visual and structural unity of the film. But all of Bullet Train goes sour in the last act. The prior commitment to skill, patience, and restrained action is wholly aborted, leaving both the characters and audience adrift in a nightmare world of impossible stunts and tensionless revelations. Even a clever, final moment of wild casting can't save Bullet Train's final act from feeling like anything other than a sudden, sharp betrayal; it's an absolute nosedive.Bullet Train is not perfect; it's surprisingly talky, though infrequently funny or incisive, routinely contrived when it should be simple, and breaks its neck on the final dismount. However, there are several elements to admire, including strong chemistry among a cast of unique characters, an exotic location for what's sorta'-kinda' a chamber piece, and some handsomely assembled cinematic action. It's a worthy addition to Leitch's filmography, finely tuned to the upper tier of this era of cinematic action and stands in stark contrast to the assembly line sludge theaters are currently overrun with. It's a nice harkening back to dense, rubbery assassin-driven action which deserves to be seen on the silver screen.6/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

While some of the sequences are bemoaning in how over-the-top and unrealistic they were. They still worked in the world of the film. I also laughed, or chuckled, through a good portion of the film, even in parts I probably shouldn't have found funny. However, I found some lightheartedness through the carnage.The acting wasn't half bad. I enjoyed Brad Pitt in this one, and I found his character to be relatable, so that was a bonus. The twins were hilarious and brought good chemistry. I found the mini bosses and the big boss to give about a good performance, nothing crazy. However, I was not a fan of Joey King's. While her acting was ok. Her attempt at a British accent was awful. Sometimes she spoke with it and other times she seemed to lose it. I still don't know if her character was British or not.Lastly, the cinematography and score were very enjoyable. As we know films use certain colours, tones, and sequences to capture places on film, and I felt like they captured the Japanese essence very well with the vibrant colours, and poppy music. I enjoyed how lunches were matched with a beat, amongst other similar actions.Overall, I was very pleased with this film. It entertained with a good story, decent acting, and cool cinematography & score. I will say there was a lot more carnage than I anticipated, but that didn't keep me from enjoying it. It's definitely worth seeing in theatres, especially IMAX.Thank you for reading my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

And since there are so many characters, a lot of them get dialogue dumps while others get visual storytelling, which is a nice change of pace and fits the vibe of this movie but is rare.

What I mean is, those who have a keen sense for detail will appreciate this film more than those who need a broad picture to take shape with minimum effort. This film has a great story set-up that reveals itself in sections while the interim is peppered with witty action scenes and clever dialog that helps frame the story. Much of the humor lies in the detailed facial expressions, captured with skilled precision.Some of the low-star reviews missed blaring details, such as why the train was virtually empty. They complain that the action scenes were unrealistic having entirely missed the humor of the good v bad luck theme. The film mocks the popular mental health portfolio we see so much in today's younger crowd with great success. In fact, there are so many clever personality odes that the characters are built on them rather than taking us on verbose intros.Bullet Train may remind some of the older crowd of a combination of clever assassin films over many decades yet it doesnt feel cliche. I don't know that I would watch it more than once but out was definitely worth the first go.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

A very interesting place for the film, the Bullet Train. A good cast try to carry this film and they managed to draw you in from the start. However the story was disorganised and it was hard to piece together what was going on. The characters rushed through their explanations of what their plans were. I only got the picture at the end when White Death showed up which wasn't a big wow moment either. I feel if Quentin Tarantino was at the helm he would nicely put this film together in a way that made sense, was humorous and took us on a journey. He always tends to have a good method to the madness. Unlike Leitch who has let this film be like a train with no driver. Despite Brad Pitt's strong performance the film did not quite meet expectations for me.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

And opening the movie with it in Japanese? Couldn't take my eyes off for the rest of the movie. Bullet Train is the first Brad Pitt movie I've seen, and it's by far my favorite. Genuine laugh out loud moments throughout the movie, and when the camera wasn't on Ladybug, Lemon and Tangerine made sure there was never a dull moment. Ladybug dodged metaphorical bullets from start to end but got hit by metaphorical cannonballs. Great camera angles. Epic soundtrack. Entertaining backstories and flashbacks. I love Bullet Train so much, I watched it on loop for an entire weekend from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed. I prefer making my reviews without spoilers for people who haven't seen it, but I could make paragraph after paragraph of positive feedback if I broke Bullet Train down scene by scene. If you like high-octane, funny, and popcorn-entertainment, this is surely to become one of your favorites.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

In this case the location is a high-speed train from Tokyo to Kyoto. The execution here is better than Smokin' Aces in every way: the plot makes sense, the dangerous people are interesting, and the humor mostly lands. This is a violent movie but the action and dialogue are sufficiently cartoonish and fast-paced that it comes off as affable and fun rather than grim and nihilistic. The style is reminiscent of Snatch, especially cutaway flashbacks to fill in backstories, and there are a few times this movie seems to be trying too hard to mimic Guy Ritchie's style. The only other major drawback is that it overstays its welcome by about 20 minutes and the novelty has worn off a bit by the finale. Overall very enjoyable but not especially original.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It has an above-average story for its genre, effective plot twists, and somewhat less effective attempts at humor. It is a fact that it is full of clich√©s, borrowings, and hit & miss attempts at humor, but those clich√©s are perfectly integrated, I experienced the borrowings more as homages than as a lack of originality, and the humor, although you will not roll over with laughter, is still at a quite decent level. The screenplay is certainly not an Oscar material, but hey, this is an action movie, not a literary classic.On the other hand, the qualities it brings almost completely compensate for the shortcomings. The pace does not let you catch your breath, it is visually beautiful and, although practically all of it takes place on the train, there are flashbacks that prevent monotony at the right moments. In several aspects, the homage to the cult ""Pulp Fiction"" is obvious, to some extent in stylistic moments, but mostly in the black-and-white duo of hired killers, who both physically and in character strongly resemble the Travolta-Jackson tandem. In addition to this most obvious one, movie lovers will be delighted by a handful of less conspicuous homages and cameo appearances.But the main asset of the film is the excellent cast, by which I mean literally all the actors, because everyone, from Brad Pitt to the smallest supporting role, treated us with impressive performances, far beyond the level I expected. Many single out the young Joey King, but in my opinion, Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass) and Brian Tyree Henry are the backbone of this entire spectacle.7,5/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The plot involves a number of assassins aboard Japan's bullet train who turn out to have a link.

Brad Pitt may be the official star, but each character turns out to be important. It's not any sort of masterpiece, but I recommend seeing it.

Each character is larger than life and outrageous, but all fit perfectly in this vivid and comical world. Bullet Train feels like Edgar Wright's version of John Wick - all the action is there, but so are all the comedy and quirky characters. Brad Pitt's prowess as an actor shines as his ridiculous peace-loving assassin blunders through the film but never crosses the line into cliche or too much. Brian Tyree Henry's Lemon is the most entertaining out of a cast of enthusiastic over-the-top characters that will have you laughing from the first second til the credits roll. Funny cameos and great action punctuate this already fun and colorful film. Bullet Train is a fun watch, but some poor visual effects distract from the ending and keep the rating from being higher. Even with its few faults, Bullet Train is a goofy, dynamic, and bright action flick that invents a fun world I wouldn't mind exploring in future films.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

In fact, it gets to the point where you expect the surprises to happen, so they don't really feel like surprises anymore. I thought the cast all did a good job with what they were given. Brad Pitt's detachment to what was going on around him kept me amused, and I really enjoyed Brian Tyree Henry's character, as well. It gets pretty ridiculous at times, but Bullet Train is quite the ride if you're in the right mood.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

If you don't, you should probably give this one a pass.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The story develops into a mystery, that like any good mystery comes together at the end.Really interesting characters...Ladybug, who won't use guns, thinks he's unlucky and is seeing a therapist to help him work through some issues. The Prince-a girl who lacks empathy and uses her innocent look to sucker victims. The Twins, lemon and tangerine, who clearly aren't twins, spend a lot of time bickering and are obsessed with Tommy the train and numbers. The Hornet, who uses a deadly snake venom to kill her victims. The Elder, who used to be a high ranking member of the Japanese syndicate but was ousted by The White Death, a Russian who came in and took over. The Wolf, whose entire family is killed and is seeking revenge.There were a couple scenes that I absolutely loved. I really enjoyed the telling of The Wolf's story and the use of the rotating bed to signify the passage of time. (I also love Bad Bunny...so that was fun.) I really enjoyed the perspective of the water bottle...it was a clever storytelling technique.Great campy use of color, lots of close up action...a snake in a train, and quick clever dialogue. This was snappy, fun to watch and for me unexpectedly funny. I would highly recommend this to action movie fans and fans of comedy. If, like me, your family loves Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels...than this should be a must see.On one side note there are some completely unbelievably events in this film...a ridiculous train crash, people walking on top of a bullet train, etc. So, don't forget to just go with it in order to enjoy this film.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Still, it is an enjoyable action-film filled with many elements I normally like! Such as a group of assassins butting heads, and being set in one closed location (like a hotel or a train). The best I can compare it to.. is Kill Bill (a lot actually), mixed in with the tone of the recent ""Lost City"" film. It is by no means a serious movie. And while it did not think it was great, most of it wasn't bad either.As you may know, the cast is quite famous, but their presence on screen is rather lacking (Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry, mostly) and the characters feel underwritten. Bringing the movie down. Ah, but whenever Brad Pit is on screen, it feels like a completely different movie! I also quite enjoyed Joey King's role. Oh, and ironically, for a movie set in one of the world's fastest pieces of transport.. it feels slow a lot of the time. With some unimportant dialogue that could be trimmed or compressed for a better viewing. It all feels rather unpolished.But good choreographies, beautiful locations, some great moments.. it's worth a watch.Maybe just not on theaters.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Easy enough task, you might think - especially as he obtains it relatively easily. It then transpires, though, that there is much more afoot. Also on the train are the two guys who own the suitcase - ""Lemon"" (Brian Tyree Henry) and his twin ""Tangerine"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who have been tasked with rescuing the recently kidnapped son of the legendary ""White Death"" crime lord and his ransom (in the suitcase). When the pair discover that their loot has gone missing and that their charge has developed a rather nasty habit of bleeding from the eyes, they have to keep their suspicious employer at bay and find their luggage whilst this high-speed train hurtles from Tokyo to Kyoto. Add to the mix the slightly enigmatic ""Prince"" (Joey King) - outwardly a charming, butter-wouldn't-melt, schoolgirl type, but really a gal who is also up to something with the rather hapless ""Kimura"" (Andrew Kohi) whose son she had recently pushed from a roof and, well... Yes, the plot is pretty convoluted at the start but with a monologue style narrative well delivered by an on-form Pitt, and an engaging repartee between the 'Thomas the Tank Engine"" obsessed ""Lemon"" and his spiritual brother, this actually makes for quite a decent action adventure. It is way too long - it could comfortably shave twenty minutes from the character establishment phase, but the script is quickly paced and sometimes quite clever and there are plenty of action scenes that are fun to watch and don't take too long. It has shades of ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) I thought - multiple characters with entertaining storylines that gradually involve and synergise all the characters. The ending isn't the best, and perhaps one might wonder about the complete lack of security not just on the train but at just about every station between the two cities. Carnage ensues pretty readily but no sign of a blue light. It's fun, throwaway, entertainment that follows on from ""The Lost City"" in which Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum allow Pitt the supporting role that he allows to both of them - and a tiny but of Ryan Reynolds too, if you are eagle-eyed, here. It's factory fodder, and you won't remember it by Christmas - but it's still nice to see some folks having fun on a big screen with no pretence whatsoever.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

But I have to admit, ultimately I was entertained. The comedic acting was a bit over the top, but tolerable. The CGI was, frankly, poor and unnecessary, for the most part, though I don't know that action audiences really care about realism. (To be honest, it might have been a better picture with a lot less of the action). There are sufficient action movie tropes, as well as a few bits of social commentary which will probably be viewed as woke by cynical action aficionados, (the subtext of Lemon and Tangerine is decidedly not a brotherly love). But it takes all kinds to make a film. Finally, the attempt to tie everything together as fate seemed a bit forced, unless it was meant facetiously, then it was perfectly on point. No need to overthink it, just enjoy the dumb fun. And as an added point, as a resident of Tokyo for nearly two decades, the film bears little resemblance. And I was unaware that Fuji-san was moved between Nagoya and Kyoto. I can still see it outside my back window.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, I felt like the last 30 or so minutes of the movie was predictable which caused me to lose interest. Also it felt a bit anti climatic when the white death showed up as he didn't seem that imposing and have more of an interesting impact as I expected. I liked the different types of characters which made the movie more entertaining. The action scenes were good, but it's funny how unrealistic it was towards the end where the train is damaged and somehow some of the characters survive.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The jokes were funny, original and absurd. Brad Pitt was a fantastic pick as the main character. The pacing was great because I was laughing all the time. This movie is packed full of jokes and its not getting boring because its so well executed. The other killers are really well written as well, funny background stories etc. The action was nice and the fights were creative. Also the introductions tof all the other killers were great. CGI was not too bad, but you can sometimes really see that its CGI. If you get the chance, watch it, good acting, good action, funny jokes, creative location and characters, of course very brutal. 10/10

Train is the Best Picture this year by far, though it clearly won't take home an Oscar. Watching Bullet Train is like feasting on a 260-layer cake (Guiness world record - looked it up). Pulp Fiction by comparison is a 7-layer cake, whose comedy seldom lands (watch it again and you'll probably agree). The Jackie Chan flavoring of the fight scenes was delicious and incredibly well-executed by Pitt. I was howling throughout, while my wife was appalled by the violence. By the time the movie ended my stomach was aching - 260-layer cakes will do that.Among the layers; Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock cameos in a tit for tat for Brad's appearance in Lost City. Jackie Chan-esque fight scenes with brief cases and laptops as weapons and shields. Gun play without the guns being fired during fight scenes. The pause button hit during quite room and snack car fight scenes. The bottle of designer water as a rolling gag and its hero-anti-hero role. The perfect chemistry between the twins, Lemon and Tangerine that includes a tremendous running gag with their names and a truck load of tangerines. Bad Bunny, the WWE wrestler (I'm a big fan) as a Mexican assassin and his boot fetish. Stayin' Alive as the theme song, the movie's central theme and Bad Bunny's (aka John Travolta's) boot fetish. Brief case battles with the inflatable Anime doll. The scenes are so deep in movie Easter Eggs you feel like David Leitch just made an omelet out of your brain. That or you've been run over by a Bullet Train. Go see it! A+","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

While Ladybug manages to grab the briefcase with relative ease, Ladybug's attempts to disembark the train are thwarted every time as he keeps encountering assassins and criminals who have grudges against Ladybug. Meanwhile another assassin, known as The Prince (Joey King), enacts her own plans involving a blackmailed underling of The White Death with The Father (Andrew Koji).Bullet Train is an adaptation of the 2010 Japanses novel Maria Beetle written by Kotaro Isaka. Initially Antoine Fuqua had intended to direct the film as a serious action thriller, but eventually the film went for a more comedic slant during the development process (rather fitting as Maria Beetle was written as more of a dark comedy). The film was one of the larger projects worked on during the COVD 19 Pandemic as it was greenlit by Sony in 2020 who were most likely sold on the A-list cast combined with a limited location that would make filming easier. The movie comes to us from David Leitch whose prior credits include co-directing John Wick, directing Atomic Blonde, Hobbs & Shaw, and of course Deadpool 2. With such an established pedigree, Bullet Train seems like it's poised for high octane fun, and it does deliver on that front, but it's also the kind of film that feels like it could've been improved with some trimming and going smaller on some things.Despite Brad Pitt being front and center on the marketing, the movie's really more of an ensemble piece and plays like Guy Ritchie by way of Under Siege 2 (I'm kind of struggling for comparison). The movie is very much a character piece with a comedy of errors execution as Brad Pitt's Ladybug isn't a hard knuckle action protagonist and for the most part when he kills people in this move it's usually by accident as he tries to repeat his self-actualization mantras and overcome his bad luck much to the annoyance of his handler and the various assassins he encounters. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry are very fun playing assassin ""Twin brothers"" with the latter having a funny running joke about how Thomas the Tank Engine taught him everything he needs to know about people and how he's never wrong when it comes to reading them. We also have Joey King playing The Prince who's been gender-swapped from the character in the book, but they do find a way of making it work in context. King is despicably good as The Prince as she's a very manipulative character who's pretty much the polar opposite of Ladybug as she plans 5 steps ahead of her target, is extraordinarily lucky, and completely lacks remorse, empathy, or mercy making her a truly hateful antagonist.While the movie has a good setup, it feels massively overstuffed, from what I understand Bullet Train is fairly faithful to the source novel (which I've admittedly not read) but it is the kind of thing that feels like stuff that was originally happening over several pages of exposition has been compressed into a cutaway montage as is the case with The Wolf played by Benito A. Mart√≠nez Ocasio aka Bad Bunny who's one of many flashbacks the movie does with The Wolf's backstory going on for awhile and it almost feels like you're watching cliff notes from one of Robert Rodriguez's action films. The movie feels massively overstuffed with how many things are going on with this train as the focal point and while I get that's meant to be the central joke I think the movie does wear thin with a just over two hour run time and the relentless quick cut Guy Ritchie-esque execution that I felt less exhilarated and more exhausted by it. For me Nobody which was also made by the producers of this film and the John Wick films was the better version of this story especially as they're both pretty similar with them both being mixes of John Wick style action and dark comedy but Nobody was better paced and more focused, so I'll probably watch that again before I rewatch Bullet Train.If you are a fan of the David Leitch and 87North produced action films you'll probably find something to appreciate here, but it has a lot of issues I noticed with the last 87North film I saw, Day Shift, in that they're both too long and too overstuffed. Bullet Train does have some good action scenes and humorous moments, but it also feels like it needed to be pared down to something less unwieldly.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I don't like much this type of films (marvel style) where there are guys jumping from trains and all of that but I think this one just hits different. The argument for the most key parts of the film was not that predictable and I enjoyed the overall story.I recommend this movie for you to check out. The cinema experience is always the best, of course, and I'd recommend it as well for those like me that don't like this cgi types of films.Also, just a quick comment, I imagined this movie to be 150+ million USD (budget) but it turns out to be less than 90 million. I was kind of impressed by it, just a little.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

As one of the producers said, the action was not just for action sake.It is almost like a Warner Brothers cartoon, where the carnage you speed through to pick for humor in the wreckage. Meep meep? The film drew a cavalcade of celebs, a handful uncredited.Brad Pitt in the Bugs Bunny role found the right tone for the film. He helps deliver a proper man-handling of self-help psychiatry, but the twin hearts of the film are Tangerine and Lemon. Their promo commercials caught my interest in a Guy Ritchie sort of way, their petty bickering bubbling up in blood bath scenarios followed through on that commercial promise.There is a mild meditation on luck/fate, but I wouldn't think too much about themes per se. It served its Friday night, turn-off-the-brain purpose for me, I hope it does for you as well.If not, the exits are clearly marked, but if you enjoy a simple and brisk ride, you may have as much trouble leaving the Bullet Train as Pitt did.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was enjoyable to watch and had lighthearted humor in it as well. It was a bit white washed with Americans playing Japanese roles but that's the Hollywood norm nowadays. Brad Pitt was his usual action star self. I think the standout performance was Joey King. She played the part of the malevolent and manipulative young girl very well. Her British accent was great considering she's an American. I actually thought this was a remake of an anime movie but it's actually based on a book.The cinematography was particularly good.

Some of the ad-libs in this were rather painful to watch (or at least they seemed like ad libs). Some have understandably compared this to a Guy Ritchie film, but I find his films much more clever.

Ladybug played by Brad Pitt was a charming character that you liked following while being funny and being great in action scenes.The action scenes were fun to watch. The action scenes looked cool and the ways they show them can be violent or funny in how it plays out, even in the 3rd act climax which was also both fun and funny.There were lots of funny moments mostly because the main character is likable, and the train looked good with effects and was believable. The different assassins on the train were interesting and one of them had a good backstory to explain why he does what he does.The movie had a funny ending that left me satisfied with what I saw.

They all complained about the gory violence being the reasoning behind their poor review, which is clearly in the description of why its rated R. If gore or ANYthing bothers you enough to make a review about it I suggest you not be lazy and check prior to seeing any film....
Now that I got that out the way. Took my wife to see this film Friday and from the beginning I knew we would like it. Starts off in a older samurai back story setting then you get to Brad shortly after who still looks good and gives you that classic Pitt feel. He's so comedic with out trying lol. Im not going to give a full broken down review of the entire film but will say it has everything in it from laughing, crying, action, gore and I want to say there might have been a quick scene of nudity but extremely brief. If you're a fan of Atlanta, Brian Henry does a great job in this as well. I highly recommend.

This is not to discount the overall viewing experience, which I have to admit was pretty fun and engaging, but walking out of the theatre felt like you watched something that you're not going to remember after a good night's sleep.Bullet Train is extremely stylistic and it has a plot that is interesting enough to give that style some substance. But that substance always seems to be the surface and never grips you in with anything to emotionally invest in. The writing at some points feel poor, almost as if you're watching an AI try to piece together an interesting conversation based on every high octane action crime film from 10 years ago. The whole ""Thomas the Steam Engine"" gig was cringe from the beginning, and so was the entire character of Joey King's ""Prince""; which I found to be utterly irritating and an eye-sore to look at.Don't get me wrong. It's not in any way a bad movie. I'd even say it's decently above average. And it was fairly interesting and to some extent engaging. It also does its best to present the movie in a somewhat different style from what we're all used to. But they all just don't seem to leave a lasting impression. It's not a waste of time if you decide to go watch it, but you wouldn't be missing out on anything if you didn't either.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If he manages to successfully end this mission, he wants to take it easy with his criminal life and tries to make a start with this during this mission.The suitcase he tries to steal is in the hands of twins Tangerine (Aaron Taylor Johnson) and Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry). The twins are sitting together in the fastest train in the world in Japan to deliver the suitcase, which is why Ladybug also board this train. On entering the train, Ladybug learns that the train is filled with wrong people from the criminal world who have problems with each other. Ladybug now has to get hold of the suitcase as quickly as possible and then leave the train as quickly as possible without getting the wrong people after her.Director David Leitch already had a history before this film with Brad Pitt as his stunt double in other action films. They worked well together on this film. Despite the fact that the film is promoted as a Brad Pitt film, he still shares a lot of time with the other cast members of the film, who sometimes even manage to overshadow him.David Leitch knows how to use the environment in which the film takes place in beautiful and creative ways. Despite the fact that the space of a train compartment seems small, it still manages to provide exciting and entertaining action scenes here. He has enough surprising train compartments to use in his film. Furthermore, he seems to be somewhat inspired by films by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino and seems to take over elements of their films in a respectful, yet somewhat copied way.The film is further based on the Japanese novel ""Maria Beetle"" and the final screenplay is written by Zak Olkewicz. Unfortunately, this screenplay is only the first screenplay, which he wrote himself without the collaboration of other writers. Despite the fact that he has managed to provide an entertaining film, it can be seen from the film that this is only his first written screenplay, because the film has its messy sides. The story often jumps from the main chronological story to flashbacks or imaginative previews of the various characters in the film. This sometimes makes it difficult to follow the entire movie exactly and to remember all the details.Thanks to the many trailers of the movie that give away too much about the movie itself and the comedy moments, many things can come across as predictable. For a better experience of this movie, you should try to avoid the trailers. Then you're more likely to laugh at the movie's comedy. Yet many comedy moments are a bit on the predictable side, especially if you are familiar with an average action comedy. Zak Olkewicz sometimes seems to come across with his writing as if he thinks he is funnier than he actually is.Another problem of the film is the size of the film cast, because each different character carries some extra baggage in the front of the story. This makes the film sometimes a bit too full, because every character has almost its own background story, comedy or action style. The cast knows how to do good and entertaining work, but not every actor gets the same amount of time. Some are used more for a short comedy moment, or play an entertaining cameo. Some characters seem almost unnecessary or sometimes provide a more long-winded feeling. With a smaller movie cast and a more focused story, they could have had a better movie. The playing time could have been shorter, so that the entire film could have come across more appropriately.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

David Leitch comes from a stunt background so his movies usually have very good fights and stunts, then you add a layer of coolness sprinkled with a pint of comedy and his movies tend to be really enjoyable and the definition of very well executed entertainment. The cast is also very good with Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry stealing the show. I might be alone here, but I did find Brad Pitt to be a bit miscast, as this role was clearly meant for someone like Ryan Reynolds and Pitt lacks the comedic chops to pull it off perfectly. He's not bad by any means, it's just a bit of a nitpick. Everything else was a joy to watch and I was thoroughly entertained throughout. It's a bit hollow and I don't know if I want to re-watch it many times, hence the note, but I can still highly recommend this for fans of the genre.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The spectacular, creatively choreographed Japanese high-speed themed set engulfs an outstanding ensemble cast led by Brad Pitt. A well-made film with undeniable superficial virtues, but not many deeper ones, which are enough for a -mostly- entertaining two hours of viewing.The sets are a feast for the eyes throughout the film, detailing the aesthetics of Japanese culture inside the Bullet Train's different thematic wagons (as if taken from different video game tracks).The other great asset of the film is the awesome ensemble cast. The actors fulfill their mission with passion. The deliberately over-the-top acting sticks hand-to-hand with the hyperkinetic action (which is filmed with precision and clarity), while duets like the one of the twins impress with their chemistry. In a rather goofy performance that suits his comedic style, Brad Pitt entertains and is the film's highlight as the most politically correct -and unlucky- hitman we've seen in cinema. You can't help but laugh your heart out watching him struggle to keep the modern narrative of self-improvement against dangerous enemies that want to spill his blood, but also mocking himself on the occasion of the setbacks that he happens to stumble on! But as good as Pitt is (once again), it would be unfair to suggest that ""Bullet Train"" is a one man show. Even the cameos of all the well-known stars that appeared for the smallest amount of time are absolutely worthy to be mentioned.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was so close to this, but yet it was too much in the last scenes.But lets go back to the beginning. I wasn't expecting much when I went to the cinema, but with every station this movie was getting more and more amusing.Brad Pitt in absolute top shape. It's like his best from ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" and ""Inglorious Bastards"". Funny, mysterious.Tangerine and Lemon - those two were absolutely superb. For the first time probably I was totally for the bad guys. I was worried that there would be too much meaningless monologues, but the amount was just right to make the right climate... and this reference to Diesel and Tomas was just hilarious (but probably only parents would understand it the right way).As a spectator, throughout the whole movie, I wasn't sure who is who and why the do what they do. Sure, I had my suspicions but hey... each time someone was dead I had to rethink it all over again. That was the fun, really.The big finale on the train ... well it was this little too much to feel really, really satisfied with the movie. Entire movie was wild and fast, but I was enjoying it and there was not even one scene where it got me serious thinking whether something is possible or not, it was all connected so seamlessly and the the final battle happened... it wasn't so bad, but it was just too much.Overall impression is great though. Solid piece of entertainment there, good acting, very expressive characters. Definitely worth seeing for every fan of Tarantino :)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There were lots of plot and technical issues and some overboard action where not needed, and not enough where needed. The pop culture got annoying pretty quickly, and the cheesy characters tried to be shown off with Tarantino flair, but ended up just being obnoxious. But still, thanks in part to Pitt's stellar charisma and performance, it was a fun and entertaining ride. It's a shame a seasoned writer wasn't at least consulted to up the ante in the writing department to fix the lost opportunity to make this a great film.","14 out of 32 found this helpful.

A story about an underworld murder mystery with flavours of gang rivalry, family feud and personal vendettas, which all connect.There are exciting and diverse characters(assassins) with intuitive names. I loved 'Lemon'. He loves Thomas & Friends, the cartoon show but finds himself in trouble when he has to drive the train!Brad Pitt is 'Ladybug' who is furious with his luck as he always lands into trouble and people die without him even trying. There is a subtle comment on fate and that however hard you may try to control it, some things are just not in your hand.Filled with some decent action, better comedy and little gore Bullet Train is a good one-time watch.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Try wiping your nose 10x with the same tissue. It isn't funny.Since Tarantino tried to be Scorcese (and couldn't), this type of movie and directors have been piling up. That kinda funny+violence humor, the funny nicknames, The Villain, The Killer, The Thing in The Briefcase, all misused, plus the impossible action scenes... old, overused, it's like John Wick 1 to1.287, same old, same old. It's like fried chicken with fried potatoes with sundae: Wanna more fat? Wait, we have mayo.Nothing new, old jokes, old story, old plot, old, old. Old.It's one of those productions to fill up the streaming services: ""10K+ titles!"". They just don't tell you they're all the freaking same.The difference is that you have Brad Pitt (which is maybe becoming a Steven Seagal of this century after Once Upon a Time...) and other good actors in the cast that makes you think it'll be something nice.

Brad Pitt gave the same kinda casual act but not sure why it wasn't that enjoyable for me, it might be for his fans though.And the most interesting part of the plot for me was the karma part that makes you think backwards in the film in the end and connect the dots with not so much complexity but in a very straightforward manner, you'd probably like this, if you like spirituality even a bit of it.There were many mockeries kinda sequences in the film especially the ones that come in between the action sequences, which could've been avoided to make it even more serious & interesting.Overall, it is a one-time watchable decent flick, if you've time to kill.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

And I love that style. It feels fun, bouncy and light - nothing to take too seriously. Also, the action is great (similar to John Wick style which I absolutely adore). But other than that, the film does suffer from an over complicated plot with so many twists and turns you can barely keep up.The film is VERY fast paced, and introduces so many different characters at a time that you're left wondering who's who anymore. Sure, the film offers several flashback sequences and returns to these throughout to ensure consistency and to make sure you as the audience can just about keep up with the pace of this movie. But when there's so many plots going on at once, it begins to lose itself slightly, and soon becomes a bit messy in places, with a few holes throughout. For example, the 'Wolf' assassin trying to kill Brad Pitt's 'Ladybug' when he knew the actual person who killed his family was a woman called 'the Hornet'. That was a bit odd to me. I had to make up and guess a reason for this, which was purely the fact he maybe recognised Brad Pitt's character in that split second of seeing him?However saying this, the films style allows for this messy plot, as it's so fun and wild you don't seem to care too much what's going on, so it justifies it in a sense, which I can just about cope with. And none of this takes away from the enjoyment of the movie itself.For me, it's mainly the political references again that lets this movie down. Comments such as 'you look like any other white homeless man' and calling a girl 'Prince' and having her say 'I don't need to be a part of someone else's story, you're all part of mine' which is a cry at feminism, then of course another feminism boost when someone refers to God as 'She'. A film doesn't need to rely on cheap political jokes and references like this to make a film entertaining and if anything, it just irritates me because it ruins and spoils the experience of the movie. Sure, people need to feel represented and whatnot, but having racial comments about white men isn't going to achieve anything. Is it a case of making others feel better by slandering white men? If so how is that fair? Because if it was the other way around, it would not be tolerated...Whenever Hollywood realises this and comes to their senses, I will stop talking about it. Until then, I will continue to call it out.For that reason, it just scraped a 6/10.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I could also add the dialogue in general sometimes tried a bit too much.There's also a theme of faith and luck throughtout the movie which I did like.

This film contains a very basic plot and doesn't go anywhere you wouldn't expect. The films abundance and overusage of CGI while in other films I'd consider a weakness actually works here it fits the theme and style of the film very well, but I have seen better CGI then again I've also seen worse.By the end of the film what truly kept it engaging and fun was the writing and this well put together cast. Everyone played their respected roles so well, I particularly enjoyed the twins ""Tangerine"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and ""Lemon"" (Brian Tyree Henry) both actors had great chemistry and the bickering of their characters was just hilarious to me. Brad Pitt was obviously great and he played his role very well. Also there are some great cameos that really were a joy to watch, I won't say who so as to keep that a surprise.What stood out the most for me through this entire film and perhaps it's just me but this entire film looked, felt, and played out like it was directed by Guy Ritchie. The comedy, the characters, and the way the story was told just felt a lot like a Guy Ritchie film, like The Gentleman not saying these films are similar but it just had that feel. But The Gentleman is way better, if you haven't seen The Gentleman before I would highly recommend that film.At the end of it all I can't help but feel a tad bit disappointed because I wanted this film to be more and I wanted to enjoy it more. Not to say this was a bad film far from it, I was just hoping this film would've been more than I anticipated it to be.I can't say this is a must see in theaters but I can definitely say this is the perfect film to go out with the bros, make it a guys night, and have a good time.IMDb: 7/10
Letterboxd: 3/5Watched in Theaters.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The characters are fun and likable (although they all are bad guys), the action scenes are well choreographed, the violence and gore is just enough to satisfy me and not got too gory, the jokes are well timed, the cameos are hilarious... it had it all to become a real good action flick, set on a bullet train through Japan.I was just missing something... I don't know what it was, but it was lacking something genuine I think. It all was well thought out - but it was connecting for me sometimes and there were a few plot holes!That been said, I did have a really great time with this movie.

It feels like this movie is a big pretender. It pretends to be witty, funny, intelligent, with good character development and fighting scenes, being able to tell multiple story lines, with good acting and being some ingenious combination of a whodunnit and an action movie. This movie is none of these things. It's garbled mediocrity.Take for instance the two brothers, The first time they talk about being black&white brothers, about Thomas the Tank Engine and about their nicknames (Lemon and Tangerine) it sounds interesting. But then this keeps repeating throughout the movie and it is an absolute drag. Not funny at all. How believable is it that two people who've known eachother all their lives talk about these things all the time, anyway?Furthermore, Brad Pitt's character feels totally out of place (even accounting for the fact that he's just filling in for someone) and the others are even less interesting. However, we spend a big part of the movie looking at some of their back story. Looking back, that is just wasted time. It goes nowhere.The jokes are forced. The acting feels sloppy. The characters are walking cliches and the way they make decisions and form alliances is too rushed and ridiculous in most cases. And finally, the overall story is unimaginative and senseless to the point of being boring.I'm being very, very generous giving it 6/10 for this bad attempt at a Quentin Tarantino imitation.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With the city's glitzy and grimy neon-lit surroundings serving as backdrop to the tale of assassins finding themselves pitted against one another the movie is one sonic whoosh of a flick.Lead star Brad Pitt is the center of this whirlpool of flung furniture and smashed faces as he navigates his way through the long length of this seemingly endless train. The trite clich√©d Action tropes, annoying pc and diarrheic verbiage that passes off as humor make this a seemingly endless movie proving that there's no worse film than a bad Action film. The cameos by a fruity Channing Tatum, facially-swelled Sandra Bullock and barely there Ryan Reynolds provide brief respites from an unending 2 hour Odyssey of watch checking and snooze-inducing torture.A surprise hit that filled screens and emptied wallets, ""Bullet Train"" is a (barely) watchable teaser that's overall a disappointing waste of talent (and money) involved. Pass this.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The jokes tend to land most of the time and the best thing about this... It doesn't take itself serious. It knows it's ridiculously stupid and that makes the film more fun. It doesn't try and make sense of the stupid like other films would (like a fast and the furious). It was much more gory than I would have imagined as well.The negatives on this film are mostly a messy plot, some bad cgi and a couple moments I was taken out of the film by some serious FF moments. I do also believe this movie could have been trimmed down in certain parts as it does seemingly go on forever.The positives are, fun, action packed, cool shots, great comedy, great acting and great choreography.

Some great cameos from the likes of Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum & Ryan Reynolds are worked in well fo add to the movie. What let's the movie down quite a bit is sometimes they go back to the same well too many times. Flashbacks are in abundance and some are good however by the time the water bottle gets It's own flashback, something has gone seriously wrong.The last half hour is a bit of a train wreck (Pardon the pun) with awful CGI and characters dropping in and out from nowhere. It's a shame really as up to that point Bullet Train was great.(Also less thomas the tank is required.

Pure fun. Didn't think too much about some unrealistic situations and the excessive CGI.Brad Pitt is great here. Perfect role for him. But, overall great cast and solid performances except for Bad Bunny.He's obviously not an actor. I didn't like him in Narcos Mexico. Nor here. I understand he's only a marketing strategy, as many other Reggaeton singers trying to ""acting"" decently.So, overall if you love Tarantino movies and Brad Pitt's usual great performances like in Fight club or Inglorious Bastards, this one is for you.Solid 7/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"10","/10","TLDR - Definitely deserves a 7.8 at a minimum","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8415956/?ref_=tt_urv","seanmcampbell-17853","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur155486431/?ref_=tt_urv","8 August 2022","My wife and I loved this movie when we saw it in IMAX the other day. I want to preface that I don't think it's necessary to watch it in IMAX, but we upgraded our tickets just in case.The movie has great comedy and action. Brad Pitt is incredible is this movie, and the rest of the cast makes the movie great. The thing I love most about this movie is that it is definitely made for entertainment, and not thinking it was the summer blockbuster IMO. That's what makes me love the movie that much more. My wife and I both agreed we would turn around and watch the movie again as soon as it ended.I was a fan of the wittiness and interesting action scenes. The movie's pace was great in my opinion. With a little over a 2 hour run time, it may seem too long. But the 2 hours was just right in my opinion, because of the connections to different points it references back to from earlier in the movie. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is also one of my favorite actors, so I'm a little biased on his performance (which was terrific btw). Taylor-Johnson does an incredible job with his character, and reminds me a lot of his role in Kick-Ass. I might be highlighting him, but really everyone in the movie played their part amazingly. Each actor made a connection to me through their characters. I loved each character's growth, or lack of, through the 2 hour run time.I'm probably rambling a little bit, but I would say this movie deserves at least a 7.8 due to the entertainment value and hilarious cameos (the trailers did a great job of hiding them). Personally, I gave it a 10 because it hit all the points I was looking for a movie this year. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the seriousness, comedy, and action was just *chef's kiss* perfect for me.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

There is light hearted comedy sprinkled into every action packed scene (which is, quite literally, all of them) to alleviate some of the non-stop gun pointing and sword wielding.This movie starts at a level 9/10 on the action scale and ends at a level 1000/10. The stunts are continually outdone, becoming more outrageous, and really pushing the limits of what is capable with special effects in this day and age.Brad Pitt is a fine actor. He carries this movie on his shoulders with the wacky duo of Lemon and Tangerine and Prince also showing themselves to be formidable actors.The acting is good, the technical effects are even better. It's a smorgasbord of instantaneous reflexes, special effect wows, and a lot of gore.There's a bit of everything here, which I guess is also the weak point of this movie. There is SO much going on that it's hard to focus on the story. I honestly can't tell you who the White Death are or what the suitcase was for or who is chasing who. There's just a million pieces of visual and story information hurling at you at light speed that it's really hard to follow the story and appreciate everything else this movie offers at the same time.The director really took a maximalist approach, fitting in as much candy into the jar as possible, until it overflows and you get a cavities from eating all of it.This is definitely a movie that requires repeat viewings to take in everything that happens. It's a good movie, bordering on great, but it suffers from too much going on at once.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The action is of course choreographed well but the dialogue is like someone asked ChatGPT to ""create a Tarantino script with lots of hitmen on a Japanese Train"".Of course the gallery also reads like a modern stock photography where any clich√© is represented.Now this could have worked fine for a while but as with so many modern films it's a long movie - 2 hours. Earlier, only the artsy films were long movies and the standard fare clocked in at 1:45 max. But now any generic action movie can be between 2 and 3 hours.This is odd since in today's fast-paced media landscape, audiences (who go for generic films) have shorter attention spans and don't necessarily want to sit through a movie that is overly long.So just because you don't have to use a cinema for an extra half hour it doesn't mean that you can just squeeze in 1000 references to Thomas the Tank engine.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's virtually a whodunit for a large portion of the film too. Though its final 20 minutes are not great.

"6","/10","The perfect movie to turn your brain off during","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8410411/?ref_=tt_urv","Benslie","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur69664646/?ref_=tt_urv","7 August 2022","You know, for a movie called, ""Bullet Train"" that takes place on a fast-moving bullet train this movie definitely wasn't as fast as one.Right out of the gate I'm going to say that this movie might work for some while not for others. There are multiple reasons for this and I'll get into each one and what I thought of them. Starting off with the story for this movie and for me, I just found it lacking. The story for this movie is an interesting one and if you look up the plot for the original book it could've worked if some factors changed. Now, I haven't read the original book so I can't say much about how much was changed for this adaptation so maybe everything that happens in this movie might work for the book but not visual media, for example, the plot twists in this movie. I will admit there's one in here that unless you're really paying attention to the movie it will go over your head but the others you can easily figure them out. I will say that in regards to the story for this movie, it's good if you shut your brain off while watching the movie and not think too hard.The next aspect that'll split people is the pacing of this movie. For me, the pacing just didn't work and I thought this movie should've been shorter. A lot of things in this movie happen that I just feel like could've been cut out and nothing would've been missing from the movie. There are two segments in this movie that come to mind, one that already is short enough to just be a deleted scene and another that goes on for a bit. I know action movies need breathing room from all the action scenes in them but the slower scenes in this movie just didn't intrigue me. This could be due to how many characters there are which does tie into the pacing issue. Because of how many characters there are, the movie tries to flesh them out and give them all backstories when they aren't necessary. There were maybe one or two characters, other than the main character, who really needed backstories given for them.I don't know what everybody is going to think about the characters themselves though but to me I couldn't really get into them. Despite them getting backstories I still couldn't grow to really care about any of them to wanting to see them live. There's one character in this movie that honestly could've been written out of the movie entirely and I wouldn't have cared other than that means the runtime would be shortened. I will say though in regards to the characters that it isn't the actors faults as all of the actors give it their all but the writing.The writing is the third aspect that will for sure divide people as some will enjoy the campiness of it along with the humour but for me the humour just didn't work. Pretty much each character got one personality trait and had to stick to it. None of them were given room to grow and change as characters instead all just stay flat characters. Most of the writing is dedicated to the humour in this movie and like I said this will be divisive between people depending on your type of humour. If you enjoy slapstick humour or surreal humour then this movie is for you but for everybody else there might be one of two jokes that'll work.But like I said the actors all did their jobs really well and made each character stand out with their one character trait. The standouts for me in this movie are Brad Pitt, Joey King, who plays Prince, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who plays Tangerine. Brad Pitt takes his one character trait and portrays it to perfection and makes for this weird oddball character that's enjoyable to watch. While Joey King on the other hand plays this character that you have no clue what they're going to do next. She plays this manipulative mentally unstable character to perfection that I definitely wouldn't look down on her.Now this movie is first and foremost an action flick so the action for this movie needs to be good and with it being confined to a bullet train it would be right? Well the action in this movie is pretty good but given the setting could've been better. I'm just going to side track here for a second to talk about the design of the train and my thoughts on it. I feel like the train easily could've been a character in and of itself with the right production design and here it doesn't work. The train is still well designed but I wish there were more rooms that looked different from each other or had a special feature to it like the quiet car. I feel like it's because of the design of the cars that the action scenes felt like they were missing something. Now, don't get me wrong I did enjoy the fight scenes in this movie and I felt like they were really well done but how much cooler could they have been if they were fighting in like a car with bunk beds in it since this is an overnight train. I also feel like it was during these actions that David Leith, the director, directing shined the best. The action scenes were directed with perfection with not too much editing in them and having them easy so that the audience can easily follow what's happening in them.But you know what I can easily forgive everything bad in this movie as the soundtrack for this movie was amazing. From the musical score to the songs used in this movie it felt appropriate and fit in perfectly. Also, this movie gave me a japanese version of an already great song and made it better somehow.In the end, Bullet train might not work for everybody but for those who want a movie to turn their brains off and enjoy this is the perfect movie for you. I give Bullet Train a 6/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It fails at being what it is supposed to be - a comedy, but on the other hand it is a very well crafted movie with many great aspects.It is obvious that the writers and director know their craft. The movie is professionally done and follows all the rules of how to create a great movie.The plots all fit together and in the end even naturally merge into one big one. And at no point does a plot feel out of place.Almost every scene contains either a setup or a payoff, there is almost nothing in this movie that could be removed without hurting some other part. The ""Diesel"" payoff might be the best of the movie and even though it wasn't particularly deep or complex, it just worked very very well because it had a lot of different setups that touched the viewer in different ways.The characters are another strong point, every character has a strong motiviation to be there and they all act according to their unique personality.And wow, the cast... very diverse, good actors, memorable faces and lots of characters that look familiar but not familiar enough to recognize them. Best example is ""White Death"", he seemed familiar but I could not figure out that it is Michael Shannon.And even ""famous"" actor Brad Pitt did not overshadow his role with his fame or personality.The biggest/only issue is the comedy aspect of the movie. Humor is hit-or-miss, sadly mostly miss, but it tries really hard to be funny. So hard, almost all of it seems forced and it ruins many dialogues. But the movie still was entertaining from beginning to end and a few jokes were pretty good.I feel like if the movie didn't have comedy and focused on the darker and more serious aspects it could have been a great mystery action thriller. Instead we got a bad comedy forced into a good movie with a lot of potential.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It feels like we've been overwhelmed lately by these by-the-numbers action films lead by recognizable movie stars. There is an ocean of them and I can barely tell them apart much less remember half of them. Films like the Grey Man, Red Notice, Kate (2021), Six Underground, The Old Guard. It looks like they exist in a plane somewhere between the slickness of John Wick action and the humour and sensibility of Family Guy. I would be too much credit to say they're formulaic but they tend to have the thinnest plot with the most boring characters.The key element that separates Bullet train from these other movies is a certain amount of flair in the execution.The movie tells the story of Brad Pitt, who is basically playing a version of The Dude from the Big Lebowski. Half unscrupulous killer, half hippy slacker. He is tasked to get on the Bullet Train to recover a briefcase full of cash. Unbeknownst to him, it seems that everybody in the Japanese underworld is also apparently on the train, for a bunch of different reason. As such it is a merry gallery of characters, should I say stereotypes, going at each other. It is not exactly high art but the tone is irreverent enough and it does not take itself too seriously, yet at the same time the action is treated with respect. The film achieves a tonal equilibria that keeps you engaged, and at this point that is frankly as good as it gets. Same thing can be said of the plot, it is nothing groundbreaking, but is sufficiently convoluted that it will make you guessing on how it is going to unfold.The thing I liked the most about the film was the comic relief duo of Lemon and Tangerine. Brothers and partners in crime, their dynamic veers between police detectives in a buddy movie and old married couple. However the actors charisma makes them endearing and somewhat relatable. I almost wish the movie would have focused on them as protagonist. Unfortunately the story does not give them much to do, and they have no agency. And also, while I adore those actors, iit is clear this movie was built around Pitt and he is the draw.You're left wondering if there is anything it could have done better? I would have enjoyed a bit more if it had given the script more gravitas, more heft and have the protagonist a bit more grounded. The humour and the setup are a bit too quippy and giddy. The humour comes primarily from the randomness of the situations.As such Bullet train is a good film, but despite the heightened japanese-inspired neon stylistic look, the faux-ironic use of music and the levity of the script it does leave you with an overall sense of blandness.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's funny and full of fun and action packed. Director David Leitch has done a great job with adapting the book by K√¥tar√¥ Isaka to the big screen.The plot centers around multiple assassins and bounty hunters who all unite in one place (a fast train in modern-day Japan). Slowly, it is revealed to the characters that their missions have a lot in common, perhaps intentionally.As much as I enjoyed the fast pacing and humorous tone of the film, I did feel like a lot of plot points were left either unfinished or just cut short. Many interesting characters to me seemed to just appear and die for nothing.The peak of the movie for me were the duo Lemon and Tangerine (Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor Johnson respectively). I loved every moment of them on screen, their chemistry was great and I really enjoyed all their interactions.Aside of the rest of the cast, I think Lemon and Tangerine were really my favorites and the ones to hold the whole humor and soul of the film.The movie uses a lot of pop culture references and different styles of genre to keep its tone uplifting: you have russian mobsters, Yakooza Japanese gangs, Mexican cartels. As much as it's fun all the use of different materials, I did assume it was all just a huge fuss, a lot of random combinations for a OK movie.Is this movie at the end worth watching? Sure, it is entertaining and holds lot to it, but nothing more, one of those movies you might not remember looking back. As I said, a Train wreck.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Lots of style and lots of frenetic story telling. I consider them punk neo-noir.The aim is something like ""overwhelm your audience with tons of characters and tons of exposition vis a vis flashbacks and hopefully earn your big twists along the way."" Whereas films like Kill Bill and Hot Fuzz and Snatch do this masterfully, this movie comes up a bit short. It's just not as cleanly done and clever as those movies are are tying it all together in a neat bow. That's a writing failing.Aside from that, the movie is well paced and well directed and a lot of fun to watch. The cameos are welcome, the product placements are eye rolling and embarrassing, but I think it's easy to look past by the end of the movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Answer: Everything!These industry and fan respected directors belong to an elite group of filmmakers who typically operate in a rarified corner of the motion picture industry where few others would dare visit (nor would they want to). If it's untamed, completely unapologetic entertainment you're looking for this Summer (2022), you'll easily find it here.Bullet Train embodies many genres, and the kind of quick action scenes that are at times nearly debilitating to the senses. While it is true that real Bullet Trains are common in Japan, it's highly unlikely they'll ever transport this eclectic collection of passengers who also happen to be deadly assassins. These killers each have a mission to complete, but apparently, they also harbor very deep-seated grudges against each other. Like a real bullet train that can reach speeds up to 268 mph, the film's pace is correspondingly swift. Scenes fly by in a flash. Blink and you'll miss something. Then, just when your brain begins to process a previous moment - WHAM! You're on to the next scene.There's enough ultra violence and sadomasochistic behavior here, and in such great abundance, it makes ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) look like ""The Sound of Music"" (1965). I confess I winced once or twice at certain blood-gushing scenes, but stuntman/director David Leitch brilliantly infuses just the right amount of dark humor that makes even the goriest moments more palatable to digest.This is the kind of film that makes you quietly exhale when the end credits begin to roll. It's as if you had been holding your breath the entire 2:08 minute run time. The screenplay by Zak Olkewicz is so brilliant it's like looking through a prism, the optics of which are often so glaringly opaque you begin to think ""Did I really just see that? Even the most astute audiences will have to pay close attention to this film because there are quite a lot of carefully placed elements containing foreshadowing and clues, all ingeniously hidden in marvelous plain sight.Bullet Train is based on the 2010 novel, ""Maria Beetle,"" by Japanese writer Kotaro Isaka. For acting, it stars a delightfully laid back Brad Pitt in the role of a Zen-style serial assassin who is forced to do battle with his fellow killers while speeding along in the fictionalized ""Tokaido Shrinkansen"" bullet train. In addition to Pitt, the hard working cast includes sterling, truly memorable performances by Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henr, Andrew Koji, Hiroyuki Sanada, Michael Shannon, Benito A. Martinez Ocasio and a too-fleeting cameo by Sandra Bullock.No major spoilers here as usual, but I can reveal that a real life Bullet Train traveling from Tokyo to Kyoto takes 2 hours and 8 minutes, the exact run time of the film.","12 out of 27 found this helpful.

The movie had some really great stylistic choices and was pretty great cinematically too. There were some over the top cgi parts that could have been avoided to keep the movie slightly more grounded, but it was certainly more bearable then a marvel movie.

Moreover, I cherished the brotherly banter between Tangerine and Lemon; all those Thomas - The Tank Engine references were hilarious.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It does not feel organic and the tension gets ruined by dumb jokes. The story revolves around the bullet train that only stops for exactly 1 minute. It does not stop when it's windows are breaking, when people fire guns on it and staff is dying. Also more than half of it is completly empty all the time, so scenes can play out. (There is some explanation near the end, but it does not explain the start). Nothing makes any sense on this train. The main villain is a russian mobster who runs a japanese gang that has multiple black guys as ninjas. What's next? The Bloods with an indian leader and eskimo members?Second, the humour. There are some decent jokes and funny scenes, but they are over-shadowed by the amount of bad ones. They joke about thomas the tank engine and their dumb codenames throughout the movie like it was so funny the first 10 times. It's almost as bad as Love and Thunder.Third, the casting and acting. The girl from the kssing booth cosplays as Dolores Umbridge with zero charisma and presence. She's directly states at the start of the movie that she's gonna be a cliche 2022 strong girlboss smartass aroggant female ""character"". That dialogue was so bad I almost head-butted the screen.Lemon and tangerine? Well, they are the comedic due, but i already told you about the comedy. Both of them are incompetent jesters who in the movie kill a bunch of people but in real life would probably not be able to deal with a child.Lastly, Pitt's character. One second he's a competent well trained assassin, the next he gets defeated by a smart-toilet. Enough said.This movie is not unwatchable but i would not give it more than 4/10.","14 out of 25 found this helpful.

The story of an enlightened assassin that becomes entangled in a dynamic twisted adventure involving the crossroads of colorful characters attempting to kill each other and stay alive. Brad Pitt is fun and colorful intros role. He is multi-talented-both funny and lethal in this one. The supporting cast of characters are just slight of cartoonish, but fun to watch. Japan and the train are terrific as the setting and are as much a character as any of the cast. David Leitch's direction and cinematography are very good and visually unique. The action and fight choreography are, as expected, very top rate. This is, at its core, an action and martial arts film starring Brad Pitt. There are a lot of surprises and cameos, which make watching even more fun. It has elements of Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, John Wick, and more-all of which make Andrew Koji, of Warrior is good here. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Bryan Tyree Henry are very good as ""twin"" assassins. Sandra Bullock a nice addition. The movie does suffer from silliness at some parts, which is where it falls from great to very good. Michael Shannon is also very good in this. The music is good. Still worth seeing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Some good twists and turns, hilarious moments, and ridiculous moments to guarantee loads of fun.I have a few problems with it. There were some plot holes to obvious to ignore that took away from the ""wowness"" factor of the plot development. Also, some of the acting is a bit forced, and Brad Pitt, while a stud and a fun actor to watch on screen, is a bit too much like himself. The movie tries too hard to get the audience to like him. Additionally, some people might just find it too, well, stupid to enjoy. And lastly, way too much forced profanity people. It feels like the producers just sat in a room and discussed how they could make the movie more ""adult"" and obscene (which, being someone who knows people who have worked in Hollywood close to many popular celebrities and producers, is something I can attest is a REAL thing), and one of their conclusions was to just throw in more F-bombs. It felt unnecessary and unnatural, and frankly, it was just distracting. It felt natural in movies like ""Goodfellas"" or ""District 9,"" but not this one.Other than that, it's a barrel of laughs and fun. Some cool fight scenes and cameos to boot. Don't take it seriously, because it certainly didn't itself. Grab a bag of popcorn and let it take you in.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is nothing new under the sun: the whole plot and setting are predictable. The dialogues, especially in the first half, are well written and they gradually build up the tension. I had a good laugh and I liked almost all the characters. I truly enjoyed Tangerine and Lemon, who were such a funny and powerful duo that performed the most comedic parts. Brad Pitt was charismatic and he fitted quite well the role of Ladybug. I appreciated the short Bad Bunny and Zazie Beetz cameos, while Kimura and Prince were absolutely unbearable: they were distracting and their presence often stalled the plot. Joey King was particularly insufferable and I did not like her performance at all.I liked the editing, there were a few short sequences that explained some story elements. The director managed to portray flashbacks or small sub-plots in just a bunch of minutes. These scenes were well integrated with the main timeline and they were well placed along the film. Special effects and CGI were decent for a flick of this kind. Stunts were amazingly coordinated and directed. The quality of these dynamic parts slightly dropped towards the end. The epilogue was quite trivial and lazy, screenwriters could come up with something a bit better. Overall it is a nice movie that will make you spend two enjoyable hours, perfect if you just want to relax with something easygoing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And, surprisingly, it really works. This movie is a ton of fun; a neon, hyper violent ensemble piece set in a confined space (two types of films I feel like I don't see enough of).The action is glorious and well choreographed and the editing (while mostly. Concerned with style over efficient storytelling) keeps the film high energy and snappy. If you're a fan of smug, self aware action comedies, this movie is perfect for you.This movie has some truly inventive and fun cinematography and I like how the train itself (as well as a water bottle) sort of become characters. For a movie called ""Bullet Train"" it lives up to its namesake by being super fast paced and never letting things get dull.The cast is also truly excellent. Pitt is effortlessly charming and likeable. Aaron Taylor Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry are so good in this movie, not only did I want to see more of them together, but would legitimately want to see a prequel just about them. Even side actors (like Bad Bunny, Logan Lerman, Zazie Beetz, to name a few) excel in their small roles.But, of all the actors, Joey King of all people surprised me the most. I've never been a fan of hers, but I'll admit when I'm wrong: I've probably judged King based off of the bad performances in BAD MOVIES. While she isn't winning an Oscar here, she's really good and surprisingly convincing.Also, that Bad Bunny sequence is one of the best parts of the movie. The perfect example of delivering exposition via montage in a fun, efficient, and shocking way.The Bad: Bullet Train is a bit in love with itself and as I mentioned before, it's edited for the purposes of style, which means the movie is a bit confusing at times.There are also a lot of overused flashbacks that kind of reminded me of a hyperactive kid begging for attention. We really didn't need to see a bride vomiting blood and bleeding from her eyes OVER AND OVER again. What I would've loved is more backstory for Pitt's character or the Twins, not constant reminders of what happens when people get poisoned with Boomslang poison, you know?Oh and the product placement is extremely distracting. I knew this was a Sony Pictures film from the get go because of how often brands are just shoved in your face. No, I don't want an Audi and overpriced Fiji water, movie.The Ugly: One little detail I really liked about this movie is how it deals with women fighting. We do not get Black Widow, where 100 lb women toss men double their weight around. What we do get are female assassins using disguises, deception, and toxins to achieve their goals. When they do fight men head to head, they lose. Because of course they would.Ironically, the two women in the movie I'm referring to are easily the most intimidating villains in the film. One of them is so scary because you feel she could exist in real life, using her looks, age, and biases of the men around her to manipulate people to achieve her goals. Much scarier than if she was able to just body Brad Pitt or Aaron Taylor Johnson.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Comedy falls flat and leagues behind the wit and tension of Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. I enjoyed Brad Pitt's performance and some of the characters grew on me in the second half. Most of the action is great and was entertaining enough to provide a decent score despite the issues. Some of the dialogue in scenes is poorly acted and directed and attempted humour in the script is cringeworthy at times. Didn't laugh once and the almost cartoonish feel and at times look of the film sucked most tension out of it. I think there was some wrong casting. I like the White Death actor but he was unconvincing for this role. My biggest complaint is with the script and director.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film has many faults, but pace and not being fun isn't one of them. The plot is Paper thin and the accents from Lemon & Tangerine are poor and simply not needed - it's gives it a weak Guy Ritchie take that the film never quite shakes off. But if you can look past that you do get a fun action film that doesn't take itself too seriously, does bring the odd genuine laugh and despite the large number of fight scenes, does very well to keep each set piece interesting and gripping.It's a solid film, nowhere near perfect but very much worth a watch, even if it only ends up reminding you of a dozen or so films that have walked this path and in a far more spectacular fashion.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Directed by David Leitch and featuring an all-star cast, the film follows a group of assassins and hitmen who find themselves on a speeding train from Tokyo to Morioka.One of the strengths of ""Bullet Train"" is its relentless action sequences that are choreographed to perfection. The fight scenes are intense and well-executed, with each character bringing their own unique fighting style to the table. The film also has a great soundtrack that complements the action on screen, adding to the overall excitement.However, the film's main weakness is its length. At almost two and a half hours, ""Bullet Train"" feels unnecessarily long and could have benefited from some trimming. There are a few plot threads that could have been cut or condensed without affecting the overall story, and some of the action scenes could have been tightened up to keep the pace moving.Despite its length, ""Bullet Train"" is still an enjoyable movie that is worth seeing for fans of action films. The cast is impressive, with standout performances from Brad Pitt, Zazie Beetz, and Andrew Koji. While it may not be the most groundbreaking movie in terms of plot or character development, it delivers on its promise of being a fun and thrilling action movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It also reminded much of Quentin Tarantino's narrative and filmmaking style in films such as Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2, Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight. I would say Bullet Train is a more comedic version of Kill Bill because of the films unique assassins, for blending in the martial arts genre, and because blood tends to splatter everywhere!The story was quite simple - A typical case of putting different characters, with seemingly different yet connected agendas, into an isolated space. There was a recurring theme of ""fate"" and ""luck"" in the film, which I could not take too seriously. However, I suppose it appealed to the films melodramatic nature.I enjoyed the film's overall colourful look and its lighthearted and vibrant soundtrack as it corresponded with the beautiful neon lights of Tokyo.The assassin pair, codenamed ""Tangerine"" and ""Lemon"" played by Aaron Taylor Johnson and Bryan Tyree Henry provided the standout performances for me. I could not help but enjoy Johnson cursing left right and centre with his thick British accent while Henry proceeds to analyze people by comparing them to various trains from the animated children show Thomas and Friends, which centres on an anthropomorphic train, Thomas the Tank Engine. It was certainly iconic, considering everything takes places on a train! (Lol). Brad Pitt gave an okay-to-good job as the assassin codenamed, ""Ladybug"". It was certainly nothing groundbreaking from Pitt. It definitely gave Deadpool vibes - the clumsy yet smart character, with a few tricks up his sleeves.The action was cool. There were many fun, on-the-fly close-combat encounters among the assassins. Leitch has certainly proved that he knows how to make great, multifaceted colourful action sequences.Overall, Bullet Train was an entertaining watch and is definitely worth the watch for those interested in the action/comedy genre.That's all from meYours sincerely,AKA The Cinephile.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The action is almost non-stop. There's always something going on. It has a comedy element, but not enough to make you laugh out loud. He laughs every now and then. Fight scenes are good. The injury scenes are also realistic. The story flows. It is not difficult to put the pieces together, but it is necessary to follow. If you play on the phone, you will miss most of the details. Of course, there are logic errors, but the flow of the movie does not allow you to fall into these errors. So I wasn't too bothered. Directing, stage designs, colors used were successful. It's a quality movie. The cast is already champions league. With a little more work, it could have been 8.

It tried too hard to be funny and often wasn't, which cut through any semblance of tension or threat. There was too much clunky exposition detailing backstories which threw off the pacing. It was congested with characters who came and went too quickly. The action was fairly uninspiring and not particularly well put together.Still, it managed to keep me somewhat entertained and if you can look past these flaws there's a good time to be had with this film.

Furthermore the plot is sufficiently interesting to hook the viewer and justify the well shot choreographies.

The films starts with a moment of promise, and rapidly slides into a script so amateur that at times it felt like cast was speaking the bits between the dialogue, rather than the dialogue itself.As for the dialogue, when it wasn't exposition delivered like someone rewriting a shopping list, it was - to put it kindly - banal at best.The gratuitous violence at points seemed to be there to embellish pointless conversations, simply to extend the films runtime.The trailer made it look like a combination of Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie's films. The result is a combination of Quentin's Tarantino and Guy Ritchie's films if they were translated through the eyes of a film school drop out who worships those filmmakers, but bailed their education before getting past the Logline class saying, 'I got this', and strutting off with all the confidence of Mike Tyson in his prime, while weighing in at a sickly 135lbs and sucking a vape pen for 90% of his waking hours.If clich√©s and tropes could speak, they'd tell you this movie is tragically so full of them that if feels less like it was written, and more like it was assembled of all the worst bits of those other filmmakers' filmographies.I've watched a lot of movies and tv series over the years. And yes, sometimes I've tapped the 'fast forward' button in some slow parts. I've even watched them at 2x speed to get through some of the worst offenders quicker. In this film, I kept wishing the theatre had a fast forward option... including for some of the fight scenes.Making a feature film is a monumental effort. As a viewer, I'm someone who commits to a film. I'm someone who believes that if you've reached the half-way point, you owe it to the filmmakers and the story to finish it, out of respect for their efforts.And yet despite my best effort, sitting through 3/4 of 'Bullet Train', it stands as the worst movie I've seen in decades, becoming the 3rd movie I've ever walked out of in my entire life.Everyone watching this movie is getting robbed. Even if you see it for free.Save your money. And your time. Heck, this movie wasn't even worth its poster.It gets a well-earned 0/10.","29 out of 60 found this helpful.

But talking about White Death - Michael Shannon brings wrong narrative to film with his brilliant acting: russians are threatening and can outsmart you. Nope - those are just inadequate, impulsive, furious but nothing to do with smart beings. Joe King impressed me with quotes at the end of the film - I know how hard the pronunciation is with completely different articulation system. Tangerine is handsome as well as Ladybug- both of them gained brilliant come back with this movie. Zazie Beetz and Logan Lerman are cool as always - rare but always top of the top.Listening to the dialogs was a pure pleasure, and not because this are well-made, but because the accent variety is a mix of all possible cultural representations.

Long story short:90% is pure gold. The acting is very good. The action is stylish and perfectly entertaining. Most of the characters are fun to watch. The cinematography, music, storylines, dialogue (mostly), etc... It's all very well-crafted, and this comes from someone who can be very tough on action movies. It felt like an anime come to live on the big screen and I was constantly entertained and interested.The other 10%, however, are all in the third act. The movie ends pretty underwhelmingly considering everything that you would expect to happen. The action and story go completely off the rails in the last 20 minutes or so, if you ask me.The final fight is set up to happen in this epic and awesome way...only for it to get dragged out so long that it turns into a slapstick comedy in the end (literally).Deaths that you are wishing for to happen in a satisfying way sadly aren't fulfilled, and this only gets worse considering the brutal ways likeable characters get killed off in this movie.Bullet Train could have been one of the best action flicks of this year, maybe even of the last several. But an underwhelming third act and lack of satisfying pay-offs didn't bring it home for me sadly.

This juxtaposition of maudlin emotional scenes with desensitised hyper-violence will be familiar to viewers of the aforementioned films (and films like Dead Pool).I did enjoy the Tangerine and Lemon duo (played by a swaggering Aaron Taylor Johnson and the disarming Brain Tyree Henry), but they were probably best in small doses, whilst Brad Pitt's self-help obsessed ageing hitman just about carried the movie but failed to really connect. Meanwhile, Joey King's 'Prince' was a little too convincing as an annoying smug narcissist.A number of Hollywood actors turn up in cameos, personally I'm not a fan of this trend - it feels like a lazy in-joke and that the cast are having more fun than the audience.Other running 'jokes' revolve around Thomas the Tank Engine and a hi-tech toilet, amusing but asinine.The setting - a Japanese high speed train - could have led to some more interesting cultural insights, yet I learnt nothing new (and probably reinforced some stereotypes) and the fact that this was filmed in California probably didn't help.It was visually entertaining, but superficial and, for the all the money thrown at the project , the film looked a bit cheap (maybe it's that HD crispness combined with the digital fakery?).If none of this is selling it to you, I should add that I quite enjoyed it.My girlfriend fell asleep halfway through and on awakening said, 'oh, are they still fighting?'","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jackson was not in this movie. He was probably occupied elsewhere because I know people have to had called him in. Everyone else was there: Brad Pitt, Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock - repaying Brad for the cameo in their movie, Ryan Reynolds (because that's how nice Canadians are), Andrew Koji and Hiroyuki Sanada (frankly I expected more of them), Michael Shannon, Zazie Beets (in withdrawal from Deadpool movies?), a quirky Black and White duo of fast talking and philosophizing Brits, even Masi Oka was there, apparently teleporting around for no good reason. Many others, too.The film is a Quentin Tarantino homage from beginning to end, based on a Japanese book, set in a bullet train with some Guy Ritchie stuff sprinkled in and many cameos. The whole moral of the movie was that fate makes all actors meet eventually (paraphrasing here). Was it good? Don't know. I was entertained, that's all i can say. It made little sense, logically, but it didn't matter. It was like Train to Busan with known actors instead of zombies.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

First, Yes... see it. This is a entertaining, odd, strange, fun movie. It wasn't what I expected and was a bit more dark comedy than anything. It was a bit like if (maybe) Breaking Bad had been a dark comedy movie with a few more hit men. It also had vibes of ""Kingsman"". It's really hard to describe, but I'd suggest that if you in expecting something strange, violent, and with some humor you probably shouldn't laugh at (but will), then you'll enjoy it.Brad Pitt did a great job in this role, and you'll see some familiar faces. All the actors were great in this movie.Definitely NOT for kids. I'd give Bullet Train a 5.9 rating. Unlike many on IMDB, I have a tough rating scale, but anything over a 5.0 (on my scale) is a decent movie. Above a 6 is a pretty darn good movie. Above a 7 is a VERY good movie. Above an 8 is phenomenal. Above a 9 is a MUST SEE ""masterpiece"" of a movie (something that likely will fall under ""a classic"" over time).","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Perhaps David Leitch was targeting senile audiences in the first place as there are so many prolonged sequences wasted on the repeated explanatory flashbacks. With a lot of one-dimensional characters, the revenge plot showed conspicuously on the other side as the singular serious aspect of the story, only to be failed miserably by a Hollywood clich√© of last-minute swapping bodies. The abundance of technical shots and unnecessary slow motion in this felt like an attempt to make this film sophisticated but fell rather hard under the pretentious filmmaking process only halfway to being actually great. Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson would've been far more interesting main characters, both plot-wise and visual-wise. I also have high hopes for Karen Fukuhara's role in this, which apparently crumbles in a non-existent way.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's made by a stuntman-turned-director and is a popcorn-stuffing-your-mouth fest for the middle of the first-half all the way through the end. It's well acted with a lot of talented people and is, can I say, a little wholesome albeit violent (not as violent as they say it is except for one assassin who uses venom to annihilate targets).Nobody is safe on the train, and we see main characters picked off at random times. It's pretty funny actually and a breath of fresh air coming from Hollyweird.The best part of the film is when they announce new assassins even in the third act and they're really popular actors you wouldn't think would be in the movie for a small period of time.The negatives are is that it's very slow in the first act and the CGI is almost obvious CGI. There's the word ""man-splaining"" in the film which is a made-up political term disparaging an entire gender but it IS subtle and ironic when you see the scene. I doubt it's meant to be ironic but I'll let it slide (just this once).7/10 good popcorn flick.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It may be confusing as it introduces a lot of characters in the train. Where every assassin has there own agenda. While it all ties together on why they are all on the same train.There is a couple of fun cameos that make an appearance. Sure, the direction did not take itself serious with its narrative structure and the humor does get a little loss and loses its concept of creating laughs. The humor is more cheesy and tacky than actually being funny.The climax of the film does pay off with a violent action sequence showdown. And can be a bit bloody. The visual effects are decent.

And that's bad for a movie that is a Brad Pitt vehicle. The most fun part is the Joey King character. Her perfect innocent young girl face is suitable to that of an assassin you least expect. Her British accent is also superb. I have only known Joey King in ""The Act,"" portraying a Munchausen by Proxy victim. What a contrast of two roles. She is a really good actress.

I think it was the right call, as away from the pressures of the Silver Screen the film's stylish charms, though lack of substance, were more forgivable.A contract killer, suffering a crisis of confidence, agrees to an easy task, retrieving a briefcase from the Bullet Train as it passes between Tokyo and Kyoto. The operative, codenamed ""Ladybug"" (Brad Pitt) is unaware though that the briefcase is in the possession of two East London Hitmen, 'Tangerine"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and 'Lemon' (Brian Tyree Henry) who are returning it to a notorious Yakuza boss, along with his son (Logan Lerman) who they have liberated. Also, on the train is 'Prince' (Joey King), who also has eyes on the case and has gone to terrible lengths to ensure that Yuichi Kimura (Andrew Koji) is on board as well.I know in that first paragraph I came close to using ""Style over Substance"" as a criticism. I do dislike that phrase, both because it's a boring review cliche' but also because it supposes, in this visual medium, that the style has markedly lesser value. It also would suggest that I didn't like the film, which isn't true either. I liked the performances, even the particularly mannered ones. Taylor-Johnson and Henry both struggle with their cockney accents, but not so much that it undermines their back and forth. Lemon's obsession with ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" is perhaps the most ""I am quirky!"" element that the film has, but it pays back into the story in ways that propel it forward. In fact I was impressed by the cleverness of the story and how the call-backs figured back into the narrative, even with a couple of aspects that surprised me. It did make me laugh a couple of times too.The ending was a little underwhelming, after what had come previously, and you do need a healthy acceptance of the unrealness of the world, to make it through some of the earlier scenes. The CGI in those final moments could have been better too.I can't imagine I'll feel the need to come back to the film very often, but it was a surprisingly enjoyable ride.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie tries so hard to be cool like Snatch, Lock Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels. The characters are cringe, esp Lemon and Tangerine. One has a fixation with Thomas the Tank engine because I guess thats supposed to be funny? Neither character is believable as an assassin, one of them is obese.The dialogue photography was bad, cutting between 2 shots with their heads centered in the frame. Why try to reinvent the wheel? The camera isn't allowed to fixate on anything for more than 2 seconds because the children enjoying this movie would lose interest.Brad Pitt's character is on a bluetooth call the first 15 min of the movie. It's tiresome. It reminded me of video games where someone is constantly blabbing in your ear over a radio. The banter is eye-roll inducing.. ""Take the gun"" she says as his hand hovers over it. Not even 2 minutes later ""i sHoULd'Ve tAkEn tHe gUn!"" was this written by children? A setup and payoff only 2 minutes apart?Then the ""We killed 16.. no it was 17 people!"" argument cuts to a mindless violent montage showing 17 people murdered for a tasteless throwaway joke. These movies are manufactured BY baby-brains FOR baby-brains.Brad Pitt's a great actor, but even he can't save this uninspired, unwatchable trash.

Definitely one of the more enjoyable films to have come out this year. It's definitely a turn your brain off type of movie as if you think about it logistically for too long, then the film's logic doesn't really make any sense especially in the finale. If you can suspend your disbelief for just a little bit then I think you'll have a blast. The action is really fun and engaging most of the time. It feels very creative and that's desperately needed in action films nowadays. The humor was surprisingly really funny. There were multiple points in the film where I found myself laughing which I don't really do a lot. Part of it might be potential bias though because every Thomas & Friends joke they made, which was a lot, got a laugh out of me. All of the performances are pretty good and the characters that get that are allowed time to shine are really fun. Lemon and Tangerine are easily the best part of the film. Their dynamic is a lot of fun and Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry's performances and charisma were great. The film can feel a little bloated though character wise. Some people are in there really just to say ""Hey look it's this actor/singer you recognize"" instead of actually having an interesting fleshed out character. The pacing of this film is awkward a lot of the time. The film really does feel like a Bullet Train as it speeds through every plot point with sometimes not enough time to just slow down for a minute to let the audience catch their breath. This shows at the end because for the last 15 minutes, the film definitely starts to feel a little too long. As I mentioned earlier, if you think about the story for longer than 10 seconds, it doesn't make a lot of sense. There are seriously no cameras on this train, The White Death really banked on everyone showing up to this thing and got extremely lucky that everyone did, why would the White Death trust a random person he's never met before with the briefcase without checking if there's an explosive or not. Like I said, if you turn your brain off then you can have a good time but I definitely did take the story into account. If you want a fun action movie to just sit back and enjoy then I would definitely recommend checking this out.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Almost as a point of pride, Lemon states that everything he learned came from watching Thomas the Tank Engine, going so far as to compare everyone he meets to various characters from the show, and even keeping a sticker book of characters to illustrate his point. In the middle of the insanity that is Bullet Train, Lemon mentions that Thomas says ""simple is always better,"" almost as if writer Zak Olkewicz (adapting the novel ""Maria Beetle"" from K√¥tar√¥ Isaka) is poking fun at how convoluted and wild this film is going to get. While Thomas might be right most of the time, it's the ridiculousness and twisty nature of Bullet Train that makes this film such a wild ride. In Bullet Train, Brad Pitt plays Ladybug, an assassin coming back to the job, despite being worried about his bad luck. His handler Maria Beetle (Sandra Bullock) assigns Ladybug with collecting a briefcase from a bullet train going from Tokyo to Kyoto. Of course, Ladybug's return mission isn't as easy as it sounds, as the train is packed with other assassins, each with their own missions and targets. Lemon and Tangerine are trying to take the aforementioned suitcase to the organized crime leader The White Death (Michael Shannon), while trying to protect his son, known only as The Son (Logan Lerman). Bullet Train is a film that knows how preposterous it can get and revels in that silliness. This is a film that has an origin story for a Fiji water bottle, and again, did I mention samurai Michael Shannon? Bullet Train is knowingly absurd and has plenty of fun with the wild lengths it can go, and for the most part, that keeps Bullet Train on the rails.","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

Fast forward to me now having seen it, it's quite amazing. I'm very glad I saw this one. It's funny, it's well-written, it has turns, unexpected turns, it has a cohesive plot that never once made me think, ""Would this really happen?"" or, ""What's happening? How is this related to that?"" Never, it all clicked, it all made sense. I left the theatre having been very satisfied by the ending, feeling there were zero loose ends or unanswered questions, and also feeling glad I went to see it. The action, if anything, wasn't even a highlight for me. The action was good, but the fact that it actually served the story and never felt too forced was the best part of it all.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It boasts of a formidable band of characters led by Brad Pitt, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry, whose quirks are wildly entertaining, easily the film's strongest assets. The stunts & action scenes did not disappoint either, as the creativity of the filmmakers behind Deadpool 2 was happily front & center. As for its visual appeal, the overall theme of a neon-jungle Japan and the slick design of the bullet train itself, score a magnitude of points in style, paving the way for an eye catching viewing experience reminiscent of Tarantino's films. Director David Leitch' pace & Jonathan Sela's camera work are notable as well, as they leave no dull moment through well executed & flashy flashbacks, interesting monologues & positively unexpected POVs.As for the film's downsides, the story does careen off its tracks and when it does, the ludicrousness becomes a chore to fathom. Also, the script's attempts to be witty and cute can sometimes fall flat, accounting for the film's most desperate & awkward moments (like that ending).Ultimately, Bullet Train is a film brimming with energy from its charismatic cast that oozes with chemistry, its action-packed premise & drool-worthy visual flavor. If only the storytelling was up to par, the film could've been an unforgettable. For now, happy to settle with its entertainment factor.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In fact, I think the creators of this movie are perhaps the smartest people in action right now. The whole of Phase 4 of the MCU I've been getting what I would call ""action fatigue"". Many ""action sequences"" have been lacking in creativity and style. I've found myself bored in the theater. But this movie knew how to use the set and the props to make things engaging. The characters are eccentric, sure, but they're so engaging and you can't help but love watching them bicker in the absurd situation they find themselves in. Not a single plot thread is left unresolved, and never does the movie have a dull moment. None of the talent feels wasted, although you'll certainly find yourself wanting more. This is a rare movie I will be rewatching for many years to come. Bullet Train has succeeded in building a 2 hour whirlwind of thrilling action, compelling characters, beautiful cinematography, engaging and snappy dialogue, and if that's what makes a movie ""dumb"" then Martin Scorsese can suck it.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

The relentless two-hour run time can be a bit overwhelming to watch, especially since the theater I saw it in was set to a scorching 30 degrees Celsius, but it's a good kind of exhausting.The film is very stylishly made and visually stunning. The acting is excellent, and the characters are all polished and cool, as one would expect from a movie about assassins. The train itself is also an interesting setting, and even though the film takes place in a single location, it never feels that way. The pace is so fast that it feels like you're zipping around the globe.The only downside is that the humor falls a bit flat. Many attempts at jokes failed to elicit even a smile from me. While there are some laughs scattered throughout, the hit-to-miss ratio is skewed towards the latter.Despite that, 'Bullet Train' is still a blast to watch.

"6","/10","Decent enough though it seems a little familiar","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8892328/?ref_=tt_urv","jimbo-53-186511","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26154754/?ref_=tt_urv","25 February 2023","Five assassins board a bullet train in Tokyo each seemingly with different objective. However, as events begin to unravel it soon transpires that these 5 assassins being on the train is no coincidence and somebody has big plans for them all!!!Despite the plot revolving around a bunch of assassins, Bullet Train has a sort of playful light-hearted feel about it, which, at the very least, makes for a superficially enjoyable film. I thought that Tangerine and Lemon made a good double act and I thought that Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Henry were superb in their respective roles. They reminded me a bit of Vincent and Jules from Pulp Fiction (only with cockney accents). Lemon using Thomas the tank engine characters as a means to determine a persons character was as bizarre as it sounds, but it was quite amusing.The story itself is OK, but doesn't really offer much that we haven't seen before. In fact, had this film not been based on a book I would have assumed it was made up of bits and pieces that had been left on Quentin Tarantino's cutting room floor (then again depending on when the book was written there's every chance that this could still be true). The film benefits from good performances, a light comic feel and some nice cinematography which in many ways is a good thing as the story itself lacks urgency and the climax is also a bit messy.Looking at the acting then it's fair to say that everybody does a pretty decent job (Henry, Taylor-Johnson, King, Shannon and Sanada are all on top form). Brad Pitt is arguably the star draw here, but I've noticed a slight laziness in his performances in recent years and for me he was outperformed by nearly all of the other main stars of this film.I found it to be reasonably enjoyable, but not quite as good as its current 7.3 rating suggests. It has a 'Taranito lite' feel about it which does the film a bit of a disservice if you compare it to some of Tarantino's better work. It's still worth a look though.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The Fast Blast of 2022 Action Cinema; Very Fun!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8567699/?ref_=tt_urv","Zac_La_Porte","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur132809519/?ref_=tt_urv","25 September 2022","Although 30 minutes too long, the excellent cast, bloody action, the bullet train-speeding pace and the popcorn-fun entertainment value make Bullet Train an absolute blast of an action movie. These days, there are way too many action-thrillers revolving around assassins, cops or bad guys that just fall flat and fail to properly entertain the audience and provide a substantial experience. But we also get some occasional action-comedies with the spotlight on assassins that only work out infrequently, including The Hitman's Bodyguard and this new can't-miss flick directed by David Leitch.This film has an almost-even focus each on five assassins completing their missions when they each collide on a bullet train in Japan. Coming from the director of the fantastic Deadpool 2, this movie offers a fast-paced experience on the train-tracks with extremely violent and bloody action sequences, excessive swearing, characters who by themselves are worth seeing this movie for, and of course, humour that consists of jokes every minute or two.Bullet Train is a very stylish action movie. It begins with the perfect cinematography, using lots of different colours during certain sequences and lifelike audio quality that makes you feel like you're in the moment, as well as very fast but super-smooth camerawork during the action, fights or quick moves. As said, this makes for a very entertaining and also a hilarious action-comedy, although an entire half hour could probably be cropped.And if the action, laughs, songs and music weren't enough, what's unexpectedly the best and most distinguishable part of this movie is the fun cast and each of their characters. The film's main actor is Brad Pitt who plays an assassin with a bad luck, alongside the extremely memorable actors Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry as their own duo whose chemistry together is so enjoyable, it's enough to easily make the film better than Ryan Reynolds' and Samuel L. Jackson's duo in The Hitman's Bodyguard. This all gets better as they collide with Pitt, as well as Joey King and Andrew Koji throughout the film.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie flows between jokes and slight feels and makes you bond with each character unwillingly. It's not the best written and is ridiculous but when every other movie is filled with marvel, it's a nice breathe on an action movie. I really enjoyed it, I am also a west ham fan so the renditions of forever blowing bubbles through the cinema imax speakers was something I genuinely could only compare to London stadium/Upton Park. It doesn't take itself seriously and plays on the visual and computer game esk tropes, so highly recommend for good fun. Additionally, the actor/cameo choice was perfect with some sketch Cockney accents.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

The story, however, certainly did not under-do anything about gory homicides that happen on one subway ride.Where are the police in this film? Masi Oka tried his best, but I think honestly I can say that Zazie Beetz stole part of the thunder with her performance as The Hornet. From what I saw this movie is worth a rewatch because between the naming scheme Lemon and Tangerine concocted or the explosive drama of trying to free one's captive loved ones the movie coalesced under the watchful guidance of anti-hero Brad Pitt's character 'Ladybug'.The story had enough flashbacks to tell viewers more about the characters. As to say that the plot was clear enough. I was surprised when Ryan Reynolds was in the scene. The ending, I thought wasn't completely clear. All of the characters sort of got away with their individual crimes? Despite personal vendettas vigilantism seemed to hold steady throughout the movie where characters pretty much got what they deserved. I'd look for a Bullet Train Two, but I don't think that there will be one. At least not any time soon. 7/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Once I saw the directors previous films it all made sense and I guess this is just his style, which similar to Tarantino, heavily borrows from other films.

I think my only critiques would be that it was unnecessarily bloody and didn't need that much swearing, but that's only a loss of one star in my book. The other loss of a star is just because it's not one of my favorite movies. The movie has a super interesting and unique premise, but halfway through the movie I determined this movie was just gonna be fun but meaningless (which is okay), but it ties up everything in the end with a good message. The last star knockoff is that the good message wasn't really communicated too well, but it was there and good. I do personally believe it's all about how you frame things.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The acting is excellent since Brad Pitt displayed his personality. Bryan Tyree Henry stood out and did an excellent job at pulling off a British accent. Also outstanding is the tempo. The movie's first half moves along quickly, and there are several terrific passages that utilise timing. Although the second half of the movie moves quickly as well, I think the first half is better.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

It's a mess of horrible visuals, terrible performances and mind-numbing dialogue. The Tangerine and Lemon characters represent the absolute worse of what film students think is clever - perhaps the most dislikable duo in cinematic history, whose every screen moment is an ugly stain on a strip of celluloid.

Of course, nobody expects here characters that are more than one-dimensional, but how about some funny dialogues! There is just no quality or originality to be found in this film. Ripping off Tarantino is bad enough, since Tarantino's old tricks have become boring and he himself moved on. But not knowing how to copy him and thus writing a truly prepotent script is an insult.

It's stupid. It's not even that good to look at. Ignore the zillions of 10 star user reviews (do they seem fake?) and see what the critics are saying.Or am I missing something? Maybe I'm just too old for this (55). Maybe I'm comparing it to the wrong films. Did you like Deadpool? Do you like Guy Richie? Then maybe you'll like Bullet Train. If not... please mind the gap.","32 out of 69 found this helpful.

This movie wasn't really that bad. It was just boring sometimes because again, there's nothing new in this movie. The story and the action, you've seen these in many other movies. The only notable thing from this movie was Aaron Taylor-Johnson's looks and acting. He looked really cool unlike him in Kickass movies.

I got the feeling I was watching a Quentin Tarantino flick. It has that very stylistic approach to the violence, dialogue, music
and humor. Having said that, the director, David Leitch, gives this movie a fresh style by injecting a lot of humor into the incredible action scenes. I was simultaneously gasping and cracking up. Brad Pitt is at his charming, hilarious best and ""Tangerine"" and ""Lemon"" could have their own series. I'm a huge Sandra Bullock fan and wish she had more screen time. I love her and Brad Pitt's chemistry and have always felt that she is the female Brad Pitt and he the male Sandra Bullock. They both have that charismatic yet self deprecating manner.(and self deprecating is hard to pull off when you're that gorgeous) This flick was an exhilarating escapist thrill ride that left me wanting more.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The problem is that is all feels very forced, contrived. The ""cool"" dialogue, the nonchalant acting of stereotypes (hey, we even have a Bri-ish duo with a 'funny' fixation on Thomas the Tank Engine). The over stylized violence....
It can only work if if it's countered by something real. When things and people are at stake that we can relate to, care about.It's actually quite boring to watch. It's also just not funny or smart, if that is what the movie tries to be. If no character takes him- or herself seriously, if everything feels like carton, if there are no true emotions and relatable backstories... Then why should I care?I don't understand the positive reviews here.","25 out of 54 found this helpful.

Zany characters, rapid-fire scene changes, goofy conversations, and a lead protagonist who is very good at what he does, but can't believe that he's been surrounded by this many crazed killers.It was amazing how it all comes together. Every so often, something like ""35 minutes ago"" appears on the screen, and a flashback shows how the thing you just saw came together. The near absence of loose ends in such a grand, comic action film is extraordinary, and leaves you awestruck that someone had such a grand vision to bring it all together.Henry and Taylor-Johnson are spectacular; they are reminiscent of Kidd and Wint in Diamonds are Forever, if Tarantino had written their lines. You were just waiting for them to talk about ""Royales with cheese."" Ditto for Joey King who does wonders with a multi-layered role.Finally, I loved Brad Pitt; he's a bit of a Southern Californian John McClane (who happens to be an assassin).We saw Bullet Train in a theater with (I think) 4 others. Only our second movie in a theater in the past couple of years. Seeing it on a big screen may have added to me giving the movie a 10.But I really did have a great time!","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

It's nonsensical because I hardly knew what was happening; I'm still unsure.The film has a few well-choreographed fight scenes and occasionally mildly amusing one-liners, but I wouldn't bother trying to connect the dots or fathom who is who and what is going on. The characters are unendearing, the script is pretty lame, and the usual CGI explosions are as predictable as they are boring.I'm surprised Brad Pitt took on this role; it's the worst film I've seen him in, and I've seen most of his films.

Excessive use of montages & flashbacks instead of character development. The writing made me think of what used to be considered B movies, but they had A list actors, some of which only had cameos & no lines. I have no problem suspending belief for fantasy films, but when everyone is getting stabbed or shot & continuing to fight on, or needing to be hit in the face more than once with a fire extinguisher, or holding onto a bullet train from the outside, or punching through the glass of a bullet train windshield, or we're shooting guns all over a train in Japan which suddenly becomes vacant of workers & passengers, it's more of a crap adventure film than a fantasy B movie.I'd prefer my 2 hours back than the few chuckles it provided. I never write reviews, but this was so bad, & was trending #1 on Netflix (because it was a straight to Netflix production) that I had to attempt to warn others. For a film supposedly being shot in Japan, very few of the leads were even Japanese. Sometimes there would be subtitles, other times they would just say ""announcement in Japanese"" or ""speaking in Japanese.""Not enough high spots to make up for the consistently terrible writing. Oh, we're in the quiet car? Well either you make it a running joke or you have no continuity of the old white lady shushing them! Did we really need a video montage of the life of the water bottle? I'm just surprised they didn't take us through its previous life when it had to be recycled to get to this point.I've taken dumps with better consistency. If this film wasn't consistently bad, it would have no consistency to speak of.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

It tries to be a 90's movie, a Tarantino movie. Kind of a Kill Bill for the 2020's. The thing is, Tarantino can make movies that are really over the top, but serious all a the same time. He can make us feel for the characters, add drama, even if it's all surrounded by surreal unbelievable events or even kinda silly dialogue.But that's Tarantino's gift, and he's basically the only one who can do it well, even to this day (we're way past the 90's). These guys are trying to do that, but they don't have the skills, or confidence, so they do a lot of bad jokes, lots of CGI, and turn a story that started out as interesting into a big dumb mess. Two thirds in, it starts hitting you: this is gonna get really really stupid isn't it? And boy does it, and quickly. For the last 20 minutes or so, you just want it to end...It's too bad really, cause at it's core the story idea was at least original. And all these actors, all those cameos: wasted. This thing isn't any better than say ""Red Notice"". ""Hey let's not take ourselves seriously, that way they can't dump on us"". Seems to be the usual attitude nowadays.","15 out of 30 found this helpful.

Woo Wee! 9:00 PM, Central, at the Cinemark, former home of Front Row Joe. Somebody burned some popcorn so I had to tell the young cutie slinging snacks a Mitch Hedberg joke about Hot Tubs. Why? Seemed appropriate. The joke? Oh! Sorry! It goes like this: ""Hey, have you ever walked up to somebody in a hot tub and asked if you can join them?"" ""When they said yes, did you start chopping up carrots and celery and tossing it in the hot tub and ask them how they were stewing,"" Or some variation? Pretty funny. Anywho, the film...Bullet Train (2022) was a stone cold gas of a summer flick! Lots of action, never a boring minute to witness. The XD theatre was huge with lots of recliner seats; all faux leather bound and comfy. The screen was gigantic, and the sound system? Better than any I've ever witnessed! The Icee was cherry & Coke, and the Reese's Pieces were crunchy and fresh. I was fortunate enough to lease the far left, rear spot, which is my favorite. So, all of the precursors were there for a perfect film to be seen. I had so much fun with Ladybug's self absorbed karmic evaluations and the random happenings within the plot that I probably over enjoyed the summer flick that deserves a watch on the big screen and not to be overthought. I also was really happy to see Channing Tatum in his brief comic relief. If I tell you anything about the actual movie, it would keep you from going to the theatre to see it for yourself, so I do not want to be that guy. The ticket for my premium opening night spot was $17. 59 plus it was about $10 for the Icee (Slur-Pee) and Pieces. So, was Bullet Train worth almost $30 USD--Americano or not? My answer is, YES! It was like a cross between Spy Hunter the 1983 Atari 2600 video game, with happy James Bond's and Mahayana Buddhism seeking John Wick's, that somehow look like Brad Pitt. So, I guess you could say Brad Pitt was the S--t, in this Japanese train ride. Real Fun! 10/10 P. S. If you run across a poisonous snake, anybody that looks like the owner of Mint Mobile/Deadpool, or a water bottle...ever...in the rest of your life.... Just walk away.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I had no idea what the movie was about, except that it starred Brad Pitt. I had no expectations, but was so pleasantly surprised by how much I loved this movie. It actually delighted me and filled me with joy.The acting is wonderful, I enjoyed the dialog, and laughed at the jokes and gasped out loud at some of the violence. There is something for everyone.I always stay for the credits and you should too. Some surprises thrown in. However, reading some of the user reviews, I actually missed some of the cameos.I definitely plan to see it again.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Prad Pitt's character, Ladybug, is what you'd get if John Wick and Beatrix Kiddo had a child. And the direction is something along the lines of a Tarantino film, with it's intriguing story and slapstick violence. What else do I need to say without giving away too much that it's an amazing movie!The cinematography is phenomenal, yes, the CGI can get a bit out of hands on some scenes, but the purpose of a movie is to enjoy it right? And I really effing enjoyed this movie.The action is really fun and intriguing, you feel on the edge of your seat on every scene. Brad Pitt really spices up the action too, being comedic and badass at the same time. Brad Pitt and Sandra Bullock's acting really stands out here, not to say the others are not great also. But my only complaint is that Joey King (kissing booth) acting is awful in this movie, every scene I cringed at her wacky, cliche, dialogue and acting. But the rest of the movie really outshined this awful actor.Overall, I really recommend it, but remember to bring earplugs, it's a loud, fast ride.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

And in between there's lots of forced comedy, mayhem, lots of blood spraying everywhere, lots of gunshots, lots of people getting their heads chopped off, lots of John Wick style choreographed fights, there's lots of vomit shooting out of every hole. There's an abundance of profanity and gore for cheap shock value to compensate for the weak script.Within the first 10 minutes, I was already tired of the trifling snarky banter between characters attempting their best shot at comedy. Blatant Tarantino ripoff. Brad Pitt's performance is lazy, uninspired and bored. The movie itself has zero character development, zero suspense, zero class and artistic expression. A nonsensical, convoluted plot offering no reason to continue watching beyond 30 minutes. If you're the kind who enjoys Deadpool style juvenile humor, then you might enjoy it.This is a movie with not one original bone in its body. Everything you see in this movie has been done a million times better. The comedy is SHOVED down your throat over and over again. Everything is just forced, there's no natural progression or rhythm.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

There was nothing funny about this film, it was and is a total disaster sorts like Hurricane Ian currently hitting the West Coast of Florida. This movie was lets throw something on the screen and make a few bucks. It has no rhyme or reason, it's not funny, it's rather stupid on all fronts. What saves this train wreck from total disaster is the ending credits, and even they were slow.

The second hour takes more of a thriller approach but not too much for someone to get scared. It keeps you wondering what happens next.

Maybe it's my low expectations but this was absolutely phenomenal! Honestly a top 3 film I saw so far this year and maybe a new favorite of mine! I can't really find anything wrong, I'm not kidding. The Carver cameo, the holding out for a hero, all the little details are so good! It's ironic that this movie doesn't take its plot seriously, and a lot of people say it's not good. But because this movie knows what it is and embraces it the plot is amazing. It's a dumb plot but since the movie knows that it doesn't feel like a problem, especially compared to other movies of similar style. Several other movies have generic, even dumb plots that it feels the audience needs to take seriously, and maybe it still works but not as well. This movie has a dumb plot and knows it, saving more time for the good stuff, and ironically making its plot feel much better than some similar movies. It also handles character death so well, like this movie has STAKES. The jokes were all really solid, the action was surprisingly phenomenal, I wasn't expecting much with the characters but I was very pleasantly surprised when so many were so good and so many fantastic moments. The plot was a little confusing for most of it but everything was revealed in one scene, and it didn't feel wrong because of how intentionally dumb this movie is. I don't mind scenes like that anyway, at least when done right. Minority Report and the Knives Out movies do a great job of having a character explain the villains plot to the villain in a really petty yet epic way. This movie has the villain explain their plot, but it gives us answers and again, this movie knows it's dumb so I don't mind. Overall I really don't have any reason not to give this a 10/10, everything was done so well. Definitely really underrated and worth your time, if nothing else it is PERFECT airplane movie (but it's still perfect anyway)","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Brad Pitt scores (and kills) his role in here as a goofball-of-an-assasin. While funny at the behest of its rigid humour at certain sequences, it lacks a few methodical (and logical physics) approaches but nonetheless it's a film with a combustion of gunpowder, blades and poisonous venom, and quite frankly that's all you action loving movie-goers need to know. I wholly recommend this movie if you guys love a film that gathers its inspirations from Tarantino-esque flicks and Edgar Wright-styled filmographic work. It's a truly an enjoyable experience to see this fascinating, hilarious and altogether bloody film.

What he doesn't know is that there are another thiefs and hired killers that would perform actions in that train too.It is very funny how they interact between each other, and there are hillarious moments.I recomend watching it, with the family, friends,...
Although I don't like anime aesthetics so much, I have to admit that it is the perfect scenery for this movie and it contributes to the development of the story, because the bullet train goes from Tokio to Morioka.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I loved every characters, very good characterizations everybody was so suitable for the role. I am fan of lemon and tangerine but I don't wanna give a spoiler... and I hope to see 2nd part ( or more ) of that. This film gave every kind of action in very limited place also ladybug character was so deep about life, it was good.

I feel pity about the development of the characters of the story. The dialogue as if seemed funny by many but ridiculous. The gore was good, and the slash scenes seem brutal, but fall flat like initiated under 10 years old children homemade like for fun action sequences.Nothing serious here. If you're a fan of John Wick type of brutal actions, well, this flick is not for you. You will only disappointed like hell.I tried myself somehow to finish the movie, but I couldn't, I feel like cheated to my expectations that didn't meet. I missed Brad's previous movies like World War Z, Troy, Ocean's Twelve, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and among others, but this one?

"8","/10","A Bullet To Kill Normalcy, This Is A Train To Wild Fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8405330/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","6 August 2022","LIKES:The Pacing (Mostly): It takes about a half an hour for the movie to find its stride, but once it does the pace is surprisingly spread well to remain entertaining. The speed like the train is fast, and yet, there is still enough time to explain and put together all the moving pieces that are in this complex Thriller puzzle. By the end you'll be caught in the ride, though you might also be ready for the movie to be over too depending on how much of the other antics you are enjoying. Nonetheless, a nice job on a very tight and time consuming pace.The Music Use: Loved the music in this film. Like Deadpool, the director and his team drum up some great talent to pull covers, mixes, and original tracks to the movie. They selected the songs very well, the emotions making half of these odd relationships sparkle and pop as they pulled more surprises into the mix. And in terms of being humorous, again Leitch really makes the right choices for fun and friends. Nice work there guys.The Acting: Like the premise of Deadpool, the cast of this speeding train are a hoot to watch. Almost everyone is a fun caricature and ridiculous character to latch onto in this coliseum of chaos. Each person has their own edge, comedy style, and gimmick that work well together to entertain the masses. Taylor-Johnson is not one of my favorite characters, but his rude, crude, and brash style is like the dark comedy character that many love. He's sarcastic and a bit of a jerk, but he works very well with the other characters that it balances out and has an offset to keep it entertaining. Joey King was super impressive, another example of an actress that can play a lot of roles with her range and do it so well. Her character requires a lot of acting, and there is even a set of jokes about how good her acting was. She impressed me so much, and though not my favorite role she has played, it was phenomenal to see how she could pull so many emotions and styles into one role. As for Pitt, the dude is funny. If you've seen the Lost City movie, it's this role, but essentially smarter and more competent and it works well. His interactions with everyone are dynamic and fun, he delivers his roles with little trouble, and he somehow maximizes every scene he is in with his style of range. I really enjoyed him in this role and what the writing team did with this character to make the central focal point engage me so well.The Effects: Mind blowing? No, but the movie looks good and has the unique flare and style the trailers promised. Like a Japanese comic book exploding into the real life, this is a movie that handles source material well and does not feel like a stretch of a beloved series. Flash lights, trippy car moments, horrifying build ups of each characters, and the flare of the country are all brilliantly displayed on the big screen. Once the more effects loaded moments happen, that's when the effects get a little more ""realistic"", but they are smooth and worthy of a video game matching theme. Much like Deadpool, the visualization really works with this movie. Even the sound editing is a champion in this, lighting up the theater with the zany, goofy, overbearing sounds that a Japanese centered tale blows up. Quite awesome indeed.The Action At The End: When the ending sequence finally starts, the action the trailer promised really kicks in and the theme of the movie takes a different turn. Bullet Train's final fight is funny, intense, and has a lot of stakes and consequences with it. Bad guys and sort of bad guys all fight their own battle, and it leads to mirroring the ludicrous combat that one finds in a video game motion. This was a fantastic cherry on top, and was the climactic finale that was fun to wrap things up in, if a little too late to occur at the end.The Comedy: This is a movie that has a lot, and I mean a lot, of dark comedy styles coming together. It's a bit dryer than your typical stoner comedy movie, relying on banter, insults, and babbling about the most random things to get you to laugh at first. Soon, the movie gets into the more slapstick, clumsy fights where the dialogue and reactions are so dumb, but yet are cleverly used to narrate the fight. And then, it goes into the aftermath and banter with the person, alongside some movie reference jokes that help add a little more polish to the weird, shadowy humor. If you can handle this awkward and dangerous style of comedy, then this is the movie for you to enjoy and feast your eyes on.The Overall Tie In Of Tales: My favorite component of this film. Bullet Train's biggest advantage for me was the story and character use in this film. There are a lot of characters in this movie, and every person has this odd integration into the film to make this complicated thriller story work. Why all these people were on the train gradually comes out and the histories of the characters with them as the big picture is revealed with each act. The twists that came in are subtle at times and when you revisit the scene, you get to see the connections you might have missed. And then all the layers neatly stack up and organize to eventually give you a more dynamic way of telling the story. However, the tie in to the tales was very well panned and the impressive part of the thriller, which a lot of the movie built off of.DISLIKES:Some Characters Kind Of Not Needed: I won't lie, several of the characters, are a bit of a stretch for their inclusion. They serve little purpose and are a bit of the hasty work sewn in for another character and potential fight. Sure, comedy wise, it worked, but there were two characters whose purpose were a bit shoe horned in.Effects Get A Bit Cheesy: The movie eventually goes to the level where the effects get a little fake. I can't' say much without ruining the plot, but there are times the limit of technology still has not been breached and the realm of CGI still looks fake. Did I hate it? No, but given the style of the movie during other parts, I would have liked to avoid the ending's theatrics and keep to the flare instead of the messy CGI..Back And Forth A Little Tedious: The plot was complex, and the twists were welcome as it added originality and style to the mix of the movie. Sometimes though, the back and forth gets a little excessive at times and did not quite feel like the right place to put it in the movie. Most of these had to do with the characters mentioned earlier that were not needed. Continuing to revisit these scenes over and over eventually added more bulk to the mix and for me, sort of dragged out the movie when the other parts were more pertinent. This back and forth did work, but like many movies took a little too much liberty and overdid it for me, which in itself was a dislike for me.The Action Not What Trailers Suggested: The biggest disappointment for me, was the action of the movie. Most of the fight scenes are more comedic than actually intense. Several of the fights have most of the choreography in the trailers, leading to unfortunately not the best use of time. I'd have liked a little more of the anime style action and investment in the other character fights that I had expected from my synopsis of the film going in. As an action movie, much of the film is meh for me, but the ending helps lift a lot of the load and I had wished that had been the story that worked out. Again, I'm an action junkie so that has everything with the high standard, but adding that flare at the end would have been a nice consistency to have throughout the movie.The VERDICT:
Bullet Train is a dark comedy with thrilling elements that work so well with the style of Leitch's madness that we fell in love with during the Deadpool phase. It's campy, it's fun, and it's sinister, all working together to be this off the wall and in your face comedy that many will enjoy. It is a bit in your face, a little dry, and cheesy to a major extent, but in the world of anime feeling fun and style, it works so well. However, the movie is a bit cheesy in many levels, character balance is not perfectly balanced, and the action could have used a little bit of touching up to be more combat and less laughs. And those who don't like blood, gore, cursing, and ridiculous antics, then this movie is not for you and you need to avoid this movie at all costs. Yet, if you are looking for a little spice in the Hollywood venue and you can enjoy a very chaotic comedy with lots of style, then this movie has plenty of things to view in the theater. My scores for all this are:Comedy/Action/Thriller: 7.5
Movie Overall: 7.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Just loved it from start to finish, great engaging plot line, great and hilarious actors, great fight scenes! Maybe I enjoyed it so much because I didn't expect much from it, maybe it's because I'm a huge Tarantino fan? (Yes it's very very Tarantino-esqe) or maybe it really was just that good! The characters were really varied and plentiful.... Pitt is always a pretty solid bet when casted, he thrives on these action comedy roles! The plot was just smart enough without trying to be too clever and difficult to follow and even the main protagonist wasn't silly overpowered and inhuman! A few little twists are thrown in for good measure and most importantly for myself there's no dull ""filler"" scenes where the movie try's to appeal to the Academy for 5mins with no real point! Highly recommend this film.....","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

His therapist (never seen) is giving him a positive worldview to counter his self admitted terrible run of bad luck. He is undoubtedly the NICEST criminal you are ever likely to meet. He is however a criminal albeit attempting to be a non-violent one... something that he fails at miserably entirely at no fault of his own. The inexplicable twins (you'll see why) are also strangely likeable since they seem to have a code of keeping civilians out of their very violent trade craft. Lemon uses Thomas the Tank Engine as his metaphor for life and people, which he takes utterly seriously and with surprising success in seeing through surface appearance. Add a Yakusa father and son to flesh out the ""good""-ish criminals and four very bad people (plus assorted henchmen) and you have the players. Stick them all in a train going 200mph and stopping for EXACTLY one minute per station, and that is the setting. BT has some of the best most crisp editing I've ever seen. You are bombarded by apparently trivial details which later take on importance. The dialogue is witty and intelligent interspersed with flashbacks that take you off the train and fill in each character's back story in viginettes. You can actually feel some sympathy even for some of the assassins who aren't just completely one-dimensional villains (except possibly the Hornet who has pretty much no redeeming features). In any case, beginning to end you have intense visual images moving along the plot as each character's story is told then connected back to the present. So much detail, that after the adrenaline rush of the first viewing, wait a while then watch it again on Netflix for details you missed. This is the kind of movie you can watch multiple times and still enjoy because you can get into the richness of detail.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

We've seen this before - over and over again in Ritchie / Tarantino - endless action scenes where multiple people are beaten viciously and killed and yet everyone appears making jokes totally normally, and in a great mood, etc.The director wants us, the desensitized, to feel sorrow at the characters' loses... He wants to shock us with violence and then make us laugh at the absurdity of the whole thing - but does that deserve our attention for over 2 hours? I'd rather watch stand up for five minutes than endure another bloodbath.There is almost nothing human about this movie from start to finish. Nothing. You feel emptier and emptier as if goes on.

Cartoon violence, a total lack of originality, lack of humour and lack of interest.A film in Japan, full of Westerners on a bullet train, full of dull characters and hackneyed dialogue, a snake and James Bond level impossible stunts.There's an attempt to reel you in with flashbacks about hateful characters that you've seen before in plenty of gangster films based in London or LA, transferred to a train. If this hadn't been done with with much more style and humour multiple times in the last thirty years it might have been with a watch.Awful.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

The visuals alone are one reason to see this movie, and I typically prefer outdoor filmography but they managed to make these striking. The cast is great with the exception of the russian daughter. She did well, I just find that actor rather annoying in the face. Can't get past it for some reason. Lemon and Tangerine are absolutely hilarious and sweet. Their bickering and Ladybugs commentary is great. Overall this movie is perfect as a goofy action comedy, my only complaint was the very brief sex scene at the beginning.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I honestly don't understand why the critics are hating on it on Rotten Tomatoes. It is exactly what the trailer had promised it to be, an over-the-top crazy fun ride, with tons of Kill Bill & Jon Wick level action, with Hobbs & Shaw level humor.The story is about 5 assassins aboard a fast moving bullet train in Japan, who find out that their missions have something in common. And then begins the comedy of errors.The movie is basically told through the POV of an unlucky assassin called Ladybug played by Brad Pitt. He is just having a blast in this movie. He has let himself loose and the result is this funny charming performance that just phenomenally clicks.But this is not just a Brad Pitt movie. It is a multi-starrer that also has him in it. Everyone in this movie is great and are just having a blast. And that comes across to us audience so we also end up having a good time.My absolute favorites were the pair of ""twins"" assassins played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry. Their back-and-forth banter cracked me throughout the movie. I need a prequel to this movie with just their previous assassin jobs. I think that would be a great movie to watch.The dialogues in this movie are witty and fast paced. If you pay attention then you will be rewarded with a whole bunch of laughs. But there is also an equal amount of bloody gore action fight scene in it. If you can't handle blood onscreen then this one might not be for you.Overall I had a blast watching this movie and was so glad that I got on board. With the runtime of two hours the movie never overstays its welcome. There are some convenient plot-lines in the movie, and the VFX are not always on point, but you can easily forgive these shortcomings, because the journey in itself is so much fun.P. S. - The movie has a mid-credit scene.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Coyld have knocked off half an hour, and the film would have been all the better. Then, once again, mandatory ""surprising"" ending and people returning from the dead. And so very, very loud.

The film does an exceptional job at delivering a compelling and engaging story as well as finding a way to create a connection to almost all characters, to a point where I found myself rooting for almost all. There's depth to it. Also, the scenes where characters go into flashbacks, these gave me a Guy Ritchie vibe, and since I am a huge Guy Ritchie fan, that was a plus for me. Amazing performances (Brad Pitt's character promoting this ""zen vibe"" was a breath of fresh air!) and great cast overall. This is such an entertaining movie to watch, that I do consider it one of the best films of 2022.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

If you have never watched a Guy Ritchy movie, this might come as a novelty to you, but I suggest you go to the sources (Lock, stock, and two smoking barrels & Snatch) which are ten times better written, acted and directed.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

I am still laughing as I write this. Brad Pitt is like your Hippy Assassin that doesn't like guns and he himself says it that he acts like and does things like McGiver. The movie of course starts off on a high speed bullet train. We need to first figure out who is who which is confusing because everyone on that train has there own agenda. At first it is so confusing but as the moving goes along it becomes so clear who is killing who and then at the end you finally find out what this insanity is all about. Brad Pitt is amazing! His performance was excellent and I couldn't pick anyone else for this role but him. I would like to see a Bullet Train 2 and a 3, or even a Bullet Plane with Brad Pitt ASAP!!!! Before he gets too old. The Simpsons will have fun with him on a Super Heavy and call it a Bullet Heavy, or Super Bullet.

Just to turn on a movie and turn off your brain. Unfortunately, most modern movie that are at least somehow related to such words, in fact, do not provide the necessary relaxation. They either try to overload the viewer with unnecessary elements, or are simply made very poorly. But it's extremely rare to see high-quality action movie which is actually fun. But this film is the rare case of success.This film has everything you need for an action comedy. You are simply immersed in the events. Yes, the film is essentially a collection of clich√©s. Yes, the authors took a lot of stuff from Tarantino, Ritchie, Vaughn, Carnahan. But is it really bad when it works perfectly? Cool action, good humor, a riot of colors, cool fights, great characters, awesome music (I was just blown away by the Japanese version of Bonnie Tyler's eternal hit). At the same time, the film does not slow down, but constantly invents new things that continue to keep the viewer watching.There is no complex plot here, there is a skeleton of a story on which characters are planted, which we can be easily explained in a couple of sentences. Is this bad? In this case, no. We're just interested in watching them. The actors are wonderful. Brad Pitt has been killing it in his films lately. And this can be seen on the screen. It is impossible to take your eyes off his character.Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry create a gorgeous duo that is as inherently stupid as it is beautiful. Small roles by other famous actors also bring a smile. There are some nice cameos.This movie does everything to please the viewer, and does it right. If you want to relax with cool action with incredibly bright visuals, good humor, cool characters and driving music, then I advise you not to miss this film. Have a lot of fun.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The movie's second half is the greatest since it amps up the excitement and passion.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The writing on this movie is A+. The movie is overall really funny and has a good paceThe soundtrack is not particularly exeptional but the music kicks in when it has to and gives a good rythm to the action scenes.As said in the title, this movie first gave me big ""Rush Hour"" vibes, then it swiches to a more murder mystery theme like in ""Murder on the Orient Express"" to finally end on a tragic/action loaded movie like ""John Wick"". All this is mixed together with a gallon of comedy, a cup of action and a pinch of drama.The only thing that I could blame is the ending, which is not very realistic (I mean not realistic like in ""James Bond"", not like ""The Chronicles of Narnia"").","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Action sequences were done and handled better then what I was expecting. The acting is really good as Brad Pitt brought his charisma on display. It was Bryan Tyree Henry who was the standout and killed it by pulling off a British Accent. The pacing is also phenomenal. The first half of the film moves very fast and there's great scenes to do with timing involved. The second half of the film also moves fast but I'd have to say the first half is more enjoyable. I do like some of the character writing although some of it was missing for important characters. The story is very forgettable and inconsistent with it's writing but the characters and humor in it keep the movie going. I noticed a lot of cheap writing as well. There's also tons of exposition and scenes that weren't needed whatsoever because they have nothing to do with the main plot of this film. There's also moments in the film that would never happen and very dumb. There's also a plot hole with a specific character but I saw it happened on purpose since the actor playing it was absolute fan service. Again, it's very entertaining and enjoyable. I only watched it for Brad Pitt and he did not DISSAPOINT because he never does.Letter Grade: C+","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals.Pitt's earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma & Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This led to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) & Cool World (1992).","14 out of 29 found this helpful.

I am a big fan of kung fu movies, constantly have Bruce Lee in the background, and while this might technically not be a kung fu movie, it captures the spirit of them. Definitely also has some Guy Ritchie inspiration to it. Some people are saying Tarantino but I dont see that at all. Not even close to a similar tone to Tarantino. I guess because its an ensemble of assassins in Asia and kung fu inspired? Seems to be really weird nitpicking to make that off link, or to call this movie derivative instead of inspired. Its definitely its own brand new thing in many ways.It felt like an exciting action comic book to me. Every actor is happy to be there and putting their all into these extremO assassin caricatures. Its good to see Brad Pitt have real fun like this and try again, he even does the old Tyler Durden happy dance at one point. Joey King is also one of my favorites from many so bad they're good type movies. This one is actually good so that's fun. Lemon is very fun. A train setting is extremely fun. Some fun twists and surprise cameos. For me specifically it felt like they just rounded up all my favorite movie ingredients in a blender to make a perfect movie smoothie. This movie has it all and keeps it moving like a bullet train, will definitely be rewatched by me several times for many years as its just a very pleasant stylistic environment. If you cant have fun with this movie I hope whatever is troubling you gets better for you and you find some better fate and/or luck soon.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

And honestly... I thought it was awesome! Like let me be clear, it's nothing crazy, it's no ""Top Gun: Maverick"" or ""Everything Everywhere"", but it was lots of fun! I just had such a good time watching it that I didn't even mind that it's not a great technical film. Sure, it may not be the strongest story, or have the best characters, but damn if it isn't entertaining! I legitimately had a good time, and thought it was a fun thrill ride to wrap up the summer movie season!This is easily David Leitch's best film since ""Deadpool 2"", and may even be his best! It's leagues better than ""Atomic Blonde"" and ""Hobbs and Shaw"" for sure, and feels almost like a wannabe Guy Ritchie flick (which works)! The movie is best described in my opinion as ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" meets ""Kill Bill"", and I loved the tone and feel it went for! The action was killer, the humour was hilarious, everything just worked perfectly for me! Again, this is not cinematic perfection, but for a summer blockbuster, it's fun as hell. This movie really is a thrill ride! It has so many crazy twists and turns, and cleverly plays with the idea of Chekhov's Gun, weaving all the satires together in a fun manner! The film has such witty dialogue and uses non-linear storytelling and flashbacks excellently. I absolutely loved it in the first hour and 30 mins, but unfortunately the last act brought the pace of the movie to a halt. Personally I thought it could have ended without everything in the finale, but I still had a good time with it because of the awesome characters!The characterization in this film is really strong, characters are all unique and memorable in their own ways. I loved Ladybug, and thought Brad Pitt nailed the performance! I'm loving this chill action hero phase that Brad Pitt is in. The contradiction between his character's pacifist personality and his violent career was hilarious and played into the plot in such fun ways. He had some awesome action scenes and great comedic moments. I would love to see a sequel to this movie like how ""Knives Out"" is doing; bringing the lead character to a new set of characters each time. I just loved Pitt and his character so much, I would love to see more! And while Pitt is awesome, it was the twins played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry that absolutely stole the movie! They had some of the best scenes, some of the best jokes, and had the greatest chemistry. I just loved them so much, especially the long running Thomas the Tank Engine joke! All the jokes in this movie hit, it's a great action comedy, and there are even some awesome surprise cameos! The action is great; every scene is edited, filmed and staged in such a way that makes it feel entertaining, stylish and so fresh. I loved the way they would make use of objects in the environment and the lighting was great too! Can't say the same about the CGI, it was a letdown but that's a minor thing for me.This movie was so much fun, a perfect way to end the summer blockbuster season! I'd highly recommend it, and would love to see more from this universe. While it's not perfect by any means, I had such a good time with it, laughed a lot, enjoyed the great action, and vibed with the epic soundtrack. So it's a thumbs up from me for ""Bullet Train"", a high speed thrill ride of a movie!","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

If one were to take it seriously and try to analyze the specific details, he would sound nuts. There is nothing the least bit realistic about this film. First of all, we have Brad Pitt who is having a great time through the whole thing. I love his wanting to get in touch with his feelings while he works as a paid assassin, or at best, a criminal. He has been in therapy and spouts things that have been told to him by his therapist. He even offers the worst guy in the film the title of a book on getting in touch with your emotions. There is a passel of fun characters all steeped in blood and guts. The brothers, Lemon and Tangerine are hilarious. They are deadly and ruthless and have no respect for the lives of their victims. Lemon runs his life on characters from Thomas the Tank Engine. An entire ethos is developed around a horror on earth, the most dangerous man in the world. Ultimately, go see this and let it happen. It is funny. It is outrageous.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"9","/10","5 assassins, a briefcase and a mysteriously deadly figure all in one train? ALL ABOARD!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8405397/?ref_=tt_urv","terrellrobinson71","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22782552/?ref_=tt_urv","6 August 2022","Luck. Fate. Karma. Destiny. That's all in the wildly creative center of ""Bullet Train"". It's also a movie about betrayal, corruption, misunderstandings, power and revenge. For an action movie laced with dark humor that involves a large group of immoral characters dealing with those morals that we hold so dear in our hearts, that seems like high praise. And it does. Here is a movie that is so rambunctious and off-the-rails (if you'll pardon the pun), it actually takes its sweet time of getting to know these characters while putting them in the middle of all the chaotic madness. And then, just when you think you have it all figured out, it doubles down on itself and surprises you with as many cards revealed to us in unexpected ways. Plus, the brutally violent action sequences that involves all the characters are ingeniously inventive. In the middle of all of this is Ladybug, as played by the always phenomenal Brad Pitt, an assassin who always believes he has incredibly bad luck but ironically survives. After a extended bout of ""keeping calm and carry on"", he's called back to work by his handler Maria (the voice of Sandra Bullock) to pull off one big (but very simple) assignment: Aboard Japan's bullet train, steal a briefcase and get out. But everytime Ladybug tries to get off, he unfortunately keeps getting up in the business of other assassins. There's ""The Twins"", Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry) carrying alongside ""The Son"" (Logan Lerman), who is the son (duh!) of mysterious figure known as ""The White Death"". Then there's The Prince (Joey King), who may act and look like an innocent schoolgirl, but she is a manipulative and heartless figure that is the causer for almost all of the events in the story. Next, there's Yuichi Kimura (Andrew Koji), who is seeking revenge on the one who put his son in a coma. And lastly, the Wolf (Puerto Rican pop star Benito A Mart√≠nez Ocasio aka Bad Bunny), who wants revenge on Ladybug for a very personal reason. Who will survive? Who will fail? Who will leave the train with the suitcase? And who will avoid a meeting with ""The White Death"" when the train makes its final destinaion? ""Bullet Train"", directed by the remarkably badass Dacid Leitch of ""Atomic Blonde"", ""Deadpool 2"" and ""Hobbs & Shaw"", is a lot of fun; a movie that is so ruthlessly over-the-top and insanely hilarious, it manages to exceed every expectation you hoped for (it did for me). The faithful screenplay by Zak Olkewicz, based on the brilliant novel (originally titled ""MariaBeetle"") by Kotaro Isaka that I had the great pleasure to read last summer, is clever and incisive by managing to balance hilarious character-driven comedy by way of Guy Richie, Quentin Tarantino and The Coen Brothers with bloody high-stakes acrion that we anticipate from this genre. It's also strangely philosophical as Ladybug and other characters try to reason with one another while spilling out their ways of dealing with life and fate. (Trust me, It's all part of the story, too.) It also has some surprising cameos from actors you've never expect to see in a film of this caliber. And this cast is just perfect from top to bottom., especially Mr. Pitt whose star-power charisma hasn't had this much fun since either his extended cameo in ""The Lost City"" or his Oscar-winnnng performance in ""Once Upon A Time in Hollywood"". In fact, everybody is having fun here, even the snake, a water bottle and a popular figure known as Momomon. With ""Top Gun: Maverick"" leading the charge as my favorite movie of the summer, ""Bullet Train"" is one of the summer movies I was waiting for, and now it's one of the best movies I've seen all summer long.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I hope truly hope sincerely that they're fake, because if they are real then that means humans are getting dumber and not smarter.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

Another home run from Deadpool 2/Atomic Blonde director David Leitch, who continues to amaze us with exciting action, interesting characters and casting, and amazing pacing and writing for an action film.Brad Pitt stars as Ladybug, an assassin with an incredible bad luck streak who has come out of hiatus for a simple job back. For him, his job is to grab a briefcase off a Bullet Train in Tokyo; he manages to grab it without a hitch but the second the train pulls up to the next station, let's just say things get nasty and a bunch of other characters are thrown into the chaos.The performances from the rest of the cast are amazing. Brad Pitt does a wonderful job of playing against type as a cordial and dorky assassin that tries to comes to terms with the chaos going around with him and trying to deal with his bad luck at the same time. Joey King does good as well, playing a sociopathic kid assassin with daddy issues. The standouts however are both Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry, the former as the serious and professional Tangerine and the latter managing a really good English accent as Lemon, Tangerine's partner who bases his readings of people on Thomas the Tank Engine.The film also has an incredibly well paced and tight script that anyone writing an action film should look at. There are a ton of set ups and pay offs that would make Edgar Wright jealous (not that jealous, but still), well written action scenes and there's even a surprising amount of drama that's well timed and placed.Dominic Lewis, a protege of Remote Control Productions and Henry Jackman, does a really good job with the score, giving each character (apart from Ladybug) a motif while mixing it up every time and making every scene more exciting. The music choices for the movie are also well chosen, including a Japanese dance cover of Holding out for a Hero that's one of the best renditions of the song in a movie since Shrek 2.The visuals are amazing, the CGI is solid and well implemented for an $80 million budgeted movie and overall, it's a wonderful blast.10/10.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

With this alone, Bullet train achieved the impossible and is worth praising.Despite being about 15-20 minutes too long and oddly paced as a result, Bullet Train never stops being entertaining. I was laughing or smiling for the entirety of this wild ride.It's darkly hilarious, violent, absurd to the point of being nonsensical, and always oddly satisfying. The characters are all fascinating to watch as each of their goals and personalities are revealed over the course of the story.The unfolding mystery of the story does sometimes require irritating exposition dumps, but the tone of the movie is so funny and self-aware that I didn't mind too much.What did at times impress me was the screenplay's attention to detail with its many plot threads. They all tie in to the story's central themes of fate vs agency and it's really exciting to see them come together.But at the same time, I wish that the themes were covered more deeply. It all cant help but feel surface level by the time the movie comes to its conclusion, because every time it starts to get deep, the script goes back to treating its characters' plights like a joke.Essentially, this movie could have been fun and could have given me more to think about and to feel. It succeeds at the former, but doesn't quite succeed at the latter.Still, this is so entertaining and so charismatic and so gleefully, absurdly chaotic that I will 100% be watching this again.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

There's a lot of famous actors in this movie, how they said yes to the movie I can only imagine. I guess the script was better than the movie itself. It's a mystery to me how the ratings ever got as high on IMDb as they got, maybe there's a lot of children that found it funny and rated it.

Fight scenes that feel all too familiar, much like the rest of this exercise in style. Style being something the film has in spades, but spades do not amount to Smokin' Aces. While Aaron Taylor-Johnson effervescently chews the scenery like he is auditioning for a Guy Ritchie movie, and Brad Pitt is amusing despite his one-note character bordering on lame, the story is sluggish and bloated with lazy exposition and lukewarm action. Had director David Leitch (Deadpool 2) taken a smaller, as in less expensive, approach and embraced the fundamentals of an exploitation actioner, Bullet Train could have been a wonderfully ferocious little cult film. Unfortunately, while this one is begging so endearingly to be liked, style is no substitute for excitement.Grade: C.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

And you know what? I didn't expect to. The humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good-until the reviews arrived. After thousands of people showered this movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic.As it is, I think Bullet Train - a funny and violent movie that is decidedly one of the best movies of 2022 - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Someone still knows how to write an action movie, shoot it perfectly, and fill out the cast with amazing actors. The dialogue is smart, the pacing near perfect, and the action scenes were exquisitely shot. There wasn't a single actor who wasn't immensely interesting and, considering the rather large cast of characters, that's no easy feat. I was getting close to giving up on ever finding a simple, fun action movie considering Hollywood's ineptitude to write interesting characters and giving them smart dialogue. If smartly paced offbeat action comedies are your thing, you can't do much better.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Watching it made me realize why it went to Netflix so fast. It's storyline was almost incoherent and the character development was worthless. It could have been a much more thrilling flick if they had done it aboard an Amtrak train. At least then we could have had the added excitement of being stopped for a slow moving Freight train and maybe some road construction. My big question is why was there never a bartender in the club car? Seems like they were losing a lot of money with that move. But alas, maybe that will answer be revealed in the sequel. Can't wait for it.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's just an action movie that can almost be considered a full out comedy.It's a classic Ryan Reynolds movie without Ryan being Ryan in it.He got a 2 second part in it without opening his mouth!That's the perfect part for him.I would recommend this movie.IMBD requires more characters so here is a list of flowers:
Violets
Roses
Tulips
Lilacs

But it's not true, it did entertain me for three fourth of the movie. The last one fourth was however a bit bragged.This movie tried to copy Tarantino's formula. And it did the formula perfect as possible except it missed one thing. In all Tarantino movies, the ending was the best way possible it could have been written. The ending gave us the satisfaction. Even if pulp fiction has nothing to say, the last act (The Bonnie situation) ended with a blast in the restaurant scene.However, it seemed like the writer didn't knew how to end this movie. Thus I think it felt like the writer rushed the ending without any consideration.So, if they had took the ending into some consideration and fixed it, Bullet train might have been one of the best movies of 2022.~My rating - 8/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Since this is a retelling of an old novel and has already been done in cinema before this was just fun to watch.Brad Pitt from pretty boy to psycho drama and everything in-between this just seemed like he was having fun! The same kind of standard that he had for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Not an Oscar worthy performance but certainly one that was based on his love for the script and not the mountain of cash he was certainly paid. Same with Aaron Taylor-Johnson going from bumbling superhero to superhuman twin, to time reversing agent to a hitman that's not to be messed with just shows how far he has come from those first Kick-Ass movies. His brother in arms Brain Tyree Henry was just another great addition to the cast together they help carry this movie when Pitt isnt about!The timing and direction of the movie cannot be understated with so many one-liners coming through takes a lot of well prepared actors and crew to get them to land and Leitch has certainly taken his Deadpool 2 lessons and brought them to the forefront of the movie. Action was slick to the john wick level that we know and love from recent action movies with his stun training this add another level that not many directors are able to accomplish in this modern age where many of the downfalls are covered with jump cuts!Overall its a great film that i can happily watch again, a proper no holds bar action comedy.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

And that's an important distinction here. If the ultra-violence is fun and important to moving the story and plot along (and not just there to be gratuitous), then the movie can succeed quite well - and this one does.What also makes these types of movies succeed is the plotting - which is sharp by writer Okewicz - and the twists and turns that you do not see coming - but make sense along the way (and will reward the viewer upon repeated viewing) and Bullet Train does this as well. It is a smartly made film that is crisply directed with some terrific action sequences (though, if I'm being fair, at times the CGI is not as good as it could/should be), but it is entertaining as all get out.Leading us through this mayhem is the always charming and charismatic Pitt who parlays the ""goofball"" personae of a person in just a little over his head but comes out on top due to luck (or skill) - you be the judge. Pitt is the perfect performer for the audience to become invested in as he is the one that you need to be rooting for throughout - and you do from just about the beginning.Leitch, wisely then, surrounded Pitt with some terrific character actors in this venture. From Aaron Taylor-Johnson (KICK-ASS) to Brian Tyree Henry (GET OUT) to Joey King (THE CONJURING) to the always terrific Hiroyuki Sanada (MORTAL COMBAT) and a host of others who do extended cameos - and to name them would be to spoil the fun of them. They all understand what type of film they are in and all seem to be having a good time going along with it all.And why not? Bullet Train is a delight in the cinema - for those of you who like action and violence that is pretty spectacular and over the top. It is a heckuva lotta fun.Letter Grade: A-8 Stars (Out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The non-stop action is very comedic throughout, most of which comes from Pitt who is an assassin going through a existential crisis.Aaron Taylor-Johnson is really good as well. He's long been a favourite of mine, and he continues to prove his worth. Good casting choice for Kraven. I do have my doubts about punching through a train windshield, even with those gargantuan rings.With 'Atomic Blonde', 'Deadpool 2', and now this, David Leitch is proving to be a top Hollywood director when it comes to action genre. Let's just forget about 'Hobbs & Shaw'. His stunts and past involvement in so many big films have definitely groomed him to be the go to guy for these types of films going forward.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

His style of directing is very similar and that's for obvious reasons a good thing. It's entertaining, very fast-paced, not one second without action, some good one liners, but and in this case a big BUT it's all a tiny bit too exaggerated. That's the only reason I don't score Bullet Train higher. It had the potential to be a gem of a movie but certain scenes are just too over the top, certainly in the last part of the movie. For the rest it's a pure joy to watch, with very good camerawork, great action scenes and kills. The cast consists of top class actors so that certainly helped making this action movie a success. It won't please everybody, some people just don't like this genre, but if you're a fan of Tarantino, Ritchie or in this case Leitch you won't be disappointed.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Ladybug fills in for Carver who had to call in sick. With the guidance of Maria Beetle, Ladybug searches for a briefcase waiting for a deadly leader of a crime syndicate known as White Death. What he does not know is that other assassins are on the board looking for the same briefcase. He wants to complete his mission with as little violence as possible. The task does not go the way he would like...Action is my favorite genre of film. I am a fan David Leitch's work. He directed the first John Wick, Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2. There is no doubt that I was going to see this movie. Bullet Train has a lot going for it. First of all, it has a great setup for an action thriller as a group of assassins boarding the same bullet train. Sounds like a lot of danger already right? This movie not only takes advantage of that premise, but also the setting itself, the train. Here, there are a few different rooms that the characters travel through. For example, is one room where the characters must remain quiet. Despite that, there is a fight that breaks out and the two assassins cannot scream when they hit each other. This is how you write a creative set piece as well as a fun bit in the movie's world. Little details like this go a long way to make the movie fresh from other action comedies. This is just one way the movie utilizes it's premise.The story is not messy, but it is very fun and interesting. It is like a big giant puzzle and each of the characters are pieces to the puzzle to find out what plan is being hatched. It helps that the movie feels like a battle royal where the five assassins and a few other characters go out of their way to threaten and kill each other. What surprised me is that a few characters that I thought would have a bigger role ended up dying quickly. Anyone can die here so do not get attached. The part where the movie gets messy is how all of the characters have their stories connected in some way. It becomes a little hard to follow at times and many instances feel rather coincidental. Still, the movie does a great job building tension and leading up to its epic climax by having each stop grow more tense.As for the characters, I like most of them. Brad Pitt as Ladybug is as charming and likable as ever while playing the chill guy in a deadly scenario well. I like how Ladybug is the one person who would rather talk everything out than kill people. However, there are three standouts here. The assassins played by Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron-Taylor Johnson are comedy gold. They bring the best humor with their chemistry, banter and references to Thomas the Tank Engine. They handle their dramatic scenes just as well as their comedic ones. Honestly, they could have been the main characters and the movie would have worked just as well. The other standout is Hiroyuki Sanada as the Elder. He does not have the biggest role, but his character is very compelling and cool. Sanada's presence gives the film the serious atmosphere and heart when it needs it while showing how great of a fighter he is. Joey King as the Prince is a pretty intimidating evil young woman. I was actually kind of scared of her in a few scenes. She is scarier than some of the buff assassins around.The rest of the cast is really good, but some of the actors are wasted. Because this is a movie where anyone can die, a few characters are killed off pretty early. While I appreciate a movie where no one is safe, it does sadly lead to a few characters getting wasted. This is my only major gripe about the story because there are a few really cool characters that are taken out so soon. Overall, this cast is fantastic and each person brings something unique and fresh to the table. I just wish a few characters had more to do.The action in this movie is solid. There is some great camerawork and stunt work in the fighting. As I said earlier, I love the fight in the quiet car. I also love the one on one fights between Ladybug and the Hornet as well as him and the Wolf. What I like about the action here is the buildup. Ladybug does what he can to avoid these assassins and fight with them, but once he gets caught, he uses every thing he can to fight back. The climactic battle is amazing. It is bloody, brutal and it utilizes the train setting perfectly. The comedy is mostly funny as well. There are a couple gags that I rolled my eyes at, but I couldn't help but smile at the Thomas references, the craziness of the fights, the banter between Lemon and Tangerine and Ladybug's confusion on how this all involves him. This movie works great as an action comedy.Despite that, I wonder how comedic David Leitch wanted the movie to be. Sure it has Brad Pitt punching a cutesy Japanese character, but some of the characters have some pretty dark and serious backstory. The third act is much darker than the rest of the film. While the movie is comedic, there are some dark elements to it for sure. The tone and style of the movie reminds me a bit from Guy Ritchie. I think Leitch took some inspiration from Ritchie with the stylish way the plot advances as well as the pacing of the film. I really enjoyed the way the movie is edited because it helped keep the movie going at a fast pace without forgetting to flesh out the characters.While the movie is far from perfect, I had a blast with Bullet Train. It made me laugh with its humor, it engaged me with its story and it exhilarated me with its set pieces. There is even some creativity within the action and world of this film. This movie is insane and I enjoyed it from start to finish. If you are looking for a fun and violent action movie, this is definitely worth checking out.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Then the one person who is human clashes so much with the rest of the story that you feel preached to. The whole film is just an empty, vacuous, immoral action film. Stupid plot points and twists to move the story forward in an absurd predictable manner or to just introduce an over-the-top idiotic action sequence.I'm guessing there is a market for this drivel - after all Guy Ritchie is still making films - but if you want any semblance of a logical story with characters having 3 dimensions, this one isn't it.","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

Jackson, you have the comically self doubting - and polite - assassin of Brad Pitt.The fight scenes in the middle of a crowded train are over the top, and all the blood spurts, splashes, and pools all over the place. But no one the train notices how the main characters have cuts and bruises all over. (They are told to keep their voices lower.)There are no soliloquies about what the French call Big Macs or the meaning of Like a Virgin from Reservoir Dogs, but there are sillier, satires of that style of dialog where killers sound like they are in French New Wave film.And like a lot of action movies, it has a twisty plot, an all powerful bad guy and revenge back stories.So grab a couple of beers and just have fun with it. And make sure you go through the credits to watch the final scene, which is a nice kicker.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

To my surprise, this is one of my favorites so far this year.I loved the colorful characters and the way they were presented as well as their fate. There was Wolf who would i loved to see in a whole movie. No spoilers, but most of their outcome was superbly ingenues and also kinda realistic.

I started to think that Brad Pitt is starting to play in some weird movies because the world does not take him seriously as in the past. One week before the movie got released I saw the score on Metacritic. It was something around 50. I started to be skeptical about the movie and thought it is not worth my time. A few days after release I heard some people saying that it is quite worth the watch. I believed them and decided to make my friends join me. Sadly I had to not bring on the reviews because they wouldn't have gone.Now I can say that the movie surprised me in a very good way. The cast was amazing and Brad Pitt once again showed the world how amazing an actor he is and how can he do a huge amount of different roles. The performation of other actors such as a Tyrre Henry and Taylor Johnson were also really good. Throughout the whole movie, you could see Leitch's signature style. His style of humor was very well handled in this movie. There was also a huge amount of surprising scenes.Since this is a review without spoilers I will not say anymore so u can be surprised as I was.

Movie Review -Brad Pitt stars in the out-and-out action comedy of David Leitch, which is made for only one purpose: entertainment! No matter how it comes. My oldest memories of watching those films whose stories take place on a running train take me back to the pre-code era, i.e., ""Shanghai Express"" (1932), starring the emerging sensation of that time, Marlene Dietrich. Alfred Hitchcock made ""The Lady Vanishes"" (1938) and Junya Sato made Japanese flick, ""The Bullet Train,"" which was adopted by Ravi Chopra in 1980 as ""The Burning Train"" (probably, the most memorable and known attempt on that subject in Indian cinema). David Leitch has previously directed films like ""Atomic Blonde"" (2016), ""Deadpool 2"" (2018), "" Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw"" (2019) and he produced "" Nobody"" (2021). So we know that he's a good filmmaker, right? Then what's wrong with him that he had to make a film like ""Bullet Train""? Something is definitely wrong. Something terrible and big, or maybe he just wanted to see the lower side of his skills and therefore decided to uncover them with this action comedy. Bullet Train has no logic, nothing at all, yet all it tries to do is entertain you.The film is about a trained killer, Ladybug (Brad Pitt), who wants to give up life but is pulled back in by his handler, Maria Beetle (Sandra Bullock), in order to collect a briefcase full of money and gold on a bullet train heading from Tokyo to Kyoto. Well, the operation seems easy, but there's a catch to it - as always. Onboard the train, he and other competing assassins, The Prince (Joey King), Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry), Yuichi (Andrew Koji), Yuichi's Father (Hiroyuki Sanada), The Wolf (Benito A Mart√≠nez Ocasio), and Hornet (Zazie Beetz), discover their objectives are all connected with the White Death (Michael Shannon). During the killing spree, friends are lost and gained, secrets are revealed, vengeance is exacted, and so on. It all happens with a kick of dark humour, illogical scenes and black comedy.Bullet Train's narrative collapses entirely due to highly illogical conflicts in the screenplay. I agree they are funny, but we are not watching a British crime comedy of the 90s or any Abbott & Costello film from the 40s to enjoy those segments now. This crime comedy genre is difficult, especially when there's a lot of violence involved. You have to understand the impact of the outcome and how people are gonna react to it. A dead man can't just suddenly wake up. At least that's what he was shown a moment ago. He was hit with a couple of bullets, yet he awakens. A man can jump and climb on a running bullet train and carry it for the next five minutes. It's just that luck factor, which has been used again and again, and don't tell me luck happens to everybody at the same time, same place, and multiple times. Nobody is going to believe that, even in the last phase of cinematic liberty. It makes you laugh, yes, but from another angle. That's a silly one, I guess.The performances by the actors were quite decent considering the kind of peculiar characters they were playing. On some occasions, it seems they are over-acting, but maybe that was the demand of the script. Brad Pitt shines in the action and comedy scenes, but the scope isn't fulfilled. Joey King plays a bad-ass girl with an innocent face, which is too unrealistic to believe. Lemon and Tangerine, aka Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's black and white combination, is crispy. In the supporting roles, Andrew Koji, Hiroyuki Sanada, Michael Shannon, Benito A Mart√≠nez Ocasio and Zazie Beetz are okay, while Sandra Bullock's cameo is passable.The technical aspects of Bullet Train are satisfactory. The background score and cinematography work most of the time. The best part is the editing, because the film never bores you nor gives you any nappy moments, despite the horrible writing. This two-hour plus ride runs like a Bullet Train, and the crew member called ""editor"" deserves a special mention for that. David Leitch repeats a few cliches and sparks from his own previous films, only to make you feel that you are watching an David Leitch film. Most of the time, you pass the scene with a silly laugh, but there's a laugh, and that's all that matters. It is just about making sense where Bullet Train slips out of the track. If there is a limit to insensible and unreasonable patterns, believe me, Bullet Train is completely unaware of that. However, a spoonful of entertainment is there, if not a plateful of blockbuster watch.RATING - 4/10*","48 out of 130 found this helpful.

"8","/10","I'm glad this was not a John Wick facsimile. - Fun, fast, gory, dark humor, witty with good performances","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8407014/?ref_=tt_urv","LovecraftKaiju","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33544672/?ref_=tt_urv","6 August 2022","TL;DR - Fun, fast, gory, dark humor, witty with good performances, and decent action. If this combination sounds like you will have fun, you will have fun and then some. A little sag here and there but the quiet moments are welcome as the movie was surprisingly fast-paced for most of it.Do not go in expecting a John Wick-type watch considering the director, just go in as you did the first time you ever watched John Wick, you did not expect the experience but enjoyed it by the end.The GoodAaron Taylor near steals the show out from everyone, I will be keeping an eye on his work going forward.I was surprised by his performance in Nocturnal Animals but his bigger Marvel performance always stuck out in my head. With this film, I no longer see him as the Quicksilver from Avengers AOU, but as a good versatile actor I enjoy watching.Pitt kept up the entire film, bringing in a very 'just done with this but can't stop doing it' performance, I genuinely enjoyed his version of the 'wants to get out of the life' vibe he kept throughout the movie.It was a great performance and I am glad it was not just a John Wick facsimile where Pitt is a retired badass and just decimates everything in his path but rather an accidental badass who is just quick on his feet, sometimes not so quick.Brian, Koji, and Sanada, and Joey King make a great supporting cast with Brian having the largest role of them all, the comedy also works well for the most part, but wherever the comedy doesn't work the movie just keeps a good pace that you don't really dwell on it, there is always something that works around the bend.The story is not really the point here, and that works well for the type of movie it is trying to be, fast, fun, and fck3d up in many places.The BadThere is just a little bit of sag that kind of lingers around here and there throughout, and the third act may have gone a little bit overboard but not so far out there that it ruins the experience. Although the movie would definitely have been a more streamlined experience with 10 or maybe 15 minutes shaved off.Some parts of the plot may be considered a little convoluted and convenient, but there is sort of an in-story explanation for the same which kind of works, but if you are someone who needs everything to make sense in a movie you will probably find it grating.ConclusionAfter 2 of my previous theatre watches JW Dominion and Thor L&D and really not enjoying them both, this felt like a good re-charge for me and a fun theatre experience. I would suggest everyone go out there and give it a one-time watch, this is a fun group watch with friends.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I was a little wary going in because I'd seen a lot of this movie through trailers and marketing and usually that means very little comes across when you're watching the film because, well, they showed you the best parts before you came to the theater. But it was surprisingly packed to the gills with action and humor that wasn't shown and I definitely enjoyed. I've heard the dialogue being akin to Pulp Fiction and other similar styles, and while I think the dialogue was humorous, there's some spots where you might find it falls flat, but for me that was not the case. I think the writer and director also did a great job at coming up with a ton of plot devices and keeping track of them throughout. The casual viewer may forget/miss one or two and get a little confused, but if you didn't then you'll find it gives a feeling of everything coming full circle. I especially want to shout out Aaron-Taylor Johnson's performance, everything he did was spot on and I loved it. Overall, it was very comedic, lots of great chaotic action, and a blast throughout.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It would seem though that there are many other killers on board the train also looking for the case.After a rather disorienting, fast moving start, riddled with flashbacks and characters, you start to settle into this wonderful film and its bizarre and very funny story. There are plenty of twists and flashbacks explaining why each killer is there and one by one they start bumping into each other trying to get the case and do each other in - think Tarantino meets What's Up Doc travelling at 300kph with a lot of blood and dark humour. The key to the success of this film though is that every colourful character in it, is glorious, with Pitt, full of self doubt, absolutely perfect. Such a lot of fun.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

I tried to go past 20 minute mark but it was unfathomable and excruciating torture. For instance:-It tries to be like Nobody with 17 kills against a background of Humphrey Bogart music.... newsflash not everyone digs it
-It tries to be Kill Bill with some painful Latin song of vomit scene at wedding and overacting by the Latino assassin... not everyone loves that kind of mariachi-esque music
-The whole Lemon and Tangerine scenes are just unfunny, unintelligble... newsflash... British humor is not universal. Majority of the world (I reckon even Japanese audience too!) can care less about dumb British Humor... The characters got way more screen time than they deserved and Brad Pitt seemed to be the extra if anything than main protagonist.. We tuned in for Brad Pitt not others..
-Even Brad Pitt's starting therapy scene was just plain boringDespite cinematic stylization and artistry, it failed to captivate me. I had to plot through each excruciating scenes...This movie doesn't know if it wants to be Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction (BOTH which I didn't like as I think even Quentin Tarantino movies are garbage... I know I will get a lot of flak for it..) or John Wick or Nobody. I hate when movies can't decide if it wants to be ""serious"" or ""comedy"". Why not stick to one genre instead of making a scatterbrained pile of hot mess which is all over the place? Even Finnegan's Wake has more coherent plot line - insert dead pan emoji.If you look at David Leitch's track record you will realize he has a record of making bad movies such as Atomic Blonde. I mean I didn't watch Calvin and Hobbes.. but hey, if I see the title Fast and Furious, it will be hard pass. Why do Hollywood STILL think people are interested in Marvel or F&F type of garbage blockbuster? Please do not insult intelligence.Finally I will say this. Just yesterday a Twitter post came up on Hitchcock's The Birds and I was in all praises: No CGI. No boilerplate/templates. No dumb plot twists. No wokeism. No cheesy dialogues. In one word Masterpiece.Point being, you don't really need billion dollar budget to make a good movie. (Heck David Leith's bio reads as ""Billion dollar director"". Yeah dude. Take your billion dollar profit and shove it under your pillow if you think boxoffice profit is all that it matters in life.It's really not difficult making good movies. Just like an author can create relentless in beauty in a txt file of notepad, or Eminem craft artistry with no background music or an unknown Youtuber can tell beautiful story in 144p vertiical screne without any jump cuts or filligrees or close up camera angle and other cringe fests... a TRUE talent lies when one can execute with minimal effort and maximum efficiency.All those p-rn eyefest and candy... yet lands nowhere.

The cast is great, they work perfectly well with each other, my personal favorite character was Lemon, I loved that guy. I loved the buildup this movie has.

It never failed to have my attention and it was just so much fun. That's what this movie's goal is and it delivers. So just have and open mind and have a great time watching this.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

(just my reference, don't blame me for not being an anime fan etc ;)Superb fun until the end, can't help but thinking there are a lot of ""Diesel's"" reviewing this.Also seeing / hearing Brian Tyree (ball smoke) Henry and his twin with a South London accent was brilliant, cushty mate.Was really refreshing and something different!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Upon first hearing about this film I was intrigued. How can you go wrong with this much talent on and off the screen? I was very pleasantly surprised when sitting through this film. We don't usually get films like this anymore. Movies that are made for the action and characters, but done well. There is nothing special about the story being told here, but sometimes if the amount of fun you have can trump your negatives, that is all that matters.Bullet Train focuses mainly on Brad Pitt's Ladybug, an assassin for hire who's really just lucky with his job. They play the character out as if he has bad luck, but that's an ironic bit. Along with four others on this train, they all realize they are there for similar reasons. This in turn sets the action of the film in motion and it is a ride from beginning to end. Is it silly? Absolutely, but in the best ways. I laughed very hard on multiple occasions, at and with the film.As I said, the premise is very straightforward, so you really need to like the characters and be having fun with the action to really enjoy it. For that reason alone, I can say that I loved watching it. Brad Pitt has charisma for days and the duo of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry was an absolute joy. Their chemistry is some of the best I have seen in a long time. On top of them, Bullet Train is filled with big-name stars that you weren't even expecting and they just added to the fun.There's not too much else to say about this film, other than the fact that David Leitch is a terrific action director and his films usually always pack some great jokes. I think you will be hard-pressed to find a film more enjoyable than Bullet Train this summer, especially when you are looking for nothing but fun. It is not a film that will win any awards, but it will definitely be one that I will purchase and revisit time and time again. It's heavy on the gore and violence though, so if that is a detraction for you, that would be my only concern. Other than that, I just had a great time with one all around.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Maybe the best movie of 2022! The speed at which the movie goes is amazing and its just thrilling from the start to the end. Goriness aside, I had so many laugh out loud moments watching this. It reminds me a bit of the movie Foul Play for its speed and craziness. What a blast this entertaining movie is! Kudos to the director David Leitch and the whole ensemble. Nice to see Brad Pitt not take himself too seriously and allow himself to look foolish at times.Love the backdrop of Japan and its culture, down to Hello Kitty soft toys and vending machines - and the music interludes, really matched the scenes! So cool!If i had a negative point to say, it would be White Death's explanation scene with Brad Pitt - i found those parts a bit slow and boring.For those seeing the low reviews, I'd say give the movie a watch without expectations and don't take the movie too seriously. Its just pure fun and entertainment .","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Last year, it was Free Guy, this time it's Bullet Train.I had a blast with this movie. In fact, I might go to watch it again. This is an action-heavy movie with lots of comedy and witty banter. It uses the fact that chaos is an asset to entertainment. Because the plot is so chaotic, that it leads to some hilarious misunderstandings and many different types of action sequences. And the action is all well done. Of course it is, the movie comes from the director of John Wick and Deadpool 2. The stunts are violent and entertaining. And the Tokyo bullet train environment in the whole movie was really cool.The movie is very fast paced, and never slows down. The plot will be a bit hard to follow for the first 20 minutes because there are different perspectives to follow. But afterwards it's just non-stop entertainment. All these 4-5 different character perspectives made it really exciting and unpredictable. The plot itself is genius for an action-comedy. They did a good job making fun of the common action movie tropes.Brad Pitt, Aaron Taylor Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry, are brilliant in the film. Their chemistry is hilarious and characters are charismatic. The dialogue itself is bonkers. It was so hilarious. The finale of this movie was actually a bit satisfying, which I didn't expect from a movie meant for entertainment. The final action scene was exactly what I wanted from an action movie named bullet train. The song choices were great too. And surprisingly, the movie had a theme, like, can you control your fate or is there something like good luck or bad luck? I liked how they questioned that in such an entertaining manner.Overall I loved this movie. I would recommend you to watch this in theatres, it's worth it. Just expect a fun movie with lots of action and lots of comedy.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Right at the beginning we are told that ladybug (pitt) was not the first choice for this mission... that must be important later. And film rule number one.... once the gun is shown, it must be fired in the film. Part of the excitement here is that i could never guess what was going to happen next. Several missions occurring at once on a bullet train in japan. Various teams colliding, as the train speeds along. Changing alliances. Discussions of karma, good luck, bad luck. Revenge. All with a sense of humor. Smallish roles for sandra bullock and channing tatum. Directed by david leitch, who has won several awards. Great writing, great performances by all. Bullock, tatum, and pitt also worked together on ""lost city""!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's filled with flashbacks and cutaways that add absolutely zero value to the film. One has to look no further than the cutaway at 30:35. A callback cutaway to a Japanese anime with zero substance or relevance? Thanks for that, the 2 hour runtime couldn't have gone without those 15 combined seconds! The all-star cast of characters conned into this dumpster fire are to be pitied. Brad Pitt thankfully has an incredible repertoire to offset this misadventure; and Aaron Taylor-Judge, while young, luckily has outshone enough roles for his career to not be left on the platform. It would appear there's a reason David Leitch wasn't credited as a director on the original John Wick, and that his directorial filmography is so short and utterly without accolade. I can only hope that after seeing this, Hollywood comes to its senses. Maybe in the future, stunt doubles won't be tapped to direct major blockbusters and will be relegated to the end credits as they apparently deserve.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Okay first, the characters, is one of those movies that you end up loving the characters, not so much of a background except like for a couple of them but even with that you can relate and even love them. Second, the plot, is good enough to keep you interested for two hours and that's a big challenge now days honestly, specially with comedy, it's not enough putting a bunch of famous names in a train, you gotta keep it interesting and this is what this movie does with a sequence of surprises (at least for me) I mean it's not like ""oh I knew this would happen"" or ""totally predictable"" and a mystery to solve till half of the movie and the other half supported by the question what's next in all the mini plots happening at the same time. Third, Good ol' comedy, and since I'm giving my personal opinion, perfect comedy, not hypersexual comedy, all sex jokes and scary movie comedy, neither hyper dumb comedy like Hubie Halloween where all is silly people gettin hurt in silly ways and Patrick star comedy. Man, I mean, well done, they knew how to do this the right way. Oh, fourth and not least, the choreographies, in the action department, I mean, not the best scenes but good enough to call it an action movie, pretty interesting and entertaining.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The neon lights and enclosed spaces force the fights to be creative and unique. The pacing does feel lost at times due to the cutaways but that doesn't detract overall, as they serve either the plot or tone setting.Overall the film delivers on being a goofy action film that you don't need to turn your brain on for, its a solid 8/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

All hired by a mobster with a thirst for revenge.Phenomenal as David Leitch, since Fight Club, went on to become a great director. Once again surprising in his works of action with a beautiful touch of first-rate comedy and action. He knows how to direct a film that will please all audiences, especially with his good relations in Hollywood. Fantastic Celebrity Cameos in one movie.The film's art direction was masterful with anime arts and Tarantino inspirations. And according to the cast, Buster Keaton and Jackie Chan led the way in terms of action and comedy. Leitch is simply a genius.Zak Olkewicz, debuting the Californian screenplays with great competence. Excellent adaptation of the Japanese novel ""Maria Beetle"" by K√¥tar√¥ Isaka. Olkewicz made the story go global and international, taking a little bit out of Japan.Competent cast. With Brad Pitt doing 95% of his own stunts in this film. By the way, he made a great character. Bringing even some of his attributes to the scenes. Forgotten character and smart toilet was fantastic. Nice to have the freedom to add your ideas. That's the benefit of being a close friend of your director.Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson burst in theses roles. Together they formed a super dynamic duo of sociopaths in the scenes, with lots of ""back and forth"" dialogue. This led Aaron to a very interesting position. Since comedy is not his comfort zone. Aaram says in an interview how Brian was largely responsible for carrying this humorous atmosphere between the duo.Joey King, as Prince in this film and as The Princess in another. The way the movies communicate with each other is hilarious. So... She was praised by the entire cast for how sharp and quick she is in scenes... and also playful behind the scenes. ""She's a powerhouse,"" commented Brad Pitt. As opposed to playful and harmless, in her acting she came with multiple layers, from sweet to revenge-hungry killer.Despite his few appearances, Sandra Bullock did very well as a Ladybug boss. Replacing Lady Gaga was a good incident.After seeing the trailer, I knew it would be a fun movie, but I didn't think I would like it as much as I did. I had a lot of fun in the two very well-crafted hours of this film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It took a *lot* of post-'90s cinema for this to go down as palatable but it's adult entertainment, for adults, and you'll go to see something else next week -- you might not think of ""Neuromancer"" or ""Blade Runner,"" but you might think of ""Hello Kitty!"" and it's not a piece of crap. The conceit that a bunch of hired killers conduct themselves like day traders or other corporate types in good-natured but serious competition with each other is gamely handled, and it's hard not to be charmed by (nearly) everyone in the whole thing, even if there's too many characters to keep them all in your hand at the same time and the choice to keep everything trundling along and light if graphic entertainment is some of them fall off your mental radar. ""Murder on the Orient Express"" and ""Silver Streak"" maybe are inevitably in the background as precursors, and Joey King as a trapped-on-the-train suspect type is charming as ever -- this could be her breakthrough role to super-stardom, watch it happen without your really *noticing*, next -- and Brad Pitt proves once again he's awfully hard not to like. The d√©nouement goes on for a while, but what doesn't these days with CGI to dispense? ""I'm sorry, forgive me, I'm mansplaining!"" comes up. ""Are you going to get that?"" comes up. What's not to like?","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It delivers the sort of random craziness that you expect from Guy Ritchie films (I think Ritchie would be envious of this movie). A varied cast of characters all with their own stories in one massively twisted and interconnected plot. With tons of action, laughs, and downright WTF moments.The cast is excellent. Top notch on every level. They deliver an outstanding performance. Everyone involved hits it out of the park. Each character gets their own intro, has their own backstory, and their own reasons for being where they are. And the way they all interact is beautiful.The action scenes are incredible. Choreography is out just amazing. Using a small location to deliver some intense action, fast movements, and comedy gold.The special effects are great. So many things done with CG that look flawless.The story is just beyond out there, and so wonderfully put together. You get to enjoy some truly outrageous moments, with a surprisingly good tie in for everything.

The acting is well done, far beyond what you would expect from a genre piece. But it is the story that makes it successful. What could have been a convoluted mess as multiple storylines converge was impressively and tightly interwoven as it is tightly written and connects all of the dots. Brad Pitt was phenomenal as the down on his luck operative, Henry and Johnson (as ""Lemon and Tangerine"" respectfully) were hilarious and owned their scenes. Joey King as ""Prince"" was awesome. I had never seen her before in anything, nor even heard of her. I was highly impressed by her throughout the entire film. He has the role of sociopath down to a science.

And to be honest, I did not think I was going to be this good, and I'm disappointed I didn't see this in theaters when I had the chance. From the looks of the trailer, Bullet Train just looks like a somewhat generic action movie that will suffice some entertainment, but the story is, shockingly, much more complex. So I guess let's talk about it (Youtube level transitions lmao)The story in Bullet Train is so much more than it seems, and you start to recognize that at the beginning of the movie. The setup provides enough information to get you interested but doesn't overwhelm you. And for only being two hours, Bullet Train takes its time when adding plot points to the story. While some character arrivals may seem out of place at first (The Wolf) it really comes together at the end and everything starts to make sense. I think the strongest part of the story is the twist at the end. I was not expecting this to have any kind of twists, but I was proven wrong as we got multiple smaller twists throughout the entire movie, but even with all of those, I did not expect such a big twist. And a movie having a twist does not automatically mean the twist is good, obviously, but I can safely say that the twist in Bullet Train is very well done, and makes so many things make more sense in a satisfying and creative way. Another thing that makes the story so good are the characters.Each character, even the ones with little screentime, all have something going for them. It helps that almost every single character gets their backstory when they are introduced and that quickly creates something that makes their character unique, right off the bat. But some characters are just so much better than the others, and I think anyone who has seen Bullet Train knows exactly who I'm talking about. Lemon and Tangerine are easily the best characters, and they add so much to the movie. They provide tons of comedic relief but also add emotional moments, and their characters aren't just meant to be funny. They actually have some nice depth to them that just makes them more likeable, and that is much appreciated. Brad Pitt's character, also known as ""Ladybug"" is quite good too. I feel like he didn't have as much depth as the other characters, but he was still likeable and was really funny. One thing I find interesting is that Brad Pitt was advertised as the main character, but honestly, everyone feels like the main character here, not just him. And Bullet Train has 2 great villains, The White Death (who I'll talk about soon) and The Prince. The Prince, at least for me, was very unique with how they were written. They were also really unlikable, but still very entertaining to watch, and an unlikable villain is not a bad thing. The White Death is also a badass character, and even though he doesn't have much screentime, I like how his presence is always there throughout the movie.Before talking about the acting, I want to talk about the action and directing. The action isn't anything superb. BUT they made great use out of the fact that the entire movie takes place on a train, and the hand to hand combat was well choreographed. Considering the director of Bullet Train directed Hobbs and Shaw, and Deadpool 2, it was interesting watching him take on something that was a bit smaller scale. And while I think his larger scale action is better, he still clearly has talent in this department. The Hornet fight, and The Wolf fight are standouts when it comes to the hand to hand fighting, but the climax is easily the best when it comes to the action. The directing is also great. The neon lights pop, the clean colors and design of the Bullet Train add to the atmosphere and make every scene pleasing to the eyes.I talked so much about the characters, but not the acting, which is weird considering acting is probably the most important part to a character. An amazing actor and help remove the viewer's attention away from the character's flaws, in terms of writing (Thanos), but a bad actor can make the audience ignore how well written a character is and instead talk about how bad the character was. But luckily the acting here is fantastic. I think the standouts here are Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Tangerine, and Joey King as the prince. Both of them add so much to their characters. I also really liked Hiroyuki Sanada's performance as the Elder, but I might be a bit biased because Ryuji is my favorite horror movie character. But there are no bad roles, and I would say every performance was above average.Now this is where more pros, and some cons come in. The climax. I loved the climax but didn't like the climax of the climax. I think the fight with the White Death is great, and something hits different about a katana fight on a bullet train while a Japanese cover of ""I need a hero"" is playing. The entire climax is very well shot and entertaining. The fighting is great, it has a lot of blood, and the twists, like I said earlier, are great. My problems with it are I think it goes on for too long at the end, and the jokes they put in there aren't that funny, and I think the slow-mo scene of *spoiler* looked a bit ugly and was unnecessary, but other than that, the climax is great. The last thing I'm going to talk about is the soundtrack. I LOVE the soundtrack. The Japanese covers of famous song was a nice detail, and also sounded great, and the theme that plays for the White Death is great too. I didn't expect this to have such a good soundtrack, but it having a goo soundtrack was a welcome surprise.I think the chance of anyone reading this whole review is close to zero, and I can't blame them, but as we reach the end of this review, there is a chance that someone skipped to my final paragraph, and for that, I will end a pros and cons here:Pros: Great action, amazing acting, very well written story, super well shot, well paced, and a shockingly good soundtrack.Cons: The climax fumbles a little bit.Overall, an amazing movie, and I'm happy that I'm reviewing this after such a long break from actual reviews.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's such a lie and you're just as bad of reviewers as ppl who give perfect 10's on crap movies. This movie was fast paced, action packed, driven plot, great actors, and keeps its viewers captivated. There's a cameo or two that might annoy some folks, but overall it was a good movie. I didn't see this in theaters, I saw it on Netflix and for a Netflix watch, I really have no complaints. Brad Pitt is great, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is greater, and ""The Elder"" is my personal favorite. Besides entertain, what more do you ppl want out of a movie? Do you want the actors/actresses to physically come outta your tv's screens and play patty cake with you? Like, I seriously don't get the complaints on movies that are obviously DECENT and that you can tell a lot of work went into just so our eyeballs can have a good time. The movie is good. And It's at least better than any of the super hero movies/shows that poop out of Disney every other month. So yeah it's good; go watch it.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

One, it beats everything on Hulu, the rest of Netflix, Showtime and Epix. Only HBO and Prime have reasonably equal films. And Two, since it is a dry season for great films, this one stands out. No Star Wars, No Marvel(well not on TV), etc. So for you stuck at home like me you will find this the best 2 hours of the past 2 months. And for those of us starved for good media, that means a lot. Call it great timing or whatever, it is the itch that nothing else scratches. Except for that show on Prime. But that is still pretty great. So savor it. Enjoy it. Get the popcorn ready. Make it a prime Friday night event. Don't waste this opportunity because I don't know when in the next 2 months or so we will get another Bullet Train fun time. Get the wine or beer ready. Even make it a first date event. She will love you for it. But remember, good popcorn, extra butter, good food, good wine or beer. Don't waste this opportunity.

I just loved how he was portrayed as this wacky guy who feels out of place in all this madness but somehow still manages to pull things off on a professional level. And its not just his character, all the characters in this movie had their own little quirks which made them all likeable.What makes it better is how each character plays into each others path/storyline. The expose throughout the film was paced out perfectly so we get a better understanding of how each character got in their positions and how they will interact with one another. But after each sub story, adds to the whole madness of the main story which just racks up until the chaos just swallows everyone.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's filled with plenty of funny and memorable characters and moments!The visuals and cinematography are fantastically soaked in a beautiful neon glow.

Director and producer David Leitch is quickly becoming the King of Action Films!His name alone was enough to capture my interest in this film...
I'm honestly convinced that the man can do no wrong?!He is definitely becoming a director to watch...Bullet Train was honestly one of my most anticipated films of 2022.With a cast that includes Brad Pitt, Sandra Bullock, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, Michael Shannon, Hiroyuki Sanada, Zazie Beetz, Joey King, Logan Lerman and even surprise appearances from Ryan Reynolds and Channing Tatum; I was sold right from the very start...
Brad Pitt proves once again why he is Hollywood's go to man for literally anything!Joey King is surprisingly really badass!But for me, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry steal the show!They are absolutely hilarious and have fantastic chemistry too!Bullet Train is a non-stop thrill ride!It's an entertaining whirlwind of goofy character after goofy character, and awesome fight after awesome fight...
Bullet Train feels like it has come straight from the crazy minds of Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and Matthew Vaughan!Overall, David Leitch's direction is simply terrific.The film just oozes style with gorgeous lighting, vibrant colours, inventive camera work and a fun soundtrack!Bullet Train provides you with enough adrenaline pumping, high octane action we have come to expect from Leitch, laced with colourful characters played by a star studded cast and enough witty humour to keep you engaged from beginning to end.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And amazing performances... brad pitt dont disappoint to carry the show in a wild hilarious gory mess. Violently fun and thrilling. Enough mystery to look forward to what will happen next or who is who or responsible and such ... brilliant screen play with more details that it seems like the waterbottle sequence... nice choreography.I loved the japanese reference in the movie, oh yes some are clich√© but some are actually very true to this awesome country - in fact lot in the movie reminds me of a good anime called ¬´ baccano! ¬ª
watching it far exceeded my expectations with a lot of actors popping in the movie and making it even more fun or hilarious ! 200$ anyone ?Anyhow, it's approved here. Even my wife had a good time ! The last part is maybe a bit more ¬´ predictable ¬ª but it does have enough twists to be satisfying.. Really found this movie clever and entertaining !Felicitations, congratulations. Bravo.Made my week.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I don't typically watch action movies as they tend to be a bit monotonous. But Bullet Train never felt at any point boring to me. It has flaws no doubt, but man it was a good time.Being directed by the guy from the John Wick (uncredited), Deadpool, Hobbs and Shaw, you know you're gonna get good action. And it delivered. Action was satisfying, punchy and bold. However the finale got noticeably sloppy, especially the sword fighting scenes felt unrefined. Besides that I loved the visuals, it's out there, it's fun, it's humor. Also It's very...very stylized. But the movie has already been framed as a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, so it kind of ends up working. It's weird, quirky and goofy. Special shoutout to the editing and creative visuals. But man, the movie is so snappy I though it was made by Baz Luhrmann. The creativity though, like the bottle scene, so many moments to enjoy.All whilst it's surrounded by a story that keeps it's mysteries until the end. The story is fun, not incredibly smart but it keeps you in the unknown enough to make the future unpredictable. To it's fault sometimes, some characters come outta nowhere and it can switch between some scenes a bit too fast. The dialog between action scenes is a key feature of this film, and it's a risk considering it could work out poorly, and feel clich√© or ruin the pace. But the pacing and the method they use to get the scenes going again are fantastic, it's always ends up working out. The sparkling water bottle scene was great and has a particular tiny detail that makes it even better, getting a glass bottle instead of plastic.Writing, good writing, witty and quirky. Not all the humor worked but a lot of it did, and it's rare for me to laugh out loud but this got me a couple times. Also pretty rare for a mainly action oriented movie to do that. Writing is smart though, there's a ton of references pointing towards future events and so much more. Some more obvious than others, obvious one being the body armor joke. That said you notice the writing felt finished and thoroughly connected.Acting and characters, everyone was good here, Pitt with his character was nice. But he wasn't the main part of the show. It really is split between the 3 main characters. Ladybug, Lemon and Tangerine. Lemon and Tangerine were fantastic, hard to get sick of the British banter. Regarding casting though, I felt that the White Death was miscast, though it might also just be that that whole character arc was kind of meh, and the whole movie was building up to that character, so it had big shoes to fill. I just expected a bit more of a visceral performance, like over the top visceral, fitting with the movie.Music is used plenty, every action scene the volume goes bananas. But the songs or score isn't very memorable. The music aspect is not what you'll remember, the action and dialog within those actions scenes you will.If you're in for a fun, goofy action movie, with still brutal kills then this is the one. It's a action movie worth seeing, and that's a lot these days. Instead of the monotonous sludge that are Statham and the Rock action movies.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is the type of movie that starts slow, with a huge range of pieces to be putted together, and you see, right in front of you, the puzzle being completed.I loved the small details, the jokes, even the acid ones, are excellent and made with care and precision. The visuals are stunning I must say, just a small CGI scene that is a bit ridiculous (but I was too distracted laughing while watching it).Oh, let's not forget the fights and the blood effects: awesome. I really loved to see the visuals in terms of fighting, the choreographies were really good, with the right amount of ""overkill"" and plasticity, nothing too much exaggerated.Brad Pitt delivers a great performance, that you really feel that he putted his core into it, the master itself with some small details of Inglorious Bastards, Fury and the charm of his character in Troy and also in Ocean's Twelve.One last detail: the heavy content of the movie (violent in general) are very well-balanced, indeed not a movie for kids, but a great movie to watch with the family if you have adults/teens at home.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Brad Pitt. But he wasn't even that good! He's pretty cool but he rambles and jokes too much. It's a bit funny at times but the whole movie is too silly. Yes, it's a comedy, but they do have a pretty serious 9-5 job.But did I expect a film with substance? No, and that's not what the movie tries to be either. It's a silly movie that tries to entertain the audience. And yes, sometimes I breathed out through my nose because some scenes were kind of funny, but mostly the humor is bad. Way too many Thomas the Tank Engine jokes. That's not funny! That's enough!The film was nicely filmed, but it had bad special effects. It was below all criticism and ruined my (already pretty bad) experience. If Reynolds or The Rock had played the main role, the film would have had minus points, but Brad Pitt is cool and carries.I have already seen this movie several times before. It's just like any other mediocre action comedy that Hollywood has produced in recent years. Always the same humor, poor use of greenscreen, and one-dimensional characters. Couldn't care less about any character.In conclusion, I think the film is mediocre at best and there are so many better films to be made. This movie and Marvel need to learn that it's so easy to tell when it's CGI or not. It does not look good! More practical! Thank you.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

Lemon and Tangerine were very entertaining as well. The duo was well cast and well played by both actors. If there was a Bullet Train 2, they would be tough to replace as a duo.Bullet Train made me think of when Pulp Fiction made its debut...also refreshing in its time.The brutality was plentiful and almost hard to take but done in an almost comedic way, kind of like in The Kingsman. This took the edge off it being distasteful and being taken too seriously, in my opinion.It was a pleasant surprise to see Sandra Bullock towards the end. There wasn't enough of her in this show.

They imitate the feeling those provide to kids to try to appeal to larger crowds. That's why we're ending up with empty shells of movies like this one.The scenario is as simple as it gets. Every character's personality is a caricature in its own style, exaggerated in its traits, while lacking any sort of depth. They end up coming off uninteresting, shallow and idiotic. Everything here relies on quick paced snapshots of an action-oriented movie put together to overflow you with shiny images and noises, so you don't have time to think of how lamentable this trash really is until it's too late for a refund. A little ""comedy"" is used to try to justify the lack of depth, in a miserable attempt to avoid any responsibility in this disaster.I can guarantee you that nobody here will ever watch this garbage twice in his lifetime, even the ones leaving positive reviews. We stopped watching after 30 mins of agony. You'd think they'd learned their lesson with The Grey Man....

Great ensemble cast, check. Witty dialogue and a interconnected web of characters, check. Excellent transition from one point of view to the next.Exposition isn't in your face (although it could feel extremely fast paced) and character motivations make sense. The action was fun af as you see Brad Pitt uses just about anything in the train to fight against a variety of opponents.What really makes the film work is the interactions between these archetypal characters. It definitely reminds me of the old heist movies Guy Ritchie is so fond of making. One can easily point out plot conveniences/holes but that's really the whole point of the movie. We want to see quirky interactions and crazy turn of events.And the action, damn the action was exhilarating! I love sword fight scenes and you're gonna get it here. No weird and confusing shaky cams and you get to see blood splashes in all its glory. Lots of Jackie Chan-esque fight scenes requiring random environmental items and the camera work is on point.This is one of the funnest movies I've seen this year. Easily recommended for all action fans and I'll definitely watch it again once it's out for streaming.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Could be the best 2 hours spent watching Netflix EVER! Not just because of Brad Pitt who, by the way, totally rocks this performance, but because of everything about this film. First let me just say that I believe Pitt is a better actor now than he's ever been, he's more relaxed in his older years. I've always thought he was a very good performer, I just feel he's grown. The film: The entire cast is perfectly matched, the action, the cinematography, the insane yet hilarious violence and the over-the-top craziness of the plot -- just all of it blends into a roller-coaster ride that we didn't want to end. I highly recommend turning off your phone, tucking the kids in bed, suspending your disbelief and watching this film ASAP. You're welcome!!!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And boy, was I wrong when initially assuming that he'd do most of the heavy-lifting. All in all I found most actors did a really great job.However, the most interesting thing for me was seeing David Leitch climbing up the ranks and approaching the circle of world class directors around the Coen Brothers, Quentin Tarantino or Martin Scorsese.

I was expecting a blockbuster, no messaging, just a good story like thelma & Louis which Brad starred in too, Wow he has sunk low.

I didn't particularly enjoy Hobbs & Shaw, but John Wick, Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, and now this have all been spectacular action movies full of both style and substance. He's also developing a deft hand at merging comedy with action to create movies that are just outright fun. Bullet Train is no exception. This a surprisingly clever movie full of foreshadowing, interconnected storylines, and the pervading theme of fate driving every character, while also giving us exquisite action sequences, meaningful character moments, and some truly laugh-out-loud comedy. If you're looking for a good time at the movies, it doesn't get much better than this. I give Bullet Train an unequivocal 8/10, but honestly I could easily push for a 9. Definitely one of the best movies of the year. Bring on The Fall Guy next, even though I know nothing about it.QyrosMovies.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was everything I was looking for after watching 365 Days: This Day. By everything, I mean not complete garbage. But I honestly was excited about watching this film. It has a cast of actors who I recognize by name. Brad Pitt, Joey King, and Bad Bunny are the big ones. It also just looked like lots of fun. And it was lots of fun; one of the most entertaining films of the year.Nearly every aspect of this film is done well. The set design is incredible. The cars of the train are simple yet complex. Each one has a different element of the story. The characters are also beyond entertaining. I knew Brad Pitt would be good; he is in all his roles. I never expected the rest of this cast to be this enjoyable. The chemistry and comedy from Lemon and Tangerine are perfect for this film. I wish a sequel starring the two of them on their adventures could be made. Joey King also deserves praise for her role as the Prince. She can turn from an innocent schoolgirl to an assassin so strangely well. It's hard to find something about this film that I disliked. Even though the film is levels of insanity, it all works so well that the film is perfect. It is one of my favorite action films released in the past couple of years. It's not going to win any awards, but It will also be remembered fondly by me.10/10 Action-Comedy at its peak.

I'm not sure what some people were expecting out of this movie as if it's supposed to be some serious pretentious Oscar award bait. It's an action movie with seriously good dialogue, acting, comedy, and maybe because of all that people forgot what this movie was trying to achieve when the action sequences took place.The acting was performances were stellar - Lemon (Brian Henry) and Tangerine (Taylor-Johnson) were the highlights of this but Ladybug (Pitt) had great moments as well. The story was actually fantastic for an action movie. Fantastic dialogue, comedy moments, and twists.

Over the course of the next two hours dead bodies rack up whike things escalate to a massively OTT finale.Brad Pitt leads the ensemble cast as newly peace loving former assassin ""Lady Bird"", looking to ease his way back to work with a simple pick up job. Unfortunately for him the train he boards is full of other dangerous types whose motivations we learn about via flashbacks all of who are entertaining and played well. Amongst others there's a father looking for payback on the person who pushed his son off a roof, a violence loving cartel killer and a scheming young women with big plans. Special shout out to Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as likeable cockney hitmen Lemon and Tangerine. Pitt himself is effortlessly cool, managing to portrey his bad luck magnet (according to himself anyway) fixer for hire as simultaneously out of his depth and above it all.There really isn't much to dislike about Bullet Train, its slick, well paced and acted with an interesting bunch of characters and fun cameos. If you have even a passing interest in this type of movie you are in for a good time, with the caveat that you need to be ready for a transition from low key action mystery to a ridiculous ""how did anyone survive that"" finale.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

That is NOT a criticism. The movie works BECAUSE its so disconnected and chaotic and uses the best elements from those films in a slam bang action film with the right amount of humor, gore and violence. The only thing missing is gratuitous nudity.Five assassins are on board a speeding train in Japan. They have been brought aboard via different machinations. Brad Pitt is Ladybug, a contract agent who is hired to retrieve a briefcase full of ransom money on a speeding train in Japan. He gets the job because the original agent was sick (this becomes a fun cameo at the end of the film). There are two hit men ""brothers"" Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry) and Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), hired to rescue the son (Logan Lerman) of a mafia chief as well as the briefcase of money. Then there is Prince (Joey King) a young woman who keeps getting mistaken for an innocent girl. A Mexican assassin named The Wolf (Bad Bunny). Another assassin named The Hornet (Zazie Beetz) who uses a very poisonous snake venom as her weapon of choice. The mafioso chief known as the White Death (Michael Shannon) is more concerned about the money than his son. Also on the train is a father, Kimura (Andrew Koji), whose son was pushed off a building by one of the characters and he is seeking revenge. HIS father, known simply as The Elder (Hiroyuki Sanada) also boards the train as he has a connection to the plot that gets revealed late in the movie. Even Saundra Bullock shows up as Ladybugs handler (while she doesn't actually appear on screen until the end, this is not a spoiler since she is in the trailers) There is even a M-F snake on this M-F train. I fully expected Samuel Jackson to show up...he doesn't.This movie works because it is well-written, superbly acted and each character is given a decent backstory to make them interesting. The movie flashes back to the reason each one is on the train the way Kill Bill did with its characters' backstories. Ladybug is a low level agent who just does ""snatch and grab"" jobs and despises guns. He is trying to recover from some trauma and spends a lot of the movie incorrectly espousing self-help missives. He keeps trying to get off the train at each stop, but something always prevents it (ala Red Rock West). Lemon and Tangerine bicker and banter about inane things like Vincent and Jules in Pulp Fiction, despite the dawning realization of the enormity of the situation they are in. Prince is a conniving lady who is manipulating the events in the plot for her own personal reasons. The Wolf's wife was murdered during their wedding and he thinks it was Ladybug. The father and grandfather are both seeking revenge, but for different reasons. The Hornet is probably the least developed assassin, but she is so well played by Ms. Beetz that you kind of forget that. Her and Ladybug have a fight that is both funny, touching and fiery. Even the small role of the conductor is well used and adds to the plot.All the characters interact with one another in some way or other. That's the best part of the movie. Each thinks, wrongly, the other characters are their enemy and they spend most of the movie beating each other up, not even really knowing why. The action is non-stop, the dialogue is very funny and the plot keeps moving along and isn't that complicated to follow. By no means is this as original as Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, but you can see Tarantino's DNA all over this movie. It entertains and makes you laugh while all the blood is flying around on screen. The two hours went by fast and I was very disappointed when it was over.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film lives and dies on its style and tone which is essentially a Guy Ritchie crime comedy combined with Tarantino's Kill Bill and mixed in a blender. Unfortunately, it's all hit and miss here. Sometimes the stylistic choices work (some of the fights are decent and there's some jokes that land), at other times it just feels like a desperate and shallow imitation. Pitt mostly works here with his laid back demeanor, but he's a bit too one note and the movie becomes far too a big an ensemble feature for it to coast on him alone. The ambitions to take this from an interesting crime story of intersecting lines and stylish fights to an all-out epic sage drenched in style opining on fate and ending with a cataclysmic train crash undercuts it all and turns it into a really dumb and trying movie at times. It's just not stylish, smart, or good enough to be anything more than a passing entertainment. Disappointing given the talent involved here.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Some people think that load of ""blood"", shooting and some kind of ""fighting"" plus stupid and nonsense dialogue make movie interesting. First, plot is so confusing, idiotic and absolutely necessary comparing dialogues, situations which are without reasons just there. Assassins knows each other from who knows where, passengers don't pay attention to actions around them, speed of bullet train is like walking in a park, unharmed people after horrifying crash, all in one totally mess and pile of rubbish. Better go and spend two hours with your mother-in-law, you can have more fun.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Seen these reviews people hating the movie. People must understand what they are going in for. The trailer tells you very clearly its one of those no brainer stupid action movies with some laughs.I don't know what else people were expecting from this movie. Its not John Wick and its not imitating Tarantino as many say but its rather like a Guy Ritchie movie. I enjoyed it a lot because of its stylized action, bloody violence and comedy. All the characters are awesome. The ending have some cheesy CGI but still not that bad. A perfect fun evening movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I also laughed out loud multiple times - but it is more about the story and action with lots of jokes sprinkled in.

They have the same mission to get a reward from the same lord, the yakuza leader Death White.An excellent mix of action and comedy films. Bringing the concept of a story where in each conflict each of the characters is interrelated with each other and is on the train. Starting from Ladybug who gets a mission to steal a bag, the father who is looking for someone who has pushed his child from the height of the building, the assassin twins who look after the child of the leader of a criminal organization, the wolf from Mexico who avenges the death of his wife and the White Death who is constantly discussed throughout the film. Likewise, whatever is on the train also has something to do with such as water bottles, snakes and even cartoon characters as well. And it happened, I think it's like a plot twist that's quite surprising and makes you laugh in amazement at seeing who's behind Carver's character.Film is well packaged. The plot of the story and conflict is neatly constructed. Various easter eggs are the key to each character to be introduced in the film. Don't forget also with animpressive and awesome fight. Moreover, it is brought with the concept of character recognition made like a sub plot of the story.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The setting and tone are wholly original and complimented by a humorous and clever script that doesn't take itself too seriously. Pitt's charm as a lead shines through in every scene he's in amidst a script that is surprisingly well connected despite the appearance of being chaotic. The problem with the film however lies in the discrepancy between its potential and its execution. Based off the trailer and the concept, Bullet Train has all the marking to be in the high 90s but ultimately fails due to its lack of coordinated hand-to-hand action sequences the action sub genre has come to be known for. If you're on a train full of unique assassins, we should expect some unique fights. Unfortunately this is where the movie falls short, as the action is more reminiscent of older, more traditional action films like Die Hard, The Borne movies, transformers etc. Ultimately there is plenty of action, and it's exciting and explosive but it's not artful nor memorable. That for me is what had me leaving Bullet Train feeling it could've been better. 89%","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There is a complex plot in this film but it goes nowhere and the ending seems cheap. Kotaro Isaka, the author from whom this story has been adapted has made it big, since book to screen adaptations are where the real money lies.The movie was entertaining to me but only because of the cinematography, and some of the angles of the camera. Brad Pitt seemed finished by Burn After Reading, where I thought his looks would fade. That was in 2008. The fact that he is still being the main man is a surprise to me. I like him enough to go through this movie with a sort of tolerance.The edgy music accompanying action scenes has been done enough for it to lose its primary authenticity, but this way of building up the contents of a film is not so seamless that it becomes a trope of its own. Music and movies do not complement each other, else Indian romance films would be more popular.I did not get into this movie expecting Matrix like action, but it seems weird that the gun fights are so bland here. The highlight of the movie for me was the Reddish Wedding scene. That was cool. The actors give a performance that hints that they are having fun. It is only sad that the actors playing the White Death and his family are so miscast.Overall this movie grew on me, believe it or not. I intended to give it 2, then 3, finally settling on 4 stars. I am now only an honorary moviegoer, but want more good movies like this. Despite the blandness and my rating, this is a movie that is half boredom, half complacency. Its plot, and its concept, and really just the casting of Brad Pitt make it a piece of art that will leave a trace after fading away.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The script was awesome and the direction tight and extremely well done. There are so many good things about this movie that it is hard to say one part was the best - but I would have to say that the Casting was even better than Pulp Fiction - at least its equal. From Brad Pitt as the 'leaf in the wind' trying to find meaning in life as chaos falls all around him, through to the brief cameo roles played by established stars - the casting was perfect and their timing outstanding. I was also very dubious that whoever was to going to be the main villain could possibly fill the role - it built up through the movie and was the axle around which the whole movie turned - but Michael Shannon was awesome - absolutely perfect. Just Wow.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Entertaining but merely fitting the genre and enjoyable if ur up for it. I think the plot twist and turns a fairly predictable and the premise that everything happens on a train during a train ride. The movie actually loses sight of the destination of this train which makes it all the more subject to the slapstick genre. English accents and mixing in Japanese mystique and martial arts is merely used as accessories to dress up the story and visuals. At the end of the day this is a slapstick movie with the main character squarely focused on Brad Pitt...","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

""Bullet Train"" has this macabre and sometimes on the edge humour and lots of action scenes but there is much more to it which sets it aside from a series of typical films in the genre.Setting. Action takes place in Japan, and it creates a special atmosphere and allows for particular peculiarities and twists.Plot. It is based on the 2010 novel Maria Beetle (titled Bullet Train in its UK and US edition) by Kotaro Isaka and it explains why the narrative is so good. Unfortunately, many action movies lack an original and captivating plot, and this picture is the case when it's not only pleasing to watch A-level actors fighting with each other, but you actually want to follow a story flavored with poignant jokes.Cutting. Kudos to cutting specialists who made the movie such a dynamic piece of art. It reminds me of works of Edgar Wright, and if you like them, I think you'd find this one quite amusing.Soundtrack. Main theme is Bee Gees - Stayin' Alive (should I say more?) sets the tone - it's energetic, a bit (okay, a LOT) chaotic and playful.Actors. Although it's not the most important part for many people I can't but admire Brad Pitt, Joey King, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson who became an icing of the cake.To me the movie has become a breath of fresh air and I haven't laughed so hard since the release of the Gentlemen.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Good films are not common but nowadays are rare like dodos , the bird from animation movie up. Most of the new films are mediocre at best. Maybe there is no more true inspiration. Maybe there are difficult and tiring times for art. On the other hand i hope this will change at one poit. All the movie takes place in a train . The action is fast and some times pointless. Its a wannabe tarantino movie , without tarantinos surprises and artistic point of view. Film , actors , creew are trying but its still not enough.Bullet Train is a 2022 American action comedy film directed by David Leitch from a screenplay by Zak Olkewicz, and produced by Antoine Fuqua, who initially conceived the film. It is based on the 2010 novel Maria Beetle by Kotaro Isaka. The film stars Brad Pitt as a former assassin who must battle fellow killers while riding a fictionalized version of the Tokaido Shinkansen. In addition to Pitt, the film stars an ensamble cast which also includes Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, Andrew Koji, Hiroyuki Sanada, Michael Shannon, Bad Bunny, and Sandra Bullock.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

And the master does not disappoint in his latest outing, with ""Bullet Train"" providing the adrenaline-pumping, high-octane action we have come to expect, laced with colorful characters played by a star-studded cast and enough irreverent humor to keep you engaged from beginning to end.Brad Pitt was clearly in his element as ""Ladybug"", a down-on-his-luck assassin tasked with a seemingly straightforward ""snatch and grab"" assignment on a Japanese bullet train headed from Tokyo to Kyoto. Little does he know that the package he is assigned to steal contains deadly secrets that a mafia boss will literally kill everyone to get to. ""Ladybug"" with his trusty handler ""Maria"" must navigate deadly master assassins, yakuza gangsters and other co-passengers with dark secrets to get his cargo to its intended destination.Based on a novel of the same name, written by Kotaro Isaka, the writer as well as the screenwriter Zak Olkewicz deserve praise for their world-building, with each character adding mirth and quirkiness to the narrative. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree-Henry shine as a pair of assassins known as the twins while the usually dependable Hiroyuki Sanada and the precociously talented Joey King shine in their supporting roles. The cameos and guest appearances flow thick and fast and turn up on the most unexpected of occasions, to keep the audiences glued to proceedings.""Bullet Train"" is the action-genre revival Hollywood desperately needed, proving once again that the gritty, R-rated best version of the genre is still best delivered on the big-screen, with OTT products like ""Red Notice (2021)"", ""The Man From Toronto (2022"" and ""The Gray Man (2022)"" ending up as damp squibs due to the shortcuts that undeniably get taken in scripting and staging when a movie is designed for at-home audiences. ""Bullet Train"" is a refreshingly fresh action-comedy produced after long by Hollywood and a recommended theatre watch!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The events all take place on a train after the hero of that series (Thomas the Train). It deals with it as the characters were defined in the cartoon series, the way the characters and clothes are drawn, the formations and methods of filming the scenes of the groups, and the transitions between the chapter and the other, even the methods of narration and dialogue are cartoonish.Finally, we come to the best thing about the movie, which is the comedy that raises it to a high position and adds a lot to it.The movie bullet train is a comedy, violent and enjoyable action movie that contains a light and balanced artistic vision that is somewhat strange from those types of films currently, but that vision is what gives it its weight and special taste.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

If I gave it three stars it is for the CGI and the action scenes which involve some creative skills, otherwise the script is a catastrophe. There's nothing funny in the Tarantino-inspired dialogues (not that the much quoted Quarter Pounder with cheese of Kill Bill dialogue had any entertaining merit). Really not worth wasting one's time on.Several studies have determined that IQ scores have been falling for decades. Sorry to say but the cinema nowadays is in a difficult state, with all the Marvel and Transformer escapism coming out of Hollywood.

Snakes on a train! Refreshing to see Brad Pitt continuing to depart from his typical blockbuster roles and I think this was a good fit following ""Once upon a time in Hollywood"". Fun to watch him in this film as the self-aware, enlightened ""man for hire"" who still has a job to do. I have to say his comedic timing was perfect and its almost like where has funny Brad been all our lives?!? I loved the witty english banter amongst the other assassins and the dialogue between the main characters. The visuals of the bullet train speeding through Tokyo were artful and the fast-paced fight scenes held watchers interest without ever overdoing it. It was really funny throughout, even when you didn't expect it to be. Hiroyuki Sanada was amazing as always and I do wish we got to see more of his sons/grandsons backstory. You are somewhat thrust into the storyline in the beginning and figuring it out as it goes along. I give it a solid 8.5 and only detract some because I wish we had more plot pre-story.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

You'd end up with something like Bullet Train.Fast, funny, very violent, and with lots of little touches. By touches, I'm basically referring to them taking Chekhov's gun off the mantle, revealing that it's a machine gun, and spraying it liberally about.Excellently paced, great characterizations considering how much was going on, action throughout but still allowing breathing room.I'm trying to think of recent action movies I've really enjoyed... I think this places at the top of the last few years.After watching this, i immediately started following the screenwriter and director.

I was expecting a reasonable amount of kitsch but it seemed as if this movie was both trying too hard and not trying hard enough. Whoever wrote the character backstories didn't try hard enough as the backstories were completely trite and unconvincing, and the plot itself as well as its developments were so cliched that it shouldn't keep the interest of anyone who's seen an action movie from the last 40 years. On the other hand, the antagonist pair tangerine and lemon were so hollow and built of nothing besides teenaged edginess and Deadpool-esque humor that it was clear that they were trying too hard to appeal to adolescent sensibilities. Not to mention that that thomas the tank engine theme was unbearably lame... a blatant rip off (or clumsy nod) to the odd quirks of a tarantino or besson character (even down to the names); another instance of not trying hard enough. Upon my first viewing, the introduction of those antagonists made me cringe so severely that i had to turn the film off. I later resumed it, hoping it would get better. It did not.The character played by brad pitt was completely mismatched to his acting prowess relative to the rest of the cast. His presence only made the lesser known actors and actresses appear like unprepared amateurs. I want to like brian tyree henry but his flat affectation and sarcasm is the same in every role he plays, and it falls flat every time.To its credit, the technical filmmaking aspects were executed with some degree of competence and panache, and the fight choreography was impressive at times. But that did not suffice to save this schlocky waste of time. And a looong time it was.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Here he concocts another a highly entertaining, high octane, stylised actioner with plenty of irreverence, over the top violence and black comedy to throw you off track, so you never quite know what is going to happen next.Brad Pitt is having a bad day and just wants to quietly get the job done for his employer and leave the train, however he is one of five assassins who have boarded who become unwittingly interconnected with each other while doing different jobs that result in bloody shootouts, ultra violence and witty banter, especially between Lemon and Tangerine, where Leitch clearly takes his cues from Guy Ritchie, as they all speed across Japan to get their respective jobs done.While the story gets a little convoluted there's never a dull moment as Leitch expertly choreographs the action to perfection. It's a cracking thrill ride with a witty script full of twists and turns, colourful characters and Japanese flourishes, often reminiscent of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (1994) but with more gloss. Bullet Train is an absolute blast that moves along at a breakneck speed, even if there's a little too much CGI for my liking, but the sheer bravura set pieces, wit and style ensures a high likeability factor and it's good to see Brad Pitt clearly enjoying himself here in amongst all the irreverence.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

He gets entangled with other assassins on the train. Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry) and Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) have just rescued the son (Logan Lerman) of Yakuza crime lord White Death (Michael Shannon) from kidnappers and are taking him and the cash-filled briefcase to the father. Yuichi Kimura (Andrew Koji), a Yakuza member and father of a boy, Wataru, who is in a hospital after being pushed from a building, as well as his father and Wataru's grandfather, the Elder (Hiroyuki Sanada), are looking for the culprit. The culprit is the Prince (Joey King), disguised as a schoolgirl, who pushed Wataru and has her henchman currently holding the boy hostage in the hospital, to force Yuichi to kill White Death. The Wolf (Benito A. Mart√≠nez Ocasio) thinks Ladybug killed his wife and wants to avenge her. Another assassin, the Hornet (Zazie Beetz) uses the poison of a boomslang snake, slithering loose on the train, to kill.If the synopsis above is confusing, you should watch how these entanglements play out on the screen. As wild and violent as can be. The comedy, mysteries and thrills of this action-packed adventure are so riveting, I overlooked the violence. Sandra Bullock as Maria, Ladybug's handler, mostly lets her presence known through phone conversations with Ladybug, but her lines are no less funny. This is surprisingly exceedingly entertaining.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It has a great deal of violence, but without being unnecessarily gory. We just found it a ton of fun to watch for the visual effects & story as the director used so many interesting techniques & angles. It all felt so original & different from many recent movies we have seen. I think comic book fans will like this though it's not at all dark & dreary which is how I often find some of the comic films. One thing important to add is that this film is very funny. I mean laugh out loud funny. And it also has heart with relationships & people you really care about. I don't write a lot of reviews, but I wanted to stand up & clap at the end of this one as well as share how good it was with as many people as possible.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie had a good beginning, it was ordinary, but in terms of the beginning and continuation, it was very beautiful and attractive, and it was in a way that attracted the audience, and in addition to This movie was an action movie, but it was so beautifully scripted and made that laughter and the comedy genre were used in it in an excellent and logical way, but instead of a normal beginning, it had a beautiful ending and you convinced the audience. It means that the film is complete, the content and the expansion were excellent in terms of filming, the slow scenes were very, very well filmed, the direction was very professional and the editing was very beautiful. It was a beautiful combination of comedy and action, so that it made the audience laugh, but it didn't take away from the action content of the scene. For the selection of actors, make-up and special effects, it was clear that very professional groups were used. The final opinion is that the movie was perfect and had no obvious flaws.

Check.Adrenaline-Pumping Action Scenes? Check.Badass Villain? Check.Now, a regular action film would have the above three components to rely on. But, in addition to the above three, the film has a pretty well-woven storyline which is not at all a regularity in action movies. David Leitch directs this film with such a great screenplay that it almost reminded me of Pulp Fiction (1994) which was essentially a dialogue driven drama film. This film reminded me a lot of Pulp Fiction due ot it's non-linear storytelling and is essentially a plot-driven action film which is a rarity nowadays. The Gray Man (2022) was supposed to be this Big Action flick of the summer but I guess Bullet Train gets that title for me.Brad Pitt, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, Joey King and each member of the cast is just perfect and on point. Each one has a reason to be on that train and at the end, the film even points that trope out of action films having unnecessary side characters. Brad Pitt was amazing as always, Aaron Taylor-Johnson surprised me, and TYree Henry got most of the best scenes in the film. Also, I only knew Joey King as this cute girl who will always play the love interest in Cheesy Netflix Rom-Com's but I was dazzled when I saw her performance in this, she really makes it up for her Kissing Booth performances. Also, keep an eye out for the unexpected cameos this film has to offer.The song choices, ahhhhhhhhh. David Leitch never disappoints in that department, John Wick (2014), Deadpool 2 (2018), Hobbs and Shaw (2019) and now this.I'd say the film overall, is a great experience at the theatres and would definitely recommend it.It's pretty enjoyable although you kinda get what has been happening all this time a few minutes before the end when the film finally decides to reveal it to us. Nevertheless, it manages to keep your attention by the amazing climax this film has to offer.P. S.: Loved that Kill Bill Reference at the end.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I'm always impressed by his ability to choose locations, cast and set, and great soundtracks to complement what we see with our eyes. The picture is a great proof, that it is not necessary to have many locations in order to shoot beautifully. The charm of this picture is also added by the coexistence of different national cultures, which look harmonious and at the same time funny next to each other. Well, of course, I cannot but note the charisma of the main character and the wonderful acting other artists. The cast includes both experienced ""players"" and young talented actors, which is very gratifying. The plot line of the film did not let me tear myself away from the screen while watching it. That is, there is no division into dynamic and non-dynamic ""parts"". Through the screen, we can also feel the good sense of humor of the director and screenwriters, because there is a considerable amount of jokes and gags in the picture.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

All of the characters are amazing and if the situation they found themselves in was a little less surreal I would've totally emphasized with most of them but considering it's an action flick I already used to the fact they're mostly unkillable - and once you've put it behind you the action looks less impressive.The soundtrack was a fantastic inclusion into the narrative and really helped to set the mood of the scenes. All of the actors did great and a couple of surprise cameos were refreshing to say the least. Overall Bullet train is a good way to spend the evening and a worthy addition to the niche of action movies that you don't immediately delete from your memory as soon as you watched it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Might not sound like it could be too interesting, but the writing and directing are at their peak. Not one word is out of place, and spoken in a stylish manner totally dedicated to each character.And each character is developed from the first scene they appear in, and all are likeable and interesting. Nothing is missed from beginning to the end in opening up their intent and purpose for being on the train.This is a movie based on style with humour and mystery. Brad Pitt is ideal as the main actor 'Ladybug"" supported aptly by a great cast and a great script. Just when you think something has been explained and has settled, an unexpected turn of events or info drags you back into its story.The title of Bullet Train pretty well sums up what the film is like watching; a train ride of fantastic entertainment at high speed, which never lets up until ALL the credits have been shown.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Where Tarantino takes a little more time for story telling and plot buildup, this flick skips that for the most part and goes straight to the last 30% of his movies. The cinematography and dialogues add to the great atmosphere of the film and also convey that it doesn't take itself seriously. This is something that I really like about those crazy over the top action movies. The small plot itself is crazy enough to keep you guessing what brings all those whacky characters together on that train. Overall great 2h entertainment, especially if you wish Tarantino movies would skip the first half and go straight to the over the top gory action.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Its more of a cartoon than a realistic or serious thriller. The narration and the entire movie dialogue were just fluff material. Like I said its a cartoon, even an eight year old will get by without understanding any of the words.The story itself involves betrayal and revenge but none of the villains or heinous acts were especially gripping. Brad Pitt as the reluctant assassin is not very impressive. He's just yapping away on the phone with his handler for most of the movie. Tangerine and Lemon were a funny side act but they also wore out their welcome in the movie.Channing Tatum had a funny 2 minute cameo its too bad he couldn't have gotten more screen time. I think if the roles were reversed he might have done a better job. If you just like Brad Pitt for some mindless fun then sure why not go ahead and watch this.","14 out of 37 found this helpful.

The plot is sort of Pulp Fiction (1994), Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2002) and Vol. 2 (2003), and Lucky Number Slevin (2006). This quite difficult to follow, convoluted storyline with many moving parts tries to outdo Pulp Fiction with its initial gore and subsequent cute comedic dialogue. A rather ambitious writing, acting attempt that also incorporates two rather nice cameos towards the end. The movie includes several nicely creative fight scenes as well as humanizing moments for a few of the ""villains."" Overall, this movie is an improvement on the typical action mystery movie though it still struggles with its overall presentation. Good effort, decent try, and definitely worth a visit to the movie theater if the theater's sound system and the music track does not blow out your eardrums first.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The director co-handled JOHN WICK so the fight scenes that take place here are typically brisk and well-choreographed. I could have done without some of the CGI, though, particularly at the never-ending climax where it gets completely ridiculous (as much so as the flying train in the Thai movie VENGEANCE OF AN ASSASSIN). Pitt is well chosen as the likeable lead, but the supporting cast are decent too, particularly Taylor-Johnson and Henry as the amusing double act. Hiroyuki Sanada is always a welcome presence, as is Michael Shannon, and King is the only misstep in the casting. Generally, though, this is fun and entertaining stuff.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

You see - much like alcohol - I wholeheartedly recommend ""Bullet Train;"" it is a slick, stylish, action-comedy that never ceases to entertain from the time it gets going to the time it ends; however, in between the entertainment and the ending, you will be able to feel the fact that it is outwearing its welcome.Director David Leitch, if nothing else, signifies a high quality movie experience; from the first ""John Wick"" to ""Deadpool 2"" and ""Atomic Blonde,"" my man knows how to direct competent action sequences. And so, when I saw his name pop up in every single trailer I saw for this movie, I, at the least, knew I was in for an action spectacle. However, what I didn't realize was how much ""Bullet Train"" would entertain me during sequences when no action was occurring on screen. But before I digress, let's talk action.After watching action movie after action movie filled to the brim with close-up shaky camera, it was more refreshing than words can express to watch a movie that had nothing but clearly comprehensible action sequences. Every hit, slice, and gunshot was seen in full view of the camera, which was shocking, to say the least. I found myself on the edge of my seat every time an action sequence began. And thankfully, there are plenty of exciting - gory - action sequences that will draw viewer attention. Leitch draws inspiration from Japanese Yakuza films and packs ""Bullet Train"" full of katana battles, as well as with riveting gun fights and hand to hand combat sequences. And the best part of it is that everything is clearly filmed, but I'd expect nothing less from a co-director of the first ""John Wick"" movie.What is more surprising is that ""Bullet Train"" manages to entertain even when there is nobody beating someone else up on screen. More of an action-comedy than a straight up action film, ""Bullet Train"" has plenty of moments that will elicit full-blown belly laughs from its audience, thanks in part to Brad Pitt's brilliant performance. No stranger to the limelight, Brad Pitt knocks it out of the park here with a role that highlights his action prowess as well as his comedy chops. And as one who has never been fully convinced by Pitt's acting abilities, his skill behind the camera and endlessly rewatchability has fully turned me into a fan.Another thing I appreciated about ""Bullet Train"" was his unabashed style - taking notes from Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, this film has a rather unorthodox style that throws viewers in the middle of past and present, fully trusting them to pay attention as to what is going on, and why. And it works. I couldn't help but have a goofy smile plastered to my face as ""Bullet Train"" jumped back and forth and with it, serenading audiences with non sequiturs that - ultimately - tied everything together into a perfect bow. So be aware - even if things don't make perfect sense in the beginning, by the time the credits roll you will have everything spelled out for you.Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, and Andrew Koji - amongst others - make up the cast, and each and every actor and actress bring their A-game, with enough charisma to lead a movie of their own; while Brad Pitt may steal the show, everyone else is so good in their own right that I found myself coming to this movie for Brad Pitt, and staying for the supporting actors.In the end, ""Bullet Train"" is one great time at the movies. With enough action to satisfy even the most hard core adrenaline junkie and enough comedy to engage the most casual viewer, ""Bullet Train' is a crowd pleaser in every sense of the word. Even with the high hopes that I had due to the director, my expectations were still blown out of the water - even if I do think this movie was a bit too long for its own good, and dragged on just a little too much. That said, there is so much to enjoy here that I find myself highly recommending this movie to anyone who is even the slightest bit interested in checking it out. Because, trust me, you won't regret giving this one a chance.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Non-stop and massively visceral action delivered with a dead pan energy, that also pauses and takes the time to insert some laughs along the way - it's humor found in the juxtaposition of absurdity, violence, and repartee - and the oddly comical recurring themes that pop up in awkward moments.Bullet Train is a high voltage trip that won't disappoint, a trip that also manages to take the time to get up close to some of the leads and record their personal journey and investment.

There were few imperfections, as it was almost ruined by some over the top, random ""cameo/appearances""... but it was a small part of an otherwise very entertaining experience. Brad Pitt, the Twins, and the rest of the bill did an amazing job creating a fun story almost like a ""who dunnit"" type of story. I laughed pretty hard, and was on the edge of my seat quite enough.

A lot of action movies can take note from here on how to develop characters properly while still being an action movie.Direction was very very good. Fight sequence co-ordination was out of this world.

This sounds simple enough, too simple in fact, but ""Ladybug"" (which is his code name) agrees to take on the task. He has recently found enlightenment, and he rhapsodizes about forgiveness and acceptance in a Zen manner as he goes about his mission. Of course it will not be that simple.Directed by David Leitch, who directed ""John Wick"", the film includes plenty of special effects, quirky characters, and gore. Because it is set in Japan, it includes many elements of Japanese culture. Its tone and a plethora of colorful characters might make some viewers think of ""Pulp Fiction"".The plot is intricate and whimsical. And it is very confident in the way it weaves seemingly-disparate story elements into a cohesive, fanciful whole.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

to become a PG13 ratingAnd the film, the second movie of the series, a confrontation between the character of the serial killer Brad Pitt and the character of the serial killer Carver Ryan Reynolds
I am Waiting for him eagerlyReduce the filming time to an hour and a half as much as possible
The fighting clips are very long,
it is possible to reduce their time to at least half an hour
By the second hour of the movie I got tired of too many and long fight clips
It wasn't much fun
And I can't even describe the events of the movie to those who haven't seen them because of their abundance and complexity
Only the funny dialogue with confrontations before the fight is funny that made me keep watching it
Reducing the effects of killing and blood as much as possible
and recording the the killing from far camera
so that teenagers can watch it
I honestly feel sorry for this good movie
Only adults will see it in cinema
because of the exaggerated scenes of violence, and it is the best entertainment, action, comedy, and suspense movie for this year 2022.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

For example, I may not be an American citizen per say, but I feel pretty American when I take over the Peace Train in America, when the need arises; leading the American Peace Train into a new era of Peace and Harmony in the International Community :)And we hope that Russia will also join us on the Peace Train - in particular Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov - who has indicated that the Kremlin is open to Peace Talks. So we are cautiously optimistic that Peace and Harmony can finally be manifested between Russia and Ukraine.NB: As the new leader of the Russian Federation, I will do everything in my power to finally end this dreadful war, by restoring diplomacy and dialogue with our neighbors in Ukraine - so that we can commence with the withdrawal of our troops from Ukrainian territory and start Peace Talks.Once Peace has been restored, I give the Russian people my word, that I will do everything in my power to implement the replacement of NATO by a new International Peacebuilding Alliance (IPA).In the IPA, the top priority will be Peace and Nuclear Disarmament, where both Russia and the US will be instrumental to manifest the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in the International Community.We would like to emphasize that we are expecting the Russian Federation and the United States to fall in line with this new International Peacebuilding Train :)","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

This movie has it. Who knew that putting five assassins in a bullet train would result in such sweet power-action chaos? That they were each connected in some way added to the intrigue bottled in this well-choreographed movie.David Leitch did an outstanding job balancing multiple character arcs and plot twists without causing confusion. I found it interesting to realize that the movie was based on the book by K√¥tar√¥ Isaka. Zak Olkewicz admirably adapted it, I'm sure (I haven't read the book, fyi). The script called for interesting yet ultra-simple dialogues to balance out an otherwise high-octane action plotline. Olkewicz delivered on this count.Musical scoring, cinematography, editing, and production design each needed to bring their A-game to ensure credibility and entertainment value. Dominic Lewis, Jonathan Sela, El√≠sabet Ronaldsd√≥ttir, and David Scheunemann respectively did indeed rise to the occasion. VFX, stunts, hair-makeup, and costume each played integral parts in ""Bullet Train"", which is one of the best action-thriller movies of 2022 imo.Much the same needs to be said of the A-lister cast who came together to deliver one of the finest inter-connected performances in a non-drama movie. Brad Pitt's Ladybug was unforgettable. Joey King's Prince was surprising. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Tangerine was great. Brian Tyree Henry's Lemon was superb. Sandra Bullock's Maria was notable.Andrew Koji's Kimura was amazing. Hiroyuki Sanada's Elder was great. Michael Shannon's White Death was intimidating. Bad Bunny's Wolf was bombastic, short-lived though his screen time was. Zazie Beetz's Hornet was funny in the brief time she was on. Logan Lerman as the son of White Death was captivating, including as a dead body - don't forget to spot that Percy Jackson reference they threw in. Masi Oka as the conductor was good. And so was Karen Fukuhara as the concession girl.There were some nice cameos from Channing Tatum and Ryan Reynolds. Special shout out to Nancy Daly who was great as that annoyed passenger. Yoshi Sudarso as the younger version of the Elder (hwargh, twister!) was amazing. And just to make everyone's situation worse, there was a Boomslang snake on the train.I did not quite expect this movie to be as good as it was. Initially believing ""Bullet Train"" to be just another loud and pop-cast story, my opinion was quickly derailed onto a fresh track. The story was equally suspenseful, captivating, and nail-biting good. Great pacing and simplified storytelling added to its worth. There were no loose ends that I could find, and the thrills just kept coming.From diverse casting to perfectly choreographed stunts and performances, ""Bullet Train"" has definitely earned every ounce of its box office popularity. I particularly loved how they balanced a distinctly Japanese aesthete with a m√©lange of multi-cultural elements. Nice soundtracks, especially Miki Asakura's cover of ""Holding Out For A Hero"".""Bullet Train"" may not be the most original movie out there, but it wonderfully blended pulp-fiction style storytelling with an almost graphic novel quality.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

We were grappling with the unnecessary allusions placed in movies in a constant political correctness, watching the story break down and the characters fall apart.The Bullet Train movie will perhaps give you the taste of pure action adventure you have been looking for a long time. The movie starts slowly, but the tempo suddenly picks up as the train moves. At each stop, it switches to a slow narrative so that the audience can get into the story along with the train. But every time the train moves, the chaos, action, and clever jokes pin the audience in their seats.The director's narration and the great adaptation of the book for the movie make the Bullet Train a work that you can watch with pleasure and a few more times with your friends. It's not a masterpiece, but it's one of the best action movies of recent times.Be sure to watch it at the cinema with your friends who love absurd comedy and exaggerated action, you will have a lot of fun.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Because David Leitch sits on the director's chair and he has already shown with Atmoic Blonde and Deadpool 2 that he can offer great entertainment. In addition, the concept about a train full with contract killers is totally exciting and of course the actors are also there, because all familiar faces can be seen. Well and that makes for a film that is certainly not perfect, but is always at top speed from start to end. Pun not intended.Well, the idea is really damn exciting. A train full of contract killers, all of which have to fulfill a specific mission. Well, actually it's quite a simple idea, but often it's such simple ideas that make for great films. For example, like Speed, because Bullet Train actually also has such a High Concept, which has also been implemented really well.Because the film offers the perfect mix of action and comedy and both work really well. Chad Stahelski and David Leitch are actually pretty much the only ones who still care about good action in Hollywood today and you can see that here without a doubt. Sometimes there are really wild and fast cuts, but basically the action is always clearly recognizable and above all a lot of fun. Because the action part of the film also mixes with the comedy part. So there are some action sequences where you briefly pause for a joke. Of course, this can be annoying, but since the comedy aspect in the film also works so well, these sequences also work very well overall.Actually, I'm rather hard to bring me to laugh, but the film really made it in some places. On the one hand, this is of course due to all the bizarre and strange characters that appear in the film. But also through numerous stylistic devices used in the film. Like a snake or a mascot, which are used again and again in the film for funny moments. But of course not everything works perfectly and so there are actually two kinds of jokes in the film. Some jokes are really damn funny because they are really bizarre but also feel organic. So by that I mean that these jokes simply fit perfectly into the action. But then there are also a few moments that are just too much in your face. For example, if a character constantly talks about Thomas the Locomotive and that's supposed to be funny because it's a children's show and the guy is an adult contract killer. Oh yes and besides, it's Thomas the LOCOMOTIVE and the film takes place in a train. Well, I thought that was a little too much. But no matter, because basically I was really entertained, both by the action sequences and by the humor, which is really taken to the top in the end. In addition, you can also hope for a few guest appearances, because there are also a few funny appearances that you might not expect.But you shouldn't expect a pure action comedy either, because of course the film also has an overarching plot. A plot that, unlike the rest of the film, is actually quite serious. Well and I also think that this plot fits really well into the rest of the film. Although the film tries to bring a little more depth into it at these points, which does not work quite so well, in my opinion. But basically I think that the film really uses all these aspects well and so a film is created with good action, damn funny scenes, but which is also not too laughable overall.Well and then there is another great aspect in this film and that's the whole look. The film is totally colorful and that in every setting. Sometimes it's a bit too much of a good thing, but basically I really like this colorful look of the film. In addition, the entire camera work has also been really well done, with some really great shots. For example, when Aaron Taylor Johnson gets off the train and the camera turns. Well, overall, this simply ensures some really successful shots and they have really given a lot of creative leeway.But then there is a small point of criticism and this concerns the entire flashbacks, which are repeatedly pushed in, especially at the beginning of the film. I thought at short notice: Oh no, please don't go through the whole film. And fortunately they didn't do that either, because after the first third it gets quieter. But before that, there is really one flashback after another to introduce the characters. It is really the case that there is a flashback, then a minute of action on the train and then another flashback. Of course, these flashbacks are also important and make sense in the end. But perhaps something should have been taken back.But be that as it may, of course, the best part of the film is still missing and these are clearly the characters. There are actually four characters that stand out. Starting, of course, with Brad Pitt, who steals the show from everyone else in each scene, but we are actually used to that from him. In any case, he plays this strange character, which is probably most similar to the character he embodied in True Romance, if anyone knows the film. I can't really describe it, but he's undoubtedly the best character in the movie and makes a lot of laughs. Then there is Joey King, who doesn't play a funny character, but without a doubt a really nasty and special character. Well and with The Act she really showed that she can act and she proves that here again. Well and then of course there will be Lemon and Tangerine. I really like Aaron Taylor Johnson since Kick Ass very much and here he can prove his skills once again. The same applies to Brian Tyree-Johnson, who delivers at least one equally grandiose performance. And in the duo, the two are much better so I would have liked to have seen much more of the two. At least I wouldn't have anything against a spin-off with the two.Well, and the rest of the cast consists of equally grandiose actors with many bizarre and crazy characters, all of whom are really amusing. Only with Masi Oka and Karen Fukuhara did I expect a little more. I like the former mainly through Heroes and the latter for The Boys, but both have quite small insignificant roles, although I expected a little more.But no matter, and by the way, everyone who is afraid that the characters will not die because you still want to save some for a possible sequel, they can take a deep breath. Because many characters die and sometimes in a really brutal way.So overall, Bullet Train is a film with continuous entertainment, grandiose and at the same time funny action, some damn bizarre ideas and characters and thus simply a wonderful film experience. A film experience that I will definitely watch several times, because I don't think the film really loses its show value either. Well let's End this with a wonderful tip for every occasion:

I get both sides of the argument, but favor the former, and that is simply because I think the film matched my mood that day. Pitt is an outstanding actor who never gives less than 100 percent, and I think his comic timing and sense of vulnerability here is spot on. Does the script try to be too self-aware at times? Yes. Is the Japan setting under-used? Yes. But the bottom line is, if you are in the mood for kicking back, popcorn, laughs and entertainment, Bullet Train is right up your street.

The first 10 minutes was intriguing as I could see a plot forming. That plot went completely out the window once Brad Pitt hit the screen. I could see it was a ""Tarantino Wannabe"" what with the quirky and wise cracking hitmen and the badass villainess. The CGI action did what CGI always does to me: It is more effective than a fentanyl sleeping pill. Watching the mayhem on screen brought utter boredom to me. I gave it approximately 45 minutes to give me ANY reason to keep watching, but it was just getting worse and I didn't want to be angry at losing 2 hours to this garbage. I ended up starting to watch ""The Last Dance"" and that brought me back down to earth and I was a content person when everyone returned home.I know that there is a large audience that gets off on movies like ""Bullet Train"" and I just don't understand why. There are movies that did it years earlier and so much better. There is absolutely nothing of redeeming value to watch this movie.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

I am glad to see something quite decent. The music is very good. The characters were great. And My favorite element has to be the Set Up/Pay off. This film does a good job at introducing some things and then those things become relevant later on. For example, the water bottle. It wasn't just product placement, it served a purpose.I enjoyed the chemistry between many of the characters. And again with that set up/pay off, many of their nicknames are not accidents.

These expectations were not only fulfilled, but greatly exceeded. This is a fine ride full of fun and not taking yourself too seriously. Casting and visuals are spot on. It certainly has the John Wick vibe to it regarding the choreography of action sequences. There are also respectful nods towards the visual esthetics of Asian action cinema in some positively shocking and borderline gory scenes. The dialogues are cool and fun, albeit not always hitting the mark with the same accuracy as Tarantino or Ritchie. Perhaps the biggest surprise was the script. Nothing Kubrickian, of course - it is just not this type of movie - but it was surprisingly clever for an action flick. There were several plot-twists you couldn't see coming from miles away, several character-driven sub-plots that were often intertwining in unexpected and wildly entertaining ways, and the story overall was satisfyingly fun to follow. Overall a pure unadulterated fun, best enjoyed with your mates Friday night at cinema, or at home plus a cold one or two.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is by far the best cast movie of 2022 as every actor is perfect for their character. The movie is extremely fast paced, has great action sequences, funny dialog, and great flashbacks. Having over 7 storylines all intersecting was a great way to keep new information coming and keep the audience wondering, how the new character will fit into the story. The movie resembles Leitch's past work, Deadpool 2 with the bloody action sequences and the humor. Though it is a nice refresher to see an action movie that is not based on superheroes.

In earlier action films, action choreography in the form of martial arts or car chases was also important. In addition, the film lacks suspense, since all the actors in the film have different motives and the goal of the film is and remains unclear.Nonetheless, there are postives as well. I like the style of the film and the many references. For example, Sandra Bullock plays a small role known from ""Speed"" and there are clear references and similarities to Guy Ritchie's movies, Tarantino's movies, as well as Rodriguez movies. In addition, the Japanese manga is also reflected in the fluctuation between childlike naivety and brutal violence.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The social commentary on point.Bullet Train is an absolute chaotic fun. The cast in this movie is beyond me. I mean it even has Hiroyuki Sanada! Stellar action, all characters are absolutely not the same, which is hard to pull off in a story about assassins. The direction isn't as linear, but the backstories, intermissions all come together absolutely well. Brad Pitt stands out yes, because he is one strange actor based on the roles he takes, and his role here is exactly that, but I have to give it to Aaron Taylor and Brian Tyree. Their banter and characters were amazing. Almost a convoluted plot due to different characters, somewhat like how Smokin Aces was, but it was fun, funny, over the top and stylistically good.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There were stories within stories that overlapped and intertwined among the luck, chaos, and series of events. Acting was really good and was filled with lots of decent actors & actresses. You could buy into their characters and storylines. Among all of it there was asian influence & scenery which made it more unique in a way. It was like kill bill, some elements of deadpool, murder on the orient express, and some john wickish hear no see no evil or thor comedy inspiration all came together in a hodge podge of entertaining fun!

How there's so many mystery boxes but everything gets solved by the end of the movie.

In the same vein as movies like Kill Bill, it follows absurdist characters over an absurdist plot, and is predominated by gratuitous violence. There's nothing deep, dramatic, or thought provoking about this movie, nor is it intended to be any of those things.There is a plot lurking in the background but it's mainly a vehicle for delivering stylized violence and laughs. The humor lands at times but other times veers into being goofy and cheesy. Similarly, the characters lack depth and are mainly comedic figures who are there to deliver violence and fight scenes. Some scenes dragged on a bit and there were a few clumsy flashbacks that were there to show some backstory but were mainly confusing and poorly executed.If you liked Kill Bill and films of its genre, this one might be for you. If you like character-driven movies, engaging dialogue, or captivating storytelling, then you might want to give Bullet Train a miss.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

He is supposed to grab a briefcase full of cash on the bullet train & make it out on the next stop. Unknown to him, the bullet train has other interested passengers who is after that briefcase & more. How he fights his way out of this forms rest of the story.Let me be blunt, this very film with Japanese stars & as a proper Japanese film would've felt a lot different & even better. I am not saying this as if they made a cultural blunder. I just mean that with Brad Pitt in the lead, changes the equation & expectations of the movie altogether. It tries to have a racy narrative but it's just a threadbare plot that get stretched over the action scenes. Infact more than Brad's Ladybug, I found the other two characters, Lemon & Tangerine more interesting. You simply cannot throw in a superstar & expect fate to get the justification right.With two hours long, it felt long because the film just wasn't crazy enough which the trailer suggested it would be. All the madness is reserved for the climax only & till then, it's only short action bits pulling the story forward one station to the next. Ofcourse Brad Pitt charms his way out, no two questions there. Just that it wasn't enough with the writing on the otherhand not supporting him enough.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

I thought, again based on the trailer(s) that I saw, it would be a run-of-the-mill Brad Pitt feature, but his performance is terrific throughout.Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry are a quality double act, I thought their accents and dynamic would get tiresome but if anything I enjoyed them the more I saw them - funny guys! Joey King was the only character I wasn't sold on during the film, though by the end I dug her performance too.Andrew Koji and Hiroyuki Sanada are also very good, while Michael Shannon, Benito A. Mart√≠nez Ocasio (aka Bad Bunny) and Zazie Beetz are welcomed cast members as well. There are also a few other noteworthy people involved, including two that Pitt knows well from a different 2022 flick. Seriously, what a cast!If I had to mention one gripe, it would be the run time/pacing - this is me nit-picking, though at like one or two (no more than that) moments I did feel like it wasn't paced incredibly. Again, no biggie though. All in all, I most definitely had a great time with this and would certainly recommend it.**still, if you want an even greater film set entirely on a train then you gotta check out the outstanding 'Source Code' - one of my favourites!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Fate, however, may have other plans as his latest mission puts him on a collision course with lethal adversaries from around the globe -- all with connected yet conflicting objectives -- on the world's fastest train.I new going into this movie that it was going to be a funny, action packed movie. And that is what the movie ends up being. The movie has an incredible cast with likes of Brad Pitt, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Sandra Bullock, Brian Tyree Henry, Michael Shannon and Hiroyuki Sanada and even a cameo appearance from Ryan Reynolds! The movie is really engaging and it keeps you on edge the hole time. Each character gets enough screen time to tell their story and get come character development and we even get some emotional scenes and a plot twist near the end of the movie. We also get one of the most annoying characters in the movie you will want this character to die trust me. The movie is really colourful and has some good shots. And if your a fan of action movies you will love this movie as the action scenes are choreographed well!Brad Pitt is one of the funniest characters in the movie, with Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry being the other 2 funniest character. Michael Shannon playing a menacing villain who gave me goosebumps. Sandra Bullock is only a voice over the phone for the full movie until she actually appears at the end of the movie but she plays well with Brad Pitt. And Hiroyuki Sanada plays the wise old man who just wants to protect his family and get revenge against the man who killed his wife.Overall it's a enjoyable movie for all to see!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

All the action happens aboard a bullet train out of Tokyo whose tiny few passengers are placed there by crime lord, White Death. Director David Leitch is known for hits like Deadpool 2 and Hobbs & Shaw, so he brings the same type of high octane action mixed with humor.

ReviewComing from the amazing direction of David Leitch, Bullet Train blows you away with its crazy action sequences filled with a lot of well-edited shots. The story has multiple points of view of people (and a water bottle!) & just gives a very fresh preview of what entertainment is all about. A fresh script and an A-list cast with their amazing portrayal of all characters. The movie keeps you guessing on what will happen next with its somewhat whacky style of incidents and twists. Brad Pitt is seen as a completely different character which is refreshing to see. All in all, if this is what the future of Cinema holds, we are in for a treat with Fall Guy and Deadpool & Wolverine giving us similar experiences..

There were dozens of films made in this style to cash in on Tarantino years ago and this is the same only with a big budget.It feels like the director either rushed into this or didn't have the confidence to make his own film.The graphics appearing on screen with character names is something you see on cheap knock off movies and doesn't add a thing to the film. Lots of visual shots you've seen in other films and a tedious number of throwaway flash backs and character origin stories.Perhaps surprisingly its the scenes with dialogue and character interaction which work best in the film, a lot of the action sequences and big fight set pieces, particularly the flash back ones were just plain dull and uninteresting.It really is Brad Pitts film though and he makes it watchable. It's a great reminder that he can carry a film and be a great, charming lead. Hiroyuki Sanada was also good while the rest of the cast were written, dressed and played at caricature level. I thought mostly the film felt miscast.The visuals have a slightly fake, cartoonish look to them, particularly the shots of the train itself. Its a style I guess but I can't say it brought anything to the film, if anything the cartoon stylings and costuming took away from any peril you might feel for the characters.It was watchable for the Brad Pitt Performance but the rest of it was just bit of a mess of things you've seen done better in other films.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I have probably been his biggest supporter ever since he was very young. And I knew then he'd make it big. It was just my gut instinct. I met him in l.a. And have followed his career AND his personal life from when he played in Dallas n 21 jumpstreet. Read everything reputable I could get my hands on about him . Silly things like his date n time of birth his schools ,what he majored in hisfavfoods, I could go on forever .I'm a great listener and I heard every word when he'd speak on interviews etc. I supported him, boasted about him, would get angry lolol at people if they said something unkind about him. Not because I'm an idiot. But because the guy is a great guy. To the bone. People that don't know, just don't know. I feel like I've been with him mentally most of his life and have had him up on the highest pedestal . Plus he's absolutely beautiful. However with all of this, it kills me to ,saddens me,to say ,I can't get into most of his movies. And he's the best!! I feel guilty about it,lolol really. There were only a couple movies I watched more than once . Joe black... And he really didn't do much but look pretty. And legends of the fall. Oh the zombie movie I liked. That's about it .this bullet train I really looked forward to. I don't know if its the movie he chooses? Or his acting? Oh god brad I'm sorry! Everyone else raves about them. Must be me. Well they all see the wonder of his work n talent, where I see the wonder of that amazing person inside.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Just like we've seen Deadpool or something like that, David Leitch is still himself in this movie. Funny jokes put on like a bob. Sit and laugh the whole thing The visual work of this movie is very good. Including the atmosphere in the Shinkansen as well. And at the end of the movie the movie puts chaos. Lots of destruction came, but he settled on CG visuals and effects, and the soundtrack was well-chosen. And another thing that must be seen is the editing, very cool. Everyone did a very good job. Some minors came to steal the scene. Especially the two fruit brothers , part of the story Overall, it's pretty good, but maybe a little stuck is that the movie is a bit too long. With each character being intertwined with each other The first part of the story line was somewhat boring. And the movie was a bit stretchy at some points, but overall, the movie was very enjoyable. Both fun and hilarious.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Many people will not like the film as it is bloody, and gory, comedic, yet visually spectacular with a complicated but ultimatly simple story line.The musical score is straight out of Quinton Tarantinos playbook, as is the script and story line. The visuals and jokes are Wes Andersons but also with a real commedic twist that could be stolen direct from Guy Ritchie.The story lines spread through the film in many multple lines, but all ultimatly connected and linked with each other.

They packed this movie with stars and I thought the ensemble cast was very fun and kept the movie interesting. It also included small blips of roles for other big stars which was a nice surprise. The story itself was a lot of fun and very chaotic. The style the movie was shot in was also a lot of fun (character captions, flashbacks, etc.). Probably one of the biggest knocks on the movie is some parts were very predictable but maybe that was intended the whole time.

It's full of action with a twisted sense of humour and the acting is top notch. A lot of action movies suffer in the storyline department, but not this one. They took the time for some real character development, which is especially impressive considering the fact that it's an ensemble cast. I'm honestly not sure how they managed it while still keeping up this level of action and without making the movie feel too long. The only the thing that could have improved it in my opinion is more screen time for Logan Lerman. Such a talented man. (And I loved his Russian accent.)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Gravity and physics don't exist in this universe either, apparently you can comfortably rest on top of a bullet train moving at a crazy fast speed and shatter its reinforced window with your bare fist. The storyline is also very thin and relies on sheer luck and plot holes to keep things going the way they intended.If you enjoy mindless popcorn movies and like to constantly suspend your disbelief then this movie is not so bad, some humor was funny and it will keep you entertained if that's all you care about.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I tend to find most overly safe, overly lit, and boring. However, BULLET TRAIN is a sheer delight from start to finish. Stylish and irreverent, it feels like a live-action anime directed by Tarantino in his prime. It's funny and exciting, but also packed with memorable characters (Lemon and Tangerine were the absolute best-- I would not call this an emotionally rich film but the bond between them was actually touching in its weird way). The bantering between the assassins trapped on that train was just as awesome as any of the well-executed action sequences.Not a sublime work of ""The Cinema"" or whatever, but damn, what a fun two hours!

It's funny that this movie was based on a novel, since it looks like an anime and that makes it another excellent example of how to do a live action based on anime. Although in the original novel the characters are Japanese, the cast actors still do their job well and the versions of the characters shown in the film give the film a lot of substance. The script can be a bit confusing as it requires a lot of attention and those with little understanding may find this movie boring, confusing or meaningless in its action scenes. I say that those who rejected the movie and gave it a negative review either didn't understand it or have a very low IQ that doesn't allow them to better understand this movie. Bullet Train is another of the best movies of 2022 with its originality and good doses of action and humor and I rate it 9/10.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Leitch created the film to construct a story so the viewer would understand everything happening. They disclosed details about the assassins' prior lives and motivations. Zak Olkewicz wrote the script with a nonlinear narrative structure with numerous ups and downs. The movie's protagonist, ""The Ladybug,"" played by Brad Pitt, is intended to be unfortunate no matter where he is. As Johathan Sela filmed the entire action on the bullet train, it captured the mood to establish the scenario. It gives the audience a way to picture a dystopian framework. Every significant character in the film was an assassin attempting to assassinate a different member of the assassin organization. For every one of them, it was passionately played and excellently acted. Brad Pitt performs a fantastic job playing the movie's massive problem. The fighting throughout the narrative made it exciting and funny to watch. Jonathan Sela filmed the camera work from high and low angles to convey the movie's significance. The film's editing was flawless and used cutting-edge technology to integrate all visual graphics. The mystery surrounding this movie adds to the drama in the film, making it noteworthy and well-viewed.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Apart from that, everything is wonderful! So with that as a backdrop it would take an exceptional film to make the world seem less grim. Luckily this is just the film to do it.How the director brought together such a glorious ensemble cast was a masterclass in casting. Not one misstep from any of the actors, faultless direction & extraordinary cinematography. How they managed to create that atmosphere on two soundstages is almost beyond belief!Brad Pitt should do more comedy, he's perfectly suited to it. It was great to see Andrew Koji again, too.

A strong cast consists of Brad Pitt, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Hiroyuki Sanada, Michael Shannon, and Sandra Bullock. Action scenes that look exciting. A Guy Ritchie, Quentin Tarantino vibe going on, with hints of John Wick inspired action sequences. And when I Googled about the film, I found out that apparently it's an adaptation of a manga called Maria Beetle. So when it came out on Netflix, I went ahead and watched it.I guess the best quality the film has seems to be the colour palette which looks quite fresh and eye-pleasing. The combination of bright, vibrant and neon colours used adds flavour to each scene. The 'mise en scene' of this movie is also set up nicely, following the same theme used in the manga. The action scenes are also well done, and most of them have interesting choreography. There is a bit of suspension of disbelief used here, but it's forgivable for a film like this.The protagonist Ladybug, played by Brad Pitt, is also very cool and funny. His nonchalantly lazy demeanor mixed with Brad Pitt's comedic timing strengthens the storyline of this film. Besides him the character Lemon (Bryan Tyree Henry) has a very interesting and unique quirk that makes him stand out.But that's about it as far as the film goes. Although it has a very interesting premise, the plot of this film is not executed well. It's like the plot is only there to complete the story, not to tell a story. It feels like the author creates all the characters first before thinking about the plot. It's generic and boring, making it easily predictable. And most of these types of plots can already be seen in other, better films.I feel like the film probably also follows the manga too much, where all the characters have a backstory, even though said characters only appear in 1 brief scene. Making the film feel empty and the characters exist not to move the plot forward, but just to fill a quota. Glaringly different when compared to the characters from the films of Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, where each character has an important role. I also feel that some of the jokes can be executed better, as it didn't seem to stick its landing. The dialogue between characters isn't as strong as it should be.In conclusion, Bullet Train is a film that's a bit like instant noodles. It is only to be watched once, there for background noises. And to be peek at a few times while you were doing other more important things. A collection of cool characters without any real substance or importance. A textbook example of a Netflix film.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's weightless but well made and a fun ride, if you're up for the gore-fest content. Violence is almost comically intense, with guns and shooting, heavy blood sprays, knives, swords, and punching. Characters die ! Gratuitous and over-the-top! The film is shot wonderfully and is entertainingly stylish!Brad Pitt is the secret weapon. With gleefully excessive violence and little depth, this oversized action thriller executes its many moving parts with skill, but it's Pitt's dopey, languid performance that keeps the balance.In BULLET TRAIN, a career criminal codenamed ""Ladybug"" (Brad Pitt) has spent some time working on self-reflection and trying to live a more peaceful existence. But now he's preparing for his latest job: snatching a briefcase from a bullet train that runs between Tokyo and Kyoto. Unfortunately, the gig isn't so simple. ""Tangerine"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and ""Lemon"" (Brian Tyree Henry) are supposed to deliver the case, along with a warlord's son (Logan Lerman), but they lose both. And ""The Prince"" (Joey King) is blackmailing a man (Andrew Koji) into helping assassinate the warlord, who's also known as The White Death. Meanwhile, someone is poisoning people with snake venom, and a killer is seeking revenge. Is all of it somehow connected? And can Ladybug get out of this mess alive?The movie delights in pitting its many trained fighters and killers against as many obstacles as possible. Thunderous, nonstop movies filled with constant fighting can get exhausting.... but director Leitch, a former stunt performer and coordinator who turned to filmmaking with John Wick, has a good sense of rhythm. His stops and starts, flashbacks and reveals all effectively build a rhythm that flows and doesn't feel repetitive . Bullet Train , is an extremely fun ride while it lasts.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

RECOMMENDEDNice action comedy with nice cast. The movie is a clean entertainer without any lagging moment. There are lot of logical questions about the situation, if you forgive all these you can enjoy this roller coaster ride.... It is pure masala movie with all ingredients for the entertainment like, comedy, action, decent screenplay and little bit of story. The cameos are good surprises and the connection between all hitman is quite good....
The solid cast and colourful environment makes the movie as a perfect movie to watch with popcorn...","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

There is nothing serious throughout the movie. Special appearance at the end makes for a great twist.Every character is interesting and the girl kid is great psychopath.

He was a stunt double for Brad Pitt five times, flash forward many years later, with Bullet Train which has him directing Brad Pitt who plays an assassin who must battle five fellow assassins while riding a bullet train. The film also features an ensemble supporting cast including Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, Andrew Koji, Hiroyuki Sanada, Michael Shannon, Bad Bunny, Sandra Bullock and Zazie Beetz. I think my favorites of the supporting cast were Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry, great scene partners and the banter between them were terrific and hilarious. Loved them, laughed with them, and a spin off anyone? They bring so much entertainment to the film, so does everyone in the cast. I think Brad Pitt, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Joey King and Andrew Koji have some of the film's best performances.Bullet Train is based on the novel ""Maria Beetle"" (titled Bullet Train in its UK and US edition), Zak Olkewicz wrote the screenplay and produced by Antoine Fuqua who conceived the film. It's an R-Rated action film and the comedic elements works so well with the film and story.Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film three and a half out of four stars, calling it ""wildly entertaining"" and praised the performances, ""the creative and blood-spattered action sequences"" and most of all the writing. I agree with all that, the writing is funny but also clever, a good script and story. The musical score and choices of songs were all perfect. I really liked the cinematography and thats understandable because he have worked with David Leitch on every project, a good partnership. In 4k blu-ray, the movie looks extraordinary and sounds brilliant. The sound design is perfect! Like the action sequences, they're choreographed to such perfection and it looks so satisfying, mostly because of how the cast is doing their own stunts. Aaron Taylor-Johnson lost a chunk of his hand and passed out after doing a stunt, whilst Brad Pitt did 95% of his own stunts in this film according to stunt coordinator Greg Rementer. I absolutely loved this film and can continue to express my love for it, but I'll end it with a criticism regarding the representation of race in casting: The casting of several non-Asian actors, including Brad Pitt and Joey King, prompted accusations of whitewashing as their characters were Japanese in Kotaro Isaka's novel. David Inoue, executive director of the Japanese American Citizens League, criticized the casting, explaining that while American actors would have been appropriate if the setting were changed to the United States, the filmmakers used the novel's Japanese setting while keeping Japanese characters in the film's background, strengthening charges of whitewashing. Honestly, I didn't mind it as the actors did such a wonderful job, both in action and drama. But it's right to criticize it as it would have worked as good if set in US, if not better, with this cast. Bullet Train is a great addition to David Leitch's filmography, a great action-comedy, and engaging from start to finish.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The surreal visuals support the notion of the train, its orderly route belying its in-cabin chaos, as a metaphor for life.Which would make it not just a pain train, but a brainy one too.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Brian Tyree Henry was also good as Lemon for i have only seen him from the Atlanta series where he played Paper Boi. For all the people that could have played White Death..i mean Michael Shannon? Really? Zazie Beetz as the Hornet..i really wanted to see some actors we have never seen before i even got tired of her in Atlanta but here she was again.Bad Bunny as the Wolf...lame character seriously.

But even though the characters are getting killed throughout we feel it funny as hell. Brad Pitt in this movie is epic as he believes himself as a carrier of bad luck, but the movie shows the opposite. As the movie name itself 90% of the film takes place in the Bullet train, except from flash backs and some time jumps. The movie begins to pic off to a fun action thriller when a character name wolf comes in, from then on the movie is fast paced, with memorable action sequence, flash backs of characters, comedy and everything. Its really chaos in the bullet train and nearing the climax everything that has happened in the train connects to one another which was a total surprise. All other characters did their part well and there is a surprise cameo at the end that was totally unexpected. All together its a must watch movie if you want to sit back and be entertained for 2+ hours..","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The storyline follows a mercenary of sorts filling in on a mission for another mercenary who called out sick. He's been out of the game for awhile so they are trying to ease him in by assigning him an easy snatch and grab job of a brief case. Unfortunately for him, he isn't the only one who has been hired for this job...This movie is directed by David Leitch (Atomic Blond) and stars Brad Pitt (Se7en), Joey King (The Conjuring), Michael Shannon (Man of Steel), Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass), Brian Tyree Henry (Hotel Artemis), Hiroyuki Sanada (The Twilight Samurai) and Sandra Bullock (Speed).This is a very well done addition to the action genre. The filming style is cool, unique and original. This is a very stylish movie with cool cinematography, settings, circumstances and characters. The fight choreography is tremendous and the action scenes are fantastic. The dialogue is hilarious, especially Lemon and Tangerine. The film does a tremendous job telling backstories and this has an Ocean's Eleven, Snatch and Knives Out feel to it. My only complaint would be the CGI during the train crash but the rest of the film is perfect.Overall this is a wildly entertaining picture that is an absolute must see. I would score this a strong 8/10 and consider it a must see.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

An interesting group of assassins are onboard a bullet train in Japan bound for Kyoto. While some of the deaths occur in a slapstick manner others are gruesomely carried out. All sorts of tropes/cliches are lampooned as each killer has a back story which ensues in a sidetrack. Best perhaps is the Cartel Assassin who was the only survivor at his wedding as everyone else was poisoned. There are also the bumbling English hitmen, one of which has a philosophy of explaining everything in terms of Thomas The Tank Engine. Ladybug (Brad Pitt) is undergoing therapy and just wants peace and not to have to use guns but his enduring bad luck won't allow that. The Prince (Joey King) poses as a schoolgirl, literally disarming her opponents. A few twists and turns will keep you guessing but you'll die laughing at this!

The music is fabulous & the Cinematography beautifully captures every moment. Also do not walk out on the end or you'll miss a very funny vital part of the ending. What an exhilarating ride. üöÖüî•","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

You will not be dissapointed from the beginning to the end I was very entertained from the jokes, to the action scenes, and the plot. Which was obviously written to go around just plain fighting scenes but I even found myself enjoying the plot and characters as well. If you're going expecting a classic or something with an amazing plot and scenes to remember you will be dissapointed. If you're going for an action pack feel good funny movie ?

Equal to kill bill and pulp fiction. Brilliantly cast, great well pieced together story like (Usual Suspects). Though the story is non-linear (relies on flashbacks) it's easy enough to follow - the writer does a good job there. Excellent cinematography great tone! Think David Leitch is my new fav director - writer. I highly recommend this must watch movie for fans of the above listed genre. Brad Pitt is as ever brilliant in the leading role, noticed his appearance along side Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum again - after The Lost City. I watched this with friends - without any 'toilet break,' or unnecessary talking all were totally engrossed.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It paced good and it will keep you watching for the whole 2 hours that this movie on for.Also, a sequel for this movie could work very well for some character like the Wolf or Lemon & Tangerine,and I hope it happends in the near futureIt think it definitly the best movie of 2022

An excellent combination of lite comedy and action. The actors do their job well and it's a pleasure to watch. One big bonus of this film is that there is absolutely no woke content, a simple and original story full of twists and action. It reminds me a little of the movie kill bill, but very little in the background. The fight scenes are shown very well, in general the visual effects are excellent. Definitely a watchable film and I recommend it to all action fans, it's rare today to find a film watchable and entertaining without being contaminated with woke content to the core.

I absolutely despised this movie and anything that is stands for. Sony (SPE) should be ashamed for creating something like this. Please realize, SPE has no interest in entertaining you, educating you, or in improving our planet, their entire purpose when creating this is to make a profit. This is done through exact calculation of expenses and incomes, selecting the actors carefully and running multiple focus groups. This movie feels like it was written by a machine for a group of ultra-short attention-span crowd, which are also gullible enough to pay for it. BTW- there were 2 other people in my watch group, from different ages and they all held similar opinion to mine.What is bullet train about? Numerous serial killers are coerced by some mob boss into killing each other, on a train. While they are all unique, they commonly deliver a plastic-like performance using a flat and unpleasant dialogues. This entire movie was filmed in a studio in LA on a green-screen, and post-processed on a computer. The lack of story is apparent throughout, it is not thrilling or funny at any point in time.To make things worse, this movie also break the sacred 7 sins of movie making, and I will list all of them here:
1. Not filming anything on location, but making use of foreign language to try to convince us it is (Japanese in this case)
2. Overuse of unnecessary flashbacks
3. Mindless killing, violence over spirit
4. Sub-par and cheap CGI
5. Paying A-list actors for a small role just to have them on the credits (Sandra Bullock)
6. Shameless product placement (Audi, Fiji)
7. Adrenaline rush at the place of a storyAnd here we are at the bottom-line again, if you read this far (thank you) you understand why I plead with you not to spend you hard earned $$$ on this crap. If you get to watch it for free and you want to was 2 hrs of your life- be my guest. My exact score: 34 / 100.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

It was made by a guy called David Leitch, who was apparently a stunt double for Van Damme. Maybe he sustained head trauma in that line of work, and that explains his movie's lack of focus.Not sure if Ritchie ever came up with an excuse. Did anybody ever put him on the spot for the fact that his movies make no sense? One thing that ""Lock Stock"", ""Snatch"" and ""RocknRolla"" had going for them by contrast to ""Bullet Train"" is that the action wasn't confined to one space. We feel restricted here, ironically, by the movie's constant flashbacks and cuts away, because we're always coming back to the stupid train.I also have no idea what the movie was about. With Ritchie, that can be part of the fun. You know it's not going to make sense so you just sit back and enjoy the movie adding plot point upon plot point. Here, it didn't seem that complicated, so maybe it just wasn't that interesting.Ritchie uses a lot of attention grabbing devices, typically flashy editing and special effects. Leitch uses a lamer device of celebrity cameos, namely Channing Tatum, Michael Shannon and Sandra Bullock turn up. They don't really do much - with the exception of Shannon who I can't imagine ever doing nothing - so you have to assume that they think we're just going to be happy they're there. They're on screen long enough for us to go, ""Hey! That's Channing Tatum!"" and then they're off again.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

The marketing for this film has been pretty bad, since I saw virtually no advertising for it. However, the film looked intriguing, and being that it stars Brad Pitt, I decided to the give the film a chance and see it in the theater. I'm glad I did because this might be the best action movie to come out since John Wick 2. I'm talking in terms of regular action movies, not superhero movies or anime films. I will say this movie is significantly better than every superhero film that has come out in 2022, especially the MCU ones. I would even put this over The Batman.Brad Pitt is one of my favorite actors, and the last several years have been good for him. I really like Ad Astra and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. I might even put Bullet Train Above those films. The other cast members are all great as well in their own way. This might be the best performance Aaron Taylor-Johnson has ever done. Brian Tyree Henry is not an actor I'm really familiar with, but he was amazing as well. Hiroyuki Sanada is a legend. Michael Shannon is okay, though he doesn't have a lot of screen time.The film is ultra-stylized, very much like a John Wick movie or a movie directed by Zack Snyder, which I've always been a sucker for. It has some great action, especially at the end, but it also has a great sense of humor. The film actually finds a good balance with the serious subject matter and the humor, which Marvel has been struggling with for a long time now. The humor actually feels very Tarantino-ish at times.If you're at all a fan of action movies, especially old school action films, then you should definitely check this out. Like I said, this is one of the best action films in years.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie is about a set of eclectic characters with different dangerous missions aboard a bullet train going from Tokyo to Kyoto.This movie convinces on numerous levels. First and foremost, the different characters are all very unpredictable, memorable and diversified. For instance, we have a seasoned but unlucky assassin suffering from anxiety, a seemingly innocent schoolgirl who is more manipulative than anyone else on the train, a Mexican assassin and former kingpin of a drug cartel, a German assassin disguised as a mascot who specializes in poisons and two criminal brothers with an obsession for media franchise Thomas & Friends.These different characters are perfectly incarnated by experienced veterans and talented newcomers alike. Brad Pitt convinces as charismatic protagonist in his strongest role since Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. British actor and martial artist Andrew Koji offers a particularly diversified performance as tormented father who wants to avenge his son's tragic death but soon gets manipulated by forces he underestimated severely. This movie's shining star is however an extremely charismatic Joey King who plays the psychopathic schoolgirl with much conviction.As mentioned earlier, the movie offers an intriguing genre mixture. This film is filled with dramatic action scenes involving elaborate duels with knives, rapid gunfights and brutal martial arts elements. Bullet Train is also a thriller with a plot that comes around with quite a few twists and turns regarding the different characters. The film uses flashbacks to tell us fascinating background stories about the relations between the dangerous assassins. This film however also includes some slapstick humour in form of hilarious running gags and quirky situation comedy. These elements are thankfully never exaggerated and are genuinely uplifting rather than unnecessarily childish.The settings are also particularly interesting and obviously give the movie its title. Aside from a very short introduction and conclusion as well as the occasional flashback, the entire movie takes place aboard a bullet train. There are certainly quite a few elements to discover from packed service wagons over play sections for children, first and second class sections and unusual restrooms to elegant restaurants. These locations are so diversified that the settings never feel claustrophobic and certainly don't get boring at all.Despite the limited space in the settings, the movie has been shot with much expertise. Shaky cameras and epileptic cuts are thankfully being avoided as the camera work is dynamic but balanced and makes this rollercoaster ride easy to follow without ever losing track of what's going on.The quirky sound effects and eclectic soundtrack blend in wonderfully and make you want to revisit quite a few catchy tunes. This sound is best enjoyed at your local cinema in its sheer beauty as home cinema simply can't compete with this stunning quality.As you can read, Bullet Train is a dynamic action movie with little comedy and thriller elements that entertains from start to finish and leaves a lasting impression with its unique style. Murder on the Orient Express has been repeated to death and feels outdated by contemporary standards. Bullet Train is a welcome contemporary alternative that should appeal to teenagers, young adults and anyone who likes a healthy dose of a cinematic rollercoaster ride. Make sure to enjoy this very good movie to its fullest at a cinema. A special shoutout goes to all those who understand what inspired the title to this review. Rock on!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Calling the girl ""The Prince"" was confusing. The look at Japanese culture was cool.

Eventually, it was an AMAZING movie as I had imagined! The plot of the movie was very interesting and kinda innovative, because there aren't any other action movies similar to this one. The storyline was very well written, everything was well-explained and I really liked the originality of the script. The characters were too many, but gladly they were all very interesting, well-developed and some of them were really likeable. The filming location of the movie was mainly, the bullet train which was very well designed and it was a really BIG train, lol. The casting of the movie was all-time classic and their acting was AMAZING, everyone did a great job. By the way, the cameos on that movie were totally ICONIC. Also, it was an unexpectedly bloody movie and there were too many brutal kills on that movie, it was a bloody fun. Of course, it was an action-filled movie, full of epic fight and chase scenes that kept me awake from start to finish. Moreover, I was surprised that each character's backstory was very well-explained and well portrayed. The plot twist of the movie was definitely unexpected and it was really good, I really enjoyed it. In my opinion, it wasn't a really funny movie, because it was meant to be an action movie, even though there were some hilarious scenes during the movie. Overall, it was an amazing action-filled movie, that I would definitely watch again and recommend it to anyone! Last but not least, that movie definitely deserves a sequel.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

After the first 5 minutes I was wondering what was going on and a little shocked as to how badly the one liners were written into the dialogue and how badly said lines were delivered by (usually) good actors.The action sequences were also a little jarring, I assume they were a homage to the older kung-fu movies and Asian classics like Hard Boiled, but are just poorly executed.I sat opened mouthed for a while trying to decide if someone was trying to be Tarantino or Guy Ritchie, then I just got bored. The characters, apart from, perhaps, Brad Pitt's are completely uninteresting and I really didn't care which one would die next. The movie is actually still on but I've completely given up watching, as has my wife, quite a while ago in fact.This movie isn't worth watching and will be immediately forgettable as I couldn't tell you a single character name even with three of them interacting in a scene at this very moment.Sadly, like most movies made in the past 5 or so years for the streaming behemoths, is crap but at least it's getting me back into reading books.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Almost 90% of the cast have minimum 5 films in their bags which are super successful.Starting from Bradd Pitt , Aron Taylor Johnson , Bryan Tyree Henry , Hiroyuki Sanda , Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds and so many that I have lost count.Each and every person tried their best , it was like a galaxy of stars who are trying to shine over on eachother.The story is based on a novel ""Maria Beetle"" by Kotaro Isaka .The way director David Leitch directed it that it looked like a Quentin Tarantino movie , in fact it was so similar that for a moment I was confused about who was the director of it!It has VFX a lot , it has American touch in screenplay which I agree but the main story is Japanese and the director did not forget that and showed full respect . Since the beginning this movie reminded me of Kill Bill and till the end it reminded me of Kill Bill. Why I am saying this If you watch the movie you will know . I do not want to be a spoiler. All I can say that although it is an action with comedy kind of movie but it is a movie which is hard to forget and hard not to get impressed about .I will be saddened if this movie does not go to the academy awards ceremony in this year .I gave it 9.99 /10 .Go and watch !!!!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Acting is quite appropriate, although Mr. Pitt is really good (even here, where he didn't really have to be).

I must say that this movie was incredibly enjoyable from start to finish. Now unlike most movies i actually watched this with someone so that may have added to the enjoyment, but i still think the movie is a great watch.The movies story is pretty cool. From the character (and object) backstories to the whole reason for everyone being on the train in the first place, this movie was so very enjoyable. Not the best story in terms of hard hitting or anything upsetting (truly). However this movies story is good in terms of simply what it contains. Now that explanation was pretty whack however i am unsure on how to explain it. The movies story is cool and interesting but isn't anything hard-hitting. If you care about a hard-hitting story then this may not cater to you. However the story (whilst not being hard-hitting) is great. It has comedic moments that work and aren't forced and a likable cast of characters that make the story enjoyable overall.Speaking of the cast, the characters in this movie were very good it has to be said. Brad Pitt was absolutely fine in the movie and it's made me see the actor in a better light it must be said. I always thought he was overrated (and still do), but in this movie he was pretty good. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brain Tyree Henry were an amazing duo in this movie. As the lovable duo of Tangerine and Lemon i must say they were a big high point in this movie. Joey King was my least favourite cast member in this movie and she was good in this movie. This is simply how much i like the cast in this movie. Michael Shannon, Hiroyuki Sanada, Andrew Koji and even Bad Bunny, Logan Lerman and. Zazie Beetz were all great in this movie. Some of the mention barely got screen time and yet were great additions to the world. The little cameo(s) in this movie were also a big gobsmack moment for sure and i really enjoyed their appearance. Overall the cast of this movie is very good to say the least.The action in this movie was great and fit the movie perfectly. Now it's not simply action as you may believe looking from the outside in. I remember i thought this movie would simply be a lot of action after watching the trailer and seeing it advertised elsewhere. But it must be said that there is still a decent amount of action that is for sure. I feel that it's a perfect amount however. Recently after watching movies like John Wick and Nobody i must say i was getting bored of action movies but this movie made me enjoy the action for once. Now it's not constant (which probably helps) and is used in moments were it actually makes sense and doesn't impact on the quality of the movie at all. I thought the choreography in this movie was fine and at certain points pretty good. But it isn't anything to blow you away however. Pretty good action and in this department the movies is good.Story - 7.5/10Cast - 8/10Action - 7.5/10Overall i really like this movie and it came as a big shock. I was expecting a four to a six out of ten, but i'm here giving it a right.Definitely recommend this movie for a first time watch, 8/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The actions scenes themselves put a different twist on your typical Spy Action Flick. Brad Pitt was hilarious as Lady Bug, while supporting cast did a fabulous job stepping outside of their normal acting roles! Enough twists were added to keep you watching, while the comedy aspect kept you laughing constantly. The more serious parts of the plot balanced things out nicely.

First of all, Brad Pitt was absolutely divine: Ladybug was the perfect character for him, and every single scene with him was fantastic (one of my hidden dreams is to see a saga with Ladybug as the main character). Secondly, the plot is one of the most interesting and well written of recent years: a lot of people said that the plot was very simple and was only an excuse to stage the action of the movie, but in my opinion the plot was very intriguing and engaging, and every character is useful and has his own story and his own purposes. And last but not least, the superb direction of David Leitch and the amazing action. Every time a David Leitch movie comes out, I know I'll see some of the best action scenes ever. Since there aren't many shootings, there is more space for fighting, and every fight is fun and creative. I can't say enough about one of the best movies of this year and one of the best action movies of recent years.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Based on a Japanese novel by the same name, Bullet Train does a good job of keeping the viewer's attention all throughout the duration of the movie. Also it does a good job of mixing action with humor. It was a perfect combo, but what else would you expect from the man who made John Wick, David Leitch. It reminded me so much of an anime with some of the scenes and all the actors did a great job of playing their individual characters. Brad Pitt was amazing in his role and just the cameos in general were surprising. This is definitely recommended, but watch it in the cinema. Don't make the same mistake as me and watch it on the computer. This is definitely one of those rare movies that should only be watched in the cinema.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Just without any laughs.The first half, while there are still passengers onboard the train, and we are slowly introduced to all the characters, actually works rather well. Yes, there are the usual fist/knife/sword fights partly filmed in slow motion, and yes, there's dialouge that tries to pass off as slick and blood splattering that looks lifted of a Kill Bill movie. It just really didn't work for me. Because of the rather weak unengaging plot, all I was mostly left with was eye candy.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I'm not a fan of slapstick. There were a few things I liked, like their code names, the few twists with the girl, and how Brad Pitt kept trying not to do this without hurting anyone.

It was, IMHO, an above average action mashup where a bunch of assassins are after Ari Gold, and features an ensemble cast. It was equal parts Oceans 11 setup, and a battle royal of the assassins and police. It was fun but not great. Lots of the lines had that ""we think we're so cool"" kinda writing that can make you roll your eyes.Well enter Bullet Train, a similar concept that takes itself far less seriously, and this is why it works. Brad Pitt is fantastic as always as the reformed bumbling pacifist who still has his Assassin chops. The Englis Duo also ham it up while giving depth as two ""brothers"" growing up together. Joey King surprised me as she's well known for doing bad Blumhous YA horror. She worked here, and being American, her British accent didn't bug me. The rest of the cast also were great.It's rare these days that I find this action comedies work as well as this one did. It walks the line so well, I throughly enjoyed it.If you want a bonker, fun action flick, I definitely recommend this.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

However the plot for the film was really clever but sometimes hard to follow, the cast and characters including Brad Pitt as ladybug was nonchalant and a great main character. The twins (Lemon and Tangerine) are very comedic and well connected at this point. Especially the banter was absolute god-like in this film, also the comedy was very decent and balanced. As well as the cameos for this film felt like a return the favor type of cameo and it was wonderful, the action scenes was well shot and choregraphed only Guy Ritchie can pull off in his other films (and possibly in his future films). The acting was quirky and one problem about the film is the dialogue was not only forgettable but also hard to understand, but at least the film itself was fast paced filled with action, comedy, twist & turns that keeps you guessing. I think the movie is both fun and a thrill ride with Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie vibes, can't wait for it's home video and streaming release.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Every time I watch a movie set inside a train, I always wonder as to why don't we see more movies set inside a train. It's difficult to explain but there is something unique about stories set in high quality trains; for some reason the proceedings become very exciting to watch. Bullet Train is an extremely entertaining black comedy that is guaranteed to give you a good time.This movie almost feels like a Tarantino movie with multiple colourful characters, their stories being told in chapters and everyone coming together towards the end for an explosive climax. There are so many twists and turns in the screenplay that no character feels safe and the surprises don't stop till the last few moments of the film. It seems this film has been made keeping in mind the evolving audience of today, who gets bored too easily and wants to be surprised at all times.'Bullet Train' is visually amazing; the cinematography and vfx are of top quality. The train in which this movie was filmed looks extremely beautiful and I really hope someday we get to see a train like that running in our city as well. I did not expect to see so much vfx towards the end of the movie; it almost feels like when the vfx team asked, ""how much cgi do you want towards the end"", the director replied with ""yes""; Bullet Train literally has an explosive finale! The action choreography throughout the film is outstanding but the fight sequence in the climax is just mind blowing.I loved the characters of this universe and the actors who portrayed them. Aaron Taylor Johnson was wonderful to watch as the foul mouthed Tangerine. This is the first time I have seen him and I was super impressed by his acting prowess and screen presence. Brian Tyree Henry was brilliant as Lemon and his scenes with Tangerine were quite funny. Brad Pitt has not only matured physically but also as an actor. When you think of good actors of Hollywood, Brad Pitt's name doesn't come up in your mind but he has been performing consistently well in the last few years. Brad's comic timing as Detective Ladybug was impeccable and the scenes that he shared with everyone, especially Aaron Taylor Johnson were extremely funny. Hiroyuki Sanada added a lot of weight to every scene that he was in with his powerful voice and screen presence and his sword fight sequence towards the end was absolutely stunning to watch.This action adventure movie is packed in with so much comedy that you won't feel bored at any given point. This movie is not at par with , which was quite an experience, but it has enough in it for you to watch it multiple times and have a great time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Super-entertaining action flick from my favorite director of action movies, David Leitch. Amazingly looking movie, with beautiful use of color pallets and with a Ritchie/Tarantino-like screenplay. This movie has a lot to take, but man I was on board the whole time (no pun intended). It is just pure fun, with Brad Pitt in it and some very interesting characters. The Twins were great! Like, I felt that this has a lot of fun elements, and every single one was too enjoyable. Very rich movie from that standpoint. Maybe the ending was a little too rushed but enjoyed it anyway. A one nice.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I found it quite boring that the characters could act as violently as they wanted with no consequence as if they were not in a constrictive space filled with people. I mean that, in my opinion, the peculiar setting was not quite used to its full potential.The best part is surely the cinematography, well-finished in almost every scene (except for a single one where there's way too much ""sunlight"") . The neon lights of Tokyo and the futuristic look of Japanese bullet trains were delightful to watch. As for the director, I strongly suggest you watch Atomic Blonde instead where he sure did a much more praiseworthy job.Lastly, the cast is full of skilled and/or charismatic actors and actresses, which feels like an overkill for this script (too many cameos I may add).Some neat action scenes in the last act do their job but have no power to solve the lack of pacing and the several script inaccuracies for which the film seems to limp along most of the time.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The first act can feel a bit convoluted with many dialogues and flashbacks, but for me they didn't ruin my experience or anything, and I quickly got invested in the story, and had a lot of fun.I liked pretty much all characters, which is pretty impressive, and Lemon and Tangerine Twins were standouts. This is a very stylish film, I'd say this has a lot more personality than this years another action film, The Gray Man. (even though I did enjoy that one too). The comedy was great too, and the Thomas the Tank Engine stuff wasn't as annoying as people say, it actually got used in some memorable dialogues and scenes.Apparently this was adopted from a Japanese novel, and the themes and concepts regarding 'Fate' was portrayed in a very interesting and satisfying ways in the film. A lot of great set-ups and pay-offs. Will be thinking about certain plot points regarding those for a while... Leitch's previous film Atomic Blonde suffered from weak script, but while having a similar issue of convoluted first act, I'd say Bullet Train has a much stronger script.But this isn't a perfect film, there are some noticeable bad VFX work during the final 15 minutes, and although this isn't the movie's fault, I'd say the trailers showed way too much. Don't watch the trailers before watching the film. Like I previously mentioned, the comedy was overall good, but at parts it felt like the movie was trying too much at being funny, slipping into the Reddit / Deadpool territory.Nonetheless, it is a good film - despite some issues I don't understand how this movie is so divisive among critics. 53% is lower than Thor 4 lol.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Fate, however, may have other plans as his latest mission puts him on a collision course with lethal adversaries from around the globe -- all with connected yet conflicting objectives -- on the world's fastest train.Bullet train is set in the train and the train only, and for a movie that is set solely in one place, it's super fun.

The movie also has breathtaking photography and exquisite transitions between scenes. Additionally, the music that accompanies the action scenes suits the mood perfectly.The movie starts with multiple disconnected storylines, which get really confusing. However, as time passes the parallel lines start getting closer and closer to eachother until they become just one big storyline.

The first time I watched Bullet Train, I would have rated it a low 8, maybe high 7. I had some trouble keeping track of who was who and why they were on the train. This time, I didn't have that problem and followed it fairly well. If anything, it's in the second half, specifically the last act, where the plot, for lack of a better term, goes off the rails with twist after twist, making for a very convoluted film. But honestly, that's part of the fun: seeing what reveal comes next and how all of the characters are connected. I also thought the character of the Wolf was entirely unnecessary, as he didn't seem to be that connected to the other characters. But, on a second viewing, I realized that I likely wasn't paying attention the first time, as he was connected. Finally, I thought the effects on the train looked terrible. Now, while they aren't fantastic, they look a lot better than I remember. Maybe it's due to getting a new TV in between viewings.The cast and characters are a ton of fun in various different ways. We've got Brad Pitt as a snatch and grab artist dealing with mental health issues caused by him constantly bringing others bad luck. We've got Aaron Taylor Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry as ""twin"" assassins, one of whom swears constantly and the other of whom judges people based on Thomas the Tank Engine. We've got two more assassins who are mainly there to give us some super cool fight scenes. We've got a teen girl who's a complete nut case. And we've got the villain, with the reveal of who plays him and the fact that he's almost impossible to defeat earning some of the biggest laughs.The dialogue is sharp, witty, and accompanied by some great visual gags. For example, the twins argue on the number of guys they killed on their last job. The film then flashes back to the job and has them in the moment counting the kills as they happen. The music is catchy, including Japanese covers of some popular American songs, like Holding Out For A Hero. It's well paced, with not a single dull moment. And the action, especially the climax, is fast paced, well choreographed, shot, and edited, brutal, and a ton of fun.Overall, Bullet Train is a darn good time that was even better the second time around. I would actually like to see a sequel, but if they don't make one, at least we still have one heck of a fun movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","wild, funny, and ingenious","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9810156/?ref_=tt_urv","cherold","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0011762/?ref_=tt_urv","26 May 2024","In Bullet Train, Brad Pitt is a genial criminal who's been working on himself in therapy and needs to steal a briefcase on a train that has an inexplicable number of professional killers on board. This leads to a series of crazy fights and weird plot twists.Brad Pitt is terrifically funny as Ladybug (almost everyone here has a codename or alias). He's a shambling, charming, everyman who just happens to be terrifically good at fighting. The rest of the cast is also marvelous, including Joey King as an innocent-presenting psychopath and Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry as bantering killers.One thing I don't see anyone talking about in the user reviews is the ingenious construction. Even though it's true that much of this can be picked apart, from minute to minute the way it unfolds, and the clever throughlines like that water bottle, have a lovely intricacy to it. Everything fits together neatly, at least until you start thinking about it after.The other thing about this movie is that it is a contemplation of fate. Everyone in the film talks about fate and luck (Ladybug talks about his bad luck, King's character Prince talks about her good luck). I wouldn't say the movie's philosophy of fate is especially consistent, but that may be because the movie is more concerned with how fate is perceived than what it actually is.(Director David Leitch's follow-up movie, The Fall Guy, talks about wrapping the central thesis of a film in the tasty bacon of action scenes, and this movie appears to be exactly that.)So come for the action, vibe on the goofy philosophizing, observe the construction, take note of the plot holes, and have a good time.Highly recommended.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The action & comedy blend well and there are even some emotional moments within the story that bring it all together. Brad Pitt is the main character but Brian Tyree Henry's role as Lemon stole the show to me. Originally introduced as an Antagonist (one of many) his superior acting in both tense and humorous moments stood out in what I would call a breakout performance. Visually this movie is amazing. Effects aren't too over the top and the color grading was flawless. The plot itself was a very different approach than expected. The attempt to keep things as simple as possible but it only became more chaotic overtime. The random enemy cameos were dope as well. They were interesting enough to fit perfectly where they were without overstaying or wanting more. Overall this movie was a great one. Definitely recommend it !","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

This is an action movie of the old mold. On top of that it adds on a ton of really cool characters and a plot that is perfectly tied together. We have like 15 people with unique goals on the same train. And everything comes perfectly together. All storylines intermix in clever ways and there are no dull moments in the movie. It's an action movie for smart guys who like a fast and clever plot.I can't praise it enough. It really was a huge surprise all the way. Maybe some will think it's a bit low-brow or simple theme wise, but for the genre it does it all and then some. Brad Pitt is amazing here. This is the sort of stuff that should get an Oscar. He is both funny and cool. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is amazing. So is his friend here, Brian Tyree Henry. Only one who was not perfect acting wise for this action comedy was ""the girl"". She played a tough girl character and it came off as very fake. All her lines were forced. She wasn't terrible though. And besides this I was blown away by how good the acting was in the movie. This is top level and that's totally unheard off in such silly comedies. I started to like quite a few characters quite a lot. There are like 6 different actors here who by themselves could carry the movie. How often does this happen? Maybe in The Godfather and Casino, but seldom in such silly action flicks.So the movie works in all the ways it tries to. Acting, special effects, action. But by far the best part is the tight and clever plot where all elements interact in clever ways and everything is constantly referred back to. This movie is hype. But it's not only for action fans. If you like detective stories you are going to love this movie. If you like puzzle movies this one will be a classic in your eyes. Of course the shallowness of the plot does make it a one-time watch. There is nothing to it besides what you see. But many comedies are like this. It's just very, very fun to watch. I had a huge blast.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

We then go to ""Ladybug"", the Brad Pitt character who is walking as the Japanese cover of ""Stayin' Alive"" blasts from the big screen. Ladybug is just taking a new high-risk job, this time he needs to recover a brief case full of money from a bullet train going from Tokyo to Kyoto... At this point we are less than 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest big budget movie from director David Leitch (""Atomic Blonde"", ""Deadpool 2""). Here he brings us a tale involving multiple hitmen who are all on the same bullet train going towards Kyoto. First of all, don't worry about the plot. It is nigh impossible to follow. So we are left to enjoy the stylish production set on board of the bullet train, and the many, many, many tightly scripted fights. This would've been a complete waste of time but for the charming lead performance by Brad Pitt. But in the end, this film is all style, and little to no substance. One final note: the real life bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto runs 2 hrs. 8 minutes, the exact running time of the movie.""Bullet Train"" opened in US theaters in early August and has done quite well at the box office. The Labor Day early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was very well attended. If you are a fan of Brad Pitt, or love action movies without much substance, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

The trailer looked pretty average, and the initial reviews suggested the film was mediocre at best. Instead I was surprised to find a well made, well acted film with a story that kept me watching. It's an ensemble cast film with a number of characters on their own stories, with Brad Pitt as 'Ladybug' being the point the plot pivots around.It's entertaining, filled with action and yet not too gory to become too serious. It's funny, with an array of interesting and well fleshed out characters.Perhaps most impressive of all for me was Aaron Taylor-Johnson playing a cockney hitman. I honestly had no idea it was him from his Kick Ass fays, and even after knowing this I can still barely tell. He and his partner were a great duo and added a lot to the film.Throw the characters, plot, and action into the neon lit world of night time Japan and you get something pretty different to the usual action flick.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Everything in this movie seems real but, at the same time, it's too grotesque to be true.Every charachter has a backstory, which is shown with flashbacks just when you need it to be known, and are the embodiment of almost every criminal stereotype ever shown on film (they just missed the italian mafia). I really liked how David Leitch portraied their own special desires and reasons to do what they do on that train, they even made me feel for Tangerine and his super strange obsession with Thomas the Tank Engine (he was my favourite).I don't have much to say on this movie; it might have been entertaining, even strange but, above all, surely worth the watch.Nice movie._____________________________________________SCORECARDIn a range from 1 to 5, i'll give a value to each entry written below.

The intensity is enough to get anyone locked into their seat, scared for the next move. The buildup of a thrill ride is strong and captivating. There's so many cameos, and the movie includes such an amazing cast. I couldn't be happier with each performance. And even though we're getting these pieces of the puzzle and think we know how the mystery is going throughout, it was a major shock to see how the big twist goes down. I couldn't believe all of these minor pieces would fit into such a huge frame. And let's not forget the perfect humor that was very unique but fun nonetheless. There are some corny scenes, but I could look past them pretty easily, because the thrill, mystery, comedy, and visuals make up for it. One plot point in particular I'd like to point out is a species of snake that's pretty key to the movie. It makes no sense to those out there who understand snakes, but it's just a fun addition for those who might not understand what they're seeing. I'd love to see a sequel, and really hope to see one in the future. This movie has some pretty good potential to become a classic.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The ensemble cast adds to the fun element--everything is so fast-paced and light and airy that you don't even have time to get bored--the characters are engaging enough, and the ample plot twists keep you on your toes.Yes, the Pulp-fictionesque dialog especially between the Lemon and Tangerine characters feels unearned, but there's enough originality in Ladybug's (Brad Pitt) reluctant-warrior trope that this feels like a worthwhile addition to the canon of action-comedies. The action scenes were fun to watch, although some of the stunts beggared disbelief even in an action movie. A man jumping on to and holding on to the nose/tail of a moving bullet train, and said man successfully punching through the windshield glass with his bare hands even though I understand he is an action movie-elite-assassin character? Really?But this was such a fun ride I didn't really mind the cartoonish elements.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This was excruciating. Endless yammering, garbled slathering, muddled babbling, awkward preening and sword fights. Brad cranked it up to maximum vapidity with this one. At least in Snatch he was being intentionally annoying and incomprehensible. Here he's just a mealymouthed, permastoned, mentally invalid, mouth breathing snowflake. His most autobiographical role to date. The script is hacky, the action cheesy, the acting atrocious, the direction kitschy. It's as if the filmmakers literally set out to make the worst trainwreck possible. Hell, this dumpster fire wasn't even filmed in Japan. Hollywood just doesn't know how to make interesting, original films anymore. At least it wasn't another cookiecutter superhero mcmovie, I'll give it that.

Brad Pitt does his usual comedic routines, and the rest of the cast do well enough with their lines, along with cameo appearances of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, but it doesn't warrant the rating. I guess the director, who also did Deadpool 2, felt this was a formula that worked well and could be repeated, but it lacks the plots of Tarantino or Guy Ritchie that carry their movies. Directors need to focus less on CGI and graphic violence, and more on plots than movies like Bullet Train.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Suddenly Bad Bunny appeared as a wolf and and his line just said ""NO!"" in the non-speaking part. I didn't quite understand the concept of the movie and wasted 2 hours. The director of this movie may have been conscious of Tarantino in the 90's, but there is no doubt that it is clear CRAP.

It isn't an homage when action sequences are beat for beat ripped from more interesting, and original, Jackie Chan efforts and the production design consists of a neon colored and mythological Japanese backdrop vomited from most of the ""too cool for school"" (I'm trying to bring that phrase back) action crap from the early 2Ks. I would like to say the dialog is close to being plagiarism, too, but that argument is dulled by the fact that those lines are what are given out as complementary phrase packages at most stock screenplay content providers to incentivise you to purchase a monthly subscription, thanks again Adobe (not a real thing).The movie has a few interesting characters and talented actors playing them (Lemon and Tangerine really grew on me), but the choices made by the director to keep only the ""wink wink nudge nudge"" takes was exhausting and got old, at least for me, before the halfway point of the film. It could also be a problem that with so many converging side characters, none were able to be attached to my emotional strings to where I cared what was going on, rooted for some, and rallied against others.As for a specific character misstep, it is difficult to understate how awkward a fit Michael Shannon was here; an actor who I have a great respect for regarding his ability to make a fictional character feel real in the world he inhabits. Here he was, like most of the characters, a recycled cardboard caricature of his archetype. I want Bill (Kill Bill) to philosophize about what Superman really represented in the frame of social commentary and what it meant to Bill's ambitions. I want Thanos to elucidate his reasoning to the point where the logic of his means might debatable justify his ends and people in the real world are triggered to discuss it, if only as an unserious devil's advocate.I understand that this movie may be understood by most as simply a fun and diverting action film that doesn't require the audience to deeply engage with any of it. Don't get me completely wrong, I laughed a couple times, had a smile on my face often, and was genuinely surprised in one particular event (train skylights be dangerous, bro). I even had a small sense of satisfaction when various scenes were shown to be interconnected. It just didn't do anything functionally new while wrapping that old hat in a shiny CG package and giving the result a title that Sony was able to buy the rights to.With it's overuse of digital effects, slick and hollow characters and dialog, and a plot that's as forgettable as the Japan they imagineered, Bullet Train came off less like an expression of skill and vision and more like the toys in the current boxes of Cracker Jack's, disposable.One last thing that bugs me, this movie spends 20 straight seconds following a Fiji Water bottle around as it moves through previously seen scenes. It's not just rolling about willy-nilly (bringing this back, too), blurry from the speed and agitation of its movement, it is actually framed in the bottom center of the entire screen (taking up half of the screen's height and a quarter of the width) and pausing from intermittently rotating to show the full logo several times for several seconds each time. This is more intrusive to the fourth wall than the FedEx infomercial that was Cast Away. I mean no subtlety at all. I sure am thirsty for the ancient and natural artesian life's nutrient that is Fijian spring water, though!All that being said, if you have never watched an action film made in the last two decades, this movie would likely be enjoyable to you. If anything, it could serve as cliff notes for techniques used in more capable shows. Enjoy!This review was brought to you by Adobe Screenplay Stock.

But, like many films in this genre, it was a vulgar mess of F bombs and violence with no one to root for and no one particularly appealing. A movie that stands as an assault on the senses is just lazy film making. The pleasant music behind people getting their heads blown off and such graphic violence as to numb the viewer has no point but just to fill the too long running time with as much carnage and foul language as possible. Sorry, I stopped watching at about 45 minutes in, so, maybe it got better, but I doubt it. Movies that make you feel like you need a shower afterward are just no my cup of tea. I guess I'm old fashioned. I like a good story that doesn't rely on repulsive filler to propel it.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

No film that uses ""mansplaining"" unironically deserves anything other than a 1 - without this it would've been a 7.5/10. If I want sexism in films I'll enjoy some 1950s comedies.A cramped experience with 2 hrs across a somewhat unbelieavable scenario of a long bullet train ride in Japan where riders are oblivious to multiple people dying, a snake being loose, gunshots and fight scenes, Bullet Train is a fun, action packed comedy that is - conflictingly - an unnecessarily convoluted (and at times poorly paced) film. 2hrs appears to be about half hour too long and the multiple story lines do not help what could be an otherwise exciting flick.Brad Pitt shows his acting experience in spades playing an ""unlucky"" hippy-esque assassin (with some Mr. Smith vibes) who is doing whatever he can to not kill people with unexpected consequences.Joey King's frustratingly accurate faux-damsel in distress paired with the fantastic buddy comedy combo of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Henry give a lot to like and dislike about this film.Some notable cameos from Channing Tatum, Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds add to the larger than life (and at times gruesome) comedy of decapitations, Japanese mascots, Japanese covers of classic 80s pop and sex perverts (?).Overall a mixed film with a satisfying conclusion which I think could've been a classic with a bit more work of the pacing, cut of an unnecessary storyline or two (Zazie Beetz's The Hornet is just painful) and an ending about half hour sooner. The deconstruction of Brad Pitts character was not too heavy and overall there's a fun mix of unique characters and excellent directing by David Leitch that will give you some hard Quentin Tarantino vibes.","5 out of 17 found this helpful.

It's not good as an action flick. And it's not good as a spoof of action flicks. It's not good as a live action movie because all the action and backgrounds scream that it's not actually taking place on a train but on a sound stage. In fact in some scenes the train (clearly animated) seems to be going at jet speed while when the same exteriors are shown from inside the train through its windows, the train seems to be going 50 miles per hour. The special effects regarding the train are so poorly conceived (head-on crashes after which the train keeps on going), I had to laugh. And I did. The effects are a mess.But all is not lost. Let's get to the 'good'. Brad Pitt as the 'good assassin'; playing against type as a somehow laid back assassin is quite wonderful. He has great timing, great expressions, and he made me laugh (and that was his intention). Aaron Tyler-Johnson is fine as another assassin, as is Brian Tyree Henry as his partner. Sadly I missed some of their dialogue, spoken in a rich British street dialogue.And now for the 'bad'.Joey King as a very strange female assassin was disturbing. Whether the fault lies with Ms. King, or the character, or the direction, I wanted her to disappear from the film as soon as possible. Alert. She does not.There are flashbacks that are ill-timed. The film is just beginning to rev up, to catch fire, it has not yet grabbed the viewer, but suddenly, and unexpectedly, we are thrust back in time, ostensibly to tell us why a new character is about to do what he or she does. One thing for sure about story-telling, the viewer has to be committed to the story's present-day before being moved back into the past. And I was not yet so committed.As for the story, as unbelievable as the premise seems (a group of assassins somehow on the same train) once the premise is 'explained', the seeming coincidence is even less believable.As I said, I was very disappointed.I read the film's negative reviews, went to see it anyway, and with that, I was disappointed.So, I can't say 'Lower your expectations'.Because I did.To no avail.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

I totally wasted two good hours watching this movie and it was a huge disappointment. The action scenes are lame, repetitive and lack creativity. The movie has no respect for the laws of physics throughout e.g., several guys walking on top of a bullet train traveling at 200-300km/hour (per odometer of train shown in numerous occasions), not factoring the relative wind of the train speed would blow them away like popcorn pieces! The screenplay is lame, and the movie has abundant scenes of crude violence in complete absence of a good story beneath. The movie is more like a violent video game where the characters want to kill as many people as possible without telling a good story. My rating for this movie is in the range of 2-3, with 3 being in towards the generous end!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The action itself is pretty boring and brief, the dialogue tries to be clever but has nothing to say and the attempt at comedy made me groan multiple times. At least it's stylistic enough, although flinging the camera from one place to another gets pretty distracting at time.Looking at the parts there's technically nothing wrong with the movie, but as a whole there's not enough action to be an action movie, too silly to be a drama and too cringy to be a comedy. Really a waste of a good cast. It's not a bad watch, but it's not something I'd ever watch again or recommend to anyone.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I was bored in the first few minutes once the ""brothers"" started their stupid dialogue. None of the ""comedy"" was funny, the story was horribly dragged out, the mish mash of the characters' storylines was boring. The ""honor"" subplot with the Asian men was so cliched that I just rolled my eyes at it. The Thomas the Tank references go on far too much and it's clear that this was written for people who grew up on that show (spoiler alert - I didn't).The actions scenes were beyond ridiculous and done in a ""style over substance"" fashion. They were so completely over the top that they practically reached a Sharknado level of preposterousness. Kicks to the crotch did nothing, punches went on forever, and everyone is magically a martial arts expert. Somehow a lever, button, switch, etc was always just within reach for someone to grab it and escape a choke hold. If this was an Airplane or Naked Gun style of comedy, it really would have been funny, but it's not - it's just plain stupid.The number of ""surprising"" cameos that appear wasn't even the least bit interesting. I didn't care who showed up (one of them was literally just a quick reveal), and they added nothing to the plot. By the end of the movie, I was hoping every character would die because they were all worthless and I didn't like any of them.Don't waste your time, and if you do waste your time, don't pay for this movie.

I'll start with the main problem I have with this film is casting Brad Pitt. I mean who doesn't love Brad Pitt but not for this role. This character was begging for Ryan Reynolds. It's a very Ryan Reynolds role that we're used to seeing. A kind of nerdy, kind of awkward (yet attractive) guy with kind of nerdy kind of awkward one liners that turn out to be funny and yet when Brad Pitt delivered them it just often fell flat. Ironically enough Ryan Reynolds does have a cameo. They really should have switched their parts. That aside another thing that annoyed me was Tangerine and Lemon were probably the most interesting characters and the only ones that didn't get an actual backstory. We know they grew up together that's it. Even a freaking water bottle got a backstory but not them. The pacing was off. Some scenes were mildly exciting followed by boring ones. It finally reveals why they're all on the same train and yet the reveal is... unsatisfying like having sex without orgasm. Sure the film was good but I didn't quite finish so to speak and I left feeling it wasn't as pleasurable as it could have been.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Certainly one of the worst I've seen in a long time. The writing is really bad - like someone trying to do something akin to Tarantino without ever having actually seen a Tarantino film. The acting is awful, and the directing is cluttered and confusing. The pacing is way off, too; it's far far far too long, and goes on for another exhausting 45 minutes just when you think it's coming to an end. It's kind of depressing that so many people seem to rate it so highly. Watch Pulp Fiction to see how this type of storytelling can be done well.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The heavily stylised action pieces and premise seems intriguing for a brief while but as the film progressed the mindlessly whimsical plot starts to become tiresome.This kind of story works when it is edited sharply and is fast paced. When the dialogues are not only funny but are measured against the time. And they are getting delivered crisply. Unfortunately none of that happens in Bullet Train. In its middle portion the film looses grip on the pacing and starts meandering in the realm of total nonchalance. That doesn't help.Some characters are funny and some are not. Some set pieces are worth gushing over but some are just plain old cliched stuff that we have seen before. The action is funky but not breathtaking. The acting is ""okayish"" and not something to be proud of. The music pallete ranging from over-dramatic howls to funky dance numbers is at best ordinary.But the worst of all is writing. No matter how silly and unconventional film you are making, the characters needs to be backed by good writing. Editing needs to be crisp and intelligent. And that was clearly missing. Repetitive plot points and lack of genuinely funny characters didn't help this film any more.Overall it may be a fun watch for the fans of all the actors involved (and there are quite many of them) but apart from the handful ""cool"" action sequences and occasionally funny one liners there is nothing more to get entertained.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In fact, it is not even entertaining, which is why it took multiple viewings and pauses to get through it. Just kind of gross. Why I am required to say so much about a movie which amounts to the cinematic equivalent of junk food is beyond me, but let's just say that I was not impressed and will not be seeking out future works by Director Leitch.

I found it funny how every character has a little backstory, even a water bottle. The film has colourful visuals, style, thoughtful action set pieces, and absurdly violent humour.However, one of the things that stood out about this movie-going experience was that I got to see it on Screen X, an expanded, dual-sided, 270-degree screen projected on the walls. And I got to say Screen X is not for me. On the sides of the walls, it was moving at ten frames per second, while the middle screen was moving just fine, which was very distracting. It does not help that it projects to the walls next to a fire exit, which was visible throughout. So yeah, I don't recommend it.Aaron Taylor-Johnson (as Tangerine) and Brian Tyree Henry (as Lemon) were the best part of the film. They are two hitmen who are good at killing but terrible at protecting people. Their interaction was the most entertaining, especially how they rope in the kid program of Thomas the Tank Engine when it comes to reading people. Also, Brian Tyree Henry and Joey King are two American actors who manage to do solid British accents.The movie is not great or anything, as there are problems, but other than that, I enjoyed it for what it is. It served its promise, and it served it well.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

OK, you can stop right there. This movie is an insult to both those masterpieces.First off, the movie is way too violent and gory, to the point that it cancels out any of the supposed ""comedy"" it possesses (more on that later). I like crime shows. And heists, and capers, and spy movies. And war movies. And action movies of all kinds. But it was like Netflix hired a bunch of brand new special effects artists off the street. And those noobs wanted to make sure the audience saw their work in every freaking scene. Truly god-awful over-the-top gore that is completely unnecessary.Next, again, the supposed professional EXPERT hitmen who are taken in by the female lead. This overused trope is really getting tiresome. It's like the writers decided, we need to have a female lead, but she can't be all smarts, and witty and sneaky, because we're lazy Netflix writers. So, we'll make her act like a helpless female, and she has to rely on tears and the ""poor little girl"" routine to win the day. And these buffoons fall for it...every freaking time! It is so bad that I found myself either rolling my eyes and groaning loudly or fast-forwarding through her scenes.Lastly, it isn't funny. Not in the least. The verbal jokes fall flat, or go on far too long, or follow (or are immediately followed by) scenes of excessive violence that make you not want to laugh, even if you originally did (which I doubt you will).Finally, pack in stupid unrealistic train physics and you get yet another big-budget star-fest Netflix movie that is a complete mess.

For about 10 minutes early in the movie they seemed concerned about it seemly like this was an actual train in the real world. Then after that the violence and fighting which would have brought the train to a stop and authorities to the scene never happenedNothing felt ordinary or regular, and that made all of the interesting characters and situations uninteresting because they didn't exist in contrast to anything very ordinary or relatable at all.Another odd thing was how many English speakers there were in Japan speaking English with expectations of all of the local Japanese characters understanding their English. In some scenes they would speak only Japanese but seem to perfectly understand everything that the character spoke in English.The best thing the film had going for it was that it had some nice visual effects, shocking action moments, acting moments and crazy visuals that made it fun to follow as complete absurd escapism. And for a lot of people that's enough to make them to be happy at the movies.But I feel like if a story is going to be crazy like this one, why not make it an animated film and/or science fiction world for the characters to inhabit so the occurrences can seem less ridiculous? Or else make it a complete comedy where people cannot believe how long and absurd everything is able to get all along the ride. Instead in this film everything is portrayed as if it could really happen until maybe the end. And by then it's too late.","3 out of 15 found this helpful.

With all the chaos, mayhem, killings, bloodshed and gore on board this high speed train neither the director's attempts at comedy nor the prescence of star Brad Pitt is any relief. Yes there is plenty of fast paced and high voltage action embellished with special effects for those who love such stuff. So you need to settle down with popcorn and ask no questions. Surprisingly there are hardly any other passengers and the fights take place in almost empty coaches. Lots of rocking music in the background and the movie starts off on a promising note with "" Staying alive"" as Brad makes his way to the Tokyo railway station. The plot is complex to put it mildly. The characters are caricatures and the one liners do not raise laughs. It's also strange to hear desperados talk of fate, karma, zen and other aspects of philosophy. It appears that an interesting plot has been made complicated. Some reviewers have noted that the director David Leitch is influenced by Tarantino's work but that doesn't appear to be so. Tarantino's class and flourish is missing. The climax is outrageously unrealistic in design and execution. ( Compare with the thrilling climax of ""Speed""). There is an overdose of attempted wit and humour which does not work. The sentimental stuff too does not sound true.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Why he doesn't use a knife or silenced pistol anyway?The guy in a white suit The Wolf directly attacks Brad Pitt when the murderer of everyone in his wedding is a woman whom he has given her picture for she is the assassin which he personally came to Japan to kill her. She doesn't look like Brad Pitt so why he attacked Brad Pitt? Also in flashback the guy in the white suit is shown as he directly came to the bullet train just after the wedding assassination and then we learn Brad Pitt was also in the wedding but he mention he was retired for some time. Did the guy didn't take his clothes off for a while or what? What kind of cinematography and storytelling it's?The Russian woman is revealed to have an evil plan for the Asian guy who is tasked to assassinate her. For fail-safe she states she sent a man to the his kid in hospital so if she doesn't report back in a certain period of time the guy will kill the kid. But then we learn the kid's grandfather sent a woman to protect the kid. When the guy is clearly up to no good being next to the kid this woman waited for the last minute to take the guy down so the plot can continue in the way it was badly written.So The Elder's wife was revealed to be especially murdered by White Death or his men but why The Elder wasn't killed when White Death was literally in front of him?The people kill others in bullet train but there is no security, no staff, et cetera around to ensure public peace, protecting possession of the customers and whatnot. Literally there is just a conductor and a servant.Brad Pitt takes down The Wolf but doesn't look at the envelope he has on him but he ponders ""why he attacked me"" for minutes.Brad Pitt was revealed to be shot twice by a man called Lemon. Why he shot him and why he just his shoulder instead of so many deadly points on his body doesn't make sense.It turns out so many foreign people brought firearms with them. Japan is not like America, it's very hard for a civilian to get a gun and Lemon bought his favourite gun with him, not even some ""the random gun we were able to smuggle into Japan"" gun.People constantly speak English to Japanese people and Japanese people speak Japanese back but somehow people understand each other. The hell?The Asian assassin was shot in the stomach but he survived just fine for hours.The Russian girl shot Lemon in the torso instead of the head to kill him. Lemon couldn't die because of it thanks to his bulletproof vest which his brother knew he had vest on but forgot it and believed he was dead without even checking his pulse.The White Death was revealed to be Russian. So how he could be respected by a Japanese yakuza boss who values tradition? Traditional Japanese people dislike non-Japanese people a lot. So it's very unrealistic for such a Yakuza boss to even care about the life of a non-Japanese person.The White Death thought Brad Pitt was Carter who killed his wife. It's unrealistic for this guy to not even check what Carter looks like.Lemon was angry because his brother died because of Brad Pitt but after a while they became brothers. The hell? Is an AI wrote this story?The White Death didn't just use a gun to kill The Elder, he just used a katana. Just why?I haven't watch anything that has so much plot holes since Stranger Things' first episode.The idea is good but bad execution. Brad Pitt's face got boring years ago. None of the other people are actually famous so their acting capability are barely decent. The whole movie clearly targets new generation kids who play Minecraft and Fortnite all day and when they don't they record their own videos to upload it on Tiktok.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

I found it could have been more enjoyable. I can give it a 5 out of 10 for the visuals.This action movie should have tried to take itself more seriously. It's a light comedy-action popcorn flick that tries to add John Wick flare to a Fast and Furious-style movie, and it fails miserably at both.The casting was alright. Brad Pitt was the most forgettable protagonist in an action movie ever. The character tries very hard and succeeds in downplaying himself all the time. This joke gets old very fast.The Tangerine-Lemon brothers were fun at first, but the joke gets old fast.And I hate that this movie was entirely shot within an empty Japanese bullet train in Japan, and they didn't take any advantage of that. They add very stereotypical Japanese characters and randomly slap them in this nonsense.If you hated GI Joe for that, you will hate this one too.The action is very generic and forgettable. The enemies are dumb and Coyote-like levels of stupid and forgettable. The plot is pure nonsense.

I don't think many people will like this composition. The plot is limited to one location where all the events take place. The humor also leaves much to be desired, just like from the action movies of the 90s. If we talk about the storyline, it is very predictable. But I think the absurdity is what distinguishes this film from others.Obviously, most of the positive reviews were due to the excellent cast. To be honest, it was he who interested me. And here it was not a mistake, despite the whole plot, the acting was at an excellent level.In conclusion, the film is extraordinary, its plot and monotony are frightening. The first impression is formed in the first 10-20 minutes. It was because of this that some turned off after reaching this time. Of course, the climax and denouement are much more interesting, but it does not change the fact that the film, in my opinion, is worse than average.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Bullet Train is fast, fun & frenetic but it does suffer from not knowing when to push the brakes.Directed by David Leitch (Hobbs & Shaw), the premise is simple and the endless twists n turns do make the ride somewhat enjoyable if also overstuffed & messy. The story goes back n forth every now n then to connect the dots but it also ends up overdoing the elements in ways that's detrimental to the whole journey. What works in its favour however is the kinetic action, wicked wit, chaotic energy & colourful ensemble.The story treads all the genre clich√©s with an unabashed spirit, plus character interplay is also cringe for the most part but it manages to get ample mileage on the strength of its cast & their commitment to their respective roles. Brad Pitt plays his part with such effortless nonchalance that he manages to stand out with ease. Aaron Taylor-Johnson also contributes with a brilliant showcase. And the rest also render their roles responsibly.Overall, Bullet Train offers a lighthearted & action-packed extravaganza that may be lacking in many storytelling aspects but it delivers on the entertainment front with a sufficiently satisfying execution. The film does run out of tracks as it nears its final stop, thus leading to an overblown finale that's as lazy as it is tiresome, but this high-speed action-comedy isn't without merit and does enough to keep the interest alive in the proceedings. Definitely worth a shot.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.
