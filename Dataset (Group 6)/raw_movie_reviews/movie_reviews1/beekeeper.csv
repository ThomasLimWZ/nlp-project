"5","Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9595050/?ref_=tt_urv","DocteurDream","30 January 2024","Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
"6","Good action, incredibly silly","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9655137/?ref_=tt_urv","mikelpcl","3 March 2024","Statham knows how to fight. The action is great.The dialogs and the plot... oh my God. This was all written by a 15 year old as a weekend project.It's all beyond ridiculous.Even Statham's usual delivery can't salvage the ""zinger"" phrases in this movie. Not even that.Still, the action is good.Watch it for the action. With beer. With friends around, making fun of all the silly and teenage-amateurish dialogs.You'll walk out thinking that you should not have enjoyed this horrible movie, and that you can also be a Hollywood screenwriter. Easily.By the way, they spent 40 million to do this... I can only imagine Statham walked out of the movie loaded."
"7","Statham and action","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9599080/?ref_=tt_urv","Jhissner-1","2 February 2024","Statham 8/10
Action 8/10.Story 6/10
Agent Parker 1/10The action and the story are great. Statham is fantastic.Unfortunately, after that the other actors are bad or worse. Agent Parker was horrendous, shocking that she was even cast. If you can put her acting aside, then it's a pretty solid and enjoyable movie.The Beekeeper is worth checking out if you enjoy action and Jason Statham. The movie is comparable to some of his better movies: transporter, the mechanic, crank, expendables. Again, for what it is and putting the bad supporting actors aside then it is enjoyable. Enjoy the action!"
"6","An entertaining, though fairly stupid movie.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9730623/?ref_=tt_urv","jbkzfhmh","11 April 2024","The Beekeeper is a decently violent , sort of moronic Jason Bourne want-to-be. In it we get a Jason Statham who's more entertaining than the turgid ""Wrath of Man"", but falls short of his' action comedies , like ""Snatch"", ""Expendables"", and ""Spy"".The action and violence are several notches above many other similar movies (though several floors below the likes of ""John Wick"" or ""The Raid"").The movie tries to pretend it's a cerebral thriller , with commentary on avarice and political dirty dealings, but for the most part is a pretty plain revenge film.The bad guys are annoying enough you look forward to their painful demises.If you're looking to watch Jason Statham wander around and kill people , you could do worse."
"6","Good action and stupidity","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9674447/?ref_=tt_urv","ssvfolder-1","12 March 2024","Action flicks aren't known for their plots. That being said, is it possible to finally have at least somewhat plausible plotlines? I mean it's just so... stupid, I can't really .... My almost 80 year old parents know more about computers than these morons in the movies and many more examples of that.The action is great, as usual in Statham movies. That's why I even considered to write a review. It's everything one might expect from his action flick. As always he is the one who carries the movie throughout, and despite all the stupidity, it actually works. You probably need to be pretty drunk, but when you are, it's actually fun.So, as a one time entertainment, it's actually worth it."
"3","Awesome fight scenes, bad everything else","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9556874/?ref_=tt_urv","FeastMode","12 January 2024","I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)"
"8","Statham goes full John Wick and full Equalizer","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9558414/?ref_=tt_urv","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024","David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."
"6","The Beekeeper: 6.5/10","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9569151/?ref_=tt_urv","tmhansen-22492","17 January 2024","Plot/Script= 5/10"
"8","Agent Parker is so gross","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9772520/?ref_=tt_urv","parvesh-nehra","4 May 2024","Jason Statham is at his best - both action and acting. But the agent Parkers character is so gross, it makes you puke - for the misfit actor, her BS acting and the BS script.The concept of a Beekeeper program is actually great, but other than action, most of the movie is not worth anything. So many forces getting involved in such an otherwise beautiful concept ruined everything. Had it been a simple revenge without involving every damn agency, without the yuck Parker, it would been a great movie.I just hope they make a sequel by keeping the character and the concept of the beekeeper only, just like Equalizer, and write the other parts better, I'd definitely love watching that."
"1","Mindblowingly bad acting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9596304/?ref_=tt_urv","dam-24421","31 January 2024","They forgot to write a script? Or bring their head along in this movie?Nothing seemed to work, acting, storyline, everything was so rushed. The actors were incredibly bad, especially Parker. That must be some of the most cringe, b acting I have ever seen. It was unwatchable, I stayed in the cinema because I had my little brother with me, and wouldn't be rude and interfere with the other people in the cinema.This movies gets -3/10Way too cheesy and cringe. David Ayer this is a redo, better luck next time. My sincere condolences for the people watching.Just another movie for the money, so sad."
"6","Entertaining, but over-the-top and ridiculously unbelievable","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9558138/?ref_=tt_urv","dave-1205","12 January 2024","The film's narrative hinges on outlandish scenarios and unbelievable action, often veering into unintentionally humorous territory due to its sheer absurdity of specific sequences.While films, even those with mature content, can offer immersive experiences, 'The Beekeeper' falls short. Its graphic elements ('18' UK, 'R' US) juxtaposed with its stretched plot create a tonal disconnect that alienates its intended audience, leaving viewers unable to suspend disbelief.While the film delivers the genre's requisite action sequences, the plot struggles to maintain credibility, often indulging in exaggerated scenarios that feel more amateurish than polishedStepping out of a well-crafted movie is like emerging from a captivating dream, your mind buzzing with the story's echoes. Sadly, ""The Beekeeper"" left me thoroughly indifferent."
"7","Jason Statham and David Ayer are back","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9560934/?ref_=tt_urv","masonsaul","13 January 2024","The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"8","Surprisingly entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9557866/?ref_=tt_urv","Bateman_Reviews","12 January 2024","I was going into this with little to no expectations. I was pleasantly surprised that everything in this movie was so satisfying. I felt 0 sympathy for any of the villains or scammers in this movie and it was euphoric to see them get their due reckoning. Of course Jason nails it and makes ever kill and brutal take down very satisfyingOne thing I will say is that the lore behind the Bee Keepers was interesting enough to keep my attention though corny with the hive talk at times it works as world building. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of action movies and likes satisfying conclusions."
"6","🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝 the beekeeper, Jason Statham does it phenomenal","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9557842/?ref_=tt_urv","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024","The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."
"8","A keeper","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9558686/?ref_=tt_urv","sbweightman","12 January 2024","A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt."
"7","Doesn't deserve the bad reviews","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9632416/?ref_=tt_urv","lisaaltmiller","20 February 2024","This film doesn't deserve the bad reviews. If you are going into an action movie thinking the plot is going to be perfect, then maybe action isn't your genre. If you're going into it wanting to be entertained, with lots of fight scenes and things blowing up, then you'll enjoy this movie. Think of something along the lines of The Equalizer meets James Bond. It'll even make you laugh a few times. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a sequel or two. Is Jason Statham a great actor? No. But is he great in action films like this, that are written for someone like him, yes. It's an entertaining.fast watch."
"7","Very entertaining, especially if you're a Statham fan.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9601687/?ref_=tt_urv","Sleepin_Dragon","3 February 2024","Adam Clay on the surface is a calm character, a man who keeps brees, but underneath he's part of a network of powerful, dangerous killers known as Beekeepers. One day a friend of his is taken by scammers, he vows to take revenge.Once again, I find myself thoroughly entertained and very satisfied by one of Jason Statham's high octane, action films.It's way over the top, and some of the dialogue is beyond abysmal, so corny, but the core essence is rather emotive, who hasn't been annoyed recently, hearing of some elderly person being scammed out of their life savings.Some of the talk about bees is honestly cringe worthy, but that's the charm of the film, it's not trying to take itself too seriously.Lots of great action scenes, very well staged, and Statham is just so cool.On the debit side, Agent Parker isn't a particularly good character, and some of the American accents are a little dodgy, Jemma Redgrave's in particular is a little dodgy.I really did enjoy it.7/10."
"6","I want a second but with new writers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9689860/?ref_=tt_urv","brolsen-98886","20 March 2024","So I rated this higher than it has a right to be rated but I don't want to take away from what could've been and what could be if there is a sequel.This clandestine organization known as the Beekeepers is really compelling. I love the idea of this movie. However, the only good thing about this was Jason Statham and Jeremy Irons. The supporting actors were horrible and cartoonish. It went from being prospectively a terrific movie in the beginning, to just comical and not in a good B-movie (no pun intended) type of way.The thing that destroyed this movie was the character writing. Statham's character didn't have much background and was an easy write as a typical elite action hero. Even so, they gave him some cheesy dialogue at times. Jeremy Irons was the only realistic character. Everyone else, especially the money folks, were like goofy caricatures of cartoon villains. His FBI tail, being his neighbor's (that he is avenging) daughter, had the most unrealistic plot line and character development you can imagine. She had zero grief nor internal conflict displayed. If they had gone a more serious direction, this movie would've been knockout. They should make a sequel with better writing."
"7","A great Jason Statham Flick!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9558753/?ref_=tt_urv","subxerogravity","12 January 2024","Important to put it like that.This is the type of film I would expect from Statham. It reminds me of films like The Transporter and Crank but in fairness comparing The Bee Keeper to the others The Bee Keeper takes itself a little more seriously with a plot of standing up for the underdog ageist big business that makes the path of revenge this movie goes down even sweeter.Statham takes his homage of the 80s action hero to a new level of invincibility that would humble Dominic Toretto. I mean some of the action sequences were just wild from beginning to end, but I ate it up!Statham is serving up the best man meal i had for a while and its as sweet as Honey!"
"4","I am a big Jason Statham fan, but this movie failed to excite me.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9558632/?ref_=tt_urv","imseeg","12 January 2024","I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful."
"9","I enjoyed this tremendously.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9613630/?ref_=tt_urv","Fella_shibby","10 February 2024","As a fan of Jason Statham, I took all my family members with me to a nearby Le Reve theatre in Bandra West. My family was like 'yo man!'
This is a fast paced action thriller n has some very brutal scenes for which it is rated as an adult viewing n cos of that my daughter was asked to show her age proof thrice.I hope the film becomes a franchise like John Wick n The Equalizer.This one is hundred times better than the lousy n terrible Expandables 4 which I saw in the same theatre. (In Expandables 4 Iko Uwais is totally wasted. He is such a treat to watch for his Silat n martial arts techniques).Coming back to this film, this one moves at a soild pace n the action is non stop."
"7","Classic Jason Statham","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9599628/?ref_=tt_urv","alwinsup","2 February 2024","A good none brain thinking action movie. Plenty of things happen during the movie. Good amount of action, story line, acting, build-up time, etc, etc.Jason Statham, as always, delivers his A-performance. At first I was doubtfull; will it not be a movie that is put togheter in less then 4 weeks? However it has a decent quality. People clearly thought about the story line before shooting it. The extra deepness of the story arround the ''bee-keepers'' instead of just acting the average middle class guy gave it a nice extra touch.Just buy your snacks and drink and relax a bit! You will have a good easy time!"
"3","So much action, so little thinking","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9553732/?ref_=tt_urv","Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024","Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required."
"10","Easy 10 for me - Even if I'm in the minority I highly recommend","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9554886/?ref_=tt_urv","UniqueParticle","11 January 2024","So glad I got to see an early screening in imax on 1-6-24 just couldn't review yet. Anyway such an enriching thrill ride to satisfy any action fan of badass one man army types kinda like John Wick with a different style to it! I've been a fan of Jason Statham for a couple decades now and this is one of his best. The writing is magnificent too Kurt Whimmer is perfect for in depth action extravaganza.For an autistic person that's been scammed numerous times Beekeeper hit the spot; I absolutely loved the way everything played out. Well directed, crystal smooth writing, amazing story and top notch action; highly recommend I'll definitely want to own in 4K!"
"6","Bees","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9580984/?ref_=tt_urv","parksiet","23 January 2024","I swear if I heard Jason Statham say ""I have to protect the hive"" one more time, I was about to walk out. The Beekeeper has the most bee-related puns since The Bee Movie, and that is not a good thing. The movie will be entertaining for some, but if I'm being honest, we've all seen this movie before. It's a Jason Statham action movie and does not deviate from the pattern. Heck, it's a lesser John Wick. And yet, yeah... the action is good. It's a mindless popcorn flick that escalates quickly, and some will love it for that, however, I see it maybe only being fun after having a few drinks and putting it on with a group of friends - it's pretty silly and very undemanding of its audience. Yes, The Beekeeper is indeed a very mid-January film - lots of cheap thrills and corny one-liners."
"3","Pretty bad","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9590342/?ref_=tt_urv","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024","Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"7","The movie is a lot fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9577132/?ref_=tt_urv","rikard-99-353079","21 January 2024","This movie is a LOT of fun. Reminded me of Equalizer, but with less gravitas and more action. The main appeal of the movie is Statham kicking ass and taking no prisoners and you get this in spades. There's a bit of political intrigue, but most of it is a little silly and unrealistic (although having Jeremy Irons in the cast helped to make it not feel TOO corny). The one thing it could have done better was having a more formidable ""boss"" villain. Josh Hutchinson does a great job as the sleazy money villain (far better than I would have expected), but the muscle villain shows up too late and doesn't get enough air time."
"7","""You have laws until they fail... That's why you have me.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9690577/?ref_=tt_urv","darigato","20 March 2024","This is a movie made very much in the image of John Wick (2014). With its overly privileged mogul villain (Josh Hutcherson) and his gang, to its neon tinged settings and innovative fights. But this David Ayer (Suicide Squad) directed brawler has a suave style that sets it apart from its inspiration.It stars out pretty traditionally. Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is contently raising his honeybees and living with elderly Mrs. Parker (Phylicia Rashad) who shares her home with him. When a grave injustice leads to tragedy, it's time for vengeance! Meanwhile, FBI agent daughter Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman) tries to bring the criminals responsible to justice herself. As she figures out just how deep the crime syndicate goes, she slowly realizes what her new acquaintance is capable of and what his title actually implies...The slow buildup of Statham's titular character mirrors John Wick's introduction exactly. They both share a bond with something or someone they care for. Both are killed by an arrogant crime lord. We get an expositional speech rife with one-liners, this time delivered by Jeremy Irons (The Lion King). The colour palette switches from a soothing beehive yellow and white to over-saturated fluorescent as the film progresses. They even have the old-timely phone operator scene. Switchboard and neon green computer monitors to boot!The parallels to Wick are immediately apparent. One might even call it a new sequel... or a rip-off depending on your viewpoint. The lasting impact of a film can be evident in its imitations. The film White House Down (2014), is similar to the classic Die Hard (1987) as Beekeeper is to Wick. The beats and characters of those films are exactly the same, yet the two directors trademarks differentiate and make them uniquely their own. This film shows that if the formula works, it can still be successful and entertaining, even when repeated.There's a purity to the fights themselves. Very well choreographed and interesting sequences mostly free of CGI. The film trades in Wick's smooth and streamlined long takes for more traditional ""shaky-cam"", however there's not so much static as to distract you from the brilliant fights. The action set pieces include a vivisection by a falling elevator, a mini-gun fight at a gas station and a Wick style mirror hall featuring a very South African mercenary with a metal leg.Because of the practicality of the fights, the stakes are much easier to buy into. It feels much ""realer"" than most action blockbusters today. In this movie, they used special effects sparingly while what could be done without them was kept practical. They definitely understood the task of making a stunt-driven action flick.It's by no means perfect though. There's some choppy editing and some pretty sweaty lines throughout, the majority of which are delivered by Lampman's character, agent Verona Parker. Her only purpose is basically to verbally speak the metaphors of the film to the viewers. The symbolism isn't very subtle by itself either. It has a real problem of underestimating viewer intelligence pretty frequently. The fact that she was allowed to be put in the case of her mother's death immediately without any regard for her being easily emotionally compromised is pretty unlikely.The conflicting morals of her and Clay are actually very good conceptually. Verona represents the laws that exist to protect and to serve the public. Clay is that one that is willing to do whatever it takes, no matter what, to see that justice is served. Because of the corrupt system that allowed these horrible things to happen, Clay's only solution is the attack the system itself. There's essentially a battle between two sides of the same coin going on throughout. Because of that, although Parker is the weakest character, what she symbolizes makes dynamic between her and the Beekeeper stronger.The film does hint at a broader universe throughout and also sets up future stories for Clay and the others he's met on his mission. While leaving many things open ended can be irritating at this point, it definitely does earn it. Given this movie's success, there's no doubt we'll be getting more of these movies in the future.Like Wick, The Beekeeper is a fun adrenaline ride that will leave you wanting more."
"1","one more stupid over the top Hollywood action movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9582961/?ref_=tt_urv","samyakrout-65994","24 January 2024","The only good part the stealth and fitness of Jason Statham.This movie is so bad that where to start. Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat."
"9","Anti-Scammer Revenge Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9576855/?ref_=tt_urv","timeblank","21 January 2024","I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!"
"7","A Stupid Fun Action Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9600856/?ref_=tt_urv","joshgcobbjc","3 February 2024","If you're looking for something intelligent this is not your movie. If you're looking for mindless entertainment this is a perfect movie for you. Jason Statham does his usual bald British tough guy thing. This may not be groundbreaking, however as usual it is entertaining to watch him beat up FBI agents and criminals alike. Josh Hutcherson does surprisingly well as the movies villain. He does a very good job of playing a spoiled rich doosh bag that manages to get into WAY over his head. Several famous actors of yesteryear make appearances just to not do much and disappear after one or two scenes. There is also one major plot thread that is just dropped about halfway through the movie. Over all I feel pretty confident giving this movie a seven out of ten."

This Honey Is Hardcore!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9559034/?ref_=tt_urv","RightOnDaddio","13 January 2024","There is so much to like about this movie.It's got Minnie Driver in it. She's been driving a path to my heart for, yikes, thirty years now.Josh Hutcherson is a villain. And a darn good one.He's likable, funny, stupid and despicable all at once and it is lovely to see.He takes full advantage of his role and the audience in full reaps the benefits.This movie has cinematic testosterone with a capital T squeezed right from the glorious 1980's and butt-kicking with a capital B.They pair together rather nicely as they often do.The kills are plenty and plenty creative.Director David Ayer doing what he always does best.And Jeremy Irons stepping in and classing up the joint.This is a most welcome original theatrical release for January.It's not a comic book movie or a Star Wars movie.It's not a reboot, sequel or prequel.It's Jason Statham doing Jason Statham things.And it is a blast to watch on the big screen.I also highly recommend another Beekeeper film, Ulee's Gold (1997) starring Peter Fonda. It too, is quite buzz worthy."

It's quite well shot, the action scenes are well choreographed and there's a satisfyingly unlikable baddie.Statham always put in entertaining performances and he's got a cheeky chappy approach to most of his roles that always keeps it witty. Like he knows that we know that he's having a great time. He doesn't take himself too seriously and knows exactly what he's good at.The supporting cast do a decent job and the movie reaches a satisfying conclusion. I daresay a Beekeeper sequel would be pretty entertaining, too!Worth a couple of hours of your time!"

At some points I thought I was watching really bad version of Suicide Squad!I don't know how Jerome Irons agreed to be in it!Please avoid watching it.

When first seeing Lock Stock... I never would have guessed he'd become the next big action star, a time when Willis was still going strong. So kuddos to him. I really like the guy but in this movie you see that also he, even when he is younger than me, is getting to old for this kind of hands on simplicity. It clearly misses the intreguing intelligence of 'Wrath Of Man' which suits Statham more in this age phase. In two scenes I really laughed out loud because of the ridiculousness. For the fun of it I assume it to be intentionally so a big hive five plus 1 because I like the guy."

This leaves us eager for the central character's return.Though the story echoes films like John Wick, it fails to capture the same striking essence. It resides in predictability, unable to secure a place in cinematic memory.The action scenes are good but not exceptional. The actors shine in fights, yet the excitement falls short of expectations.Overall, it's an action film that oscillates between captivating and monotonous moments. The first act is promising, the second disappoints, while the third redeems some of the lost brilliance."

This time without a script. They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question.

Yes, Jason Statham is the hero of the movie. I'm the film of course he is invisible and immortal but he's a hero who saves the humanity, and this time we need some heroes, to find heroes we can be heroes so we can have hope.It is a great action movie, i suggest to everyone to watch it . The plot is good, performances are great and doesn't make you tired but can make you think.Many internet scams are around and this movie shows how easy an older age person can be scammed and lose what achieved in the life time.

""Matrix, what have you left for us? Bodies.""But all the scenes without Jason, and first of all - the whole line with the FBI agent - complete garbage, she is pointless, pathetic, boring, and stupid dialogues in her performance - sound really stupid. Cut her character out of the plot - nothing would change, she doesn't participate in its development at all.Bottom line, if you somewhere near 40, Sly and Arny were your idols in childhood, and muscular men with a minimum of dialog, but a huge charisma warm your heart - it's safe to watch, especially skipping characters - fillers."

I should've known better knowing I was going to see a Jason Statham movie. He has no talent, and he simply is known for his name and his action/fighting skills. But the reviews were so good! Apparently, the reviewers were paid off. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees. Statham has one facial expression in the movie, and it looks like boredom. Never again will I see on of his movie sin the theater... I'll wait to bore myself at home when it comes on streaming instead."

Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc .

She is a distraction and a disappointment every time she appears on screen.The film would have been much better off without her. She is not credible at all and seems uncomfortable in that role, even clumsy.She is obviously not built for this , and when I have watched her "" the umbrella academy "" ( I think ) it was more her style as not much was required of her...
I have enjoyed watching Jason which I hadn't seen much of lately , but she has ruined my film experience. She tries to play a solid character who finds everything, sees everything, understands everything, knows everything , but in fact ruins everything...
The rest of the cast were very good and although you can predict everything that will be happening next , the action scenes were good and almost credible ...;-)7/10 for Jason's performance."

The combat scenes are properly choreographed, well the scenes with talking moving the plot forward is fairly smooth.You have to suspend any critical thinking, but it is enjoyable watching him kick ass as usual with some popcorn, Coke or a beer. It's an afternoon other than that. The only spectacular thing about this movie is it's lack of originality which works for me since I had an afternoon off With nothing better to do!I wish they used real honey in one scene instead of using water, but that's the only thing I'm really bothered about actually 😃"

The script is bad, the writing is bad, and the dialogue is bad. It was so bad that I couldn't help but feel it was parody of itself because of how serious they took this subject matter.The premise is so laughable in its stupidity. If it wasn't for Statham and the surprisingly amazing action sequences, choreography, and great sound effects, this film would've been a complete waste of time.Jason Statham plays the Beekeeper who is essentially Jason Bourne, John Wick, and Agent 47 levels of badass. Jason Statham, to his credit, makes this whole Beekeeper ""society"" work as he is a sort of agent outside the government that protects society. He is retired now but is forced out to write a wrong against someone who cared for him. At it's core this film is nothing more than a paint by numbers action revenge movie. Unfortunately, it does it all in the most horrendous of ways.Then, if the story wasn't already horrible enough, the ending left my friend and I laughing. It literally, and I am not exaggerating here, just ends the cut to credits is the most erupt ending I've seen in a movie. If this ending is supposed to be set up to a possible sequel, I say NO!This year is not starting so well, but it is only January. This is commonly the slow time when it comes to movie releases. So if you are desperate enough and I mean desperate then maybe you can garner some entertainment from The Beekeeper but expect nothing from the story or characters turn your brain off enjoy your popcorn, your beverage, and good action.IMDb: 3/10

A few words just to make understand that he is justice where law does not arrive.Not care if its not realistic. We are here in front of a superhero that becomes mad when a loved person dies for some thieves of data's and money.Unfortunately thats the real violence of today : hidden criminals that try to steal your money in every way. And this movie makes really understand that for this kind of criminal only one solution should be taken :death penalty. Imagine if your grandma or grandpa died because of one of these acts... Everyone of us would like the same solution."

Jason is his standard typecast role, which you can't blame him for, he's a one trick pony but that one trick is entertaining.The whole movie is a budget-bin version of John Wick, which again is ok if you accept it for what it is.The main down fall is the casting of Emmy Raver-Lampan, who is just a stunningly bad actress. It's impossible to believe her on onscreen, even in a popcorn flick.Jeremy Irons is a welcome sight and lends credibility to the film, even though he doesn't get much screen time.Despite this I actually hope there's a sequel, fun action flicks are perfect beer and pizza viewing."

I'm not going to do that. Even action movies need to have a basic believable plot. This simply did not. Add in the bad directing and awful acting and you have a waste of time on your hands. This is where I need to point out that I wasn't even able to finish the movie. Not even sure if I made it half way. From the little I saw, I knew there could be no redemption. This is basically the same tough character Jason Stathem always plays but surrounded by an awful plot, bad acting by others and poor choreography. This is a B list movie better intended for release on cable."

All other glares are to the left. No other facial expression is ever detected. This is what is referred to as his ""range"".The extras for the fight scenes were provided by the Marcel Marceau School of Walking-In-the-Wind Mimes.Was there a good takeaway? Absolutely.

Everything else can be forgiven, even the one-man wrecking crew's refusal to wear body army while going up against FBI, SWAT, Secret Service, etc. Favorite kill: execution via ratchet strap, speeding pickup truck, and blown-out bridge. Recommended for fans of brain dead action flicks. If you need intelligence, look else where."
"6","No classic but still highly watchable","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9593281/?ref_=tt_urv","trevorwomble","29 January 2024","This is actually one of Statham's better films of the last few years. An original story about a mysterious agent seeking revenge on the despicable con men who indirectly caused the death of his friend and neighbor starts a chain of events that spiral out of control.This is pretty standard stuff for Statham but it's very well directed by David Ayer and has a good solid cast. Statham was never particularly good at accents but at least his weird hybrid is explained in the story. However as expected he excels at the well filmed action sequences, and although there is a certain preposterousnesd that someone as distinctive looking as him can somehow keep evading capture without a disguise, his coolness in a gunfight is part of his charm. It's just the Stath doing what he does best, beating people up who step in the way of his retribution for an evil act.There's blood, gore and violence as well as bad language (although he rarely swears here) and the film is a great popcorn movie providing you don't mind that sort of thing. Statham may not be the worlds greatest actor but he's not terrible either. He knows what he's doing in films like this and does it very well, especially with a solid director like Ayer behind the camera."

I'm a Statham fan, and I don't go into his movies expecting great depth of writing. This story was clever though and the action scenes were top notch. I always laugh when I read reviews of a movie in this genre where people complain of it being ""over the top,"" and unrealistic. That is kinda the point!There was some weak acting on the part of others in the film. That could certainly have been improved. Admittedly I kind of winced whenever the lady and the guy FBI agents were on screen. Just the same, the move hits the mark for me. Good action scenes, and a unique, very unlikable, villain."

Multiple very bad fight scenes and the acting could not be worse. Jason Stratham is significantly better in The Meg, which says a lot in and of itself, and he looks old and slow in this movie. The fight scenes are egregious and completely unrealistic, but at least they are back to back with very minimal dialogue in between. The names on the marquis are great, Jeremy irons, Jason Stratham, Felicia Rashad, all brought to shake with this show. The story line might be the worst part and continues to hammer home the bee theme. All of it is just plain terrible."

"6","Jason Statham Stings Back in ""The Beekeeper""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9602153/?ref_=tt_urv","PedroReviews","3 February 2024","Jason Statham returns to the screen in ""The Beekeeper"" (2024), wielding his fists and signature stoicism with gritty aplomb. While the plot might be as familiar as your worn-out leather jacket, the action sequences pack a punch that'll leave you buzzing with adrenaline.Statham embodies Clay, a beekeeper with a past as an elite operative known as ""The Beekeeper."" When his kindhearted landlady becomes the victim of a phishing scam, Clay unleashes his particular brand of revenge, his sting sharp and unforgiving. Think Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills with a beehive beard and a penchant for blunt instruments.The plot unfolds like a well-worn action movie map. You've got the wronged protagonist, the ruthless villain (played with deliciously evil glee by Stanley Tucci), and a trail of bodies leading to a showdown. But hey, sometimes comfort food just hits the spot, and ""The Beekeeper"" serves up a satisfying helping of vengeance with a side of well-choreographed fight scenes.Now, let's talk action. Statham does what he does best: dispatching bad guys with balletic brutality. Bullets whiz past him like angry bumblebees, but Clay remains miraculously unscathed. It's a bit like watching Neo dodge bullets in ""The Matrix,"" but somehow grounded in the grimy reality of this film's world. It's over-the-top, sure, but hey, that's part of the fun, right?What ""The Beekeeper"" lacks in narrative originality, it makes up for in its timely context. The film touches on themes of online scams and the vulnerability of everyday people, adding a layer of relevance that resonates in today's digital age. It's not exactly groundbreaking social commentary, but it gives the action a touch of weight beyond pure entertainment.So, is ""The Beekeeper"" a masterpiece of cinema? No, but it's a perfectly enjoyable action flick that delivers exactly what you expect from a Jason Statham movie: bone-crunching action, a sprinkle of dark humor, and a plot that, while predictable, doesn't get in the way of the punches and bullets. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush and a reminder that Statham can still kick some serious butt, then ""The Beekeeper"" might just sting you in the right way. Just remember, don't try any of his moves at home...or maybe just don't get involved in phishing scams."

I like Statham, and I like dumb movies but this one is a hive too far. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Plenty of bad movies I love to rewatch, but stink stank stunk, my friends. The premise itself could have worked however the unfolding story just clips along super nonsensically. Super. Nonsense. And it all goes to the script. Like this must have been a rough, ROUGH first draft and left to just go to production. In short, I am certain there will be a sequel, but OMG I hope not. ALSO, dying ones beard at his age is super funny. Eminem, Fallon, Statham - - - you're all on notice. If you make a silly movie, at least try to look less silly."

This is merciless vengeance and ass-kicking action on an extremely entertaining level.There are parallels to The Equalizer with Denzel Washington. If you like The Equalizer, you'll love The Beekeeper.I think the reason for the low rating is some of the side roles. Without naming them now.Don't overreact to these side roles, people. What matters is Statham, and he is doing great."

I won't spoil too much, but the plot of the film while it may simplistic, actually gives a convincing enough reason to keep you engaged. It also manages to make you root for the hero like a kid would.A huge credit needs to go to Jason Statham for his charismatic personality and acting on screen, which made the film so much more enjoyable. The second credit needs to go to the fight choreographer, for the excellently shot fight scenes which make you feel the speed and brutality of it.While the film may not be too revolutionary, it's a simple film with a great cast and great action scenes, so if you're looking for something not to deep but still likeable and fun, this movie is definitely for you."

In align with that, it's worth mentioning limited acting, a terrible script and zero cinematographic intentions to make a good movie. Please keep Jason Statham away from the cameras for the upcoming years until he's retired unless he decides to compromise with his job. On the other hand, Jeremy Irons: shame on you for accepting being part of such a stupid story. I guess the writers were trying to create a mediocre copy of Jonh Wick, but without giving it too much thought. Finally, let's not allow that Emmy Raver-Lampman work in a film again, or, is the script to blame for her total unrealistic performance? This film has too many flaws to be depicted in a single review, but it was awful and a complete waste of time."
"","More waste of Statham's acting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9699825/?ref_=tt_urv","MAD_PIGE0N","24 March 2024","This is John Wick on steroids, because The Beekeeper manages to overcome all kind of security, protection, soldiers etc. He acts a bit like a lunatic, but a good one. Which would have been fine if it wasn't for the overexaggeration of the character, but what is worse are the other characters - the absurd androgyne (of course, what would a movie be without some twisted human creature) who should not even exist, considering what the Beekeepers are. We then have the rich punk Derek with high-power parents who decided to steal people for no reason - he has everything, why would he do that? But it's not only him - all the characters around him are just as stupid and absurd, and incapable, while they shouldn't be, but I don't want to spoil. It isn't getting any better in the face of agent Parker whose mental processing capabilities are not fast, while her colleague is completely inadequate and deprived of any interests and analytical thinking. But don't get desperate - it is getting even better (in the wrong direction): the fighting scenes are more ridiculous than Fast and Furious, and it all ends in a stupid plot that could have been something original - maybe not too amazing, but a decent action movie. So at this point, no soundtrack or visual effects could repair or improve anything. I am simply sorry for Statham whose talent was wasted with poor or average action movies."

However, despite all that, quite watchable. The characters were good, their parts executed as you would want them to be (no stand outs) the story was predictable and did not shy away from the craved action or relentlessness that makes a good revenge movie. Some excellent action sequences that will satisfy most enthusiasts. The end left it quite open for a sequel, though could quite easily end there.

All is good with poor action in the FBI actor. Emmy & Bobby. Both are not applicable for this kind of acting in this field they should act like they are a security in the building nothing more.But the story was good even Jason did his usual in action and provided the good parts. But the other side plz not to work on good movies they look like low budgetThe enhancement was n that story was gradually Ben escalated with more of entertainment and enthusiasm. But as I said before. The actors didn't provide the best performances."

No.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9594174/?ref_=tt_urv","adamhatfield","30 January 2024","I know what you're thinking, Jason Statham was awesome and wrath of man and I bet this is going to be a great movie from the premise that I saw from the preview. But you were wrong. This movie was written by all the rejects that weren't on strike apparently and I don't know how they wrote some of these lines and then said "" That's good, let's go to print. "". This could have been so cool. The best thing in this whole movie was the FBI partner of the garbage female lead. The cat from the Hunger Games did an okay job of making sure that you didn't like him so he probably wasn't bad either in hindsight. Everyone leaving the theater we were in was like WTF did we just watch. The ending conflict at the compound with all of the secret service agents not protesting the massive amount of comical contract killers in proximity to President was just lazy."

It's supposed to be an action movie that is fun and enjoyable, and it delivers. Story is decent enough to get you through the movie. Action begins pretty quickly and he kicks butt the entire time. Extremely entertaining movie. It's a classic Statham movie.If anyone gives this a bad review it's because they are idiots. I hate when people eat h a Jason Statham movie expecting some sort of masterpiece or work of art. He delivers an enjoyable, action packed, and entertaining movie almost every time, and this one is no different."
"7","Suprisingly fun and entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9596915/?ref_=tt_urv","dubond","31 January 2024","Don't let the January burial deter you from THE BEEKEEPER, a wild action thriller that works by enthusiastically embracing just how ludicrous it is, with every member of the cast, even down to the smallest role, knowing exactly what kind of movie they're in.In one of his best films, Jason Statham *IS* Adam Clay, a loner beekeeper renting a barn on the property of elderly widow Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad). When Eloise commits suicide after losing her entire savings in a computer virus phishing scam, Clay vows that those reponsible will pay, and he'd preferably do so without the involvement of Eloise's FBI agent daughter Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman). Clay manages to find the office complex of the data mining outfit that conned Eloise, takes out several security goons and burns the place to the ground. All of this happens in the first ten minutes, which gives you an idea of just how hard THE BEEKEEPER hits the ground running and never stops. The data mining outfit is one of many overseen by Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson), a douchey, skateboarding billionaire tech bro rich kid who leaves the legalities and the paperwork to absurdly-named trusted family friend Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons), a former CIA director who has agreed to run the Danforth dynasty in the place of Derek's absent mother. When Westwyld reaches out to the current CIA director (Minnie Driver) and is told that all evidence points to Clay being a ""beekeeper,"" she wishes Westwyld the best of luck and extricates herself and the agency from the situation.What follows is absolute madness that almost makes this Statham's PUNISHER: WAR ZONE. It's the best film in years from either director David Ayer, who's a much better writer (TRAINING DAY, DARK BLUE) than a filmmaker (HARSH TIMES, SABOTAGE, SUICIDE SQUAD, BRIGHT, THE TAX COLLECTOR) or journeyman screenwriter Kurt Wimmer, who's never lived up to the promise of 2002's EQUILIBRIUM. There's a jaw-dropper of a reveal midway through that I won't spoil, but this is Statham at his stoical, vengeful best, a welcome return to form after last fall's unwatchable EXPEND4BLES fiasco.THE BEEKEEPER is impossible to take seriously on any level, other than the palpable rage it shows toward greedy tech outfits that would con the elderly (it also doesn't seem likely that the FBI would let Verona work a case that indrectly involves her mother), but once all the pieces are in play, it also takes some pointed jabs at much bigger subjects. With perhaps the fewest lines he's ever had in a movie, Statham creates one of his most memorable and merciless characters, and the over-the-top, cathartically crowd-pleasing ways The Beekeeper comes up with to dispose of the bad guys had the small matinee audience rolling with laughter. Yeah, CGI explosions are apparently always gonna blow, but we've already got a contender for the year's most stupidly entertaining movie."
"3","A movie inspired by Steven Seagal","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9622424/?ref_=tt_urv","hgffcs","15 February 2024","Alright let me start by saying I love JS and he is the only reason I watched this incoherent, inochisive, badly written, poorly casted, and awful awful movie. No character is capable of showing any emotions to connect you with the story. The bees and cars on fire have better expressions than human in this movie. This feels like AI written script that puts the bees in the center of universe. A US President with British accent? I know it is a work of fiction but it wouldn't hurt to get basic facts right. Gosh, I don't want to add any spoilers but it is really hard to not spotlight almost everything that is wrong with this movie."
"9","Talk about the social questions here","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9600729/?ref_=tt_urv","mags-06346","3 February 2024","The Beekeeper has a storyline that is simple, but keeps developing. It has a good vs evil plot, which can be satisfying. There are a few surprises which keep the viewer intrigued. Jason Statham is in a typical role, which he pulls off in his quiet way. There are fewer killings than the John Wick movies. If you like violent movies, this has got it. Here his skills are unrealistic, but the plot develops that sufficiently. The twists and turns keep it interesting and entertain. The movie does teach about beekeeping, so you may learn a few things. And, the bigger social issue here of taking advantage of people deserves a public conversation. So A+ to the cast and director for bringing this up."
"6","Makes REACHER look subtle and sophisticated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9595018/?ref_=tt_urv","Couchkik20","30 January 2024","I like that the pitch is what if Halloween's Jason (or any immortal slasher killer) was the good guy. This movie makes REACHER look gentle, sophisticated and subtle. The silliness of this movie is enjoyable. We're talking 80s dumbness with a bit of Luc Besson's movie's shiny look and stupidity. This is a violent comedy vaguely inspired by John Wick but happy with being fun and crazy with some bad CGI explosions.Of course you have the diversity female part as the badass cop to side with our invincible white hero. Jason Statham is half Bruce Willis half video game meathead and the less he talks the more he's in character. Josh Hutcherson looks like Jack Harlow if he was in Duran Duran. Dialogues make no sense, villains are from Gotham's gutter and the Beekeeper can enter any room, access any building, borrow any vehicule if needed, defeat all adversaries.Thanos would have lost against the Beekeeper ."
"7","Fun Little Action Ride","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9598576/?ref_=tt_urv","mkhulaify","1 February 2024","If you're expecting a masterpiece, an Oscar-worthy movie, the you gotta manage your expectations. This is a great movie that's loud, exciting, over-the-top, and fun! It delves deep into the action genre and delivers exactly what you'd hope for from a Jason Statham film. The fight choreography is top-notch, and the stunts are heart-stopping. However, while Statham shines, some of the supporting characters feel poorly written and their performances fall flat, which can be distracting. Nonetheless, if you're in the mood for adrenaline-pumping entertainment, this movie delivers in spades. Watch it for a quick brainless fun time with not much expectations, and you'll enjoy it."
"7","Action-packed Statham movie...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9652559/?ref_=tt_urv","paul_haakonsen","1 March 2024","Of course I sat down to watch the 2024 movie ""The Beekeeper"", as it was starring Jason Statham.Writer Kurt Wimmer put together an enjoyable script and storyline, which proved to be a good old fashioned action thriller. I have to say that while this might be a stereotypical Jason Statham movie, it was really enjoyable. I grew up on the action movies from Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, Seagal, and the likes, so of course I enjoy Statham movies a lot as well.I guess, we as the audience are not supposed to question where Adam Clay (played by Jason Statham) keeps getting all the gear that he accumulates in between each different location that he goes through on his way towards his target. And he just conveniently happens to have duffel bags stored away at key locations that happen to be the exact location where he has to go. Makes perfect sense.Of course one can argue for ""The Beekeeper"" being a generic Jason Statham movie, and I won't disagree. And yeah, this is a one man against insurmountable number of enemies and still coming out almost unscathed. But honestly, this type of movie is something that he does quite well, and it is rather enjoyable and entertaining with these hard-hitting action movies, just like the good old 1980s and 1990s action movies.The acting performances in the movie were good, and of course you know what you get with Jason Statham in the lead. It was rather nice to see Phylicia Rashad on the screen, despite it being just for a brief while. And it was also nice to see the likes of Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson on the screen.There is a good amount of action throughout the course of the movie, and again, you know what you get with Jason Statham in the lead. And he definitely delivered once again here with this movie. It was nicely choreographed and executed on the screen. The action certainly adds a lot of flavor to a movie such as ""The Beekeeper"".This is essentially a good popcorn movie.My rating of director David Ayer's 2024 movie ""The Beekeeper"" lands on a seven out of ten stars."
"10","Let there be light","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9568033/?ref_=tt_urv","mecanik-1447","16 January 2024","This movie, 'The Beekeeper,' is precisely the kind of film the world desperately needs at this moment. In an age where scamming has become an unfortunate part of our daily lives, happening every day, every hour, every minute, this movie shines a much-needed spotlight on these deceitful practices. Its impactful narrative and compelling storytelling have the power to open eyes and potentially bring about a significant change. Hopefully, it will make more people aware, leading to these scammers finally going out of business. 'The Beekeeper' isn't just a film; it's a masterpiece that blends entertainment with a powerful message, a cinematic gem that could play a crucial role in changing societal perspectives and practices. A must-watch for anyone who believes in the power of cinema to inspire and effect real-world change."

However, I haven't gone to the cinema for many years because, for me, most films are simply not worth the price of admission.Action films from the USA are by far the worst because they are usually devoid of any humor. The heroes must always be superheroes, indestructible and invulnerable. That's boring in the long run."

I expected just another bee grade action movie but it pretty much delivered an all fronts. Jason Statham was a pretty cool John wick, equaliser type of main character. And I must say as hard as it is to beelieve josh Hutcherson was really good as a villian.The plot wasn't the best, pretty basic and nothing new or inventive but for the most part the action scenes were done really well. The script was kind off silly. The amount of bee puns and analogies started beeing really annoying at some point though. A good way to kill time tho. 7/10."

This is just another run of the mill Statham action flick, but this time with a real sting in the end. Jason Statham the man I grew up with as ""The Transporter"" kicks ass per usual. The set pieces suffice with some obvious CGI explosions here and there. The supporting actors are good enough and of course all the villains are white with the ""United Nations"" of heroes serving as the FBI.This story really goes out on a limb, as do most action flicks these days. The political satire was just about as dumb as the real thing. I enjoyed the pot shots towards the Biden and Clinton crime families. Overall it's not a bad movie if you turn off your mind which seems to be all we do these days considering the low quality ""woke"" entertainment we're fed. What we have here is a real honeypot of cliche action mixed with standard modern day ideology. Nothing groundbreaking but pretty much expected, check it out."
"7","Everything you want from an action film.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9729115/?ref_=tt_urv","MattMovieNerd","10 April 2024","When I first heard about this movie, I was intrigued by its cast and crew - David Ayer and Jason Statham. And I wasn't disappointed. The film turned out to be a highly entertaining action flick.The story revolves around Mr. Clay (played by Statham), a former government agent who now lives a peaceful life as a beekeeper. But when someone he cares for deeply is harmed, he takes matters into his own hands and sets out to seek revenge.The action sequences in this movie are incredible, with expertly choreographed fight scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The plot is classic, and who doesn't love a good revenge story? All in all, this movie delivers what you'd expect from an action movie."
"6","This isn't your typical revenge flick.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9732115/?ref_=tt_urv","nERDbOX_Dave","12 April 2024","This isn't your typical revenge flick. Sure, Jason Statham delivers his signature brand of bone-crunching action, but this time, his wrath feels satisfyingly grounded. The film cleverly taps into our collective frustration with real-life scams - the phishing schemes, the telemarketing cons - that leave everyday people devastated.Statham plays Adam Clay, a former government operative with a mysterious past. When his kindhearted landlady falls victim to a cruel scam and takes her own life, Adam unleashes the fury of a ""Beekeeper,"" a highly trained ex-agent. The film doesn't shy away from the emotional toll these scams take. We see the desperation, the shattered trust, and the anger that fuels Adam's rampage."
"4","GOOFBALL CITY...!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9594373/?ref_=tt_urv","masonfisk","30 January 2024","The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."

This might as well be his version of a John Wick franchise.The plot is following a beekeeper (Jason Statham) after the lady he has been helping dies after being scammed and stolen from everything. He decides to go on the hunt for those that are responsible. Which leads into something more than he expects.Awesome plot which he follows a certain set of guidelines until the system is broken is were he steps in and at full force to stop the threats. The action sequences are awesome. Jason Statham was great. The rest of cast ensemble is good too. David Ayers direction is full of fast paced and action that makes this film worth seeing on the big screen. Sure the dialogue can be a little repetitive with characters explaining a beekeeper and how they are meant to protect the hive which sure is explaining it to the audience of who this character is.Overall, it is one of the most entertaining action films from Jason Statham since the first Transporter films."

I've seen hundreds of great revenge movies and I can't say any of them were as satisfying as this movie was. Great mix of comedy with action. Nothing memorable like Arnie's ""I'll be back!"" lines but good enough for a well earned smile.I hope they do a sequel with the same premise. Except this time go after the heads of the criminals that kidnap or lure people with fake jobs and get forced to do computer and text scams.Although this movie isn't perfect and I almost never give such a high rating I felt this movie deserved a rating boost. And a faint hope for a sequel and even fainter hope of fewer scam texts on my cell phone."

Director David Ayer & writer Kurt Wimmer are no novices to the B+ action genre.John Wick has been taking up all the lone-killing-machine real estate of recent years. Where Wick leans into assassin/fantasy, Beekeeper does well to stay relevant. Turning on internet scams, dirty money, sketchy government officials, & family ties, it lays an acceptably current foundation. No, it's no Pulitzer, but heavyweights Statham, Rashad, Irons, Driver, Hutcherson, et al, & a competent supporting cast hit the right dramatic beats along the way. There's room for slightly better characterisation but one appreciates that the set armourer has priority over the acting coach in the high body count genre.My minor quibble is with the ""jello"" effect video cinema cameras suffer from. Not really suited to action films but when you're shooting fast and lean, who can afford the crispness of the film (celluloid) frame these days?"

But you're not here for the story, you're here to watch Statham dispatching bad guys and others not as bad when the circunstances demand. And he delivers.

It's a film that fades away without a trace, incapable of evoking emotions or keeping you glued to the screen.The screenplay is the film's most glaring weakness. The dialogue, banal and lacking bite, and at times embarrassing, sounds like it was written by an elementary school student. The lines follow each other without cohesion, devoid of rhythm and any psychological depth. The actors, though talented, find themselves reciting empty words, unable to bring to life flat and stereotypical characters. And you, the viewer, cringe for them, given the artistic depth of the cast.The most dynamic scenes lapse into the absurd, making the first TV Batman look like a Marvel masterpiece. Special effects that at least made us laugh, as there was no trace of adrenaline to be found.P. S.: Too bad, because the first ten minutes could have given rise to a truly interesting action movie."

You can call him cheesy and corny and indeed he is but he does it so perfectly you don't care.Some of the dialogue would be laughable in other films, some of the scenes would be classed as unrealistic in other films, and happily there's not a gun involved with unlimited magazine. :)
There's plot holes galore and some very questionable scenes and yet...this film is fabulous. I loved it and sat without moving from start to finish.Statham has that electrifying presence that makes you forced to watch him and in any other hands this film would have been a porker. But Statham safely guides us through moral righteousness, revenge, justice and a very relevant criminal committing cyber scams is his ultimate target.Entirely watchable, entirely enjoyable, The best action film in a while bar none!"

Still at its core roots being just a run around action movie, but with evidence of compelling acting from the lead cast. It's is one of Jason Statham most enjoyable recent action movies. The opening carries the storyline and sets a semi relatable premise, that connects the viewers to the core theme due to being able to possibly identify the initial characters with someone they know. This allows this exaggerating story with wild concepts to be easily followed and not lost while watching. While have captivating fights scenes, not shying away from gruesome finishings but sill being extremely watchable by not being very gore heavy. The antagonist is an antagonist through and through, not with a weak half baked redeemable message and I appreciate that from the movie. Definitely a recommended watch for casual fun."

She appeared to force everything. Also, the writing for her character didn't help. They could have done a better job of showing her inner battle between being thankful for Jason and also trying to do her job. She made this movie go from a 10 to a 5. Jason did a great job as usual and the villains killed their roles. I feel like it can't be too hard to hire ex FBI agents to help make the parts seem a little more realistic.

Comparing it to John Wicks first introduction, I'd say I was insanely more captivated throughout this WHOLE movie. Simple plot BUT with a great concept. It seems in the beginning its just going to be a fun revenge film and it was, but not simplisticly so.The Hive can be explored even further with a sequel and more if Hollywood is smart. I don't believe any studio has lost money with Strathem at the helm and his last franchise movies were so long ago. And personally, I prefer old hard men in these roles Ala Keanue Reeves."

There's something to be said to delivering simple details well that provide a quality experience for action lovers. Statham is his usual self, but also better than I've seen him in some of his other recent work.Overall the plot is very basic and predictable, which again is fine because everything else surrounding it was solid. Another film that is in the John Wick category of type of films, but isn't, yet also doesn't trip over itself like some other attempts have.It's a fun , easy going, enjoyable watch."

Action packed, thin plot, cheesy dialogue, poor acting but good popcorn movies.This has no plot, and seems written as an afterthough. The character doesn't seem consistent, the scenarios are absurd, the decisions are dumb and there's not even a few one liners to chuckle at.Statham plays the same kind of character he always plays minus the usual dark humor. The guy from the Hunger Games plays a ridiculous villain and for the life of me, I don't know how they got Jeremy Irons to join this steaming pile of dung.If you value your time, go watch somethi else. I have no idea why or how this got such a high rating. I went in with low expectations, and it fell short of those."
"8","Great, Loved it.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9575590/?ref_=tt_urv","ashmithnandy","20 January 2024","The movie was good, and I give it 8 out of 10. The movie had really great action in it, brilliant fight scenes. Great work by David Ayer and the rest of the cast and crew. The music was good too. The story was entertaining from the beginning till the end. I was hoping to see more from the movie as I felt the movie short, so I think that the movie could've been longer. It would be great to have a continuation of this story. Jason Statham's character Adam Clay aka The Beekeeper was really like the best, dangerous and most feared characters throughout the whole movie. So at the end, I'm really hoping that the movie gets multiple sequels, and it was a great time watching The Beekeeper. I would surely recommend others to give this movie a watch and love it, as it's the best film of January that has released. If anyone asks me what is the best film to watch in January, then I'd recommend The Beekeeper."

Emmy Raver-Lampman is an absolute queen of a co-star along side a hive of other zany characters.A super refreshing outing from Statham showing that he's still got it and that action movies can still be worth the price of entry and I hope to see more of this from him after getting worn out from all the fast and furious movie's."
"5","Not the Bees!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9556988/?ref_=tt_urv","chenp-54708","12 January 2024","The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"6","Statham fans will be happy enough!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9568106/?ref_=tt_urv","Sadboosh56","16 January 2024","I'll go as light on spoilers as possible.I am 100% guilty for getting into the Statham watch mood. A bunch of nonsensical, action flicks with cheesy lines and loud noises. I love it. This movie was kinda that with the addition of a couple terrible FBI agents and even worse bad guys.Statham did his usual, coming out of retirement for a reason action film perfectly fine. His lines were bee related and most of the time looked like he had to say them over again...which just adds to the charm. The issues were more that the writing was terrible for the rest of the cast.I'm not too sure who had the bright idea of adding the two FBI agents but they really did not bring much to the table. The main one had to tell you that they were smart whilst at no point showing it. Forget about passing a physical fitness test. Kinda reminded me of lethal weapon where they were drunk and still going to their job, which makes it a bit tough to take them seriously. I'm not at all against cursing in movies but you tend to seem more professional when you limit it to under 50% of your dialogue.I was quite stoked when I saw Jeremy Irons pop up and figured he would be an awesome bad guy, nope we have some angry man child, Josh Hutchinson, that seems as threatening as a pampered 10 year old.They could have gone the John Wick route and grabbed a bunch of people you'd recognize from older movies but instead rely solely on Statham.As long as you're fine ignoring the ever changing tone of the film, it is another fun Statham adventure. It doesn't make it into my top 10 for him but I'm still happy I got to see it!"

Ok Where to Start. Look, I'm not going to be a downer on this Film. There were Multiple People Laughing throughout the Audience, so the Fun Factor was Definitely There.🐝/ 🌍 I Mean the Core Concept of the World of Bees that is used as a Juxtaposition against Humanity and It's Upper Echelon of Constructs was a Great Idea.Let's do the Positives First -1. 😠Or🎉Or🤡. The Tone of the Film. I Love this Tone . It's Basically Jason Statham is Dead Serious(Every Time he is around FBI, Security Guards or the Scam Workers it's Funny because he plays it Dead Seriously and Everything Around him is Pretty Much a Joke😂🤣), with Everyone Else Being 1 of 5 Things -1a. 🃏 Characters are either Flamboyant Caricatures (Hosts of the Scam, Australian Guy and his Crew and The Pink Jacket Beekeeper)
1b. 🎉 Or Have this Comedic/Jovial Tone About them (Workers of the Scam in this Corporate Building, The FBI couple, one of them whose Mother Just Died by the Way 🤦🏻😂)
1c. Or Cannon Fodder(Seals, Delta Force, Heavily Armed FBI Guys)
1d. 😠 Or Serious (2nd in command of FBI, The President)
1e. 💆 Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are doing some sort of Whimsical/Serious at Times Tone.2. 📜.....I think the Opening Works, and Many of the Ideas of the Film are Great. But where are the Thawing out and Details of Pretty much everything in this Film?3. 💣 The Action Scenes. Some of the Action Scenes were Ok and Others Were Great. Particularly -3a. FBI outside the Building Scene.3b. The Elevator Scene.3c. 🃏 The Pink Jacket Beekeeper Scene. (LOL it was just outta nowhere and Ridiculous yet Entertaining)3d. 🔪 The One on One Fight Scene near the End. WHAT A SCENE! IT GOT PRETTY INTENSE. Multiple Oooooossss from the Audience I was with.On to the Negatives -1a. 📜 Did they Rush the Script or Something? Again the Core Concept of the Bees ""Keeping Things in Check"" is a Great idea. Where's the Fleshing out of this and Everything Else?1b. 🐝 So the Beekeepers are So Deadly Right? So Deadly, that the Beekeepers make the Delta Force and the Navy Seals look like Wimps right? So why does Jason Statham Dispatch of a Flamboyantly Dressed Eccentric Beekeeper 🐝 with Not Too Much Effort? I mean, she didn't last that long, at all. Some of the Navy Seals put up more of a Fight than her(Not really, but you get what I mean)1c. 🐝 The Queen Bee Concept. So when the Queen Bee becomes Less Productive or Sick, the Worker Bees Kill her right? So why did the Filmakers Abandon this right at the Very end when Jason Statham is Staring at the Queen? Hello! He's called the Beekeeper and he doesn't even Follow through on the Concept? Ok so the Writers had no Balls to pull off the Kill? What about the Writers at Least Playing on this Angle At the Very End far more? Have Jason Statham take hold of that Revolver and having the Son and Queen There Playing Russian Roulette with the Revolver or Something. But I get that they decided to go with ""Well, the Beekeeper Killed the Defective Offspring"" I guess.1d. 🐝 You're Telling me that the Queen Bee didn't know where all that Money 💰 was Coming from?🤷 Neutral Note - Why is Jason Statham Actually Handling Bees? Is this part of the Beekeeper Training Regiment? Or Just a Schtick that's part of the Film? Ok that's fine, I have no Real Problem with that.Overall, with all that Said LOL. Was I Entertained?........Yes, I was."

You will definitely enjoy Jason Stratham skills and what he normally does in majority of his movies as he replicates them skills in this flick as well. 6 over 10 rating and the action scenes were great. The message passed is something still done in the world today which is not cool so as per Jason mode, he goes on a rampage to redeem the situation the only way he can which has his usual martial art skills. The Cinematography was actually great as well and the dialogues moved the movie considerably which helps in movies like this. Watch once and shelve."

I may be on the minority, but I actually even thought John Wick 4 was overrated. The bullet proof jackets were a bit of overkill. Expendables 4 was so bad, that I can barely remember what happened in most of the movie. But this one I actually enjoyed. Could the writing have been a lot better, sure. But I didn't put this movie on hoping for an Oscar award winning movie. My only gripe is that the ending was a bit anti climatic for me. They could have written it a bit better. Overall, I enjoyed it and would probably watch it again with my wife if she can stay awake long enough for it."

I want to know how he managed to give that beekeeping monologue while keeping a straight face.The action was great, and you really can't go wrong with Jason Statham. I did enjoy the movie, but I laughed at nearly every line of dialogue. I'm pretty sure the writers expected that. We think they watched John Wick and it's rediculous premise and were like, we can do that.It got a little too silly towards the end, but it was silly all the way through.I should have tried harder to make bee puns in this review.

Actors get judged by their work but that is unfair if they are given rubbish to start with.I have seen actors ad lib better than this. Jeremy Irons is an academy award winning actor, I guess he also has to pay the rent but to sink to this level, he must be desperate.Jason Statham has had us in stitches when paired with a funny script and decent actors and his action sequences are a thing of beauty, but in this film his character is lifeless, almost zombie-like.This is such a terrible film, I gave up half way and decided to express myself here, which I rarely do.Please be warned, if you watch this film you will have wasted one hour and forty five minutes that you will never get back.I am only rambling on because some dimwit at I M D B decided to set a rule that all reviews must contain more than six hundred characters. That is the same level of intelligence that the script writer of this film has. People that dumb should not be able to breathe."
"","a comedy where the one good joke is that you paid to watch this","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9580971/?ref_=tt_urv","ryan-60325","23 January 2024","I went into this fully expecting to enjoy a bad movie. It is so, so much worse than that. Its two redeeming qualities are a ruthlessly unflattering portrayal of crypto bros and an embedded decent PSA about computer support scams. Everything else is just brutal, and it gets worse the farther it gets into the run time. My generous suspension of disbelief could not cope with the later action scenes. There are no exciting plans being executed (you know, the kind that would never work in practice but are fun to watch); it's all one guy going through the motions of the same forgettable fight scene over and over. Two throwaway ""getting in"" moments, at best. If anything in the story was supposed to be a twist, it had zero impact. The experience is kind of like watching someone else speedrun a video game on Very Easy mode, taking advantage of the fact that enemies despawn when not in camera view. The key mysterious organization is barely explained and conveniently waved away at the halfway mark, but not barely enough to avoid forming a really, really dumb outline.Doesn't lean into the cheesy bee thing enough to be hilariously terrible, although it's clear that they tried somewhat. In the end, it's just regular, boring terrible."
"7","Expose the corruption. Protect the hive.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9596501/?ref_=tt_urv","MB-reviewer185","31 January 2024","What I expected from an action movie starring Jason Statham called The Beekeeper (2024) was that it was going to be a dumb fun action movie with entertaining action and a great performance from the lead actor, along with the director David Ayer giving the movie some kind of style to it; after watching the movie I got what I thought I was going to get, and had an entertaining time watching it. The action movie The Beekeeper (2024) is an entertaining, dumb, and fun action movie that does not take itself too seriously with the lead star being cool to watch, the action sequences being well done, and having simple but easy to hate antagonists; this movie does have issues like some of the dialogue and how the third act is played out, but if you think about any issues in the movie, then the whole thing will fall apart, which is why I say it's a dumb and fun action movie.Jason Stathan as Adam Clay was great to watch him go on a revenge quest to get back at a big company of scammers that did something wrong to a person that he knew that lead to her being killed, so it is satisfying to see him kill off these bad people because you know they have wronged him in such a way that should not happen again; I also liked the certain skills he has in fighting, knowing ways to get in a building, and how he handles situations. Seeing him do his beekeeping job was fine and I liked how he uses certain beekeeping methods against people he is fighting; other than him, there is the daughter of the person Adam Clay knew who died and she is some kind of FBI agent following the brutal trail of murders from Adam Clay leading to the higher ups of the scamming company, but her moments at crime scenes were a bit unnecessary and was not that interesting even though it could have been, since she is connected to someone we know.The antagonist is mainly Josh Hutcherson's character who is a spoiled rich jerk who takes the money from the scammers and puts it out to other companies he owns, or he just uses it for pointless stuff leading to him unknowingly angering Adam Clay; the other character who is more of a father figure to Josh Hutcherson's character is played by Jeremy Irons, who has something to do with what is happening in the company, but not completely where he is also the Beekeeper's target. The action sequences are fun, well-choreographed, barely has any cuts, and is cool seeing the actor Jason Statham perform them with cool stunts and brutal kills in entertaining ways; Adam Clay does make quite a few bee puns, which can be unintentionally funny becomes the movie does not take itself too seriously, but sometimes the lines of dialogue could get weird and just too cheesy on how they are said. I do like the information we get on the organization known as ""Beekeepers"" and how they are used to protect people or protect the ""Hive"" leading to them having fun with the idea, but the third act took itself seriously on how it played out and how people were acting; it should have just kept going down the path of not taking itself too seriously.The Beekeeper (2024) has its issues, but it is a dumb and fun action movie starring Jason Statham that I was entertained by, and while watching thought it was like the other action movie John Wick (2014); the performances are good, the action sequences are fun, and the antagonist is simple and easy to hate so you can be satisfied by what happens to him. If you like cheesy dumb action movies, I would recommend this movie to you, but if you do not like intentionally funny and dumb action movies, then you should not watch this; I expected this movie to be fun and entertaining, and that is what I got."

This has to be the best one in my opinion. It was well worth the money. Some reviewers expect the actors to act like Shakespeare. I saw the movie because I wanted excitement and a good time not a Shakespeare movie. It did not disappoint. The plot talks about the current issue of cybercrimes. This is an issue that needs more attention. There were great stunts and some comedy. Some scenes were off the top, but everyone should know this is a movie, not real life. I and my wife found the movie thoroughly enjoyable. We plan on buying the DVD when it is released."

The bad guys revel in their OTT badness worse than the worst MLM charlatan you've ever seen. If you take this seriously you will die from cringing so much.Some of the actors don't know how to play it but Statham goes for a complete deadpan delivery that works.If you want something that will do anything beyond entertain you then this is one to steer clear of but it delivers enough solid action and mindless mayhem that I enjoyed it."

Statham's earlier films had some kind of storyline more than just revenge let's get even but these days it's like all he does is fight em, shoot em, kill em and although I'll probably still watch I will inevitably be disappointed. Got to use up more characters for this review so will add Minnie Driver wasn't used enough. She's great and deserves bigger roles."

Worst of all is Emmy Raver-Lampman who absolutely cannot have passed any acting class whatsoever.It is all so tragic.

Jason Statham did what he always does best, fighting with a plain face and a lot of action. There are plenty of enjoyable moments here, and audiences who want nothing more than a Jason Statham beat-'em-up will surely be satisfied.There's a half-hearted plot twist that doesn't land. Mostly, however, this is a film about explosions and bad guys getting their comeuppance. Fast cuts and more than 50 credited stuntmen and stuntwomen make for, well, buzzy spectacle. A semi-confusing script and heavy-handed direction from David Ayer muddle the proceedings, but enough inspired pizazz and Statham's earnest delivery of lines like ""I protect the hive"" just barely bring it all home.My Rating : 6.5/10."
"6","Explosive Action and Statham's Signature Style: 'The Beekeeper' Review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9581746/?ref_=tt_urv","Delboy1066","23 January 2024","Prepare for a rollercoaster of adrenaline in 'The Beekeeper,' where explosive action takes center stage. Jason Statham steps into his familiar role, delivering a performance that showcases his trademark intensity. The movie doesn't aim for subtlety; instead, it embraces a barrage of fighting, explosions, and fiery sequences. While the storyline may not offer profound depth, it serves as a vehicle for heart-pounding entertainment.Statham's portrayal fits seamlessly into the action-packed narrative, and he does what he does best - kick, punch, and shoot his way through adversaries. The film caters to audiences seeking a thrill, and it succeeds in delivering exactly that. The cinematography captures the chaos with dynamic visuals, ensuring that every explosion and fight scene keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.Despite the emphasis on action, Statham's performance is commendable. He brings a level of authenticity to his character, while the plot may not break new ground, the execution of the action sequences and the overall pacing keep the audience engaged.'The Beekeeper' seems designed for those who crave unapologetic action and don't mind sacrificing intricate storytelling. The film doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is - a high-octane ride that revels in its own intensity. If the goal is to experience a visually captivating spectacle with Statham at the helm, then this movie hits the mark.The potential for a sequel looms, especially if the film resonates with its target audience. Given the formulaic success of action-packed franchises, 'The Beekeeper' could pave the way for a second installment. Ultimately, if you're in the mood for an action-packed escape and enjoy Statham's action prowess, this film delivers the expected thrills with a promise of more to come."

So, when I saw Jason Statham starting in The Beekeeper, I didn't have to think twice.What one expects from this actor, one gets in this film.In terms of my favourite action genre, old western movies, this ia something Dok Holiday might do.He gives it bad to the bad guys, who, in this film are greedy, selfish millennials in IT fraud business, led by a privileged young jerk who looks like he's desperately needed some testosterone shots.I enjoyed the villains being portrayed as morons who enjoy spiritual gurus and ride skateboard in the office.Statham delivers 100%. He humiliates FBI, Secret service, mercenaries etc. Displaying raw masculinity at its best. He's righteous, brave and honest."

Statham and Jeremy Irons delivered strong performances, however in my opinion the plot lacked believability, resembling the introduction of John Wick in terms of a feared protagonist. It felt like an attempt to replicate the success of the John Wick franchise. Despite this, I see potential for redemption in a sequel. Regretfully, I should have waited for the movie to hit mainstream television to save some bucks.

Zero efforts were taken to write the smallest amount of realism into this script. I strongly believe Jeromy Irons can actually be scene laughing to him self during some of his ""serious scenes"" because he's going to fire his agent while at the same time thinking to himself ""I've done Shakespeare!"" The only positive aspects are the legitimate phishing scam used at the beginning (not the software) and the fight choreography which can be seen done much better in any of the John Wick films. I made sure to throw away my ticket stub to avoid any reminders or evidence I've seen this film. It's physically impossible to provide spoilers to this movie because there Was no plot."

The plot was basic but that usually doesn't matter too much in this genre of shows.The biggest distraction was bad acting by support leads. Mainly the fbi lead. She was ok, but was given a horrible script. Usually when profanity count goes up, quality goes way down. Usually in a poor attempt to try and make it scary it the actor seem tougher than they are. Less words could have been used to tell more. But there was no selling that she was truly in charge or tough. It's like they modeled her character off an old nick nolte film. But failed. By the end, I was not really thrown off by the almost comical South African hit squadThe rest is for the 300 wire count

He carried this movie, which has a great base plot, but totally fails on delivery and back story. They took a fantastic and interesting concept, and completely wasted it. They need to remove it from theaters, edit out everything but Statham being Statham. Movie would have made more sense without a plot.Is Hollywood hard up for writers these days? Was the entire budget spent on Statham and the rights to the subject material? Has to be the case. Credits should have rolled after he torched and blew up the first building belonging to the film's ""villains"".Two things are true about The Beekeeper...
1, Statham still got it!2. At least they accurately portrayed how the FBI operates in real life.Earning the 2-star rating.Save your money and wait to pick it up in the $5 Blu-Ray bin at Walmart, in a few weeks."

That cause which pittyfully gets them up in the morning to go to their 200k jobs they think they earned. Thank you David Ayer and Jason Statham for having the guts to make a film like this. You will be hated for this by those who think they are in charge and some might go after your careers but fight the fight.I give this is 10/10 --- it crushes those who think they can control the human spirit.

Also interesting that the movie brings up the topic of campaign funds. In the US, every politician is a multi millionaire, is that representative?Anyhow, Jason is as fun as always and works well as a ""righter of wrongs"". The villains are whiney pricks who feed off the vulnerable so extra gratification in their eradication.I watched this out of the blue when it popped up on prime and it kept me sitting for the duration so that has to mean something since I'm normally very judgy and cynical. Maybe my hatred for cowardly trolls and online criminals played into this, but hey, in a world of influencers, consider me influenced."
"1","Awful","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9694869/?ref_=tt_urv","javierwinstondiaz","22 March 2024","I love Jason Statham. I think he's underrated as an actor. I want to say that up front because goddamn is this movie bad. The writing is just so abysmal, it's literally hard to explain. The dialogue, the characters, the plot.... Basically every word apoken is try-hard-fake-Gen-z-speak and too much swearing. And I like swearing. But you can't just use it as a substitute for... well... everything. Humour? Swearing. Anger? Swearing. Affection? Swearing.So there's the faulty foundation upon which this monstrosity is built. And from there things don't get much better. The sound design, in particular on the dialogue, is just awful: No matter the situation it sounds like the characters are doing voice over - there's zero depth/echo/reverb. There's characters giving speeches in cavernous rooms and it's like they're standing right next to you.Let's wrap this up with two more observations: Firstly, Jason Statham and Jeremy Irons do the worst American accents. Secondly the only people who come out of this with any credit are whoever choreographed the fights and the DP - good fights, great lighting. That's it. Everything else is bottom of the barrel."
"6","The Beekeeper is a enjoyable time at the movies.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9563646/?ref_=tt_urv","renohuskies","14 January 2024","The Beekeeper is a fun serviceable action thriller, while dumb, still delivers what it promises: Jason Statham kicking ass and taking names. The film stars Statham as a former special agent who becomes a beekeeper and seeks revenge on a corrupt tech company that defrauded his elderly friend. The plot is thin and predictable, but the film makes up for it with some well-choreographed and brutal fight scenes while having some amusing and not-so-amusing bee-related humor. Statham is in his element as the stoic and lethal protagonist, who shows a softer side when he talks about his love for bees and his friendship with Phylicia Rashad. One main problem of the film is that Phylicia Rashad's character makes a significant choice. She could have made several phone calls before ""this choice."" The film also features some decent supporting performances from Emmy Raver-Lampman as Rashad's FBI daughter and Josh Hutcherson as Derek Danforth, the smarmy CEO of the tech company. The Beekeeper is not a groundbreaking or original film, but it is a fun and satisfying popcorn flick for fans of Statham and action movies. The film deserves a rating of 3 out of 5 stars."

Producer and director sucked. Very poor ending. What's wrong with you people? If you don't have any idea to how to end this picture just hire me. I will be more than happy to give you some ideas that will gain more positive feedback for this film. More scenes with intensive and analytical conversations should have been added. It's not a Steven Seagal movie from 1990s. Please, do your job and respect your viewers. This is not the twentieth century anymore and despite the dumb gen-z, there are viewers who want to see more intelligent movies.Mr. Statham at his usual best but ending sucks!

Fun mindless movie; suggest viewers to avoid overthinking the plot (there is none) so that u can enjoy the good action sequences.I would normally not watch Jason's movies but since there are hardly any good movies these few weeks, this is a good one to tide the time till the good ones come back.6/10 for good action and overall fun movie for those not overthinking the plot. The ending is really a bit underwhelming but on hindsight its my fault for expecting some twists since the movie is as expected. Pay your movie ticket price and get 2 hrs of action. That's it!"

Everything about this so called action escapism movie was laboured, the script... god forbid the woeful acting and delivery of supposedly 'smart ass' rhetoric...
There are expectations from so called 'action' stars and these expectations where certainly delivered, the 'evil' bad guy, just didn't live up to any sort of evil!The 'good cop' just fell flat, the powers that be scenario just showed they hadn't a clue...
Jason himself, well proved he was just there for the money.Save yourself time. Effort and $$$ - DON'T."

Beekeeper follows a script from todays headlines. What you usually don't see is someone willing to take any steps to right the wrongs of the malicious and ultra corrupt. Every level of crime in this movie is taken from todays news report. From data mining senior citizens to political king making it is clear evidence that the American society is on it's way to being the next to fall off the cliff.Could there be a solution to that? Could Beekeepers be an answer? You will absolutely enjoy finding out."
"7","Solid Action Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9660972/?ref_=tt_urv","torrascotia","5 March 2024","Isn't it interesting just how much Argyll has been promoted whereas this seems to have buzzed in from nowhere? Both of these movies sit within the spy/action genre however there is night and day when it comes to which is the superior movie.The Beekeeper is a standard action/revenge flick in which Statham plays his usual action role, except this is more John Wick than giant CGI shark. When a friend commits suicide after been scammed online he sets out to cause some damage. And he does. In spades. While it has a similar premise to the recent Equalizer movies, this one bothers less with the dialogue and seems to fly in as a result. Compared with Argyll which seems to have a teenage girl audience in mind, Beekeeper is strictly aimed at a male demographic that appreciates carnage and takes itself seriously as it does so. Fans of Reacher or Terminal List will enjoy this. The only downside is the obvious sassy black female cop character that feels like its been added to tick a box. Its crazy to think I wasted over two hours on Argyll when I had this waiting on me. The ending was also well executed and the 90 mins simply flew past. Hopefully this gets a sequel."

Bad scripting, bad camera, bad dialog, bad actors, bad everything. Even the fights were lazy bad. Even the one liners are bad.I liked ""Safe"" from Jason Statham and many other movies, this one doesn't even come close.Save yourself the trouble, watch paint dry. There's a lot more logic and entertainment in that.I'm so glad my wife stopped me from paying cinema tickets for this and instead I waited for it to appear online, then I would've really been mean on this review.I really hope he gets better scripts before he gets too old because I really like Jason Statham and his style of action."

It's your typical guilty-pleasure action romp, with a subtle (but definitely present) social justice bent to it - even better! It exposes the evil of those call centres who prey on the vulnerable and scam innocent people out of their savings.'The Beekeeper' opens with a genuinely unsettling, uncomfortable scene where we see a good-natured, elderly woman get scammed out of her entire savings, pension scheme, and even the income of a charity she was in charge of - and this results in her committing suicide. What the scammers didn't reckon on is her typically stoic, quiet beekeeper, played by Jason Statham, who doth take no ****! He bursts in and brings down the whole edifice in typical action-film style, making it look easy of course.Walked out of the cinema feeling great."
"7","John Wick with cartoon world building physics","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9568704/?ref_=tt_urv","unsure-1","17 January 2024","I liked this movie. It's fun. It tried to go for a twist (a bit predictable), and of course as many have noted, it's very close to John Wick. No it's not a secret society of assassins, it's a government program that goes above the law. But it's a rogue retired super pro who everyone is afraid of. He goes on a revenge spree, and then continues more in the name of justice. And then also because it turns out that the beehive needs a new queen or whatever.The worldbuilding rules here are worse than John Wick. John Wick's world has style and nuance. It's inspired by eclectic influences.This is inspired by GI Joe morning cartoons and someone who read a book on bees.Jason Statham plays Jason Statham. (At least he gets a bit roughed up closer to the end, so he's not completely invincible.)We're all going to watch the sequel."
"3","A silly anti-scammer revenge fantasy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9566148/?ref_=tt_urv","academic-drifter","16 January 2024","The origin of this revenge fantasy isn't hard to imagine. My guess is that the writer (whose track record in recent years consists largely of writing scripts for completely unnecessary remakes of great action films) was persuaded to give money to a Nigerian prince or invest in NFTs, and decided to get payback by making them the villains of an action piece. Only having Jason Statham beat up a bunch of crypto bros seemed like an unequal contest, so he needed to up the stakes - with extreme prejudice.Thus we get a film in which a bunch of suspiciously well-organized scammers clean a sweet old lady (played by Mrs. Huxtable herself, so you know she's pure goodness) out of her life's savings. Unbeknownst to them, she rents out her barn to a beekeeper who decides to take revenge. Only he's not just a beekeeper, but a retired ""Beekeeper"", a former member of an ultra-secret elite extralegal organization created to maintain ""balance in the system"" by any means necessary, provided those means are violent ones. What could possibly be wrong with that?And with one phone call to his former employer, ex-Beekeeper Statham (his character has some typically generic name that is utterly unmemorable) gets needed information that federal law enforcement has been unable to obtain for years. And with it he begins to work his way up the chain to the very top, brushing aside with casual indifference challenges that would stymie anyone else. Armed thugs, SWAT teams, and ex-Special Forces operative are shrugged off with just a few moves. Injuries that would immobilize or even kill lesser people are mere annoyances to him, handled with a grunt and an application of a piece of cloth to some random part of his body. T-800s would envy such durability.More concerning is the recurring condition from which Beekeeper Statham has suffered that has caused him to internalize both his title and his pastime, to the point where every conversation with him degenerates into a series of beekeeping metaphors. Evidently this is a viral illness, as others he comes into contact with or who even learn of his existence soon spout the same inane analogies. With it comes a sort of resigned acceptance that all this murder and property destruction is necessary to protect ""the hive."" At this point Mrs. Huxtable has been forgotten five crimes scenes ago save by her daughter, who happens to be an FBI agent and who manages to figure out everything with the help of a beekeeping manual. Yes, it's like that.To be fair, if you like this sort of thing it's not the worst movie in the world. The ""system"" is saved, bad guys get their just desserts, and Beekeeper Statham lives to beekeep in the sequel (if any of this constitutes a spoiler to you, welcome to action films). The greatest crime on display in it, though, isn't the scamming or the murder or the property destruction, but the utter waste of acting talent, as several award-winning thespians are asked to do little more than deliver their lines on the way to cashing their checks. The only one who really threatens to run away with the movie is Josh Hutcherson, who plays a classier version of Donald Trump Junior with a degree of panache that threatens to make the movie fun. But then David Ayer's questionable camera angles and his need to showcase Statham's evident case of facial paralysis intervene to ensure that he does not prove to be the true hero of the movie by saving it from the tedium of predictability. But hey, at least scammers will think twice about scamming lest a Beekeeper gets them, right?"

Statham plays a former assassin who goes on a revenge spree against a corrupt tech company that ruined the life of a friend. The plot is thin, the dialogue is bad, and the villains are cartoonish and forgettable, the movie is ridiculous, over-the-top and even offensive at times, but... I totally enjoyed it.The revenge on the bad actors in this film (no pun intended) is really fun and rewarding, it is like all the people you wished you could do that to got the revenge in the way the deserve. Statham is doing his usual job in inflicting pain on everybody that stands in his way, the pacing in the movie is great and there is never a dull moment. Statham is the action, everything else is a 2nd fiddle in his symphony, including the supporting actors, are all there to be props in his quest.And yes, don't try to make sense of the story while watching this, it will ruin the movie for you. This is a beer (or coke) and popcorn movie start to finish. The tech part in the movie, as well as all the government conspiracies, although based on real occurrences is completely blown out of proportion but still a lesson to be had. The bees knew what they were doing.Grab a box of popcorn and enjoy this action flick! Exact score: 68 / 100."

As usual it's a single absolute badarse against an army of disposable henchmen and sleazy elitist malefactors. I don't know how old Statham is but he's gotta be getting up there; he still has the chops to sell the fight scenes. If there's a major flaw to the movie it's a lack of dramatic tension. From the outset all the other characters say Statham's the ultimate unstoppable one-man wrecking crew who can tear through any security on the planet with ease. Then he does. But in the scheme of things this is a minor quibble. The movie's not trying to be deep or thought-provoking. Instead it does what it sets out to do very well.

How she gets work ls beyond me, other than checking a box.She brings the movie down. WAYYYYyyyyy down. And BTW, so does her FBI partner. Who is equity bad an actor.The other issue with this film is the script. It's idiotic.

In my mind he's akin to Bruce Willis in his prime.This mind numbing cruedly written film is a stain on his career.One must consider this movie is made to teenagers and the mentally infirm.The acting was wooden with cheesey one liners that went out of fashion in the 1990's.The colourful monkey type creature with the South African accent near the end typified this train wreck of a movie.It was brash, unintelligent, unbelieveable action scenes where Statham carves his way through SWAT and Speicla Forces teams like they're new recruits.If I was 13 I might be in awe of his Superman like skills. However as an adult that's mastered the ability to tie my own shoe laces I watched this nonsense from start to abrupt finish like a stunned mullet.I gave it a 5 just because of the action scenes. Then thought about it more and lowered it to a 4. Then thought about it again and lowered it to a 3.It's a downward spiral really, just like Statham's possible career path.Watch this movie with a good book."

The No. 1 bad guy needs to rely on fraudulent money from those elder people whereas his mother is the president?.... The whole story is brain damaged made.

No holds barred action from the start to the finish in this action packed, out for blood, revenge flick.Interesting characters that at times look like X men characters. This movie had a lot to like about it albeit predictable at times.I did NOT like the female FBI character, Verona. She was cringey and unbelievable. I didn't like her appearance or presence in the film. I get it meets today's expectations, casting certain genders in roles to meet quotas however I believe this movie could've done without her. There's no way she'd get through basic training let alone survive this far into the movie if it was realistic, but all that aside - she wasn't good.Very entertaining and impressive flick.Not much to think about.Just enjoy the action amongst the gunfire."

After Statham finds out, he seeks revenge, and is to be revealed as a retired agent who was part of a top secret program in the CIA known as The Beekeepers.

There are some comedic moments that are so unexpected they just slay here. Not many but where they are they're so effective and break up the tension in remarkable ways. The directing is really what sets this movie apart as the camera work is meticulous and you feel so ""right there"". The only detraction was Statham's seeming invincibility to highly trained combat trained specialists, often several against one. But this is typical for action movies so we can give that a pass. I only wish there was more time with Jeremy Irons. Hard to believe an actor of such stature would be involved in an action movie but he played his part at 110% as always.You know there are going to be sequels. Statham has a real winner here. The storyline is rather unique for action movies and is a definite keeper. You can bank on it. I just hope they go for a more realistic character because they can't get away with the invincible star and stay within the confines of reality again. Let's hope. This has so much promise.The profanity was unending and really detracted from the storyline as it was so unneeded and diluted the strength of the dialogue as it always does when writers seem to run out of words. Hopefully they'll hire a better writer in the future."

Not quite as charming as the 90's action movies I grew up with, but I was still laughing pretty much all the way through.Whether or not that's the intention, no idea; the movie seemed to want to take itself somewhat seriously. While some short segments dragged on, it didn't get to a point where I wanted to turn it off. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't admitted to an intermittent love affair with mindless and cheesy action though.John Wick was exciting, but The Beekeeper is Fun™. The bad guys are all comically unlikeable and watching bald action man maim and slaughter them was a great time.I think the only thing I would have preferred is cutting some more of the dead weight out (FBI agents in particular) and making it shorter. Probably could have shaved another 20-25 minutes off this and kept the pace up. There's no meaningful plot to continue past the first 15 minutes."

The two combined forces to develop a story that can best be described as ""every film Charles Bronson ever made with software revisions by a programmer called John Wick."" The action starts almost immediately and then just goes. If you like memes and themes with your action, then there are some scenes where the importance of being nice to older people pop up, and also also some talk of the importance of being a good person. But all that is just talk. At the end of the day (and by the end of the film), the action takes center stage. It helps if you know the filmography of both Bronson and Statham (which would help you relate to the ""be nice to old people"" meme), but you can also enjoy a cold viewing if needs be. Very little wokeness here, an added bonus. The good old days... ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

It didn't feel so much a big budget film but more a comedy sketch but being played straight. At this point I just went with with it and yeah it was fun, daft silly violent almost cartoonish fun.I suppose what I'm saying is don't take it too seriously and with the amount of monet it's taken we'll probably see another one."

This film is riddled with bad scenes to corny lines that should have been on the chopping block or on B roll. But that shows you exactly what this production was about. Smoking weed, finding a script near the bottom of the pile, getting some semi big names and praying they make money.Hell, even the cameras they used were questionable.This film was hard to watch and if you're new to the movie scene (your very first movie) this might slip and be alright.

"6","An Above Average Action Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9586442/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","26 January 2024","Over the years, Jason Statham has been a part of plenty of action films which have differentiated in quality. We have another one with The Beekeeper and I have watched it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees after someone close to him is robbed and killed, a Beekeeper goes on a revenge mission showcasing his former skills.Main Character
As mentioned above, Statham has played the lead role in an action film many times and he does a great job here, it feels like he can play this role in his sleep. It isn't the toughest role he has ever taken on but it just works and he adds some legitimacy for this role and it is fun to see him play a Beekeeper.Supporting Characters
Josh Hutcherson plays an annoying bad guy here and it took a while but I liked his performance here. He is just so arrogant and annoying that you really want to see him get taken down and this made me root for Statham even more in this film.Jeremy Irons plays the head of the company that Statham is after. He again is good in the role and is charisma is on full display here. It is probably one of the easiest pay checks that he has ever got but he is clearly enjoying the role.Emmy Raver-Lampman plays a cop and I didn't really care for her performance. She is a bit over the top and her character just makes some strange decisions and it is kind of convoluting as to why she does certain things in the film.Bobby Naderi plays her partner and he is also cheesy and really over the top. The two of them have decent chemistry but for me it doesn't really work in this film.Story
The story is pretty basic here and focuses on this guys revenge mission and in that it is pretty cool and exciting seeing Statham's character go after the people that have wronged him and the people he knows. There is also a pretty cool twist towards the end of the film that made things way more interesting. But some of the others character motivations are pretty strange and the overall explanation for Statham's training doesn't work with other things that happen in the film. Worse of all is the really abrupt ending of the film that doesn't really answer any questions and feels really out of place.Script
This is where the film really falls flat and that is the writing. This film has some real cringe worthy dialogue here, especially when it comes to the bee metaphors. But it is like the film doesn't have an ending and like the writers weren't sure what to do.Style
The film has some really great action sequences. The majority of people are just here to see Jason Statham beat up and kill people and you get that here in spades and it is easily the highlight of the film. The film also has pretty good pacing, it doesn't overstay its welcome and I thought moved pretty well.Overall
Overall, The Beekeeper is an above average action film. Statham is great and the action is fun to watch but it is exactly what you would expect. This is probably one to watch when it comes to streaming at home instead of rushing to the cinema to watch it.Rating - 6/10."
"5","By the numbers revenge porn Statham movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9594613/?ref_=tt_urv","siderite","30 January 2024","I am going to fail this film as being as close to predictable as humanly possible, and still bad. Statham is the new Chuck Norris. He beats everybody up, kills the wicked and stares down the worthy. He is always fast, but compared only to the really slow opponents he has to face. He is always smart, but only compared to the morons stacked up against him. But he's entertaining, unless the story sucks.And boy, does it suck here. Almost every idea put forth is ridiculous and then completely contradicted just a few minutes later. The editing is bad, there is no one even resembling having fun, except maybe Bobby Naderi. It's 100% by the numbers, a movie scam.The FBI characters are completely pointless. The Black female agent is there for quota purposes only, as she starts off as incompetent, rude and cocky and she continues to run things on the basis of her arrogance alone, thus invalidating the entire premise of the film! Or maybe justifying it, I don't know. Jeremy Irons looks the same for decades, I don't know how he does it, but in this film even his character is reluctantly doing his job, reduced from a powerful man to an acting puppet in bad situations. Minnie Driver is in this. She answers phones. That's all she does for like three scenes.Bottom line: Hollywood should have Beekeepers. The only interesting aspect of this movie is that its production seems to parallel almost exactly the plot of the film. Everything but the righteous ending."

Statham plays Clay Varley, a quiet beekeeper with a deadly past. When his friend and mentor is cheated out of their life savings by a crooked businessman, Clay dons his metaphorical (and sometimes literal) beekeeper suit and sets out to exact justice.A Hive of ActionThe film wastes no time in getting to the action. Statham delivers his usual brand of bone-crunching brawls and balletic gun-fu, but The Beekeeper elevates the genre with its creative fight choreography. Director David Ayer, known for his gritty war films like Fury and End of Watch, brings a brutal elegance to the action, making each punch and kick feel impactful and visceral.More Than Just StingsBut The Beekeeper is more than just a body-count extravaganza.Despite its minor shortcomings, The Beekeeper is a thoroughly entertaining and action-packed ride. Statham delivers a typically charismatic performance, the story is surprisingly sweet, and the action sequences are both brutal and balletic. If you're a fan of Statham's work or simply enjoy a good revenge thriller, The Beekeeper is definitely worth checking out. Just don't expect Shakespeare.Overall Rating: 7/10."
"","Great movie without Emmy Raver-Lampman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9605697/?ref_=tt_urv","bankotolu","5 February 2024","The movie is dope. Worse role ever by @Emmy Raver-Lampman, she should stick to romance and comedy. She doesnt deserve a role in bee keeper... the writer would have used a different character for that role she played or cut it out, because she bored me and the audience I had the pleasure to watch the movie with. Jayson stratham on the other hand killed his role as usual. Great acting and professionalism I hope to see more of his work unlike Emmy lampman that bored the hell out of me. Such movie shows how currupt politicians can be especially those that moved from law enforcement to politics. One can relate."
"6","The Cinematography, Editing, Action & Acting are Buzz Worthy, The Script is Laughable","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9586006/?ref_=tt_urv","CANpatbuck3664","26 January 2024","The reviews I've seen for The Beekeeper laud it for being ""straightforward fun"" and ""an enjoyable throwback."" The underlying message is that The Beekeeper is enjoyable if you can appreciate it for the genre thrills. Now that I've seen it, you're going to get what you want from the action. Bones are broken, bullets go flying and the bad guys are punished for their misdeeds in a satisfying and well utilized manner. I actually think the team behind the camera deserves a lot of credit for this. David Ayer gets a bad rap for a couple of lacklustre movies sprinkled in with a few great ones (including one that's in the pantheon of my all time favourites, EoW) but his direction here is at least a level above from what you typically get in this style of movie. The Beekeeper boasts Ayer's famous gritty feel and this also accents the fight scenes. But I also think the movie looks really good between the cinematography and being cut together really well so I want to credit Director of Photography Gabriel Beristain and Editor Geoffrey O'Brien for helping The Beekeeper punch above it's weight class.I've already admitted to being a big fan of David Ayer but I'm also a longtime defender of Jason Statham. He's one of the few leading men with the chops and screen presence to lead an action movie in our modern cinematic environment (without putting on a superhero costume). He's a decent actor but more importantly, he's also secretly hilarious when given the opportunity (if you get a chance, check out his turn as Rick Ford in Spy, he's phenomenal in that movie). I was excited that he was getting another potential franchise to lead but while he's certainly bringing his physicality to Adam Clay, there's a complete absence of his charm. He mostly grunts his way through the proceedings and his character felt like a rehash and the type of role he was parodying with his appearance in Spy. There's some really talented names in the supporting cast as well and I thought many of them shone through some so-so material. Jeremy Irons brings his gravitas to the character of Wallace Westwyld. He's relatively grounded compared to some big performances from his cast mates and I enjoyed his measured take. I've always really liked Emmy Raver-Lampan in the Umbrella Academy and I think she's the overall standout in The Beekeeper. She's very serious in her early appearances (to the desired effect) but I liked her even better when she's cracking wise and trading buddy-cop barbs with her on-screen partner played by Bobby Naderi. She's definitely got one of the more fleshed out characters but she's got range and hopefully her work here will lead to more roles in movies. To my pleasant surprise, my other favourite performance was Josh Hutcherson as the unbelievably slimy Derek Danforth. This might not seem like a compliment as he's playing such a detestable character but I thought he was appropriately smarmy and unlikeable without chewing on the scenery (e.g. The admittedly fun but hammy job done by David Witts). I wouldn't have imagined Josh playing a villain but he exceeded my expectations in this role and he deserves kudos.I've mentioned the acting, the film making and the action but I have to get to the elephant in the room now. The script for The Beekeeper was shockingly inept and I kept wondering how it was greenlit in this condition? Travesty is a little dramatic but Holy Underwritten Plot & Characters Batman! Admittedly, some movies walk a fine line in tonality but not everything has to be deadly serious. There's also such things as enjoyably cheesy or deliberately hammy. I had some trouble deciding if that's what The Beekeeper is aiming for. The action scenes are unflinchingly savage and the film has a mostly-serious rhythm (the all-too-real scams, the political intrigue and government bureaucracy don't seem satirical) but then there's the tongue in cheek joking, the one-liners, the knockoff Wolf of Wall Street bravado from the villains, the constant talking about literal and metaphorical bees and over-the-top elements (a rival beekeeper whipping out a mini-gun at a crowded gas station kind of decision) that suggest it's a secret/surprise comedy. Are the filmmakers being deliberately silly? Are they in on the joke? Is The Beekeeper laughing with the audience or just missing the mark with unintentional comedic results? I couldn't really get a firm grasp on the desired tempo here but the conclusion I arrived at was that the film was serious and that the story and the script missed it's mark. The Beekeeper reminded me a little of the movie Skyscraper when it would careen into silliness. There's no doubt that parts of this movie were designed to be funny but I wasn't just laughing at those deliberate choices and I don't think that was what the creative team had in mind.I really tried to meet The Beekeeper on every level. My combined love of both David Ayer's and Jason Statham's work, an appreciation of straight-to-the-point action the movie boasts and a cast that showed up to work (extra credit to Emmy Raver-Lampman and Josh Hutcherson). I kept hoping for a gradual turnaround, a twist that would shift the narrative from bouncing between solid action to some disappointingly goofy dialogue and storytelling, or an ending that would ratchet up the proceedings. But it wasn't in the cards and while I don't disagree that The Beekeeper is a serviceable vehicle for some satisfying Statham punching & kicking but this movie could have been a lot better. I saw this with a friend in an empty theatre and we were laughing, rolling our eyes and cracking jokes throughout. I would actually like to give this team another crack at it if everyone was able to return (except Kurt Wimmer, he can just stay home). There's a lot of talent assembled here, I just think they hit a ground rule double instead of a home run. Check The Beekeeper out if you're a fan of Jason Statham or if you can tune out your inner critic and just enjoy the action."
"1","A Favorite of Ten Year Olds","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9597667/?ref_=tt_urv","leftbanker-1","1 February 2024","Some call this a John Wick rip-off, but it isn't any stupider or make any less sense than that absurd franchise of mindless killing. I just kept hearing the Itchy and Scratchy theme song throughout this kill-fest: they fight and bite, they fight and bite and fight. Fight, fight, fight, bite, bite, bite, The Beekeeper. And were all the people in this unit also bee helpers? What if one of them wanted to have an ant farm? Would that be OK?Seriously, how old should you be before you grow out of these ridiculous combat movies where one man takes on an army? 12? 13 tops. If there is no possibility of a bullet or even a fist striking the hero, then all of the action is devoid of tension. If there is no tension, just fast-forward to the end credits and save yourself a lot of time. The Equalizer, John Wick, and the films of Jason Statham are not entertainment fit for adults.There were some horrific performances and huge casting gaffs in this. Jeremy Irons simply cannot do an American accent. Period. He sounded like he had a speech impediment. The FBI woman was morbidly obese, yet wore a Harvard Track & Field t-shirt. Was that supposed to be ironic?The movie shows why no one should have a gun in their home. More folks die from their own hands than intruders."

You know, the one that is untouchable, a real mean badass with a soft heart for justice, the guy that will take out a whole army by himself, preferably without weapons as that would be way too easy for him otherwise. You have to be able to get over that otherwise you will never like a movie with Jason Statham. I found The Beekeeper one of his better ones. A good revenge story, with of course an overload of action scenes. The cinematography was of good quality, nicely choreographed fighting scenes, and good actors. Of course I wished it would look a bit more realistic, like almost everyone of us, but it is what it is, a Jason Statham movie. If one day he could take out villains in a normal way I think that movie could score higher. I would have scored The Beekeeper higher if it wasn't Jason against fifty highly trained killers, preferably all at once of course."

"6","Statham fulfilling ""Statham duties"" well enough! [+60%]","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9595001/?ref_=tt_urv","arungeorge13","30 January 2024","The Beekeeper really is one of those Statham action vehicles where you can laugh at the atrocity of the plot (and its developments) and just tag along for the undemanding ride. Yes, it does feel like a John Wick ripoff staged a bit differently, though director David Ayer knows how to play to Statham's strengths. He's once again a one-man-wrecking-machine, and Ayer exploits that by effectively stylizing the action blocks. Whenever Statham's off-screen, the screenplay (by Kurt Wimmer) carries a made-for-TV feel to it, with random and uninteresting banter between FBI officers. There are bee metaphors galore, and for what it's worth, the entirety of the last act is driven by one of them.Ayer reunites with his Street Kings colleague in DP Gabriel Beristain, who brings in a sense of slickness to the wider, more elaborate shots while also neatly balancing it out in the closer hand-to-hand combat sequences. I think Ayer realised early on that the script didn't offer anything new to engage the audiences, so he decided to keep things as delightfully campy as possible. As a result, we also gets a few moments of dark humour amidst the strictly R-rated action. Josh Hutcherson seems to have had a great time playing the antagonist (a swindling, fintech nepokid), and while he's never a physical match for Statham, the chase remains wholly watchable. For a January release, I guess this did alright."
"","Almost artful. Statham's best.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9561701/?ref_=tt_urv","JohnDeSando","14 January 2024","""If a beekeeper says you're gonna die, you're gonna die."" Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons)When patrician bad boy, Oscar-winning Irons intones this threat/reality, you can figure The Beekeeper, Jason Statham's newest blood fest, may be a cut above his usual tongue-in-cheek tomfoolery. It is, lusty as his revenge motif is and metaphoric as the title wants to be.Retired federal operative, read ""assassin,"" called a ""Beekeeper,"" Adam Clay (Statham),--hear the metaphor start ringing-- witnesses the exploitation of an elderly friend, Eloise (Phylicia Rashad), by ruthless internet scammers, ending in her suicide. Director David Ayer and writer Kurt Wimmer not quite subtly weave the analogy of Clay ridding the hive (read society) of bad bees, even ones at the very top of the hive's government.I know, The beekeeper is just another example of revenge porn, but they have crafted an early try at literacy while keeping us fed on the nectar of ramming order into a chaotic political world such as our current presidential race fosters. While the script may offer too many ham-handed allusions to the figurative underpinnings, I found myself pleased by the attempt and remembering how the Bard eloquently incorporated the motif into one of his bloodiest and most romantic battle plays when he speaks of""the honeybees, / Creatures that by a rule in nature teach / The act of order to a peopled kingdom."" The Archbishop of Canterbury in Shakespeare's Henry V.Statham, 56 and feisty as ever, is as stone faced as ever, but the surprisingly effective setup with the death of his friend at the beginning casts a serious and almost literate overlay to otherwise transparently fabulous death actions that would otherwise be plain silly. Avenging the scammed elderly seems noble given how many of us have seen the sudden blinking warning that our system has been compromised and don't do anything but ""Call this number!"" If you're old and electronic averse, you're ready to be scammed.Stepping outside the usually-absurd carnage, The Beekeeper touches on such important societal blights as corrupt political campaign funding and malicious interference of family members with otherwise benign politicians. Although bad boys are as bad, if not worse, than any you have seen in these oft-cliched thrillers, this film tries to be more original, topical, and literate with both the good and the bad.Not bad for a Statham cliche."

But his vengeance isn't a one-and-done event. He keeps attacking up the organizational ladder and the interesting twist in this is who's at the top of that ladder. Yes, he's a one-man army which gets kinda stupid as time goes on, but it's not terribly implausible. Josh Hutcherson co-stars against type as a douchey bad guy. Though he achieves his objective in the end, the actual ending is kind of inconclusive so that was a bit irritating which cost it another star for my review."

However, akin to the recurrent pattern observed in Statham's previous films, this one, albeit marginally superior, failed to meet expectations.Initially, the director presents a character engaged in beekeeping, yet the portrayal lacks authenticity by sparing only a meager 100 bees and possessing a minimal number of hives, if not fewer than a dozen.The film's execution is notably deficient across numerous scenes, prompting a sense of incredulity and frustration. Numerous lapses in coherence and logic pervade the narrative, leaving the viewer bewildered and questioning the purpose of the cinematic endeavor.The prevalence of clumsy mistakes becomes evident within the initial minutes, rendering the movie entirely nonsensical in its unfolding. Emmy Raver-Lampman's casting in a particular role remains questionable, lacking a discernible rationale.In summation, refraining from viewing this production does not entail a significant loss, as it fails to deliver any substantial content of note."

The storyline, centered around a scam call center and its connection to the president, adds a layer of intrigue and political tension. Statham's performance is stellar, embodying the role of a vengeful protagonist with unmatched intensity. The action sequences are jaw-dropping, showcasing Statham's martial arts prowess and the film's high-octane choreography. The cinematography skillfully captures the gritty atmosphere, enhancing the overall viewing experience. The narrative unfolds with unexpected twists and turns, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. The supporting cast contributes solid performances, adding depth to the characters and amplifying the film's impact. The film successfully blends elements of revenge, political drama, and intense action, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre. While the plot may stretch believability at times, the sheer entertainment value and Statham's charismatic presence make ""Bee Keeper"" a thrilling cinematic experience that packs a punch from start to finish."
"6","Unintentionally hilarious","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9610589/?ref_=tt_urv","alex-mott","8 February 2024","The second level of meaning and historical references to bees are intriguing, but don't be fooled. This is another Jason Statham film where the protagonist gets angry and decides to kill everyone responsible - and nothing can stop him! Not hired thugs, not teams of private security guards, not even the FBI! I laughed so many times. Agent Verona Parker didn't shed a tear after learning that her mother died a few minutes ago, the FBI couldn't find the baddies in months but a local cop friend of Clay's located them in 5 mins, stoichiometric ratios don't exist (as usual) and the only thing that survived another huge fireball explosion was a book about beekeeping. Jason Statham looks great for his age, Jeremy Irons' hair parting actually changes sides and it's only 1hr45mins. Sit back, chuckle and wait for the inevitable Beekeeper 2."
"2","Embarassing, not even worth pirating","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9631705/?ref_=tt_urv","wirednights","19 February 2024","With such a unique and eye-catching name as the Beekeeper, I was excited for this. I thought he'd use the bees to assassinate people, which would've been cooler than the actual movie premise. Then I started asking myself why I'm not watching John Wick instead. Staham in a raspy voice: ""Sometimes when there's dysfunction in the hive, you have to take out the queen"" lol ok. Is this the product of the writers strike? It would've been more believable if the call center was in India, not Massachusetts. But realism would upset someone. Beekeepers are a rip-off of Treadstone from the Jason Bourne series. The CGI office building explosion left me depressed. My conflusion: If you want real explosions, watch a real movie.They send a female beekeeper to take out Statham.. you probably forgot about her because she's dead in 30 seconds. Very anticlimactic and utterly pointless waste of runtime. The cringey Scottish guy at the end looks like a bad guy from Streets of Rage on Sega Genesis. Who writes this garbage? I can't believe Miramax put their name on this. This was worse than Thanksgiving 2023. I can enjoy brainless action movies, but this just did not work. Agent Verona Parker's character is so eye-rolling and unlikeable. She just sucked and was not believable as an FBI agent. Statham looks tired, he's less of a character in this movie and more of a plot device. Statham needs to retire, I'm not taking the bait again. He was good in Transporter 1 and The Mechanic, and that's all."
"7","What you would expect but more brutal","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9567469/?ref_=tt_urv","hifiman-62270","16 January 2024","Actually no idea why the story is being regarded as poor. It's relevant in today's age of rampant online fraud. And the fact that people who exist who shall we say have ""ghosts"" past is hardly the thing of imagination. So actually its quite a simple revenge flick based around reality..however of course it's a Statham flick so he has to be phenomenal and virtually unkillabe. But it's all done in a very well staged way. Exciting . Brutal. Simple and brief and efficient. I'd say it's a less styalised grittier John wick style movie and expect a sequel to be greenlit very very soon. Don't expect anything else and just enjoy be the ride."
"4","The Beekeeper caters to action junkies. This has some John Wick, Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme vibes","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9631014/?ref_=tt_urv","kevin_robbins","19 February 2024","My wife and I recently caught The Beekeeper (2024) in theaters. The plot follows a retired special agent who tends to a bee colony and shares moments with his aging yet appreciative neighbor. However, when his neighbor falls victim to a scam, he unleashes hell in retaliation.Directed by David Ayer (Suicide Squad), the film features Jason Statham (Crank), Emmy Raver-Lampman (The Umbrella Academy), Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games), Jeremy Irons (Dead Ringers), and Phylicia Rashad (The Cosby Show).This movie is a chaotic mess. The acting and dialogue are horrendous and had a made-for-television vibe. It's a ""shut your brain off"" experience with over-the-top action scenes, some intentionally hilarious, and others so bad that they become amusing. The action choreography blends fights, knives, and gore brilliantly. The shootouts are fun. The bridge scene was excellent, ""unlucky"" conversation hilarious, the gas station sequence was wild and the brass knuckles fight cracked me up. There was some entertaining scene. Even Jeremy Irons seems awkward and out of place.In conclusion, The Beekeeper caters to action junkies. This has some John Wick, Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme vibes. I would score this a 4/10 and recommend seeing it once."
"7","Buzzing with brutality and a bit of stinging social commentary","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9564400/?ref_=tt_urv","steveinadelaide","15 January 2024","The Beekeeper is not another typical sugary action film. It is a brutal revenge story characterised by biting social commentary and violent fights. The lead role of Adam Clay, a former operative in the secret dark government organisation called Beekeepers, is played by Jason Statham, who wears the beekeeper's hat. Adam has been left without his only friend, who was scammed online. He decides to sting the corrupt corporation that stole away his dear friend, leaving behind maimed bodies and broken secrets.David Ayer, director of macho war movies, has brought the same level of intensity to The Beekeeper. Fights between combatants are raw, with Statham as usual in his signature balletic violence. He acts like a beekeeper, protecting the hive, dealing with thugs, and methodically beating them down one by one; all of these blows hurt the system he opposes.The Beekeeper is not all fists and fights (well, not quite). Surprisingly, it weaves a complex web of themes. This means that its objective is to focus on unmasking the evils of corporate greed and their effects on people. However, Adam's fascination with bees shows how society interacts with everyone, for even little things can cause massive changes.Emmy Raver-Lampman as Adam's friend's estranged daughter and an FBI agent, and Jeremy Irons playing a chillingly charismatic CEO, give impressive performances among others who make up this cast. Raver-Lampman brings some much-needed emotional depth, while Irons drips wickedness out of every word spoken through his unique style.However, at times, this film fails to live up to its own ambitions. The story line, despite being captivating, tends to be somewhat predictable at times, while the pacing occasionally becomes clumsy, going from one action sequence to another without providing much scope for thematic exploration. Moreover, dialogue sometimes becomes clichéd, especially when too many bee-related puns come into play.However, The Beekeeper has enough energy to keep your attention. This is a movie that is not scared of getting its hands dirty in either the literal or metaphorical sense. It's a brutal bee sting of a film that makes you itch to fight for what is right, even when stung in the process.So, should you watch The Beekeeper? If you are just looking for senseless action, this one may not be for you. If you fancy violent movies that have an absurd plot yet still employ social commentary, then perhaps it may be worth your time to go and see it. Just remember, it's a Jason Statham action movie. If you've seen one before, you'll know what to expect!"
"7","The Grim Reaper","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9621254/?ref_=tt_urv","cahidi","14 February 2024","Jason Statham, his name alone guarantees a minimum of 5 star rating on an action movie. So with that in mind, this movie is obviously a must see for all action movie junkie. Every action movies which he starred in always keeps the audiences nailed to their seats. Regardless of their plots, the action sequences alone have that kind of effect. So I don't need to review on the action part anymore. Plot wise, there's nothing new with this movie. It's all straight forward. Meet the hero, meet the bad guy, the bad guy wronged the hero, the hero punish the bad guy. Boom. Simple and effective. Leave very little to the imagination. A little suggestion to enjoy action movies : stop thinking too hard. This is not a science project. Try to enjoy life, not experiment on it."
"6","Ridiculous, silly, and entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9563582/?ref_=tt_urv","darkreignn","14 January 2024","I am not a fan of David Ayer, but I am a fan of Jason Statham, and so - also being inspired by the positive reviews - I decided to drag my dad to the theatre with me to watch this movie. And on one hand, I enjoyed it as a Statham action vehicle; on the other hand, this film is chock-full of virtually every single David Ayer cliche that you can imagine.Is there near-constant cussing in this movie because of script writing that would make middle school students blush? Yes, there is. Are there a large number of ridiculous looking and absurdly dressed characters that you cannot envision being in anything other than an Ayer picture? Oh, you better believe it. And is there over-the-top violence that has absolutely no business being portrayed as anything that would remotely even take place in the realm of reality? Of course! It's all standard Ayer fare, and while I am not too much of a proponent of that, I found ""The Beekeeper"" to be as entertaining as it was thanks, in part, to those creative decisions.As much as I would've appreciated a more straightforward, grounded take on the action genre, I'd be lying if I said that the ludicrousness of it all wasn't entertaining, because it was. From the constant bee puns and the hilariously energetic villains that would give Jordan Belfort a run for his money to Statham's stoic and almost inhuman performance and all of the horror villain-esque violence that he delivers upon his enemies, ""The Beekeeper"" is straight-laced farce. This is a movie that's dumb, and knows that it's dumb, but plays itself as serious as humanly possible. Because of that, you'll find yourself laughing with the movie while also finding a great deal to enjoy from the action sequences.""The Beekeeper"" features Statham at his most brutal, perhaps ever, employing a range of tactics that dispatch the film's villains in increasingly violent manners. Statham is a force to be reckoned with here, more akin to The Punisher than John Wick, and it really works. It's all very silly, but the brutality is fitting, especially since the villains are so despicable. You really want to see the villains get what's coming to them, and you get that through a series of action sequences that are each more elaborate than the next. I cannot emphasize enough how stupid the movie is, but I also can't emphasize enough how fun it is to watch on the silver screen.I am still not a fan of David Ayer after watching this movie, but I am impressed about how entertaining ""The Beekeeper"" managed to be. As I said, I would've preferred a more gritty, serious action movie than this was, but for what it was, this was fun, and I will definitely be adding this to my physical media collection."

His agent suggests him to take a job, a film in his genre, and get well paid.But, honestly. This movie I hope it paid so well he can take a free job for a movie with a real script and real actors. I really understand that Jeremy Irons signed up. At his age in the business, film offers don't grow on trees. This was a low-water mark with lousy acting. A movie, if you like Jason, that can be on in the background while you're doing something else. The cocain sniffing son who is the boss and the brain behind all scams goes to history in bad avrings. How could anyone let this guy in to the film industri?"

At no point did I think the action was little or not interesting enough or that the plot was not good. Am going to have a hard time appreciating other action movies this year because of this movie. Jason Statham is amazing, and I liked how everyone responded when they knew a beekeeper was involved. This movie is one of a kind and if you are an action movie fan and don't like this, well you might not be an action movie fan honestly. The cast were wonderful and fit the movie, the movie was epic."
"6","lesser John Wick","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9599712/?ref_=tt_urv","SnoopyStyle","2 February 2024","Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is the beekeeper. Secretly, he's a retired super-assassin from an unrestricted government program. His friend Eloise Parker gets taken by a call center scam team and commits suicide. He decides to track down and take out the entire organization. He is pursued by Eloise's daughter FBI Agent Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman). The scam organization is led by Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson) and protected by former CIA director Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons).This is like a less serious Death Wish or lesser John Wick. Statham is doing Statham. It would be better to have Verona join Adam Clay in a buddy action thriller. I get the idea of uncovering the program and choosing the morality of the situation. She feels underused when her character starts so strongly. This is slight fun. It had the potential to start another action thriller franchise, but that's unlikely now."

There's some pretty awful acting going on but the script is the real criminal here. How they got the likes of Jeremy Irons, Phylicia Rashad, Minnie Driver and Statham himself to appear in this movie is beyond belief. I also find it hard to believe that the writer of this drivel, Kurt Wimmer, is the same guy who wrote the action thriller 'Salt' starring Angelina Jolie, which is a seriously underrated film. I don't wish to put spoilers into this review or give away any of the plot, so I won't, but just to give you an idea of how poor this film is, all the Secret Service agents are running around wearing armoured vests with SECRET SERVICE written on the back in huge letters. How secret would the service be if they all wore vests proclaiming who they were in giant letters? This is just the tip of a huge iceberg of goofs and plotholes, highlighting how bad this film really is."

I'm a Beekeeper. I protect the Hive, Everyone, I need your attention. Im going to burn this place down, I need to take care of the Hive, we have laws for these things. -Until they fail and then you have me.Its was full on action, refreshing to see a movie that played out with our constraints.

"6","actually a dark comedy , or seriously inept scriptwriter ?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9596597/?ref_=tt_urv","rossmcdee1","31 January 2024","Firstly - this is quite enjoyable - an almost typical , cliched action film with brutal fighting and predictable story... except for a couple of things worth mentioning.The story is so utterly preposterous & contrived it comes across as a po-faced comedy. The main female protagonist (FBI Macy Gray look-a-like) is so terrible she can't help but incite laughter or mirth at her actions.She also pulls some hilarious pouts during the film, while her motivations appear increasingly deranged- why is she making so much effort to tackle the man who got revenge for her & her mother - why does she do nothing about the parasites who stole from her mother when Stratham's character has opened all the doors for her to do so? It is farcical- yet still entertaining if the viewer is in the right frame of mind-If you take this sort of comic book fare seriously you will find it unbearable- such as when Stratham is at the 'party' & shows himself- why did he do all of what follows ,when he could have archived his goal far more simply & effectively just by shaving his beard off or wearing a wig & dark glasses - because the writers thought the scenario would be 'cool'.THIS FILM IS A BLACK COMEDY , intentionally or otherwise.There are so many more silly instances that could be mentioned but they will probably be more entertaining experiencing them watching the film, instead of me just listing them here.I noticed some reviews mentioning that this film explores serious issues of conspiracy- it doesn't - it ignores the vast network of family interests, bonds & consolidations that allow any 'individual' to become a prominent public figure, or even successful business enterprise.... It is a COMIC BOOK ACTION FILM and doesn't pretend to be anything more. As such it is quite entertaining.Usually I would mention all sort of technical matters, but there is no need to with this- it's decent, everyone does their job adequately.The fight scenes are brutal and reasonably well staged, but rather ridiculous as well, none of Strathams adversaries can aim a gun,and he has no serious challenges for most of the film. Despite that fact, if you can enjoy the utter unbelievability of the story the action can be even more entertaining than a more 'realistic' portrayal of such encounters.6.5 out of 10 - for the shear preposterousness of the story & entertainingly awful acting of FBI Girl."
"4","Where do you find these people?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9598705/?ref_=tt_urv","mertafor","1 February 2024","There are ""feel good"" movies. You just watch them to put a smile on your face, they make you feel happy. And then, there are movies just make you feel bad. You feel bad because your intelligence rejects such an inferior product. This is a recent trend actually. I seriously don't know how they pick these actors and writers but they deliver the worst material thanks to horrible writing and cringy people. By the way, I'm an action fan and ""mindless action"" is great most of the time as long as it's done right. This is just a John Wick wannabe B movie diguised as an A class thanks to its budget (probably above the average).There is not much to say about Statham, he's doing some of his usual stuff again except he can't bend, jump or do his moves on the floor due to his age. As for the rest of the crew, that FBI lady is in the center of ""feel bad"". I mean useless nosey female law person is a cliche older than me already but her appearance, attitude and style couldn't be cringier than this, zero credibility. At least try to find some actor looks like a government agent for god sake. Her only contribution to the story is to help bringing more people to get wasted by Statham. As for Jeremy Irons, clearly he needed money, maybe that's understable at some extent. I won't even go into other cartoonish villains. Very bad copies of John Wick universe characters.Long story short just stay away from this one. This is not John Wick, Nobody or even Extraction."

KInd of a weak plot that has the usual corruption in the government with the action of Equalizer and John Wick, but the plot has a touch of Bourne Identity. The corrupt gov't goes to the highest level that has the Beekeeper dealing with a coked up son with a dirty business and the parent tries to neutralize him. Gee, have we all heard this somewhere before? The best line of the whole movie is delivered by Statham when he ask some of the law enforcement branches, and I am para phrasing, You have to make a choice, do believe in the law or do you believe in justice. A good movie overall."

The choreographed action scenes are so absurd they're almost comical. I'm Wondering why we just don't send Statham to Ukraine. He'd finish the war in a day. The acting is hammy and amateurish.The basic idea of seeking vengeance against scammers could have been good but this is like a poor mans Equalizer movie.

That said: suspension of disbelief is quite important with this one.I do believe that John Wick is the better movie (franchise), but it's not like there can only be one. There is also a sense that the movie has a bigger universe ... if this is successful I do believe that we can and will see a lot more of Statham and others. Just saying - be aware what this is and what you want to watch. It is nice to see something from David Ayer ... he serves us something quite violent! Though it is not like there are complex choreography ... there is viciousness there for sure though!! The first action highlight of the year is here ... enjoy."

Every single movie he touches is the same and you'll be making the same mistake that I did if you hope for something else. Heavens. This movie is awful but it descends into another whole new level of hell when Adam Basil's character comes on. A brutally bad South African accent is actually only the 3rd worst part of this character but its actually exceeded by his painful over-acting and overall implausibility, and the fact that he is dressed like a banana but is allowed to be at a tea party held on the president's estate? All I can say in the man's defence is that he is not alone in the terrible acting that has added no value to the lives of anyone who has seen this movie. My only hope is that the last of the ammunition was saved for the screenwriters and production team.Please run as fast as you can away from this.

Don't get me wrong, it's definitely not a ten. The acting was frequently substandard (aside from Statham - and also Irons, who did his best with some really terrible dialogue), and there were some significant plot issues. However, in an age of aggressive scammers targeting the vulnerable, this film was vicerally cathartic.If the goal was to pick a villain that no-one would feel sorry for as they die horribly, they hit a bulls eye. I personally know an elderly individual who has been scammed out of a significant amount, so I was all in to sit back, munching popcorn, as they got everything they deserved. And I fully admit that the choice of villain probably led me to rate it higher than might have otherwise.Is it a brilliant cinematic achievement? No. But it was fun to watch once. If I get nothing else out of it, next time a scammer calls me, I get to close my eyes and go to a happy place where Statham beats them silly and blows up their call centre."

By the end I was hoping one of the bad guys would just shoot Statham's character instead of standing there pointing their gun at him and waiting for him to knock them cold.The only way that a film like this could maintain interest is if the fight scenes showed some variety as the story goes along. This action director didn't seem to know what he was doing, and the endless, repetitive martial arts sequences seemed to be just filling time."

Stellar fight choreography, brutal kills, and Josh Hutcherson as an extremely hateable villain.

For those who take pride in their ability to keep track of body counts in movies, I can only say, best of luck with this one. Boom. Bang. Punch. Kick. Stab. Choke. Flip. Our hero, acting alone, uses every available attack to neutralize armies, SWAT teams, trained security teams, and greedy scumbags ... all in the name of ""protecting the hive"". OK, it's mostly for revenge for causing the death of ""the only person who took care of me.""
Director David Ayer (END OF WATCH 2012, SUICIDE SQUAD 2016) and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (SALT, 2010) are very much at home in the action-violence genre, and adding the king of cinematic hand-to-hand combat, Jason Statham, to the mix can only mean more action and more fighting and more violence. There is no reason to critique a movie that delivers exactly what it sets out to deliver to an audience that expects exactly that.Statham is in prime form as Adam Clay, a beekeeper on a farm owned by retired teacher Elise Parker (Phylicia Rashad, CREED). When a phishing scam drains her bank accounts, including that of the non-profit she administers, Clay reacts to the subsequent tragedy by tracking down the culprits of the scheme. Tech fraudsters are easy targets because we all despise them, and the film plays that up by exaggerating the obnoxious nature of those involved. A miscast Josh Hutcherson (THE HUNGER GAMES) plays Derek Danforth, an entitled little bleep who skateboards in the office to his next massage and wears outlandish outfits befitting a person desperate for attention. Adding to the psychological drama is FBI Agent Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman, ""The Umbrella Academy""), the daughter of Elise, the woman who put Clay on his mission of reckoning.Additional supporting roles include Bobby Naderi as Verona's FBI partner, Jemma Redgrave as the President, a brief appearance by Minnie Driver as the FBI director (she takes three quick phone calls), and Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Wallace Westwyld, the retired agent charged with keeping Derek safe. The hook here is that beekeeper Clay is actually a retired secret agent known as ""the Beekeeper"", and in one of the oddest sequences, his replacement (a wild character inspired by Prince?) brings a Gatling gun to try and end Clay once and for all. The film is silly and absurd, and right up the alley of those who embrace Statham's stoic bulldozer of a man."

It was where our beloved dogs were buried and where we spent some of the fondest memories.For some, this movie might be over the top and unbelievable but I thank Mr Statham for doing this movie.

Jason Statham should not be one of those, but you have to wonder why he made this movie.Basically, its absolute rubbish. Lets ignore that its an Australian movie, but considering some of the cast, the money on offer must have been good and included a free holiday on the Gold Coast.Storyline is about as original as a loaf of bread, the script lines were obviously limited to a small number of letters because it lacked a quality barely above a kids show, and the guys Statham had to fight were nothing more than statues awaiting to be hit.If you're a Statham worshipper, bored or low in IQ, its watchable, but be aware, you were warned."

Some of the action is quite good, i actually would have liked a little more. The stealth kill scenes were very good.CGI and effects all very good, music is decent and acting is decent too, a funny role for Josh Hudgetson to be in, good in it mind you.Standard action film, 6/10."

The film was well put together and the fight scenes were very impressive. You can see that they put a lot off effort into these scenes. I think Jason Statham was the perfect choice for this exciting role. I can't imagine someone else playing this role. So good casting! The story was unique and had a lot of potential. Still, I don't think they got everything out of it. There were many nice details that you immediately notice as a film lover. I give this movie a 7.5. Good film, a lot of potential but could have been achieved more."
"6","Queen of the Damned","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9582819/?ref_=tt_urv","southdavid","24 January 2024","I'm not the world biggest fan of this sort of midbudget action film, the ones that seem to end up on the streaming services rather than the big screen these days and whilst ""The Beekeeper"" isn't great it's unintentionally hilarious dialogue, and some decent turns in the support cast elevate it slightly above those.When his landlady Eloise (Phylicia Rashad) takes her own life, after her life savings are stolen from her by a cybercrime syndicate, Adam Clay (Jason Statham) sets out to avenge her. Clay though is not just an ordinary vigilante, he was once a Beekeeper, a member of a special government project, highly trained and given autonomy to make his own decisions about how to progress a situation. As Clay kills his way up the foodchain, chased by Eloise's FBI agent daughter Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman), Clay comes to learn that the syndicate have ties to government agencies, that have the resources to mount a defence against his onslaught.So, all of the good work in this is done by supporting characters, particularly Raver-Lampman, so good in ""The Umbrella Academy"", and her partner in this, played by Bobby Naderi. Their scenes together elevate the film somewhat. Josh Hutchison is having a good time too, as a higher up douchebag who believes, and with some reason, that he's untouchable. One of the problems though is that Statham's character is pretty lifeless. He's proved in other films he's capable of being charismatic but here he just waffles on about Bees every chance he gets, which becomes hilarious the further you get into the film and the more frequently it happens. You can only mumble ""Protect the Hive"" so many times, before it ceases to lose all meaning.The action is fine, if perhaps lacking something truly interesting or memorable. The CGI work isn't as good as the practical stunts, and the fighting remains a touch below something like a ""John Wick"". If briefly threatens to accept its dumb nature, during a fight with another Beekeeper and become more fun, but doesn't commit to it for long.There's probably a desire to franchise the character, like has happened with other Statham films, but I really don't think there's much more meat on what was already a modest bone."

Jason Stathan is ok, fight scenes are decent, but doesn't help the movie. Loved the Transporter and Mechanic movies, was hopeful this would be on par but it fails in so many ways. There are some surprise actors in this other than Stathan like Jeremy Irons and Felicia Rashad. But others are just terrible actors and even come off as cartoony at times. Plus, like every other mainstream movie, they force diversity and it's too much. Female Beekeeper and main antagonist in the end are like something out of a Disney movie, or a bad movie from the 80's. Don't waste your $$ or time."

I was so disappointed in recent ""blockbuster"" releases that I had little to no expectations regarding The Beekeeper, glad I was wrong.From the moment Jason Statham dropped the two large gas cans on the ground, a whole hell broke loose. Just like it's 1994 again and you are hanging with your buddies watching Schwarzenegger's latest flick in the local cinema.Is the story bad? Yes, some questionable acting (Jason excluded), some dumb FBI decisions etc, but boy does the action part make up for it."

Just so many completely absurd and stupidly taken scenes and situations.Story is pretty decent, it misses a 5 or 10mins better introduction so we could connect more to the connection that main character has with a certain person, and for which everything else later happens. Why not spend some more money and make that extra couple of minutes which could create a way closer emotion to the story and characters..It touches a lot of current problems in society and especially in USA, but also around the globe, it has an very interesting lore that could be explored in so many different ways.I hope for the sequel, maybe prequel as well, with some deeper story and development of characters.All in all a decent watch, a good action movie. I would watch it again."

The only good thing about this movie is Jason. Verona parker was the worst of all. Her mother died and it was like she didnt even cared. Jason cared, but all Verona wanted to do is kill Jason. Is she crazy? I would have helpt the men.. The storyline made no sense at all. And beside the storyline, her acting was terrible.And what was up with the yellow rambo figure at the end? They wanted to bring some comedy into the movie? Again: it made no sense.If your looking for some hardcore fighting, then you should watch this, because the fighting scenes were great and pretty brutal. But don't expect much more from this movie. I think with some other actors it would have made a BIG difference."
"6","The vengeful beekeeper: between inconsistencies and muscular action","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9747131/?ref_=tt_urv","gsilecchia","20 April 2024","""The Beekeeper"" is one of those films that challenges the logic of standard evaluations. While it presents many shortcomings in terms of screenplay and narrative coherence, it is simultaneously an extremely enjoyable experience. The plot follows Adam Clay, a solitary beekeeper who, after the tragic death of his neighbor Eloise, discovers that he is a former agent of a secret organization known as the ""Beekeepers."" Determined to avenge Eloise and expose the criminal network responsible for her death, Clay plunges into a spiral of action and revenge that leads him to confront increasingly powerful enemies. One of the main weaknesses of the film is its incredibly absurd plot filled with inconsistencies. However, there seems to be a certain awareness of this madness on the part of the directors and actors, who manage to turn the film's flaws into a source of entertainment. Jason Statham, in the role of Adam Clay, delivers his usual muscular and ruthless performance, which fits perfectly with the film's tone. The other cast members also perform well in their roles, although the characters are often stereotypical and lacking in depth. The action scenes are one of the film's strengths, with well-executed choreography and adrenaline-pumping sequences that keep the viewer glued to the screen. However, the film suffers from a certain lack of originality, drawing inspiration from other films of the genre without adding much that is new. Despite its evident shortcomings, ""The Beekeeper"" still manages to entertain thanks to its mix of action, humor, and self-irony. It's one of those films that should be watched without too many expectations and with a mind willing to smile at its absurdities. While ""The Beekeeper"" certainly cannot be described as a masterpiece, it still offers a contradictory yet enjoyable entertainment experience. If you are willing to temporarily suspend your critical sense and embrace the film's madness, you may find in Adam Clay the new avenging hero you need."
"2","Terrible....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9596133/?ref_=tt_urv","angladafrank","31 January 2024","Jason Statham can't save this trainwreck of a movie.The action is passable but the plot is so nonsensical and the m,ovie unaware oif how ridiculous it is that it is actually hard to watch.And that's coming from sonmeone who enjoys Statham movies including the ridiculous ones like Fast and Furious. It is not even ""it is so bad it is good"" it just plain bad with a cler intention to emulate John Wick but without the talent in the writing.This movie takes itself way too seriously and is a total missed opportunity to touch on serious things like scammers and computer fraud.Avoid, theres a 1000 way better actioon flick to watch or look forward to."
"8","Adam clay the new John wick?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9656253/?ref_=tt_urv","gavinbshort","3 March 2024","""Just a Beekeeper"" sounds like an intriguing premise for a Jason Statham movie! The combination of his action-packed style with a retired hitman seeking revenge could indeed draw comparisons to ""John Wick."" The idea of not messing with the hive adds an interesting twist, hinting at a dangerous adversary with a unique background.From the serene beauty of the beekeeping scenes to the gritty urban landscapes of the action sequences, the film offers a visually captivating experience. Overall, ""Just a Beekeeper"" promises to be a thrilling ride for fans of action movies looking for something fresh and exciting.8.5."
"7","It was pretty good","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9767463/?ref_=tt_urv","richbaker5150","2 May 2024","I like most Jason Stratham movies. Some are corny, sure. This was corny. And the actress Emmy Raver-Lampman....more wooden than Pinocchio. She's just awful. The movie has some good action if you can ignore the hundreds of incorrect tactical moves and operations in the movie. I don't hate it, but won't watch again.There seems to be several plot lines. Will Statham right the wrong? I don't think he does. And there are some scenes highlighting the bad guys in a neon office wearing silly suits and carrying microphones. Too far for me. I said it earlier but I can't get over it. Emmy Lampman is the most uncomfortable actress I've ever seen. Almost had pity on her for as terrible as she was. Many of us think we can do a better job than others in a certain job. I know I could act better."

Badly acted, formulaic drudgery and as such, just so disappointing. A good cast that should and can do better than this. Very little character building and an implausible plot. This is a collection of scenes from other movies you have definitely seen before, stitched together but not to form a coherent whole. I watched for 40 mins and don't want or care to know what came after that. The bad guys are just annoying kids. Jeremy Irons is wasted and this does nothing for Jason Statham's rich back catalogue. Don't waste your time."

I really enjoyed Beekeeper because it was filled with action from the beginning to the ending.Now, let's talk about the action performances. Wow! Jason completely owned the screen with his powerhouse performance. The action sequences were choreographed with precision, and the adrenaline-pumping stunts were executed flawlessly. It's evident that the cast dedicated themselves to their roles, bringing authenticity and intensity to every scene.The cinematography was nothing short of stunning. Each frame was meticulously crafted, showcasing breathtaking visuals that added depth and intensity to the storyline. The use of color, lighting, and camera angles created a visually immersive experience, making it clear that a lot of thought went into the film's aesthetic appeal.The Beekeeper is by far the best action movie so far during Jason Statham's career."

Jason Statham diehard fans will find this one of his worst. Everyone else other than 10 year old boys will find it difficult to finish. The script was utterly ridiculous. The acting was awful even from Jeremy Irons. The fight scenes were mediocre and I got bored watching Statham mowing down idiot bad guys left and right. The only reason this movie was made is because Statham's agent convinced him to do another cash grab at the expense of his acting legacy. Can't recommend this. Sorry Jason."
"6","Much better than anticipated.....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9561082/?ref_=tt_urv","PerryAtTheMovies","13 January 2024","6.4/10 (Recommend)My first 2024 film of the year, and I will say that I wasn't disappointed that it was. As much as this film is like any other Jason Statham film it feels more solid overall. The story is much better than I anticipated. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. The story progresses well, but has room for shortfalls especially around the last third of the film. The acting is top-notch for what this type of action film is. It's weird seeing Josh Hutcherson in the role he's in, but he does manage to pull it off better than I thought. The fight scenes leave much to be desired at times. Yes, they're cool and have some awesome shots, but there's certain aspects that logic can't penetrate. Not just the hand to hand aspects, but also with the weapons being used and the people using them. Don't get me wrong. It's still entertaining, but when you start boiling down the logics it can ruin it a little bit. Some of the visuals related to explosions are a little wonky, but they aren't domineering. Overall, this is a really enjoyable film. It's one I would definitely watch again. The runtime is decent, but felt a little long by the time the conclusion came. The acting is good, the story is more exciting than expected, but the visuals and logics lack at times. In the end I would recommend this as a film to check out.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!"

Unfortunately as this movie progresses more and more terrible choices are visible. As the story goes on it becomes weaker and weaker and eventually you don't really know what you're watching anymore.I was very excited to see the trailer for this when it was announced. With that said I still feel Hollywood is trying to sell us the transporter but instead we got Meg 5.I don't want to give anything away so I'll keep it pretty vague but I give this a 4/10.I'm not beyond impressing, it's actually quite simple, if you stick to the basics principles of film making you're on to a win. Unfortunately for me this film fell short and gradually let it's self down like an inflatable shark."

Wow just wow I promise I laughed at this trailer but upon watching it I couldn't get enough! This movie gave me an adrenaline rush! I swear it's like John wick on steroids taking down the weak ass government mostly lol trust from start to end a wild fun ride. Perfect ending, no love story and some of the coolest deaths I've seen in action movie. Everyone played such a perfect part and I feel like this was Jason Stathams best movie! Don't get me wrong John wick was amazing but damn did he get beat up so much in his fights, where in this movie he hardly gets hit its just amazing, absurd and fun!"
"7","One of Statham's Better Action Films","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9560567/?ref_=tt_urv","ActionFan-Reviews","13 January 2024","First he was the TRANSPORTER.... than he was the MECHANIC and even fought THE MEG - now he is the BEEKEEPER. This is one of his better action movies and delivers on what you would want as a fan of this genre.Statham proves he is one of the top action stars of this generation and one of the best of all time. He is at his bad ass best in this. It is action packed from beginning to end with some inventive and violent kills. It didn't even feel as long as it was and was very fast paced and no-non sense. The overall set up of the story is relatable as we've all heard of or known someone who has fallen prey to these types of phishing scams. You want to see these guys get their comeuppance - which they do. It has a strong supporting cast - Josh Hutcherson, Jeremy Irons are solid. Sure, it may be a bit illogical at times and Statham is pretty much invincible, but if you like 80/90's one man army, R rated action movies it is quite entertaining and delivers.Overall, this movie provides on plenty of action and as a Statham fan I enjoyed and consider this one of his better movies. These types of ol' school R rated action movies are great to see in cinema and I'd recommend it on the big screen.7.5/10."

I knew it was an action flick, and I was in the mood for a typical action/revenge movie. But the script and the acting is just so incredibly stoopid, that the action wasn't enough to carry it. This is a direct to video, bottom of the thrift store bargain bin production.Better off watching old WWF videos on YouTube for higher quality of script writing and acting to go with the wrasslin' action, brother! Ooh yeah!I'd like to conclude my negative review now, but unfortunately I still have a few more characters to go.Hollywood ran out of new ideas years ago.Think I'll watch Fallout again.

If you enjoy a great action flick, without having to pick a part every little detail, this one is perfect! The storyline is great, fight scenes are fantastic, and if you're a Jason Statham fan you will for sure enjoy this! Is it 100% realistic? No. Are there small plow holes here and there? Possibly. But it's Hollywood, and if you can just enjoy it for what it is, you will love it! Plus, the plot line is super satisfying! Definitely something that I think we all wish could happen to people that take advantage of others. I don't review a lot of movies, but seeing all the negative, I had to throw in some positive..

The plot line is stupid and convoluted but that isn't a deal killer for me. I think it was supposed to be another John Wick copy but I don't think it works, at least not for me. I prefer JS in a movie like Homefront or even The Expendables where his character is more human and has speaking parts. Jason can act but he phones this one in.This movie is totally watchable if you like a good action/popcorn movie. The effects are believable.
