"7","/10","Kind of all over the place but distinct enough","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3691295/?ref_=tt_urv","spencergrande6","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8499289/?ref_=tt_urv","22 April 2017","A strange movie. It is kind of all over the place with its themes and influences but it has a distinct enough personality and some solid setpieces.This is a straight adventure story with giant monsters, and the way it's shot and the hammy dialogue are mostly B-movie and comic book derived (check out those Dutch angles and blistering colors and 10 times too big sun, moon, aurora...).But there's also a clunky Vietnam metaphor that's a straight-up over the top ""homage"" to Apocalypse Now, et al. The song choices even more so. It makes sense in theory (VietKong anyone?) but I don't think it ever really works and it's just an excuse to make Sam Jackson a bad guy to counterpoint Kong's ""human"" side.Characters are fine for the most part. They serve their cardboard purposes and that's what's expected. Hiddleston and Larson in particular feel vastly underdeveloped. Everything they say and do fall instantly from memory and their disappearance from the movie all together wouldn't have changed it that much.But what we want are monsters and we get them. Most of them are wonders to behold (the water buffalo, spider legs, and octo tentacles yum) except the generic Skullcrawers (the scene where Reilly names them is embarrassing - I don't think Larson or Hiddleston had any idea what to do the dialogue is so ferociously dumb. Reilly almost saves it however).This Kong feels like a very different movie than the new Godzilla. This is very much an entertaining B-movie with strong comic book influences worn loud and proud. It will be interesting to see how these two worlds collide. If any franchises deserve an extended universe, it's these! That's what they're all about.","31 out of 33 found this helpful."

He hires the former Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to guide the expedition; a group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson); and the awarded journalist and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). On the arrival, the helicopters need to cross a storm and soon they drop bombs on the forest to map the seismology of the island. Soon they are attacked by a huge gorilla called Kong that destroys the helicopters and kills part of the crew and scatter the rest through the island. The group commanded by Conrad meets Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a survivor from the World War II that lives with a tribe of natives. He explains that Kong protects the island and the natives from underground monsters and shall not be killed. But Colonel Packard is insane seeking revenge for his men that died.""Kong: Skull Island"" is a brainless adventure with several stupidities. For example, the number of helicopters in the beginning of the journey of Randa, Conrad and Packard is totally incompatible with the size of their ship. Bo pilot would dare to cross a storm like that in a helicopter. The attack of all the helicopters to Kong is absolutely imbecile. Most of the survivor's attitude are at least unreasonable. On the other side, the adventure is highly entertaining and the special effects are top notch. Therefore the best option to the viewer is to shut down the brain and enjoy the adventure since this is the purpose of this type of blockbuster. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Kong: A Ilha da Caveira"" (""Kong: The Skull Island"")","286 out of 359 found this helpful."
"","","Enjoyably distracting monster movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3768069/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","30 July 2017","Looking back at old movies, the effects date quickly and they become rather cheesy in their simple pleasures. Someday I will do that with this film, because essentially it is a creature feature, albeit one that happens to be being delivered with the biggest stars, biggest budget, and state-of-the-art effects. And the thing is, despite all this superficial polish, the film is essentially big monsters and spectacle.On this front it is enjoyable though; it has plenty of action, lots to look at, and a reasonably successful mix of humor and drama. I say reasonably, because the plot isn't up to much, and different characters seem to be in different films depending on who they are. This is matched by the performances which range from the silly fun (Reilly) to the stupidly OTT (Jackson) to the starry but bland (Hiddleston, Larson); the film doesn't seem to have a handle on what it wants to do, and the mix that it produces is not always successful, and it relies on big moments of action and noise to try and cover it. Perhaps at some point there was some smart commentary about US foreign policy in there, but that is lost in the mix too.Still, it works as a monster movie with great effects and lots of polish, so enjoy it for that even if there is not too much beyond that.","17 out of 20 found this helpful."
"7","/10","Tour of Duty makes an excursion to Skull Island","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5272961/?ref_=tt_urv","Coventry","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2020269/?ref_=tt_urv","22 November 2019","I usually don't comment on massively budgeted blockbusters, but ""Kong: Skull Island"" is such a joyfully tongue-in-cheek homage to giant monster B-movie cinema that I simply had to make an exception! This is a tremendously over-the-top and silly creature-feature, but the undemanding popcorn-entertainment value is just irresistible. The original King Kong, from 1933 already, is a monumental piece of cinema and still very powerful today. The more recent (2005) and expensive Peter Jackson remake was, at least in my humble opinion, a very boring and overlong romantic drama. ""Kong: Skull Island"" nicely falls right between these two extremes. By no means, it's great cinema, but at least it provides thrills, chuckles and adrenaline rushes from start to finish. The intro and scene-setting are already incredibly dumb, but oh so fun! We're supposed to believe that there exists a secret government agency (yes, another one) named Monarch, and their area of expertise is searching around the world for monsters and oversize animals. In 1973, The agency's CEO (an energetic John Goodman) benefices from the US-army's retreat out of Vietnam to recover soldiers and assets for a mission to the secretive Skull Island; a place where - and I quote - God left his creation unfinished.""Kong: Skull Island"" certainly doesn't waste any time! The helicopters have barely begun circling over the island, and there already emerges the humongous ape King Kong to slap them out of the sky like tiny ping-pong balls! The few remaining soldiers, led by the frustrated platoon leader Samuel L. Jackson, continue on foot and swear to destroy King Kong, but they soon learn that the island homes lots of other giant and unspeakably evil monstrous creations, and that Kong isn't even such a bad fella. It's a mission impossible to take this film seriously, but with the right mindset (and perhaps a few six-packs of beer) you'll have a great time. Seeing the story takes place in 1973 and has an abundantly clear Vietnam collection, it also somewhat feels like a long-feature ""Tour of Duty"" movie with a downright awesome 70s soundtrack. The special effects are cheesy and exaggerated, the dialogues are deliciously tacky (""hm, a mushroom...that means there must a river nearby!"") and the casting is perfect. I already mentioned John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson, but there's also John C. Reilly as the bewildered WWII veteran who's been stuck on the island since 1942.","10 out of 11 found this helpful."

Of course, the giant ape, Kong, is soon discovered, as well as several other deadly colossal creatures, including reptilian underground monsters dubbed ""Skullcrawlers."" Will anyone make it out alive? Like my title blurb says, this delivers the goods for fantasy-adventure lovers. The opening act is great with its kinetic air and excellent late 60s/early 70's soundtrack. The rest of the movie more or less keeps up the entertainment value, highlighted by the racially diverse cast, led by Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson and John C. Reilly; there are many others.""Skull Island"" has the high adventure demanded in a King Kong flick and is arguably on par with the original ""King Kong"" (1933), as well as the 1976 and 2005 versions, although it's superior to the latter because it lacks that one's pretentious over-length, cartoonish CGI-jungles and overkill action sequences (like the absurd brontosaurus stampede). Of course, it's criminal to compare a modern CGI-oriented flick with a classic like the 1933 film (or even the '76 version); I'm just saying that, if you favor those movies, you'll probably relish this one because it's cut from the same cloth and is effective for what it is, a colossal creature adventure flick. For further comparison, ""Skull Island"" is pretty much as good or, IMO, better than any of the Jurassic Park pictures.Along with the thrilling jungle escapades, there are some interesting subtexts and gems to mine, like the quasi-Ahab subplot and the fact that dropping myriad bombs might not be the best answer. Early in the film the photographer (Brie) tells the the gung-ho Colonel (Jackson) that America lost the Vietnam War. Yet, this isn't really accurate since the USA won every battle of that infamous conflict. So the colonel rightly corrects her: ""We didn't lose the war; we abandoned it."" The movie runs 118 minutes and was shot in Ha Long Bay, Quang Ninh, Vietnam; Oahu, Hawaii; and Queensland, Australia; with studio work done in Los Angeles.GRADE: B+","21 out of 27 found this helpful."

THIS has good effects? The acting in this film isn't bad, but it definitely won't win any awards for it. The story has characters Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) piggybacking on an expedition to an uncharted island to test their ""hollow earth"" theory. Tom Hiddleston plays a tracker, Brie Larson plays a photographer, and John C. Reilly plays a surprisingly funny WW2 vet marooned on Skull Island.The film takes place in 1973 and loves to remind you with CCR and old technology as if it was a hundred years ago. Kong: Skull Island pays homage to Apocalypse Now quite frequently even though it seems a bit excessive at times.Kong looked good, almost all the creatures looked cool and all the fights between them looked really good, especially in IMAX 3D. Some of the green screen effects, like backgrounds behind characters, were distractingly bad. Ultimately, you get some great stuff out of all the effects if you're not looking too closely.The characters are more hollow than the earth (according to the film's characters themselves), the story is mediocre, but the effects reign king in this film adaptation. My suggestion: See it! it's a blockbuster meant to fill seats, not win awards. Take it for what it is.Seen at an advanced IMAX 3D screening in Minneapolis.","288 out of 458 found this helpful."

""Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love ..."". Well, in a way, that's this version of KONG, and I am really happy and surprised at just how GOOD it was.Take a bit of the original Kong, mix it with one part Private Ryan, a dash of The Deer Hunter, some Monty Python, lots of Jurassic Park, a pinch of A Space Oddity and mix well with some (insert your favorite lower-key funny movies HERE). The result is a pleasing fare one can really sink their teeth into and enjoy.It has some familiar faces too, and what's best about it, is that not only do they live up to their so-called stardom, but even the unfamiliar or not-yet- ""famous"" actors with smaller roles, really do a great job and sell it. At no time while you are watching this movie do you feel it far-fetched or unbelievable that Kong actually exists, and isn't that, in a nutshell, what all movies should aspire to - the suspension of disbelief?

Unlike Perter Jackson's retelling of the original Black and White film, ""Kong: Skull Island"" eschews the old for the new and in doing so breathes a much needed new life and vitality into the franchise.The film is set in 1973 when William Randa (John Goodman), informs the government that they have detected a previously unknown island and need to investigate it before the Soviets learn of it and beat them to whatever the island my hold.William recruits a team which includes a former British officer named James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), and Photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), to assist his team lead by Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins), in mapping the island.William also asks for a military escort and the government enlists Lt. Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), and his team to accompany the mission. Packard is trying to find his place in the world as he and his helicopter combat team are dealing with the recent end of the Vietnam War. His men are looking forward to going home and resuming their lives, but a dour Packard jumps at the chance for another mission over the uncertainty of the future.Upon arriving on the mysterious island and starting their survey mission by using seismic charges, the team attract the attention of Kong who is not at all pleased with the intrusion on his island. Kong makes short work of the copters and the team finds themselves scattered about the dangerous island. They soon learn that Kong is not the only danger on the island and must find a way to rejoin each other and make it to their extraction point alive.Naturally some of the characters have a hidden agenda and there are dangerous and action around every corner. Further complicating matters is the appearance of Marlow (John C. Reilly), a downed WWII pilot who has been stranded on the island for 23 years and warns of dangers far greater than Kong that are ahead of the team.The film combines a solid cast with state of the art special effects to take a new twist on the standard adventure fare. While many parts of the film remain silly Popcorn entertainment, the quality of the assembled cast allows the film to move beyond being just an assembly of potential victims for a menagerie of CGI creatures to dispatch. While the story is more in lines with the linear and thin plots of adventure films of old, the sum of the parts does add up to an enjoyable film experience for those who like the giant creature films. You will want to make sure to stay after the credits as there is a very good scene that shows a setup for a future film that had those in attendance at our press screening cheering.The film may be a bit intense for younger viewers but if you are looking for a touch of nostalgia and action, you may find the film just what you need.3.5 stars out of 5.","124 out of 203 found this helpful."

An exotically stunning picture where the rain forests are so bright and golden as if sunlight was radiating from in between the trees. Kong emerges under the fiery halo of a setting telephoto sun that takes up half the screen. But it was that that moment when I began to have this feeling that I've had too often before, the movie is spectacle and little substance.We begin with John Goodman convincing a senator to fund an expedition to a newly discovered island (captured by satellite camera). He also gets the luxury of a military escort. Enter Samuel L. Jackson as the commander, perfectly type cast with his bravado Schick that is no longer entertaining. The film also succeeds in wasting Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson. The highlight of the cast, is John C. Riley. Stranded on the island for two decades, he has befriended the local indigenous people and knows all the Islands secrets. His humour and energy, are a relief from watching everyone else perform with zero enthusiasm. As for King Kong, He is the biggest we have seen yet in a major motion picture. Unfortunately he is stuck in a movie that is not 'King Kong'; a movie that about a monster finding his humanity. This Kong is all about attitude and not soul. The idea is that he is the guardian protector of the island, who fights to keep nature in balance, by controlling the numbers of the other big inhabitants. He is the last of his kind, and his family was killed by a species that looks like an amphibious version of the distinctive skulled ape in Temple Run. The climax pits Kong against the big daddy of these beasts, a riveting fight scene but with an inevitable outcome. Other highlights include a daddy 'super' long and another giant insect that can disguise itself as a decrepit fallen tree. The jarheads in the movie are virtually nothing more than bodies to feed to creatures like these. In fact the movie often feels like a realized version of the games we used to play with dinosaurs and little toy soldiers.Director Jordan Vogt Roberts seems to be mimicking Michael Bay films. You can see it in his use of slow motion, his stagy camera angles, and framing, and in his comic book color palette. He handles his action scenes with a greater sense of orientation, but like Bay, he fails to summon any suspense, thrill or anticipation. The film always seems too eager to get to the action oriented punchline of every scene. The finished product, is a sexy looking, 50's throwback monster movie, with lots of crazy beasts, stunning scenery and nothing in the way of character development or intelligent dialog. Samuel L. Jacksson points a gun and says, ""unless you tell me what I don't know, I will blow your head off."" You can't get much cheesier than that right?","12 out of 16 found this helpful."

Although I didn't really like the orange tinge everything seems to have in the very beginning, the technical side improves dramatically as the film progresses.It takes place in 1973, just after the Americans ""abandoned"" the Vietnam War (according to Samuel L Jackson's Preston Packard character). The 70's production design is good and brings me back to my childhood (the soundtrack was awesome with plenty of 70's hits), although you don't see much of the 70's vibe after the first 20 minutes or so. The CGI is very good and doesn't make me feel like I'm playing a video game. This movie is like Jurassic Park meets Godzilla and they had a baby called Platoon and it grew to become a mash-up of the three of them with its own uniqueness called Kong: Skull Island.Just under two hours in length and ""hold onto your butts"" and watch the credits.My favourite quote from the movie is, ""A camera is more dangerous than a gun.""

No one knows what they will encounter on this island and why it is so mysterious, but once they reach it, they will soon find out. Living on this hidden island is a giant gorilla . Once there, they discover that King Kong is a real creature, living in a massive jungle where creatures from prehistoric times have been protected and hidden for millions of years.

This ¨Kong¨retools the original's iconic components through the hyper-evolved wonder of 21st century CGI . The great ape himself is really the big star of the wonderful show , delivering the necessary goods to surprise and wonder us .

All over two hours , the movie's gigantism extends ways beyond the scale of its effects . The script attempts hard to build on its more interesting components , mixing adventures , military feats and jungle battles as wel as songs in ¨Apocalypse Now¨ style . The screenplay is unreservedly on the side of Kong , in spite of making an excessive massacre, more than the proud and vengeful Colonel Packard/Samuel L. Jackson .

Jackson, John Goodman, John C. Reilly, and Brie Larson. Packed with all the giant monster movie clichés and fun action scenes one would hope to see, it serves as a sufficient reboot of the King Kong franchise.In 1973, a group of explorers led by a band of soldiers journey to a mysterious uncharted island in the Pacific Ocean. Upon arrival, the group realise the island is swarming with giant monstrous animals and insect-like creatures who have called this place their home for millions of years. After becoming separated amidst the chaos, the groups eventually meet with the local natives who worship a skyscraper-sized ape named Kong who protects them from the giant monsters. While the film doesn't offer much in terms of actual plot, the action and fight scenes more than make up for it. The special effects were great and the CGI for Kong and the other giant monsters were all very convincing. The characters were all essentially stock action roles but thanks to the believable performances from the lead actors, they're still fun to watch. I also enjoyed the fact that Kong has more screen time and a greater relevance on the film's story, unlike with how Godzilla was barely in the 2014 film. I look forward to seeing these two monsters duke it out in a future film.I rate it 7/10","59 out of 104 found this helpful."

From the fire- singed Kong fur to the slick skull crawler tongues, the special effects are brilliantly detailed and animated. And it's genuinely refreshing to watch an action/monster film in which native peoples are depicted with dignity and respect, and where black and Asian characters aren't used as props or fodder for violence (admittedly, the film could have gone further with this, but I sensed some progress being made). Kong: Skull Island isn't Life is Beautiful. It isn't Casablanca. But it is genuinely, thrillingly, rigorously fun. It has heart, scales, teeth and a ferocious roar. Monster movies are back.

Instead, this origin story largely set in the 1970s when America was pulling itself out from the quagmire of the Vietnam War inspires to be no more and no less than a monster-mash adventure of epic-sized proportions, pitting not just Man-against-Kong but Man-against- nature-itself, the latter represented by supersized species the likes of towering spiders, blue-blooded pterodactyls and giant saw- toothed lizards referred to as Skullcrawlers that are all too eager to get a literal taste of human flesh. Oh yes, this is a CGI showstopper in many, many more ways than one, with state-of-the-art Industrial Light and Magic technology complemented with inventive creature design by Carlos Huante to create a fitting modern-day throwback to the B-movie action-driven creature features of the past.Dispensing with any hint of nuance, the straightforward and utterly functional plot has John Goodman's scientist cum bureaucrat Bill Randa assemble a team under his top-secret government-funded Monarch project to explore the hitherto uncharted Skull Island, a long- hidden landmass in the South Pacific hidden by constant electrical storms and magnetic interference which has been only recently uncovered by the first Earth-mapping satellites sent up into space by the US. Among those whom end up one way or another on the mission: Tom Hiddleston's former SAS officer turned tracker-for-hire James Conrad, Brie Larson's anti-war photojournalist Mason Weaver, and last but not least Samuel L. Jackson's embittered Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard and his helicopter squadron (some of the more recognizable faces include Shea Whigham and Toby Kebbell). There are about a half dozen other characters too difficult to keep track once the film gets underway, such as Jing Tian and Corey Hawkins' pair of token-minority scientists who get a couple of pointless lines and no real purpose.Withholding knowledge of the real intent of the expedition to ""document the existence of massive unidentified terrestrial organisms', Randa instructs Colonel Packard's men to start dropping bombs from their helicopters under the guise of mapping the island seismographically, which naturally irritates the hell out of its eponymous chief resident. Kong's grand dramatic entrance consists of hurling a napalm tree towards one of the choppers, before tearing through each and every one of them by either ripping them apart or tossing them against each other. Oh yes, you'll be glad to know that (unlike Randa) Kong doesn't hold anything back right from the get- go, meaning that you will get to see him in all his massive vicious glory in every single scene that he is in. That awesome introduction not only cuts the ensemble down to those in the opening credits and divides them into two groups, but also sets up the enmity between Kong and Packard.Given the simplicity of the storyline, it is no surprise that the characters are but stock types – in fact, the most fully developed character only joins midway through the film, a WWII vet named Hank Marlowe (John C. Reilly) who survived the Japanese pilot after him when both their fighter planes crash-land back in 1944 and has since learned to live peacefully among the natives there. Reilly steals every scene he is in – more than just as supporting comic presence, he is a real live wire injecting warmth, humour and dryness as an eccentric lost-in-time pilot. Jackson comes a close second with his brash gusto, but the rest of the actors are not much better than as body count.But really, who are we kidding – you're probably not here for the story or the characters but the damn ape himself, and boy, does he look magnificent. With tactile fur and soulful eyes, Kong comes to life in breathtaking realism, aided with motion capture by 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' actor Terry Notary. This Kong is majestic on his own (one such moment has him taking a break in a lake while Kebbell's terrified major watches from behind a rock a few feet away), and jaw- droppingly powerful during any one of the startlingly photoreal sequences of bestial combat. It bears noting that the monsters which emerge to challenge Kong or which simply make an appearance as part of the fauna of the titular island are also just as stunning, especially a confrontation in a foggy graveyard between the remaining survivors and a Skullcrawler and the climactic Kong- versus-giant-Skullcrawler smackdown that is impressive even by modern-day CGI standards.Despite being a visual effects novice, indie director Jordan Vogt- Roberts proves right at home in a big-budget motion picture. He creates an immersive pre-historic paradise to complement the exciting monster scenes, and mixes 70s war imageries from 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Platoon' into the 'Jurassic Park' setting to keep his audience hooked. Because of his firm grasp on pace and rhythm, what is two hours feels much less so – and if there is one unintended outcome of that, it is the fact that we end up wanting to see more of Kong. As much as it is Kong's movie, there are also stretches in between where he is nowhere to be seen, and the other nasty dino-like creatures on Skull Island take center stage to exert terror on the human intruders. Ultimately, this is a movie fashioned on pure action spectacle, using state-of-the-art CGI to breathe new life into the old-school monster movie mash genre (you would do well to note that this is meant to be an origin story in Legendary/ Warner's MonsterVerse franchise, setting up the beast for a planned showdown against Godzilla in 2020). It may all seem familiar, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun or thrilling, so really just grab your popcorn, sit back and enjoy the ride.","47 out of 90 found this helpful."

This is an all out creature feature...It is called Skull Island because that's where the action takes place with all the neat creatures.There is a LOT of screen time devoted to Kong and the monsters. And LOTS of cool death scenes. Pretty gory, in my opinion, and surprised this got a pg-13. Some scenes would be very frightening for little ones.Most surprisingly, it is the the acting of John Goodman and J.C. Riley that stands out - even overshadowing tom Hiddleston. I am not a big fan of Goodman or Riley, so this really surprised me.For the plot - people go to Skull Island. They encounter Kong and various giant monsters. Mayhem and death ensues. Some return home. The end.Doesn't sound like much but the monster scenes really made the movie, and Kong was fantastic. They really had him move - he was almost like a giant Hulk smashing those airplanes!Oh, and PLEASE stay after the credits. What was shown put a BIG smile on my face... No spoilers.. you have to see it for yourself.My wife and I had a blast.

This is not the same story that you all know and love. This is barely even the same monster; this one is much taller. The whole movie really only exists to set up 2020's Godzilla vs Kong. That being said, this is a fun, action packed movie, that rarely feels like a cheap setup to another movie.The story revolves around a group of scientists and soldiers in the nineteen-seventies who conduct experiments on Skull Island, unaware of the monsters that inhabit it.The concept is not taken as seriously as many previous renditions of Kong. It focuses mostly on intense action, and features comic relief, mostly via John C Reilly's character. But it is still suspenseful, with many characters dying unexpectedly. It also has some pretty good cinematography, and many scenes reminiscent of Apocalypse Now.This new version probably won't appeal to all King Kong fans. A lot of people will probably hate the lighter tone and the liberties taken with the monster. But it does what it set out to do: deliver a fun action movie. It is nowhere near as good as the original, or even the Peter Jackson remake, but I was thoroughly entertained by it. I'd also say I'd prefer it to the recent Godzilla movie it's set to crossover with.

They are flying helicopters dropping explosive charges to map the island when Kong shows up to bring them down. Some of the survivors encounter natives and Hank Marlow (John C.

Fifteen minutes is plenty. I don't care about Randa's backstory or the political backdrop of the situation. John C. Reilly is off trying to do comedy by himself. Kong lacks the needed humanity. The best is the monster action and Kong fits well in that aspect. The giant spider is amazing creepiness. The movie needs more of those types of thrills.

The first 30 minutes or so pass by and plays out in typical fashion, the soldier stereotype as seen in countless films meat headed with a gung ho mentality. Which in essence is a moral of the film ""don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs unless you're picking a fight"". The first 30 mins despite the roaring action is pretty dull, the CG graphics are pretty spellbinding the detail on Kong specifically.Not until John c Reilly turns up was I fully invested and in all honesty he steals the show. He provides a couple of dazzling lines and weirdly enough injects some much needed heart into a so far emotionless ride.The music was good except it suffered from the ""suicide squad"" syndrome it was over used almost to breaking point. An excellent use of Jefferson airplanes white rabbit can always be forgiven though. Kong references a whole bunch of other films some obvious choices, others not so obvious. Ranging from music cues (the shining, fear and loathing in Las Vegas) then to some more on the nose Vietnam flicks ( apocalypse now, platoon, full metal jacket)Never tries to be smart and plays Upto the ridiculousness of the story to good effect.

I don't think this will be a long remembered monster movie. It's a fun movie, but ultimately forgettable. The CGI Kong, Samuel L Jackson, and John Goodman all took a backseat to John C. Rielly, who did a superb job playing a WWII pilot who was shot down and landed on Skull Island. Seriously, his role is the greatest thing in this movie.The movie is set in 1973, and the premise is that LandSat (land mapping satellite) has taken pictures of an elusive island (Skull Island) that has been rumored to exist, but not proved. John Goodman convinces the government to launch an expedition to explore the island. They take some soldiers who were pulling out of Vietnam, and are headed by Samuel L Jackson. They also pick up a British ex-special forces ""tracker"" (Tom Hiddleston) and an ""anti-war"" photographer played by Brie Larson.They start the mission by dropping bombs on the island to map the bedrock, ostensibly to look for mineral deposits. That's when Kong shows up to smack the helicopters out of the air, and generally wreak mayhem on the team. The scattered survivors then have to survive on an island filled with monsters and get to the extraction zone. One group finds John C. Reilly's character, who has been stranded on the island for 29+ years.That's about all I'll say about the story, so as to avoid serious spoilers. The story line is fairly conventional with very little arc to the characters. In many regards it actually sets up more like a horror movie than action/adventure movie. In fact, there are numerous jump-scares and other horror movie devices throughout the movie.In many ways, it felt like the movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be. Is it a monster movie? A horror movie? An action movie (anti-war)? There are also numerous characters who seem like they were intended to play more significant roles. For instance they bring along a biologist, played by Tian Jing, who does no biology and seems to mainly appear to allow another character to give exposition. Similarly most of the LandSat team, who seem to be around for comic relief (horror movie style comic relief). Even some of the major characters do little aside from provide a single plot piece.Then there is Kong. I think they could have spent a bit more time developing Kong, partly as a character and partly as an animation. The CGI was pretty good, but his proportions looked wrong and his motions were wooden.Anyway, I think there was just too much going on, and not enough time for this movie to be really good. I think it could have been an excellent mini-series, or TV season. As it is, it's an okay movie, that is fun if you go in with a low-bar. 6/10, so I enjoyed it, but not enough.","45 out of 94 found this helpful."

First of all, we have no real idea why the government would ante up for this ludicrous venture. Once the Senator decides to go along with it, a truly idiotic array of cannon fodder and expensive helicopters head off, not knowing a thing about their reason for doing so. The early scene of Kong destroying the copters is asinine. Once he grabbed the first chopper, the rest of the pilots should have backed off and figured things out. Kong's arms are long but about 30 feet would have put them out of harm's way. There is so much that goes unexplained in this thing and so many plot holes, it's hard to get into it. Sam Jackson plays the same part he has played about sixteen times (were there any snakes in those helicopters?). The rest of the stiff acting company does nothing to develop any sort of connection for us. Even the hero guy is about as boring as one can be. I could go on, but others have already poked holes in it enough.","21 out of 33 found this helpful."

The fun starts from the get go and continues at a good pace throughout this film. Unlike previous Kong films, this time its humanity intruding on Kong's patch not Kong being transported back to civilization. Personally, I think this approach works far better. It allows for a world of CGI generated, larger than life creatures, like Kong to be brought to life, creating an outlandish but fun jungle style adventure.Whats also appealing is the pro environment, anti war message. Without giving too much away, the warmongers in this film really don't fare too well. Mess with nature and pay the price. Something we should all keep in mind. The acting is for the most excellent helped by well rounded, colourful characterizations, that, whilst not too realistic, fit snugly into the rather fantastical world of Skull Island.In sort, I really enjoyed Kong Skull Island and I think you will too.

Before going to the movie, please realize that you're going for a monster flick and it's not an Oscar calibre movie like Moonlight or La La Land, so critic it on that basis only. What this movie does better than Godzilla in my humble opinion is there is more human touch to it, once you see it you'll come to know what I'm talking about.

Look, nothing will ever beat the original KING KONG, although I did enjoy the first remake and even films like KING KONG VS. GODZILLA. With that said, I found the Peter Jackson film to be downright terrible and when I walked into this movie I was just hoping for something better than it. Thankfully, KONG: SKULL ISLAND is much better than that as long as you turn your brain off at the door.I thought for the most part the film worked quite well. For starters, the filmmakers appeared to realize that what movie fans want are giant monsters who battle one another. You don't have to wait too long for the first glimpse of Kong and this here is a major plus. Once we reach the island is when all of the fun starts and it really goes for the throat as there's a very fun adventure on the island. I'm obviously not going to spoil everything that happens but the entire running time takes place on the island and this leads to some very fun monster battles.There's no question that the best thing about this picture are the monsters including Kong. Yes, the King Kong is CGI but he looks terrific and very realistic. I thought the entire creation was an extremely good one and the film perfectly allows you to believe that what you're seeing is real. The other monsters also look terrific and I thought the filmmakers really nailed the look of the monsters. The battle scenes are certainly a lot of fun and especially the final one where Kong must go up against something much bigger than him.As far as the cast goes, no one is spectacular but they're at least fun. Tom Hiddleston is a pretty laid back lead but he does fine. John C. Reilly and Samuel L. Jackson are both good, although they're both pretty much playing the type of character we've seen them do countless times before. Goodman is fun when he's on the screen. The only real dud is Brie Larson as the photographer. She's good in the film but I must say it's a pretty bland and boring part and especially coming after winning an Oscar for ROOM.Technically speaking the film is quite impressive and we've got a rousing score to go with everything. The plot is certainly very simple but I'm actually glad. I mean, I've never believed these types of movies need to clock in at two and a half hours. This one is just under two-hours and that's the perfect time for this type of action movie.","13 out of 23 found this helpful."

They had a section of the big canyon area where they filmed the bone pit scenes and they still had all the huge styrofoam bones and skulls like the big Kong skull and the triceratops skull. They let us all walk through the field that the characters walked through, but since it's been a year plus since they filmed Kong the styrofoam bones were starting to fall apart due to rain and wind.
Anyways, Kong: Skull island is full of action. And coming off of Godzilla (2014) i'm so glad we finally get to see the action as it happens. The action combined with some dope creatures / monsters all with super unique designs keep this film fresh and amazing to look at.
Speaking of, there's also some really nice cinematography / visual choices that I was really surprised by. Character were great, I don't think there's a single performance that bothered me or more stand-offish than the others, it was pretty solid all around. I did really like John C.

This second entry to the Monster-verse franchise satiates our craving for roaring action, through technical achievements and fast paced storytelling. For instance, its impressive camerawork & sound design ushers well staged chaos, capturing Kong's destructive power through crisp, captivating effects. With these, the action sequences then packs a punch, worthy of Kong's perceived supremacy. The CGI deserves its accolades & its own mention, as Skull Island's horrors are given hyper-real renders, sweetening the violence with visually convincing appeal. As for its screenplay, its approach that veers away from reliving past adaptation's annoyances was a welcome treat, shedding the overused ape & lass love story, in favor of plot pieces that elaborates Kong's significance & tragedy as protector of Skull island.Where the film stagnates is when focus is redirected from the monstrosities. Here, the mediocrity of this picture's ensemble cast stands out, with its hollow, one dimensional characters & script that misfires with unnatural one liners & failed humor. Thank goodness then for Samuel L Jackson & John C Reilly, as their characters account for the compelling madness that rivals Kong's menace, and well placed levity that offers respite from the craziness.Kong: Skull Island is then a certified popcorn movie. It solely scores points through exhilarating sequences that features Kong, rampaging against expendable characters & over sized creeps. Its scenes that feature character drama and intended comedy are then skippable nuisances, offering small-scale relevance. Half butter, half cheese please!","2 out of 2 found this helpful."

Taking place during the waning days of the Vietnam War, it brings a gripping feel of nostalgia and also a wholesome sense of history even in a tumultuous uncertain time.Performances are solid all around, but Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly are standouts, as two dueling perspectives- one of authority and one of peace. Without giving too much away, their backstories lend their points of view a sense of conviction.

"7","/10","Kong - an exciting, satisfying monster mashup","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3657563/?ref_=tt_urv","sossevarvo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25815292/?ref_=tt_urv","9 March 2017","The construction of cinematic universes seems to be the new fad of commercial Hollywood, ever since the Marvel train came along with the original Iron Man and proceeded to churn out hit after universe-expanding hit. Now, we have a ""Monsters"" universe, with Kong back just a decade after Peter Jacksons (superior) rendition of the character to tie into the universe of the lacklustre Godzilla film of 2014. Fortunately Kong: Skull Island manages to feel like its own movie. What separates this new addition to the Kong mythos from all other films of its ilk is its distinctive visual aesthetic, an aesthetic I can only assume is a gargantuan love letter to Apocalypse Now. Vittorio Storaro's iconic cinematography from Coppola's classic has been reinvented in spades with state of the art CGI effects. Every two minutes or so we are treated to a breathtaking shot - mist and fog are thrillingly utilised, as well as a night scene eerily similar to the Do Long Bridge sequence of Apocalypse Now. While this is perhaps relying too much on a far, FAR, better film, it was refreshing to know that at least from a visual standpoint there were genuine artistic influences that could be discerned, the sense that the filmmaker wanted to put a new spin on the monster formula. The important thing to note is Kong and his wide array of monster peers deliver the goods. All of the action sequences are fluidly filmed, thrillingly executed, with breathtaking CGI and the help of such atmospheric cinematography as I detailed above. The monsters have real menace and bite, and they're imposing in all the right ways. Through what seems to be on location shooting, you also get a nice sense of Skull Island as a landscape, its harsh and alien nature. When the monsters attack it's always a blast. Unfortunately when they don't attack, we have to rely on the characters, and there isn't much to rely on. Lazy characterisation and archetypal ""there purely to be killed"" characters are abound, and several great actors - Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Shea Whigham, John Goodman, Jason Mitchell, Toby Kebbell - are really shortchanged for genuine arcs and motivations. Luckily the sheer talent and likability of these actors makes up for a great deal, and when copious eye candy and monster throwdowns occur, it didn't bother me too much. Only John C Reilly and Samuel L Jackson truly stand out, and it's because their characters have genuine development and intrigue. The soundtrack felt a tad on the nose, with popular 70s tunes, including CCR and Bowie, popping in and out for little reason other than to hamfistedly evoke an era in the broadest possible way. What cannot be faulted however is the film's pacing - there is never a dull moment, with the action and tension kept admirably flowing for a tight sub 2 hour run time ( a far cry from Peter Jackson's 3 hour epic ) In all I had a fun time with Kong. It's likely to leave my memory pretty soon, but that being said it delivers in spades on what anyone would savour in a crazy big budget monster movie spectacle as this, and even with poor characterisation, its visual appeal and effects make it worthy of recommendation.","14 out of 28 found this helpful."

All the elements of this new version of King Kong have been recycled. Taking parts of the originals/remakes and hastily gluing them together again in a different way doesn't mean it is going to create an inventive artwork. And I knew they would put a scene where Kong saves a pretty lady in his palm, I just knew it. All that's improved from the previous films is Kong's appearance. He is fluffier, angrier and more realistic. Some points must be given to the stunning visual effects.The characters' names and faces have also changed, but their nature and characteristics are half dimensional and predictable. It is stereotypes upon stereotypes. It is a major waste of talent with Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L Jackson and Academy Award winner Brie Larson (""Room"") struggling in the muddled chaos. You could see and feel the disappointment. Even Kong seems confused. The performances are half- hearted and there is just no substance for them to work with. I bet all they were thinking of while filming was 'get me out of here' – literally. For the majority of the film, everyone says very few words to each other. The conversations are forced and laughable. It wouldn't have made a difference if they were just silent. It's so predictable that you would know exactly what the next line would be. I thought while watching this, was this meant to be an exaggerated satire of King Kong? Or was it meant to be taken seriously? Even the execution of the film presents the same questions. At one point, it would be slow and mystic, and minutes later, overly upbeat music would hit your ears, and we are treated to magnified slow-motion action. It feels it is trying too hard to get our attention. And once it does, it doesn't know how to sustain it. And finally, there are so many extreme close-ups of Samuel L. Jackson's face, it probably took up half the film. They did it to match Kong's face, so you can imagine how gigantic it was. Maybe if Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts figured out from the beginning what type and style of film this would be, it would have been a better film. It seems like he had an idea but is unconvicted towards it, and instead keeps changing his mind to offer more 'fun'. The result that it is a jumble of various pieces that don't belong in the same puzzle.","113 out of 224 found this helpful."

I love giant monster films. There's something about a badass giant monster wrecking havoc that is so captivating. I think Godzilla (2014) was a bit slow and flawed from a storytelling perspective but the monster action scenes were fantastic and its really all you can ask for from a monster film. As expected its more or less the same deal with Kong: Skull Island. Its a flawed film but the monster scenes and the action is terrific.The film follows a team of people who have been hired to explore the mysterious Skull Island. What the crew do not realize is that they have disturbed a giant inhabitant of the island: King Kong. Much like with Godzilla, Kong is a bit of an antihero. There are more dangerous creatures on Skull Island and Kong is a protector against them. The main foes in the film are giant lizard-like beings that kill whatever is in their way and are at war with King Kong. Much like other monster films, humans are caught in between. For my review, I will start with all the negatives before divulging into the positives. ﻿ The characters in this film for the most part suck. They are bland, muted, unmotivated and just are there without much characterization. The ones with a bit of character (John C. Reilly) are fed uninspiring dialogue. The humorous moments are predictable and fall flat. Brie and Tom didn't have much chemistry and both characters were so bland and could have disappeared without notice. Its a relatively unknown director at the helm of this Kong film, I think he did a good job but the film would have prospered with a better script, characters, and direction. At times (not that often) the CGI looks ropy at best and its distracting (especially with the non Kong creatures).Now the positives. Every scene with Kong in it is captivating and mesmerizing. There's more of Kong in this than say Godzilla in the 2014 reboot, which is nice. You don't want to overdo the monster presence and this film just had it right. The final battle between Kong and the skull crawler was fantastic. If you love monster films and blockbuster action sequences, prepare to be on the edge of your seat. Kong took a while to get used to but overall he looked great, had great visuals, and a nice roar. The poster scene with helicopters flying at Kong against the backdrop of the setting sun was incredible.The film is flawed for sure. The human moments aren't very inspiring, its hard to connect with any of the characters, and there's a bit too many bland characters running around. However, if you are like me you are here for some epic monster v monster action and in that regard you will not be disappointed. I'm excited with the prospect of a Monsterverse. Also, stay tuned after the credits for something really great.7.5/10","8 out of 14 found this helpful."

That's not to say I disliked Godzilla, but every time something interesting or a really cool monster moment surfaces, it kept cutting away. Godzilla delivers in the finale, but what Kong does differently is that it isn't afraid to embrace those monster moments. Right off the bat, Kong is showcased front and center and it is pleasing eye-candy. Kong: Skull Island is action-packed, and director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has a keen eye for action. Cinematographer Larry Fong and the hard working special-effects artists produce some remarkable visuals. Kong combats a squad of helicopters who are swooping in formation. Vogt-Roberts doesn't overuse the slow-motion sequences, but he uses them at the right moment in the middle of the action. It never really cheapened all of the action set- pieces, it actually enhanced the experience. Lots of great creatures too, some deadly looking lizards things, a giant octopus, a giant spider, and some pre-historic looking birds. Kong himself looked fabulous. He's obviously the misunderstood monster as he is only protecting his turf and territory. He is ginormous, bigger than ever and it makes a difference. Kudos to the VFX team, there is a sense of scale and weight to Kong and all the other creatures in the film. The actors do their job commendably. Not much is fleshed out with any of these characters to be honest, but they do bring some gravitas to the film. Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, and John Goodman do their best to make their characters believable. Jackson in particular can be compared to Col. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. Against all logic and odds, he's obsessed with his mission. John C. Reilly provides a lot of humor into the film as he is a WWII pilot, stranded on Skull Island for almost thirty years. Some characters are really there for exposition, particularly the short, not much to do roles played by Corey Hawkins and Tian Jing. I do want to point out that I appreciated Hiddleston and Larson's relationship in the film. While not fleshed out at all, it wasn't some typical Hollywood, forced down your throat romance, rather just a mutual respect for one another. Larson's character is also involved in the action, useful at times, and not just some damsel in distress. Some of the supporting roles of the soldiers played by Jason Mitchell, Shea Whigham, and Thomas Mann aren't as expendable as one would typically expect them to be so that was a nice surprise as well. It's no secret that Legendary and WB are creating a MonsterVerse with Kong, Godzilla, and all the other Toho creatures. They've got some franchise building to do, and for corporate film making, this movie goes through the checkmarks very well. Vogt-Roberts does a good job not making it feel like a ""filler"" film to fill in the gaps, as a matter of fact it does feel like it stands on its own for the most part. He moves the story along from A to Z with a lot of eye candy action. The choice of music and the color palette he choose feels like a Vietnam/70's film. It does what it needs to do and it's a fun way to kill off two hours. Obviously stay through the credits. It's a nice tease. 7/10","7 out of 12 found this helpful."

Packed with epic action, monsters and adventure, this movie doesn't fail for the fans for Kong and Godzilla.The plot is basically straight forward and requires no brains for thinking and realism to be taken seriously; a group of Vietnam soldiers and explorers head out to the South Pacific to explore an island that may have signs of life and discovery. They find more than what they have been told with a massive and destructive gorilla that is hailed as a king, due to his presence in protecting the natives from the creatures that hunt and feed on the humans. The battle of man vs nature commences but it's not long till they discover that maybe the king is the one in need of protection.With an awesome eye on action, monsters and scale, first time director Jordan Vogt-Roberts delivers a fun ride. First fault though was the plot, there's not much originality on screen but it does carry the tones to Godzilla. Writers Dan Gilroy and Max Borenstein make the best attempt to make the story work, based on the story by John Gatins and Dan Gilroy who based it on the original film's writers from 1933.The acting from the cast, raging from Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson, John Goodman and such is all great for this type of film. The humorous moments are from John C Reily, who gives a fun role in the adventure. Another problem though was the lack of character development, they don't seem to expand themselves fully but then again it's primary focus is on the monsters and the mythology they come from.The soundtrack, both the music score by the great Henry Jackman and the 70's themed songs from the era are all amazing. Unlike Suicide Squad, the music is used when it's needed and its not heavily frequent.Kong: Skull Island has all the right tones to make it fun, action packed and feel like a summer blockbuster type (much like Pacific Rim). Despite the lack of character development and a plot that isn't original, it makes up for it greatly with the amount of monster action and scale of the adventure on offer. Hail, King Kong! 4/5 - Nick A team of explorers and soldiers travel to an uncharted island in the Pacific, unaware that they are crossing into the domain of monsters, including the mythic Kong."" The movie starts off rather quickly and you really do believe you are in the 70's. The movie captures the whole ""good old days"" feel. It never takes too long for each scene to get to the point.Within the first 20 mins you see Kong. So the good news is that this isn't another Godzilla remake where you see Godzilla for the finale 15 mins. This is Kong's Movie and you see him in action plenty throughout. Smashing helicopters, fighting with the creatures of the island etc, he's totally badass. The CGI of Kong and the creatures are quite good as well. There were times where you knew the actors were in front of a green screen, and it's so obvious in parts.The biggest problem with this film is that there is absolutely no character development or explanation what so ever. The acting was actually the weakest part of the whole film. The only 2 good actors were Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly. Reilly probably had more character development than anyone else in the entire film, and Reilly really plays his part so well. He made a stupid character so memorable and great. Jackson did well with his part as well, playing the badass soldier and stops at nothing until the job is done.All in all it's a 50/50 type film. It has good elements and bad elements. If it weren't for Kong himself the film would have flopped big time. P.S. Watch until after the credits.

""Kong Skull Island"" takes place in 1973 with a diverse group of military troops, and civilians exploring an uncharted island.

It doesn't take long for the group to run into the film's real ""superstar"" the mighty Kong, and from there things begin to go south in a hurry for them.The action is very good, as a matter of fact that is why the audience bought tickets to see this thing...to watch monsters battle it out on the big screen, and to its credit this movie does not disappoint, and really delivers the goods. The acting is what you would expect from a popcorn movie, who's main character is a massive CGI Ape...fairly wooden...except for John C. Reilly, who plays a World War 2 soldier who has been one of the island's denizens, after getting shot down during a ""dogfight"" with a Japanese Soldier. The guy steals every scene he is in.

This is exactly the type of movie that takes me back to my childhood, when Godzilla and King Kong were the undisputed ""King of the Monsters"". It looks like round 2 is coming soon, and I for one can't wait.Kong Skull Island is PG 13 mostly for CGI violence, and some pretty strong language throughout, including one ""F"" bomb.

A simple, direct and clear message. No remakes or sequels required. This is why all sequels and remakes are always inferior in impact to the original. Filmmakers always want to add anything new and unnecessary. In this new film, Kong leaves the territory of quality and embarks on a trip to the territory of blockbusters, in other words, special effects and jokes (just watch the retarded and unnecessary joke scene about the Skullcrawlers name with Hiddleston, Larson and John C. Reilly) overlap the story, and so the film is passable and totally forgettable in a week.Once again, Hollywood treats scientists as idiots when the character of Corey Hawkins can not even open a can of canned food and feels intimidated by a woman. Not to mention the macho colonel, who wants an unnecessary revenge with Kong, because Kong killed his men (in a casual meeting).And not to mention the idiotic plans that Jordan Vogt-Roberts uses to focus the eyes of the Samuel L. Jackson character with the eyes of King Kong. It seems like the director Jordan Vogt-Roberts wants to make a kind of (unnecessary) fight in the old west style. Pure waste of time, as we know that the macho colonel, is no challenge for Kong, so why waste precious screen time with these situations? Because Kong's story can be told as in the original in just 90 or 100 minutes. And the filmmarkers have to put 2 hours of film and for this they have to put unnecessary situations and scenes. As the disposable soldier of the colonel, who gets lost from the group, just to see Kong crush a giant squid (and then Kong eats it), then after some scenes, be killed by another giant monster. What could be an interesting conflict between the characters of Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson, but that ends up in nothing. Because people are written from a stupid one-dimensional way (like the stupid macho colonel). That is, more movie time, for less story. This is because Kong never leaves the island in this movie, Kong will only leave the island in 2020 in the movie Godzilla vs. King Kong. Yes this movie aims to create another shared universe (MCU type of crap), and in the end this compromises the quality of this film. The filmmakers have their hands tied, because they can not put their best on this film, however they have to think how this movie will work with another movie from another guy, three long years into the future.I went into the movie hoping to see a good and fun Kong movie, and I ended up seeing a crap and bad one, because of the ambition of the studio that compromised the quality of the movie, for the money. Not to mention, even as a fun movie, this movie fails so much. You see, the scenes with special effects, you can see that the scenes were all filmed on a green screen. And the final fight between Kong and the giant lizard is even inferior to the T-rex fights in Peter Jackson's 2005 remake. Yes, the fights and clashes between Kong and the other giants monsters were better, bigger, more epic, more brutal and vicarious than in this pathetic 2017 movie. I'm not defending the Peter Jackson movie, that film obviously had its flaws, but in the department of special effects and action scenes (this department that does not save a movie, nonetheless) is vastly superior to this Jordan Vogt- Roberts movie. Even as an action movie and blockbuster, this movie fails in a big way.But if you were disappointed, and if you were sad that you had lost money unfairly, you can wait until 2020 to see the rest of the film in Godzilla VS King Kong.My God, that's why commercial filmmaking is in the mud. The commercial cinema has as main target children, teenagers and young people. And this is why the quality bar is so low.","183 out of 394 found this helpful."

There have been many different sequels, reboots,etc about King Kong over the years.Now it´s time for Warner Brothers to add a new version to the catalogue.
Let´s start with the script, it´s decent, it works, but it´s clear that the goal it´s not to tell a compelling story, the director is more interested in the big action sequences and the entertainnment value involving the creatures, actually those action scenes are impressive, exciting, well directed and the visual effects very well done.
The cast is good mainly Samuel L.Jackson and John C.Reilly, Tom Hiddelston and Brie Larson were decent, the rest of the cast is fine.The secondary characters don´t do anything and they´re not particulary necessary for the movie.
The visual effects as a said are very good, the creatures look real, Kong looks very expressive. The cinematography also worths a nod, there are magnificent large open exterior plans of the island,the nature,the sunset and others involving saturated orange and blue colors.
Kong Skull Island doesn´t have the best of the scripts, or does it have developed characters.However it has good directing, visual effects, action sequences and cinematography.It´s a big monster movie, and is made simply to entertain.6.7/10","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

And don't get me started on the so called serious critics.All in all, it has made for an now outdated and no longer valid system which should be folded up and incinerated since no one really would be able to fix or correct it. The Rating System, where people rate a film on its merit and its merit alone, is dead.This film for example was AMAZINGLY ENJOYABLE. No, it wasn't as noteworthy as Citizen Kane or The Birth of a Nation, but COME the HOLY FRICK ON. Are you really SUCH a dufus that you are sitting down to watch something like this expecting it to be? The same people who expect that, are the ones that go to a drive-thru expecting to buy steak on the 99-cent menu. Fools. The problem with today's society is, that there are too many of these fools, and that these fools choose to first fool themselves into thinking they aren't fools.For those of you who are not crying in their pants and are still reading (you are maybe a non-fool), go watch this movie. You can tell, from the very first scene, that the people involved in making it took the time to try and bring you (us) a quality product. For the most part, IMO, they succeeded. It is HIGHLY entertaining, the characters are interesting and mostly well-acted, there is humor, anger, the CG is fantastic ... Yes, I agree that Samuel Jackson is pretty played out and when they put him in the game, you always get the same character more or less, but even he can't detract much from KONG, who is after all, the star.Do yourself a favor. Spring for the cost of a ticket or two, take your best friend or lover and go SEE it for yourself. Unless you are hurting for $18, and you are normal, you probably won't come back cry- babying due to lost time or lost money like some of these 'raters' are doing. (Like I really believe the ones complaining actually paid to see it and saw it on the big screen as opposed to their laptop screens). You'll have a great time.","42 out of 72 found this helpful."

A crew is sent on an expedition to survey the area for resources, but the real reason is to find proof of King Kong. Typically with the US movies we see a love story ensue with the blond and the beast as well as some money making side show. That is for the most part disregarded and instead we get a good monster fighting movie. The action was great and well shot especially during the last 20 minutes or so. That period of time really sold the movie for me. Prior to that point I was on the fence if I was really liking what I was seeing. Kong was once again the sympathetic beast audiences can root for and will continue to root for if this whole planned monster Universe goes as planned (fingers crossed). The other characters are not fully fleshed out but that is excusable since the great monster movies do not need character development. The character that was talked about the most was the comic relief and he had a great story and well timed jokes. There was certainly never a dull moment watching this as monsters just kept coming and the crew just had to survive. Speaking of the characters, Hiddleston and Larson had their moments as well. There wasn't much but there was enough to get attached to them. They had kind of a... well I don't what you call it but they reminded me a lot of Nathan Drake and Elena from Uncharted. If you don't play video games then look them up as that relationship is the best example I could give.The Bad:The big thing that annoyed me was the overly clichéd character of Samuel L Jackson I am not going to say anything about the direction his character takes but it was dumb and has been done better. Some of the action...no wait just the scene when they arrived on the helicopters yes that one. That went on too long to remain enjoyable if they cut that sequence by half I would have enjoyed it a whole lot more. ConclusionThis was a very good monster movie.I am semi excited what the next one will be given the movies success. I would recommend this if you liked the Toho movies as I believe they helped a little in making this movie. If you just like giant monsters fighting then you can't go wrong with this movie.","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

There's the girl from ""Room,"" looking lost as a photographer. There's Nucky Thompson's brother, as a faux Vietnam soldier. There's a Chinese actress, who may be the worst case ever of being a token character there to only appease Chinese audiences.As for the action, maybe I've become jaded with the prevalence of CGI, but... a gigantic gorilla fighting helicopters and skull-monsters should be exciting... but it barely elicits a reaction.John C.

It's just one Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism (MUTO) after another and who doesn't love that? At a deeper level it offers something of a sly undermining of the war movie genre. The Apocalypse Now references are everywhere and while I certainly wouldn't put it on the same level as that masterpiece in its own way it offers a subtle critique of the military industrial complex (watch for one particular act of heroic sacrificial machismo that hopelessly backfires).The Samuel Jackson character plays Captain Ahab to Kong's Moby Dick driven by his own ego need to destroy the creature even at the risk of his crew and ultimately meeting the same fate as Ahab. When he declares that Kong will learn that 'man is king' you know that such homo sapien hubris is going to get what's coming to it (another theme that runs through the film). The original King Kong (1933) is one of my top five films of all time and in my view the perfect adventure movie Unlike many, I liked Peter Jackson's 2001 remake, but Skull Island almost betters it. It's less bloated for one thing and it has more heart, more humour, and better CGI.As in all the Kong films (none has yet improved on the original) there is the theme of rapport between the human and the simian but this time it doesn't have the erotic overtones of earlier outings where the blonde becomes a sexual fetish, the 'beauty that killed the beast.' This time its two humans who establish emotional contact with Kong with Brie Larson and Tom Hiddlestone being great in their respective roles of anti-war photographer and soldier of fortune. John C. Riley's WWII survivor offers a great comedic performance and I found the little vignette on his character at the end quite affecting.The setting in Nixon-era America is perfect and the song selections are spot on (Creedence, The Stooges, Black Sabbath, Jefferson Airplane etc.) Wait till the end of the credits for a sequel teaser. I'm not ashamed to own this self-mocking giant ape movie as a guilty pleasure.","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

They recruit a former British special ops James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) as a guide and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) for the expedition.Lt Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and his team of soldiers are the military escort. Packard is upset with the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam leading what the fighting was for and what to do afterwards. This mission gives him purpose but as they arrive in their helicopters to Skull Island and start dropping bombs as part of scientific tests, they are attacked by the giant Kong who destroys the choppers and kills most of the men. Packard wants vengeance against Kong.Meanwhile Conrad and Weaver discover Hank Marlow (John C Reilly) a soldier from World War 2 who crash landed and resides with the natives in the island. Marlow explains that Kong is regarded as a god by the natives and he is their protector as the island has other monsters especially those underground that only Kong can take on.Kong: Skull Island neatly reworks elements of the King Kong story. We have the helicopter attack at the early part of the story leading to Packard becoming a sworn enemy of Kong. Of course Packard is crazy whose motivations are nonsense. It was he and his men who have invaded Kong's turf and started bombing it which has awaken the underground monsters. You get some mumbo jumbo about superiority of men while they are being killed by giant spiders and lizard creatures.It is an entertaining action adventure with a ludicrous story. At least you root for Kong and he does keep the story going. The special effects are very good and you gets all sorts of nasty creatures in the island which again is a call back to the original King Kong.The film really is unsure what to do with some of the leads. Larson is only there to be the tentative love interest to Hiddleston and bring out Kong's tender side. At least she fares better than the Chinese actress Tian Jing who as the other female is there just to keep the Chinese co-producers happy, she certainly has little to do in this film. Even Hiddleston's action man role is curtailed somewhat.","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

Kong looks great, he looks real, the skull crawlers were good and the giant buffalo. The story was pretty basic. Investors hire army guys to go to a hidden island for research but in reality it is to prove the existence of monsters. They anger Kong, so he kills some of the men and commander wants revenge. Some of the others realize Kong is of importance to the island after meeting a long lost WWII soldier. So you have the final battle between evil commander, good guys and Kong and of course the evilest beast on the island thrown in.FINAL VERDICT: Lots of cool special effects. It's eye candy, so IMO worth watching.","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

Every journey and action scene could have still been scripted by having the characters face issues such as problems navigating the island, injury to members of the party, other challenges that made it difficult for the two separate groups to reconnect.Some thoughtful ingenuity when writing the scripts in these movies can make a huge difference. But they always revert to humanizing the cast by good, evil, indifferent, and build their whole story-lines around that concept.What a shame. It would have received an extra 2 or maybe 3 stars from me if not for the typical Hollywood formula.","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

What helps set it apart from forgettable/mediocre monster flicks like 2014's ""Godzilla"" is its large and highly entertaining cast of talented A-listers that include Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, the reuniting of ""Straight Outta Compton's"" Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell, and the box office King himself, Kong.The standout is John C. Reilly whose introduction breathes new energy into the movie just as things were about to turn dull. His character provides plenty of comic relief, interesting exposition, and a surprise emotional moment. Samuel L. Jackson almost steals the show as a vengeful, trigger-happy and profane army officer who has the only logically-sound motives. Also John Goodman and Corey Hawkins play scientists out to prove the existence of Kong and monsters. Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston have an interesting scene together in the beginning of the film but after that are kinda wasted with no real development. I had trouble remembering their names by the time the end credits rolled, but their charisma and sublime hair were enough to compensate. Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham provided some nice banter that helped put a face on the faceless soldiers. Then there is the real star: Kong! The monster battles were visually delightful as well as inventively awesome -- like when Kong uses a propeller as a morning star. Shout out to the writers for not wasting everyone's time with a rehashed romance between Kong and the blonde damsel in distress. We had enough of that in Peter Jackson's interpretation.In conclusion, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is an entertaining ride from start to finish that will thrill/entertain/amuse those willing to turn their brains off.","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

As the movie opens, we are told it's ""South Pacific, 1943"", and a US pilot and Japanese pilot crash land on a beach, and while they are fighting each other, Kong appears out of the blue. Cue forward and now we are ""1973"" (as we see Nixon announce the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam). Bill Randa is able to get a US Senator to approve a 'mapping mission' of an unchartered island somewhere in the South Pacific. After some quick preparations, including getting a military escort, off we go to that mysterious island... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest reboot of the King Kong franchise, more than a decade since the last one (by Peter Jackson). This time, Kong is bigger and better and 'badder' than ever before, and with lots of other monsters on the island, much to our viewing pleasure. The movie has a distinct ""Apocalypse Now"" vibe going in the first part, even more so as the herd of helicopters approaches the island and is met by Kong. Once the action shifts to the island, there is a distinct ""Jurassic Park"" vibe to it. We all know fully well that there is a lot of CGI in the movie, yet it never bothered me, and in fact I'll see that the movie feels very authentic from that perspective. The support cast is okay, with John C. Reilly (as the stranded US pilot now 30 years later) absolutely stealing the show (sorry John Goodman, Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston, et al.). There is a terrific score to the movie, courtesy of veteran composer Henry Jackman, and there are also a ton of song placements (Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"", CCR's ""Run Through the Jungle"", etc.). BEWARE: this movie is rated PG-13 for a reason, as there are some frightening scenes that I believe are inappropriate for kids under the age of 10 or thereabouts.""Kong: Skull Island"" opened wide this past weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was sold out to the very last seat. The audience LOVED this movie, and gave it an applause when the end titles started rolling. ""Kong: Skull Island"" is nothing short of a rounding and fun reboot of the Kong franchise. I can't wait to see the next installment (reportedly due for 2019). ""Kong: Skull Island"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","19 out of 30 found this helpful."

Yes! It's my country-Vietnam which on-screen in 70% of the film duration with the magnificent view from Ha Long bay, Ninh Binh & Quang Binh. During the 1 month countdown to the premiere, the present and advertising hit the mass media in my country so hard that almost everyday. I actually pay attention to this movie about 2 years ago when it only a 2017 title on IMDb , before the whole Hollywood crews start filming The movie take the audience back to the 1973 in the withdraw of US Army from the Vietnam war. The start look promising, the battle between the Sky Devils fleet and Kong definitely get you edge of your seat( strongly recommend the Dolby Atmos sound and 2D only for better experience-just my opinion). The film then catch-up with gripping, fast-paced and appear to be little low on plot. The iconic Kong of all time now is the king of skull island and look great than ever. The giant buffalo and the view of endless field, the village & the splendid beauty of Ha Long gain my respect more than ever. The fight in the dead valley is quite cinematic and heroic with Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson came to the crash-site with full of revenge and would do anything just to take out Kong. I understand the whole fleet lost put him to this point but really deep in his mind is a soldier cant leave the war. There many funny dialogue between Marlow & Brooks, Mills and Cole (the impressive one with the AK47) which made the audience laughing over and over. The final fight is so impressive and full of tension, Kong vs the big one Skull Crawler. Kong Skull Island is a highly recommend movie for everyone with just some negative argument for the plot and the character development. On the other hand the movie is great, well direct by Jordan Vogt- Roberts with the A-line cast, outstanding graphics, awesome Kong and open up the Monster universe in the after credit. The director announce with the public to came living in Ho Chi Minh city because he love Vietnam and want to make more great movies here-that gains another respect from me. In the end, the movie will bring all the goods, beauty of Vietnam nature to the world.","9 out of 18 found this helpful."

Not only a hugely entertaining monster movie, but a well-directed, well-written and well-acted film full of ideas from start to finish. Its action set- pieces are utterly spectacular, the CGI is fantastic, and there's even a story that's genuinely interesting throughout, something that I definitely didn't expect going in.But by far the greatest achievement of this film is the presence of Kong himself. As plain as most of the film was, the biggest issue with Godzilla was that there just wasn't enough Godzilla. Fortunately, Skull Island rectifies that exact problem, and makes Kong as big a character in the film as any of the humans, appearing on screen at regular intervals, and actually playing a genuine role in the story.And that story is probably the thing that surprised me most of all. Again, Godzilla was a slow, empty and formulaic monster movie that really bored me. Kong: Skull Island, on the other hand, is a fast- paced and absolutely jam-packed action movie that actually gets better and better as it moves along.Of course, there's a part of me that's a little sad that we're not getting the classic story of King Kong that made both the 1933 and 2005 films so beautiful. However, Skull Island does do a fantastic job at bringing the character to a different time period and making a new, riveting story.Above all, the film's ingenious parallels with the Vietnam War make for fascinating viewing. Bringing a different dynamic to the relationship between the humans and Kong, the way that Skull Island looks at the story through the lens of the anti-Vietnam War sentiment of the 1970s adds an impressive layer of depth to the story, keeping Kong an interesting and emotionally resonant character despite removing his love with Ann Darrow.What's more is that some of the film's characters have some very layered and interesting backstories. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson's character, a stubborn, war-mongering colonel taken from the Vietnam War he loved fighting in, is hugely interesting to watch. At times mimicking the role of film director Carl Denham from the original, at others adding a far darker and more serious edge to the story of the invasion of Skull Island, he's absolutely fascinating to follow from start to finish.There are a whole host of other characters that bring some impressive depth to the story, depth that I certainly didn't expect after the two-dimensional heroes of Godzilla, and make the film's large ensemble cast work amazingly well.One more positive from the film is undoubtedly the action. As I said, this is a very exciting monster movie that's full of action throughout. Above all, the opening and closing action sequences really stand out. Both because of the amazing visual parallels drawn with Vietnam War films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, but also thanks to the stunning CGI that allows Kong to tower over the screen in comparison to the humans, but also puts a formidable and genuinely terrifying enemy on a very level playing field.As far as blockbusters go, Skull Island is top-quality, but it still isn't entirely perfect. For one, whilst it's brimmed with ideas and interesting characters throughout, that does lead the film to becoming a little crowded at times. The lack of a main character amidst the huge ensemble cast means it's definitely not as streamlined as I would have liked.Also, the parallels with Vietnam, whilst unique and great to see in a movie like this, are a little overbearing at times. Particularly in the first act, there comes a point where the film really hits you over the head with how similar it is to Apocalypse Now, and although that does die down to a better level later on, it's a little frustrating at times.Simply put, Skull Island is an impressively brainy and innovative blockbuster, but it goes a little too far with everything it does. That's far better than a completely empty film like Godzilla, but with an enormous main cast and a story that's so jam-packed, I felt like things could have been carried out a little smoother than the finished product.Still, I had a really good time with Kong: Skull Island. It's a massively entertaining monster movie that places its title character right in the thick of the action, surrounded by more interesting human characters, excellent visuals, stunning action sequences, and a genuinely engrossing and intelligent original story.","151 out of 296 found this helpful."

The actor that I liked a lot is John C. Reilly, like crazy, with sanity, that has been more than 30 years in the island next to the natives. John Goodman is the one presenting the plan to the government to investigate the island. The strange thing about all this is that he knew there were strange things on the island. Why did he try so hard for many people to die? And Samuel L. Jackson seemed like the typical villain of the movie that wants to kill the monkey, a villain that works well.And here come the bad things ...

The actors make jokes that are hilariously funny. Then they run away and ambush and attack Jurassic style. Then they go somewhere and there are a lot of explosions. The enemies are ugly, and they also fight each other, so it's OK to kill them. After two hours the film ends. The film is marketed to kiddies, kiddies-in-brain and China (via the token Chinese eye candy or in this case plain vanilla useless whatever..)Did you hear? Kong called his agent in New York City, USA at the Empire State Building to ask his images be erased from this turkey and demand that his agent get him better work going forward. The agent wouldn't take his call however. How could he? He didn't recognize the caller. That isn't King Kong after all.","130 out of 303 found this helpful."

The latter is a bit of a disappointment – the monster element is fine, its height used to great advantage and the huge vistas of mayhem and destruction is a young kid's wet dream. However, I couldn't wrap my head around the heavy-handed and joyless storytelling. The human component felt neglected; they barely registered a presence beyond the crazy one, the screaming one, the gung-ho one, the running one, the brooding scientist whom no one bothers with but still keeps around for some alternative voice. I find all the big-name actors very cardboard-y and lifeless. It also didn't help that the story is so fatiguing with so much overbearing self-importance. Fast-forward to 2017's Kong, I would love to say the filmmakers have learned from their predecessor, but in all honesty I can't. However, Kong is a lot more entertaining than Godzilla and for a B-grade movie it embraces its shortcomings with finesse. This is a blast!Kong has the right blend of silly humour and all-out monster action. Yes, the human characters still feel hollow, the exposition can be clunky and the story is unoriginal and riffs off Francis Ford Coppola's sublime Apocalypse Now, but it is plain dumb to expect the ensemble cast and screenplay to hold up during award season. What this is is a good ole pulsating monster mash of fun. There is a wee bit pressing of genre refresh button in that Kong doesn't fall for a white woman which will lead to his downfall and the sandbox playground is no longer a skyscraper city but Kong's Eden home ground, which is home to a multitude of humongous creatures. It is getting increasingly tiresome to see another city getting devastated, so it is refreshing to see a straight-up survival movie on an island where the human beings aren't on top of the food chain. The star is definitely the lonely God, Kong and the rest of crazy inhabitants of Skull Island. The visual and sound effects are stellar, and most importantly, the action doesn't feel repetitive. Each time Kong goes mano a mano against another monster, there isn't that dreaded been-there-done-that feeling. My fave is definitely Kong having an octopus sashimi for lunch; definitely won't be forgetting that for a while, especially when I am chewing on a tangy squid or octopus.The impressive ensemble cast plays second fiddle to Kong and his monster ""friends"", and they seldom rise up beyond a distinctive character trait. Tom Hiddleston as John Conrad has to be some kind of convenient homage to Joseph Conrad whose Heart of Darkness is obviously an inspiration. Brie Larson, after her award-winning turn in Room, shows off different levels of seriousness. Samuel L. Jackson almost had time to utter his famous muthafcuking line. John Goodman plays a corporation type with affable charm. John C. Reilly obviously had the most fun playing a WWII pilot marooned on Skull Island for decades. Then we get a myriad of soldiers playing fodder and meals for the inhabitants of the island. This being a partially financed movie by China, we also get a completely disposal China actress doing ""I don't know what"". Sure, the complete cast doesn't get much of a chance to shine, but they are definitely colourful and not bogged down by an overly important story.Remember to hang back for a post-credit sequence that entices a neat future prospect. After that you can stand up and beat your chest with animalistic confidence and shout ""All hail the King!""","6 out of 12 found this helpful."

First of all: this is for all intents and purposes just a flashy, very long trailer... Neat camera tricks, cheesy lines, explosions, you name it! Secondly: during the pitch meeting of this ""concept"" (at best) they probably said: we need ""a handsome mysterious type"" (cue: Hiddlestone), ""a busty blonde who doesn't really need to be there"" (cue: Larson), a crazy bearded goofy guy with morals (cue: Reilly) and an angry Samuel L.

It scares, it excites, it occasionally cajoles a laugh or two; it also frustrates and bewilders. Through it all it stays true to the original 1976 version, or at least true-ish enough to its surface level spirit. Wait, you're telling me there was a 1933 version that wasn't as unabashedly splashy? Say it ain't so! Set in 1973, Kong tells the desperate story of a group of scientists, soldiers and inter-governmental flunkies trying to survive a few days on the film's titular island. Initially lined-up as a geology expedition, Lieutenant, Preston Packard (Jackson), Tracker, James Conrad (Hiddleston) and Photographer, Mason Weaver (Larson) lead a pack of expendables through thick vegetation loaded with freakish monsters, defiant locals and John C. Reilly. They of course have plenty of run-ins with the island's solitary king, painting a picture of the giant ape as both a gentle giant and a force to be reckoned with.Here's the thing about seeing something like this on the big screen...again: We already know there's only so much you can do with a creature like Kong. Taken to the absolute basics, we know the structure of the film is going to be a row of dwindling meat sacks being picked off one-by-one while Kong stops the show to kick some butt and then retreat into the forest to lick his wounds. Admittedly, Skull Island does a better job than most, dressing up what amounts to a final destination gambling pool. But considering the piddly character arcs doled out in this film, we never get as invested in them as we should.The slow-burning, Peter Jackson King Kong (2005) compensated by turning Kong into an actual living, breathing character. The stop-motion work of Andy Serkis combined with Naomi Watts' Watt-ness, gave the giant ape a child-like innocence that audiences at the time found endearing. This version on the other hand turns Kong into a gritty, unforgiving force of nature motivated by ferocious anger and primordial fear. Thus what we have is a movie that intuitively lacks investment, shoots itself in the foot when it comes to the monster, and leans a bit too heavily on its Vietnam War allegory to carry the day.So Skull Island basically amounts to being a pit stop on yet another tent pole extended universe. It's awash in intricate world-building detail and inner-movie lore that will no doubt be erased or re-framed as the new installment comes clomping in. Whether you like it or not, you basically running a marathon now.","4 out of 7 found this helpful."

Little did they know that they are trespassing into the territory of the Kong, the King of Skull Island. Also, the island is filled with many mythical creatures, hidden from the rest of the world. Now, the team must fight to escape the wrath of these creatures. The movie is directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, known for 'The Kings of Summer', and starring a stunning cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson and John C. Reilly. The special effects team is the one to give credit for the success of the film. The movie starts with a bang and ends with a bang. Everyone of the action sequence, whether it be the introduction scene of Kong or the final fight between Kong and 'Skull Crawler', are so created so well that it develops, and maintains the thrill throughout the movie. The film is well paced. Character build up is concise as we were not there to know about a bunch of soldiers or scientists were we? We went to the theaters to watch the Kong, the mighty monster. We wanted him to throw things, to smash something, to kill and that is what the movie makers understood while making the film. They introduced Kong early and gave him ample extent of screen time. I saw many from the audience screaming in enthusiasm every time Kong appeared on screen. I guess the character has gained a decent amount of fan following. There were a lot many scenes involving different mythical monsters which added to the excitement.Apart from the constant edge of the seat action, two other things which I liked were the location and the soundtrack. The film is set in the era of 1970s, right after the Vietnam War. So, its soundtrack gave a feel of the 70s with songs by David Bowie, Iggy Pop etc. If we talk about acting, well, there was not much need of special efforts to be put in this department. If I have to mention someone I would say that I really like the character Hank Marlow, played by John C. Reilly. He was responsible of providing half the humor the movie has. All the other just added to the star value of the film. I can confidently say that the film fits into the pattern of a well- executed monster movie. Compared to the one which came in 2005, this one definitely has much more to offer, but I still can't choose if you ask me which one is better. But what I can tell you is that this one is going to be a part of something bigger, so make sure you watch this, and the 2014 Godzilla movie. Legendary films have recruited writers to create a monster universe (A Mosterverse!) including Godzilla and King Kong, how cool is that right!","5 out of 10 found this helpful."

I loved Godzilla and I think I loved this one even more.Everyone says that the movie is bad because most characters are one-dimensional and you don't care about them. That's true. But look, why would you want to know all of the human characters backstories and feelings when you're watching a freaking monster movie? People today are forgetting how to enjoy movies. Not everything should be watched by the same standards. It's kinda like criticizing Moonlight for not being funny and you decided to watch it as a comedy. Think about it, there's really not much difference. Unfortunately, it's starting to look like every movie today is being criticized for not being funny, but whatever. The characters might have been bland, but that doesn't make the movie any less intense. And trust me, it's INTENSE. There are quite a few scenes that will make you anxious especially if you're afraid of bugs or lizards. It's also surprisingly very gory for a PG-13 movie. I was very pleasantly surprised. It's not the PG- 13 ""violence"" that you see in movies all the time lately. This movie is shockingly brutal and one of those that push the PG-13 rating to the limits. And Kong. Wow. Kong has never been this bada$$. Seriously, he's so freaking cool and the design of other monsters is quite good.All in all, when I put it all together, I suggest that you turn your brain off and let yourself be entertained.

Enter the cinema very excited about this movie and I must admit that I love King Kong.But not every movie is free from sin. What I do not like is the fact of the not-so-special script and the not-so-good performances from two great actors who wait a lot more, Jackson and Goodman. Their names are supposed to mean ""incredible scenes of script and pure acting"" but I think this was not their case with Skull Island, because of these errors, sometimes the film became too predictable and even childish at certain times , But even so, if you want entertainment, this is just right.A deserved 7 for Kong.","3 out of 5 found this helpful."

But it's been over a decade since he was last brought to life, and although 2005s King Kong did go to the island it didn't explore it the way we would have liked, it had the plot to find Kong and capture him to show him to the world and then he raided New York, you know it. In Kong: Skull Island we explore the inner reaches of the island, and are constantly threatened by the giant beast, for which Samuel L. Jackson's war-hammered soldier here asks ""How big is it? How fast is it? And what it do?"" Of course how big he is and how he is, is obvious to those who are familiar with the monster, his speeds vary through different films. Yet with the advantages of CGI only coming in before 2005s version he went as fast as the computer would take him, although in that version he was played by Andy Serkis in motion capture. Here he's only seen in CGI visuals roaring from sound effects, and looking more dazzlingly like an ape than ever. His facial features looking more real, and his height even more terrifying here he's about the size of other monsters beside him.This is the second film in Legendary Entertainment's MonsterVerse series; the first was 2014s Godzilla directed by Gareth Edwards, who thanks to his special effects team made the beast look more real than it ever did, but also gave him extra height, it's too hard to imagine how big they'll in their next fight. Although now Kong is noticeably smaller (at around 104 meters) but he's still growing as the film tells us but he can still pack one hell of a punch when he needs to. Were as Godzilla is full sized, he probably has the advantage over the giant ape but we won't know until the next film Godzilla: The King of Monsters comes out. But for now Kong: Skull Island makes its debut reigning supreme on his home turf, where it's dangerous by day but even more dangerous by night, as a lot of the island's inhabitants are there to kill its human invaders. Some more terrifying than others.Next to Kong, on the island there are some horrific looking beasts with nasty teeth, really quite dinosaur looking, some can fly, some have horns and giant some are creepy crawlers, as the humans soon find out. However they don't help Kong, he isn't the most dangerous, and he's the protector of the island's native human inhabitants. There is something trying to kill him, in addition there is emotional heft to this story, too when it explains that Kong is the last of his kind proving to Jackson's hardened soldier that animals, even giant ones have feelings too, and he has the feeling of anger when the unwanted guests try to destroy his home, there is a gorgeous shot of the primate's fist colliding with the helicopters that he's scared of. Of course he has to be scared of something.On land, the human invaders recover from the attack here Jackson angrier than ever, decides that Kong is the threat and wants to fight against him, but others try to get him change his mind about the war. The group of men and women include: Tom Huddleston's hardened tracker James Conrad, who hired by Bill Randa (Goodman) explores the island in search for evidence as to why evolution comes to an end, he lists the ways they are going to die on an uncharted island leaving one specific note (the giant monsters). Brie Larson's anti-war photographer Mason Weaver she takes an immediate liking to Kong and wonders why the other creatures want to kill him, and end the human territories on the island. Later, they meet with Hank Marlow (Reilly), a World War II soldier who's been stranded on the island since 1944 he steals the show from the rest of the players. Unfortunately he's the only one with character in the film, the rest of the characters are bland, even a talented actor like Hiddleston is wasted here. Sure he makes a decent impact with his bad-ass moments in a bar fight and sword swinging through dinosaur birds but it's not much.This is perhaps the main flaw of the film, granted it looks gorgeous but the characters are dreary with a non-characterizing screenplay, yes there are flaws but there goodness here, too, the action is stunning it's the monsters that have the bigger impact, or in Kong's case has the bigger punch. When goes to punch helicopter of the sky it looks gorgeous as he's surrounded by smoke and fire. In the third act the action hits its peak, when he has to fight a giant creature that matches him to save the humans. Despite the horrendous flaws, like the bland screenplay Kong: Skull Island is a jaunty film with goodness and although it's not the best monster film it's still enjoyable, let's see how far he'll go in the future.VERDICT: King Kong is alive again! Only just, in this derivative, dumb but consistently fun latest addition to the MonsterVerse series. It's just about over the line of Godzilla's strength, but not by much.","4 out of 8 found this helpful."

Although I do believe Peter Jackson's King Kong is one of the few great remakes that have been made, a part of me always wished they would just skip the first hour on the boat and spend the rest of the movie exploring Kong's world called Skull Island. Rising director Jordan Vogt-Roberts definitely delivers on that. He presents an ecosystem of giant creatures that stands apart visually from other monster movies like Jurassic Park. And it shows Kong less as a misunderstood monster but more as protective figure in this new mythology.When the director described this new King Kong as a god he really wasn't under-selling it. Kong has never been more intimidated and powerful then ever. He is re-imagined to be more then just an animal and monster but as this powerful force of nature that is both ferocious and benevolent. He felt like a combination of the Marvel's Hulk and Planet of the Apes's Caesar. By removing the beauty and the beast story, Kong is explored more as a character with almost sentient qualities and we see what his existence is like on the island. His best moments range from him taking out helicopters with his fists during his big reveal to when he is just sitting around and killing time with stunning visual effects that rival what was done in the 2005 remake. And the island itself is presented as a character with always having unique ways to reveal the other creatures that hide within Kong's kingdom in suspenseful and surprising ways. The creatures are both beautiful and scary as they feel like they're one with the landscapes. I could watch a whole nature documentary on this fictional world. The most terrifying out of all of them are the Skullcrawlers. If Kong is a god then the Skullcrawlers are the island's demons. They felt like a combination of the creatures from Jurassic Park, Aliens and Bong Joon Ho's The Host. They really made up this great threat to both the humans and the island in new and surprising ways.Jordan Vogt-Roberts uses a fresh way to show the action and visuals in this big-budget movie. While Gareth Edwards's visual style in Godzilla felt similar to Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan, Vogt-Roberts is closer to that of Zack Snyder, Edgar Wright and Guillermo Del Torro. The action and editing is very energetic and quick with warm vibrant, colour tones. When he shoots action you feel like you are suddenly thrown into the middle of it with amazing slow-motion shots to help you process the destruction and detail you are seeing. This movie has some of the most gorgeous cinematography I have seen in a monster film thanks to DP Larry Fong. The beautiful and exotic real-like locations give Skull Island an extra sense of depth and believability. The Vietnam locations like a Ninh Binh and Hao Long Bay make me believe they could actually hide 100-foot creatures. The monster fights are very brutal and feel very much like a Ray Harryhausen movie where there are long shots that stay on the titanic creatures brawling with each other. The final battle is unique enough to stand apart from the dinosaur fight in 2005 as it shows Kong's intelligence being used in battle in order to challenge the Skullcrawler's agile and nimble movements. The end of that fight makes breaking a T.Rex's jaw look tame by comparison.What unfortunately holds this movie back from being great is the human narrative. I wouldn't say it's terrible but there is nothing special either. The list of big-name actors injects some personality into it but what you get with most of the characters is just what's on the surface and nothing more. Tom Hiddleston is similar to Aaron-Taylor Johnson in Godzilla where he was just there as a plot device to get from point A to B. Sam Jackson's military leader is uniquely written and has justifiable reasons for wanting to kill Kong but still feels like other roles he has played before. Corey Hawkins and Jing Tian only really exist to setup universe building. Out of all the human characters John C. Reily was the only one I was truly invested in and felt like he matched the movie's stylized surreal tone. Got a kooky Tom Hanks Cast Away vibe from him. His crazy personality and backstory is what kept me going through the scenes without any monsters. His scenes of exposition could have been handled poorly but work when he is delivering them with some well-time jokes. Brie Larson's role in this is not going to measure up to her Oscar-winning Room performance but at least she isn't portrayed as a useless damsel like in most monster movies. I did also enjoy the dynamic between Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham surprisingly. In Godzilla, the movie felt subtle about giant monsters rising from the earth being served as a metaphor for our over-reliance on nuclear power and lack of control on nature. Skull Island's thematic messaging about military power invading native lands like Vietnam felt more forced and didn't leave as much of an impact on.Overall, I would say that Peter Jackson's remake has a stronger emotional story with more depth but Vogt-Roberts delivers a King Kong movie that is simple, and more unique. Similar to Pacific Rim, the humans serve more as a way for us to explore this world of giant monsters then be emotional centre piece. The movie knows when to inject fun, humour and energy when it needs to and doesn't become too reliant on these characters that can't carry the movie without having a giant monster on screen. I definitely look forward to seeing this new Kong take on Godzilla in 2019. Also I got child-like excitement when I saw the after-credits scene for Godzilla: King of the Monsters.","5 out of 11 found this helpful."

Special effects are dazzling- the scene where the mercenaries first encounter King Kong is mesmerizing, and the actors know what to expect from a film like this and go along, especially John Goodman.

Awesome visuals and music, good cast and OK story but the monster action in this movie was the BEST! Unlike Godzilla which takes like 1hr to be shown in the 2014 film, we get a look at Kong early on but also throughout the entire movie. In short, I loved it, my friends did as well. It might lack a bit of logic but to be honest, look at ANY action/adventure movie from Hollywood and you won't see any logic in it. So the people saying that in reviews in here are total hypocrites. People who enjoy movies like Fast and Furious would most likely like the movie.

If Kong didn't look good then this movie would fail on a lot of other factors I'll talk about later. Much like the 1933 version, Kong walks generally on his hind legs as to not be a traditional silverback gorilla or a ""giant monkey."" The titular character also THROWSDOWN. The fights with Kong are truly entertaining to watch and they are diffidently the selling points. Unfortunately, the ""Skull Crawlers"" do look exceedingly generic with no personality at all.
Next on sight is the human characters and they are not fun at all. The three main characters, Conrad, Packard and Mason, have just about nothing in common a nd little to do with each other. None of them grow as people or really learn a lesson. Packard descends into a type of madness but it's actually justified in a sense and that's really the only type of growth these characters see. John Goodman's character serves as exposition and exposition and really feels like a waste of talent. In fact, all of the talent is wasted in this movie. I will say John C. Reilly is fun to watch and delivers some emotional weight that I haven't seen from him before.
The set design and soundtrack is superb, however. A lot of the music is being played ""in movie"" and personally, that's a definite plus. The scenery is absolutely goregous and they use a lot what I'm going to call perspective art that I found really cool.
To sum it up, this movie has definite problems, but then Kong appears and it works out. 7/10","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

"","","A Wasted Opportunity That Offers Nothing New In Its Retelling Of The Legend of Kong","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3669603/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","24 March 2017","After bringing the ""King of Monsters"" back to cinematic life in 2014, Legendary Pictures turns its attention to another behemoth to further solidify its own cinematic universe of super-species but all of it doesn't amount to much in the end, for Kong: Skull Island offers nothing new in its retelling of the legend of the giant ape.Kong: Skull Island follows a team of scientists & soldiers who, just before the end of Vietnam War, secure the U.S. government funding for the expedition of an uncharted island in the South Pacific but when they reach there, they encounter a 100-foot tall bipedal ape who destroys their choppers and leaves them dispersed & stranded in the unmapped territory, thus turning the survey job into a survival race.Directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, the first act of Kong: Skull Island is its strongest, for the premise is expertly set up and the efficient handling of its ominous vibe & sense of foreboding evokes keen interest. But once all our characters are on the island and the main plot is set into motion, it loses momentum as Vogt-Roberts fails to juggle multiple subplots properly and is unsure whether to go for a lighthearted, fun-filled extravaganza or a serious & dark monster flick.Production design team imbues a sense of mystery & danger to the exotic place with its set pieces. Cinematography attempts to duplicate the haunting aura of Apocalypse Now with its radiant colour palette, skillful use of lighting & shadows but succeeds only in bits n pieces. Slow-mo camera-work is finely utilised during the first encounter with Kong but is ultimately overdone in the end. Editing is a mixed bag, VFX has its share of strengths & flaws while Henry Jackman's score is serviceable.Coming to the performances, Kong: Skull Island features a talented ensemble in Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman & John C. Reilly, with Terry Notary providing the motion capture work for the eponymous ape. Hiddleston is alright as the mercenary, Larson does nothing but take photographs & act surprised, Goodman is completely wasted in his role, Jackson plays himself while Reilly is mostly annoying, plus the excessive focus on his character was totally unwarranted.On an overall scale, Kong: Skull Island is just as mediocre an entry in Legendary's MonsterVerse as Godzilla but it does feature more monster mayhem, even if those brief battles never manage to be engrossing or emotionally fulfilling. Characterisation takes a backseat, its lame attempts at humour fall flat, most creative choices don't work out in the film's favour and, in addition to all that, there is pretty much nothing in it that we haven't seen before. Falling short on all scales, Kong: Skull Island is a wasted opportunity that neither understood its true potential nor looked up to see what was up for grabs.","5 out of 11 found this helpful."

The special effects and CGI's are clearly well done, way better than most of the movies in this same genre. The story isn't actually that bad, like some people wants to make us believe. It's easy to follow, nothing special, but I didn't expect anything else of a movie with this theme. My question is, why are people going to watch a movie like this if it's not their genre of movie?

After the 2014 redux of Godzilla was something of a tonal misstep, it's unsurprising to find this version of the King Kong legacy going all out blockbuster popcorner, and with that it succeeds - kinda.Plot is wafer thin, bunch of humans from various professions rock up at the uncharted Skull Island, each with differing levels of interest as to what might be there. Of which they quickly find out is a whole heap of trouble - big trouble!It's clear that the makers, fronted by director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, are trying to blend crowd pleasing mayhem with thoughtful observations of not only the period the pic is set (1973), but also of man's inherent propensity for stupidity. On the surface, the battles and creature feature carnage in general, are wholly entertaining, but it's sometimes just too ridiculous for its own good. Even worse is that it's shallow, with no real substance of note, particularly where the characters are concerned, rendering a very admirable cast as one note players in the gorilla maze.However, irritants aside, the pic is great fun, with enough excitement and quip based dialogue to make the time spent on Skull Island worthwhile. Be it man versus beasties and the alien terrain they traverse, a popcorn muncher it be. There's some sly humour within (Nixon going down), and the nods towards Coppola and Cameron et al are pleasing as punch. You may have to lower expectation levels to not let the problems it has drag you down, and for sure it's not hard to understand why a lot of folk hate it, but it's not a disaster, far from it.One does hope, though, that the next instalment in this series goes up another couple of notches, for Kong, Zilla and the other monster gods deserve it. 7/10","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

In fact, it would have worked better to explain an island that mysteriously has a completely different ecosystem than the rest of the world. And I have to say, a sequel to this would REALLY not need Kong at all, just a remake of Verne's The Lost World.There isn't much in the story that isn't spoiled by the trailer. And that's because that's the whole story. In it, Kong is just a big monkey. There are no subtle shots at Hollywood's system as in the original, nor much emotional charge. Half of the film is about the other animals on the island and a quarter about how crazy Sam Jackson's characters can get, so it's not even a movie in which Kong has a leading role. It would have been braver and more sincere to just kill the big ape in the first minutes and then get on with their alien explosions movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

How about Independence Day Resurgence (which they did not want to call Resurrection because there were so many of those!)?The well-known Hollywood problem of greed and avarice reappears when they have, absolutely cliché-ridden have, to insert a token Chinese character... not because he or she is integral or needed, but because they want to sell the film to China and show it in China. Plain and simple. Said actors should be ashamed of themselves as being there for no good story, acting or plot reason and Hollywood should be ashamed of itself. But then again, they have never atoned for their sin of 'product placement' why stop now?Did you think the last King Kong was too stylish? Then brace for Kong! Forced plot meandering, token Chinese chick prancing there for no good reason while doing exactly nothing other than sell to China (like Chinese audiences are so desperate and needy) and to satisfy new Chinese owners and investors, etc. Again Skull Island is not Crouching Tiger or Hero that tells a story with Oriental characters (and I love those), but it is a forced injection of token East Asian as Legendary Pictures promises to do going forward in every Batman movie now that Chinese conglomerate has purchased that studio. So, what do we get a useless Chinese woman not knowing why she is there in yet another sequel/remake/reboot/whatever/who cares anymore? Which takes me to another problem. Hollywood, get an original idea once.in.a.while. What another reboot? Yes, Jurassic park made tons of dough so the fault is ours. But, what is the price of loss of dignity? Look at JJ Abrams. No credibility, no future. He made a ton of money with his unadulterated accountant-driven so-called Star Wars, but he is now washed up and over exposed as a no-talent. The same is happening with these Chinese investors taking over films and force feeding audiences something that is obviously, er, force fed. As for this film, well it is a stylized Kong battling not against humans at first, but against local predators. And there is a token Chinese who is a female scientist. Whoopedeeda! Can you say Rebooted Star Wars syndrome? One last thing, there is a Vietnam connection and so the marketing collateral oh so cleverly hints at Apocalypse Now.Price of admission?

I've only seen the 2014 Godzilla from this set of movies so I decided I better get caught up to watch Godzilla vs. Kong. I don't have too much to say here so I'll try and keep it brief. It takes place in 1973 as the Vietnam War has just ended. This film has a handful of cliches, with each character kind of having cliche aspects, but surprisingly enough the film actually takes these cliches and makes something neat out of it. It has some really interesting themes about war and commentates on the time period it's set in. The characters are mostly all interesting, although I did find some of the humor in here to be forced and not very funny. There is some really cool cinematography and lighting in here that makes the whole film visually interesting to watch. The CGI is surprisingly good and a lot of the special effects look nice. I did find the soundtrack to be stereotypical as it used a lot of songs from the time period instead of a big score. Overall, the film takes some cliche'd ideas, expands on the more interesting elements, and throws King Kong in to make an incredibly entertaining experience. Its themes aren't as well done as something like Godzilla (1954) but they are still there. Kong: Skull Island gets a 7/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

Jackson, Brie Larson, and John.c Reilly. The Vietnam war has just ended, John Goodman plays the head of monarch A government organization investigating the existence of monsters. They hire a military escort led by Colonel Packard(Samuel Jackson) and a tracker played by Tom Hiddleston to travel to an uncharted island where they meet Kong a giant ape who's bent on protecting the island and its inhabitants. This film takes a different approach than most King Kong films. It's set in the 70s as opposed to the 30s and offers a change in scenery. Paying tribute to other Vietnam classics like Apocalypse now and full metal jacket with a sense of humor. One of the strangest transitions you cut from a guy falling in Kong's mouth to a guy eating a sandwich that tells you the kind of humor you're getting in this. The human characters each have their perks some more than others and some questionable play off of those typical troops they are arrogant and full of themselves however they are soon out of their dad when they finally meet Kong. Tom Hiddleston plays a former British special air of service captain hired as a tracker to lead everyone to safety. While a decent performance, he doesn't do anything that gives you a reason to be fully invested in him dialogue-wise. He gets a decent amount of action scenes, Similar to Adrian Brody's character of Jack from the Peter Jackson film. More the guns and the actions as opposed to having more of a personality. Samuel Jackson's Colonel Packard is a war-crazed soldier who after losing the war. Find a new obsession with Kong and sees him as the enemy that's where the set of another film plays well to fit in either a certain character. Though predictable Samuel gives a good performance and it makes you hate this character throughout the film. Endangering his man in a battle he knows he can't win. The rest of the cast is pretty hit or miss the soldiers overall for the humans are the highlight Particularly the banter between mills and Cole Who is gonna be the most remembered out of the rest of the platoon. John C Reilly's Character has kind of a quirky awkwardness to Damn gives us the film over humorous tone to it and some more personality what I supposed to say Godzilla 2014 where it feels like all the humans for the most part bland and on interested I did all the humans the one main character that just doesn't seem like they belong there is Brie Lason's character yeah she has a connection to Tom's character but she has no reason to be here and some say she can document and photograph the events but you have John Goodman and his scientist there to document what's going on and outside of like one scene where she interacts with kong she doesn't have much of a reason to be in this movie. She doesn't serve the same purpose as Ann did in the original or the Jackson version. Kong doesn't fall in love with her or anything like that although she does show him that they are on his side she still comes office she just doesn't belong there. Lastly Kong himself of course he's more Scaled to Godzilla size but he comes off as benevolent. The movie gives more personality to him or you find out more about who he is through visuals and cave drawings it's also nice to see how he's rougher. Kong has cuts and scars all over his body shows that he's been fighting for a long time. And shows that he's not just dumb muscle like he knows how to use tools and weapons to his advantage. Kong Skull Island has a good film with interesting concepts and visuals do it or does it have the standard that the Peter Jackson version of the original and when they debuted it does offer enough to keep you invested wanting more.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

The movie's motto could definitely be ""don't get too attached"", but I wouldn't say that's necessarily a negative concept for what it's going for, even though some characters got mistreated. Samuel L. Jackson gave a chilling Lieutenant Colonel, too caught up in his insane desire for war. Each actor embodies their character well, but his stands out. The soundtrack is outstanding, giving us a mix of classic rock from its Vietnam War era time setting. It's a nonstop action that can't be skipped in a movie watcher's collection.

""Kong: Skull Island"" on the other hand is just a monster flick with Kong in it. Kong doesn't have any personality here nor did i had any feeling towards him - i didn't care if he nor anyone else survived here - and this is the worst part of the movie - so many great actors but there isn't anyone who i would remember, except for John C. Reilly - he delivered and stole every scene he was into. I really liked first ~30 min of this movie when they were setting this story, which wasn't original nor great, but it was done very well and thought ""oh were are in for a ride!"". But when that ride has begun, it was done so unfocused, so kinda badly edited that i almost missed when Kong made his entrance - poor pacing and editing. And after that ""Kong: Skull Island"" become very simple, not original, not highly involving monster flick in which i didn't really care about the outcome.Overall, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is a big budget monster flick with very good special effects, some nice action scenes, setting but that is pretty much it. It is a disappointing movie considering it has one of the most iconic movie monster ever, and you don't give a damn about him watching it. Not bad flick to see it once with some friends and beer, but unfortunately nothing more.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

They replaced the T-Rex-es with a different kind of creatures that perhaps look scarier if they throw them at you in 3D, or in 4DX, when they splash you with water at the same time... And, yes, for the 4DX viewing this is a good ""ride"" - when the monsters fight the chairs are moving intensely and you're splashed and sprayed and rained with water and air and scents... it's a good amusement park ride. But other than that, in the moments when the actors... ""act"" (do they?!)... this movie is pure boredom. A 5-year old would have written a better script. None of the actors matter, none stick with you (other than, maybe, the American chick in tank top who shows she's got some boobs and that's why they put her there) So, if you need a 4DX ride and you can do something else when there's no monsters fighting on the screen, see the movie. If you'll see it in plain 3D or IMAX... you'll be really sorry you wasted the money. Honestly. PS Who the f**k is paying a**holes to make the rating look so high for dumb movies like this? and write pompous reviews?... Are they smoking something?...

"","","For action and excitement, KONG does not disappoint","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3736845/?ref_=tt_urv","jimjo1216","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7679954/?ref_=tt_urv","22 June 2017","Merian C. Cooper and company tapped into something special with the original KING KONG (1933), captivating audiences with a fairly simple adventure fantasy (humans explore an undocumented island full of giant prehistoric monsters, and then bring one of the creatures back to modern civilization) and state-of-the-art cinematic special effects. But the story continues to resonate with moviegoers, through updates and retellings, out of a sympathy for Kong, the wild animal who fights dinosaurs at home, but is out of his depths in man's world.The 1976 remake of KING KONG set the familiar events in the (then-)modern world, with shady oil corporations and environmentalists. In 2005, LORD OF THE RINGS helmer Peter Jackson retold Kong's story using the latest special effects technology, setting the three-hour epic during the original 1930s time period (and especially emphasizing Kong's emotional connection with Naomi Watts's would-be damsel in distress).Over a decade later, KONG: SKULL ISLAND (2017) brings the giant gorilla back to the screen for a new generation, and a new blockbuster franchise. As the title suggests, the film is all about Kong's homeland of Skull Island. The film doesn't follow in the footsteps of prior iterations, as it positions Kong as a character who can appear in future sequels and spin-offs (facing off against other giant movie monsters from the Godzilla family of films).Like the 1976 film, SKULL ISLAND updates the Kong story from the old-timey 1930s, placing the events in the retro 1970s. Specifically 1973, at the close of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Exploring the unexplored island is John Goodman, a monster hunter supposedly (and secretly) working on behalf of the U.S. government's Cold War interests (find the monster before the Russians do!) and accompanied by Samuel L. Jackson's helicopter squadron, fresh off their tour in Vietnam and ready to head home. Also along for the ride are Tom Hiddleston, an expert tracker to get the team through the jungle; Brie Larson, an anti-war photojournalist; and assorted scientists and technicians.There's tension among the crew even before they encounter the skyscraper-sized gorilla. Military man Jackson and anti-war Larson don't see eye to eye, the scientists stick their noses up at the soldiers, and Goodman's urgency to find his monster puts him at odds with the better judgment of those who'd abort the expedition due to hellacious weather conditions. Once he witnesses Kong's destruction, Jackson, bitter about the outcome in Vietnam (a war that wasn't ""lost"", but ""abandoned""), focuses his entire being on destroying his hairy nemesis (an unpopular agenda among survivors keen on escaping the island with lives and limbs intact).Worries of the sympathetic creature in Peter Jackson's 2005 film having been truly recast as a hellish ""monster"", a terrible force of nature, may persist after the horror of Kong's first encounter with the helicopter squadron. But, new direction and all, SKULL ISLAND makes sure to hit upon the beats of the winning King Kong formula.As is tradition, a tribe of natives inhabits the island. But this time there are no ritualistic sacrifices at the altar of Kong. In this version, the natives worship Kong as their protector, for it is the great Kong who keeps the nasty ""skull-walker"" reptiles at bay and fights off the other Skull Island beasties. John C. Reilly plays a marooned WWII pilot who's been living among the Skull Islanders for twenty-eight years and can explain things to the wandering survivors.In this way, Kong is softened a little. He's merely protecting his territory from invaders. And in the grand scheme of things, Kong fights on the humans' side, or at least provides necessary opposition to the man-eating terrors that await in the jungles of Skull Island. Kong is no real threat unless provoked, and the humans need Kong on their side if they hope to survive.There's even a hint of Kong's famous weakness for pretty girls, in a scene where the savage Kong is tamed, if only for a second, by the beauty and kindness of Brie Larson. SKULL ISLAND eschews the damsel-in-distress story-line, but pays homage to the connection between ""beauty"" and ""the beast"".SKULL ISLAND is packed with action and terror. Besides Kong batting helicopters out of the air and stomping on fleeing personnel, there are the giant bone-chomping reptiles, vicious pterosaurs, towering spiders, and other unknown dangers threatening the scattered crew. Viewers never know what might happen. People die in a multitude of horrible ways. Survival until the final credits is certainly not assured, and the film builds on its tension with some clever match cuts.One particularly tense scene makes inventive use of a malfunctioning camera flash to track a creature through the fog, and another scene subverts an expected act of heroism. The action scenes throughout the film are exciting, and make for a fun trip to the movies.Samuel L. Jackson is scary as a slightly unhinged general hell-bent on avenging the deaths of his men. John C. Reilly steals the show as only he can, combining his signature brand of crazy with the film's moral center. Hiddleston and Larson are good, too, but despite little character moments, the main soldiers remain forgettable monster fodder.The quasi-modern update is welcome and refreshing dressing for the bones of the adventure plot, with the Vietnam conflict right in the rear-view mirror and the Cold War context. The technology is modern-ish, but pre-digital (to keep things interesting), and the period rock music played by the soldiers is still popular today.King Kong purists may miss the Empire State Building, but for the purposes of the new Kong-Godzilla shared movie franchise, SKULL ISLAND's narrower focus seems appropriate, and this latest version of Kong manages to take a new approach to the mythos while honoring its legacy. This new Kong is still Kong, and maybe audiences will soon get to see this protector of mankind step in against other famous larger-than-life creatures.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

Legendary makes a shift in tone when compared to the 2014 Godzilla film as Jordan Vogt-Roberts deliberately focuses on entertainment and spectacle. And it is really well done stylistic entertainment.

Bill Randa (John Goodman) seizes a small window of opportunity to engage a team, with military support, to recon a small uncharted island in the South Pacific. The team, including Randa, a troop of soldiers led by Colonel Packard (Samuel L Jackson), British tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) begins a tactic of dropping concussion bombs to map the land mass but are interrupted and quickly overwhelmed by a giant Gorilla.This is, perhaps, a better film than I gave it credit for. Above all else, visually it's really really well done. The landscapes of Vietnam and Hawaii are beautiful and evocative of a world undisturbed by human influence, until it very much is during the film. Kong himself looks great, as do the other creatures we see. The Skullcrawlers are impressive and nightmarish too, and a particularly epic looking scene, in the midst of giant gorilla bones and a screen full of bright yellow smoke shows them off to the full.Jackson's Packard is a good character, the real villain of the piece. He's already annoyed at his involvement in the futile efforts of the Vietnam war, but then takes the loss of his men as the excuse to go full Ahab, attempting to kill Kong despite being informed that his place in the ecosystem here may affect the whole world. To be critical, with the exception of John C Reilly's character - the majority of the rest of the cast don't leave much of an impression, with their characters left to either look in awe at things, or get killed.To keep things spoiler free as I can, there's a death in the film that was almost comedic the first time I saw it but has now been retrospectively made both sadder and more shocking by the ""Monarch"" series.Could it have been more fun and with better realised characters, sure. I enjoyed this rewatch though and will press on to ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"".","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

For me, it was fitting and it got my attention and I was just waiting to see when he would show up. Here we see him just a few minutes into the film, which probably gets a lot of people's attention, but not so much for me because I had nothing to look forward to when the film introduced King Kong in the opening minutes. But the aforementioned CGI was awesome and the action scenes were also gorgeous. I enjoyed the eye candy in the form of action to the fullest and that is also in my opinion the biggest draw of this film.

'Kong: Skull Island' is an American monster film directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts. The film is a reboot of the King Kong franchise, and serves as the second film in Legendary's MonsterVerse. Some people go to the movies to be wowed by the superb acting, heart wrenching and well written story, and overall solid production. This has a good story and good effects. The acting isn't bad, but it isn't award winning.
The story has characters Bill Randa and Houston Brooks (John Goodman and Corey Hawkins) piggybacking on an expedition to an uncharted island to test a theory they've been working on. The first hirer a tracker names James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and assemble a team of highly trained Military professionals lead by Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson). As they enter the island, they start dropping seismic explosives, which create mini earthquakes for them to be able to map out the island. Suddenly, the air unit is attacked by the giant ape, scattering the survivors across the island. Two groups form between the survivors: Conrad, Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) and one of the soldiers gather quickly, while Randa and the rest of the soldiers land a few miles away. Packard goes in search of the transport helicopter piloted by his right-hand man Major Jack Chapman, (Toby Kebbell) intending to use the weapons on board to kill the ape that killed most of his men.
This movie much like Godzilla has some great talent, but it ruined with boring characters. Brie Larson plays a photographer and I have no idea what she is doing there. Anyone of these trained for combat officers could use a camera to document what is happening instead of endangering the life of a civilian. Her character didn't need to be in it and seemed to just be added to have the female character that Kong needs. John C. Reilly plays a surprisingly funny WW2 vet marooned on the island. Other then the actors playing the roles they were given; they are not fleshed out at all. We learn nothing about where they were before we see them in the film or why some of them have the talents they have.
I enjoyed the action in this movie, and Kong looked good, almost all the creatures looked realistic and all the fights between them looked good. Some of the green screen effects, like backgrounds behind characters, were distractingly bad. Ultimately, you get some great stuff out of all the effects if you're not looking too closely.
Overall, this movie is an entertaining story with lots of destruction. It's enjoyable for what it is, a monster movie with lots of action. The characters are lackluster and not all the likeable. You will be going into this for the entertainment factor and not so much the character development.

With shades of the classic war movies Good Morning Vietnam (1987) and Apocalypse Now (1979) and perhaps even the monster epic Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959) and perhaps Jurassic Park 1993), this reimagined Kong movie begins with both a measured surprise and a quite different Kong movie that shows a lot of promise. Nevertheless, the script eventually falls flat in places as the plot points become more important than the realistic strategic or authentic flow from scene to scene. A huge example of the manipulation of a screen stretched to the breaking point in order to maintain the director's or producer's intended rational for a scene later in the movie is the first gigantic encounter between man and beast and it's pretty much an overkill and unbelievable disaster for man. And at almost regular intervals thereafter there are humans that seem to fall prey in order to show off some special effect cuteness that really doesn't do much for the movie and with little rationale except attempt to justify the cost of the movie. This sort of demise is repeated over and over again just in order to perhaps reduce the number of characters to manageable proportions and extend the time of the movie. A lot of editing and cutting would probably have made the pacing of this adventure action movie much more palpable. Nevertheless, the plot outline of this Kong version is very distinctive and admirable in concept and there are some great individual scenes and photographic images that boggle the mind. The ending credits film images also is a plus along with the outstanding presence of John C. Reilly almost carries the show.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

The fights are really tangible and surprising.They some how manage hit the big cliches and also subvert them. Tere are some big name actors and they all do a good job. Nothing earth shattering, but they do their jobs. The characters aren't that interesting and would have probably fallen flat without the actors doing all the work to carry them. But they aren't bad or anything.The special effects look phenomenal. And the soundtrack works really well to make it feel like a war time movie. Like it has this weirdly nostalgic feel to it. Like if it wasn't for the modern special effects, I would have this weird sense memory of having watched this movie as a kid (and not just cause its a reboot).If I had to describe it, it is like Jurassic Park meets Saving Private Ryan.

"7","/10","Unabashed popcorn film is enjoyably unpretentious entertainment (Kong smashed real good)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4294319/?ref_=tt_urv","a_chinn","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27637510/?ref_=tt_urv","20 August 2018","And unabashed popcorn film, with no deeper meaning or subtext, is delightfully endearing in it's simple (although big budget) adventure story. Set during the waining day of the Vietnam War, John Goodman plays a government agent specializing in the strange and mysterious has discovered an uncharted island and convinces his superiors to give him a detail of soldiers from Vietnam to help him explore the titular island. That island is full to giants monster, mysterious natives, and also a WWII pilot who was shot down 25 years ago and doesn't know the war is over. John C. Reilly really steals the movie as the WWII solider marooned on Skull Island, but he does have competition from Samuel L. Jackson as the commanding officer leading the US soldiers helping Goodman, British airman Tom Hiddleston, and photojournalist Brie Larson. The action is fun, the characters are likable, and Kong smashes things real good. Beside John C. Reilly being awesome, the next most interesting element to the film is that it was set during the Vietnam War and treats the era with a rather light touch and not the usual downbeat tone that typically surrounds Vietnam set war films, which is something I cannot recall seeing in any other major film before (unless you want to count John Wayne's ""The Green Berets""). Throughout the 70s and 80s, most every Vietnam war film was pretty heavy, and even the ones with a lighter touch, like ""The Boys in Company C"" or ""Good Morning, Vietnam,"" still made sure the audience was aware that this was a terrible and horrific war. The version of Vietnam depicted in ""Kong: Skull Island"" has the costumes, musics, and all the other trappings of just about every other memorable Vietnam film you can think of (from ""Apocalypse Now"" to ""Born on the Fourth of July""), but it kind of just blew my mind out uncomplicated this war was presented. World War II has seen a lot of entertaining sci-fi and horror mash-ups, from Michael Mann's ""The Keep"" to Disney's ""Bedknobs & Broomsticks"" as well as lesser underrated films like ""The Final Countdown"" or ""Zone Troopers."" There are so many of this sort of film that there's even an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to it. As for Vietnam, I think filmmakers stayed away from making light of that war because it was such a damaging war to our nation, not just politically and militarily, but culturally. Seeing the Vietnam War portrayed so differently in a blockbuster summer popcorn film made me realize that maybe we've reached a point in history where we've put enough distance between ourselves and that nearly 50-year old war, with three generations (Gen-X, Millenials, and Generation Z) who did not grow up with this war being part of their lives. It reminds me of the old Mark Twain quote, ""Humor is tragedy plus time."" For better or for worst, enough time must have passed now for Vietnam to now be fun. But I digress. Now Kong smashes things real good, fighting giant snakes and all sorts of other made up creatures. The CGI effects are excellent, but I'm a grouchy old man about CGI effects. I really want my giant movie monsters to either be men in monster suits crushing miniature sets or to be stop-motion animation. Computer generated animation takes me out of films and might as well be cartoon animation as far as I'm concerned. CGI works for backgrounds and explosions, but it doesn't work for for living people, animals, or creatures. Still, despite my annoyances with Hollywood's overuse of CGI, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is pretty fun for a number of reasons, but primarily because of it's excellent cast and it's unpretentiously fun action and adventure, which comes off as a nice old fashioned adventure yarn, which is exactly what you need in a retelling of classic monster movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

Coming from the studio who brought us the 2014 Godzilla, starring a stacked cast, and boasting a stylishly fun trailer, I was all-in. Unfortunately, Kong is a special kinda bad, like a throwaway 90s adventure with as much brains as subtlety. It's corny but cynical; it's tongue-in-cheek but mean-spirited; it even made me miss Kong ice skating with Naomi Watts. It's an awful scattershot of varied tones & overwhelming styles. In a re-imagining of the discovery of Kong, a group of scientists, explorers and military-men in 1971 make a trek to the mysterious & monster-filled Skull Island. It's full of some of the biggest actors around, both up-and-coming & veterans. Sadly, it's one of the biggest wastes of a great cast in years, as they are given an unbearably clichéd and incomprehensible script. The soldiers (Jackson) are angry, the scientists (Goodman) are reckless, and the pretty white people (Hiddleston, Larson) are romantically shoved together. The character purposes are unclear, the dialogue is mind-numbing, and the message is essentially, ""Violence: bad. Empathy: good."" Even the basic choice of creating intrigue is pushed-aside, opting to obnoxiously shove us into the monsters' faces from the get-go. It's all as graceful as Kong himself. Not that it isn't stylish; just the opposite. Director Vogt-Roberts decided that if you CAN use a cinematic trick then you SHOULD. Random zoom-in / push-outs, incessant slo-mo, quick edits, old-style reel-to-reel effects, and laughable 3D-only shots; it's a boring theme-park ride, including narrative heft. There's lots of great stuff in theaters: Logan, Get Out, Split, Lego Batman (which has Kong in it!); don't waste your time on this loud-garbage.","29 out of 67 found this helpful."

You don't go see a movie about a giant gorilla that's known for smashing stuff.Normally I avoid such titles as they are all so formulated. Which this was to some extent, but they did break away from the mold a noticeable amount. Which is a big part of what made it tolerable where others are not I had fun watching this movie. I thought it was pretty well done. By far the best King Kong since the old B&W version from 1933. The CGI was mostly plausible. Only a couple of moments of broken physics. The characters where about as well developed as they needed to be. Plot was pretty hole free.Its not 10/10 stuff, but its not trying to be either. They got this one just right.Normally I couldn't watch something in this genre all the way to the end.

The Kong was over a 100 feet tall in this, compared to 25 feet from a decade ago. Being a big fan of that film and Peter Jackson, I hated this idea, especially for totally a fresh cast and crew. So I was not expecting it. Only while watching it, I came to know it was a new version. With a new cinematic, a new set of actors, timeline, completely a different kind of tone for a King Kong film that I have ever seen.They wanted it to be a badass action film than a value added storyline. That does not mean I loved it. It was average. I only enjoyed the nice action-adventures. But the visuals were a more commercialised. I even confused whether did I watched a Hollywood film or an Rajamouli film. You know those terrible methods used for stunt sequences.The most boring part of this film was the same old formula, which is a set of people enter in a dangerous enclosure and only a few come back alive. A couple of scientist escorted by a military to a mystery island hidden in the mists of the South Pacific to do some scientific research. Soon they come to realise they are in a dangerous place where giant monsters live. After losing some of the soldiers, now it becomes a survival game. But the general is obsessed with a revenge. How the rest of the story folds were told with a battle of the film.Basically, this film was created to merge two franchises, the rebooted 'Godzilla' with this one. The post end-credit scene gave some important hint about the future of the franchise. But I thought it was too similar to the comedy flick, 'Journey 2: The Mysterious Island'. Usually spoof films were made out of greatest hit films. But it looks like here a reverse case. Though all the actors were good. Nice direction, visuals, music, particularly the sound effects. This film is simply enjoyable and forgettable.There are many things I did not like. The Peter Jackson film was so artistic. Every frame was like a classic painting. In this, the Kong standing on his two feet, walking around like a man, totally turned me off. The giant ape did not behave like a real ape. Many sequences were also borrowed from many other films, only replaced with different creatures and recreated with a fresh setting. This is a perfect time pass film to have on a weekend. Particularly, if you are a graphile (graphic+phile), you would have a nice time.5.5/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

Plots need to follow certain formulas and the drama is always somewhat predictable. I haven't always been a fan of the genre, not least because there are a lot of big-budget stinkers in the past. This is not one of them.First of all, breaking the standard plot for a King Kong-movie helps. Another straight remake like the one from Peter Jackson would have been unbearable. Adding a lot of well-known and well-performing actors also help. Of course the movie is packed with special effects, and yet I'm not really bothered by them the way that I often am. Not that they are very life-like or believable, but they are done with a certain flair. Also, the ape itself is just the right amount of human.When it comes to popcorn-movies, this is the real deal.

"7","/10","""Skull Island"" claims Kong for blockbuster, chaos-seeking moviegoers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3768760/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie_Muse_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2496397/?ref_=tt_urv","31 July 2017","King Kong holds the honor of being among Hollywood's first movie monsters, but ""monster"" has never been as relevant a label for the colossal ape as it is for his latest incarnation in ""Kong: Skull Island."" Whereas most people think of Kong as a misunderstood beast who falls for the beautiful Anne Darrow, in this film he possesses those instincts, but he's also an easy-to-anger killing machine.Despite the character's history in films with action elements but more poetic flourishes, ""Skull Island"" works to build Kong into an action hero capable of raking in blockbuster-level cash. The story and screenplay, which represents the combined work of John Gatins and Dan Giloy (""Real Steel""), Derek Connolly (""Jurassic World"") and Max Borenstein (whose ""Godzilla"" launched this monster universe for Warner Bros) does not completely strip Kong of his humanity, but he's a relentless force of nature in a film that pushes the boundaries of PG-13 violence.These writers have structured the story as a '90s monster movie: an expedition team including a researcher (John Goodman), geologist (Corey Hawkins), wilderness guide (Tom Hiddleston), photographer (Brie Larson) and a platoon of disappointed Vietnam vets (led by Samuel L. Jackson) fly through a storm to the mysterious Skull Island, where they're greeted by angry ape and encounter countless other larger-than-life creatures bent on killing/eating them.Though he be new to the big-budget filmmaking game, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts (""The Kings of Summer"") takes this solidly written albeit predictable story and does just enough stylistically to keep us on our toes the entire time. Once it becomes clear that characters' lives are not sacred in this movie, the thrill becomes waiting to see what unexpected and frankly shocking ways the story (and Vogt-Roberts) will remove them. Vogt-Roberts seems particularly adept at finding a balance between brutal/visceral violence and leaving some of that up to the imagination for full effect. He applies non-traditional angles and refreshing perspectives that ""Skull Island' gravitates between B- movie thrills and creative action filmmaking.The story leans on some classic archetypes that do enough to fuel the story in thoughtful ways. The characters get more interesting when John C. Reilly's Hank Marlow enters. Marlow is a World War II pilot who has been trapped on the island for 30 years and helps explain to the other characters that Kong is the good guy and a key cog in the island's ecosystem; he's the only one who can kill the island's giant man- eating lizards. This information leads to a schism: half the group wants to kill Kong and the others want to save him – familiar but effective.Goodman, Hiddleston and Larson are obviously all too good for this movie, but ""Skull Island"" is better for them. And absolutely nothing is surprising about Jackon's involvement or role, and that's its own kind of legitimacy. His Preston Packard character actually has the most complexity, whereas Hiddleston and Larson serve to make their two-dimensional characters appear to be deep and interesting, which they do well enough. Ultimately, the characters provide an assortment of victims and heroes for a ruthless jungle-set monster movie. Those with a thirst for that kind of mayhem will find ""Skull Island"" a gleeful adventure, but those looking to be moved -- or heaven forbid show it to their kids in hopes of a family-friendly outing – are bound to encounter disappointment if not outrage. ""Skull Island"" reclaims King Kong's fearsome, creature-crushing side in glorious fashion, though it pretty exclusively plays to those tastes.~Steven CThanks for reading!

A bunch of dreamers / monster chasers led by Bill Randa (John Goodman) are accompanied by a military escort as they set out to explore a newfound South Pacific island. They'll find that the main occupant is an ENORMOUS gorilla (this may be the hugest Kong on record) - but there is absolutely no shortage of formidable creatures on the island. Leading the military is an officer (Samuel L. Jackson) who is a bitter warrior in need of a new enemy. Hired to guide these unlucky chumps is a British tracker named Conrad (Tom Hiddleston).You do have to be undemanding to get into ""Kong: Skull Island"". Don't watch it for the silly script, with its silly characters and silly dialogue. Instead, watch it for the generous amount of grand-scale action. These filmmakers were clearly trying to make sure that their audience was never bored. To that end, there's quite a bit of good monster action, as Kong is joined by a spider with VERY tall legs, giant wildebeest type things, a giant fresh water squid, and a menagerie of reptilian animals dubbed ""skull crawlers"". The movie is never more entertaining than when it focuses on Kong and his battles with his fellow island dwellers.As for these people who are foolish enough to invade Kongs' domain, you can't be bothered to care a lot for them. Some of the actors - Hiddleston, Goodman, the gorgeous Brie Larson - manage to survive with some dignity intact. John C. Reilly adds a lot of the comedy relief with his role as a soldier who's been stuck on the island since the second World War. Jackson actually delivers a performance instead of just being a personality.This does benefit from some lovely Hawaiian scenery, effectively shot in widescreen. And the CGI is actually some of the best that this viewer has seen; it doesn't look overly cartoonish. Kong is performed capably through the motion capture technique by Terry Notary and Toby Kebbell (the latter also plays the soldier Jack Chapman).This viewer can understand why some people would be unimpressed, but was able to take the bad with the good, and have a reasonably fun time with this.The use of all the rock songs got to be annoying.

Aside from what is in the movie in and of itself, which is plenty as an ironic and satirical blockbuster (at least up to a point, in small but enough doses), as a world-building enterprise it's spectacular, and is a step up from the previous entry in this new WB/Legendary ""Moster-Kaiiju-Verse"", Godzilla.I think the difference between the two is simple but profound: Edwards was fascinated more with spectacle and the presence of Godzilla, but he wasn't so set on building human characters to connect with (except for Bryan Cranston, who was shamefully wasted after a promising start). Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts is all about characters, and even gives some time to people who should be nothing secondary ones (I know the complaints already coming, that there are too many, and that may be true - on a first viewing I was fine with it for the simple fact that the dialog given to these military runts and other scientist-types were either funny or clever enough. Everyone has charisma and characters who need to have chemistry (Hiddleston-Larson, or Larson and Kong) give it enough juice in that area.But more than that is that Kong himself is done right by the writers and filmmakers. Unlike in Godzilla as well, here we have a character who actually IS a character, someone who functions in the story, shows deeper wells of emotion (yes, a carry-over from the best of the 1933 and 2005 Kong movies is that Kong is vulnerable), and finds through non-verbal communication how to connect - or decidedly not, quite the opposite - with these Vietnam war hosts. He has goals and real motivations; while they are steeped in monster movie lore, it's sharp and exciting monster movie lore, and things are explained by John C. Reilly here and there (he's the 28-years-gone survivor of being left during WW2, a more innocent-yet-still-bloody time in US history, also with us vs some Asian menace), yet a lot is left to the imagination.How do these prehistoric-ish ""Skull Crawlers"" come out from these blasts put out by these helicopters? Who knows? Who cares? The point is these giant lizard things are genuinely terrifying; there's some limited creativity in their designs, but what's exciting is that the direction is all about drawing out suspense. And the island itself has many surprises (there's one point where a creature is revealed as something you would thing you could sit on!) and also with the natives who are... just scenery, mostly, but at least the movie doesn't try to go too far into cultural insensitivity or anything. They're simply there and do what they can for the Reilly character over these many years; Reilly, by the way, scruffy and laughing often and happy even as he is totally terrified (""I've only been here 28 years,"" he says at one point up against military/US egotism personified by Samuel L Jackson) is what Bryan Cranston was to Godzilla, only here there is much more and he's possibly the best human presence in the movie.How about the satire, if it is there? I think there's more that could be dissected with it being Vietnam, or more specifically in 1973 as Nixon is preparing for pulling out troops (of course that wouldn't be for a full two years later, but you get the idea). Jackson's Col Packard is trying to hide his anguish at having to ""abandon"" this war (he can't bare to say defeat) so this other South-East conflict will do; it's Us vs Them and Us as usual not recognizing all of our might is insignificant when on their turf. It's not the sharpest commentary ever, but it's not without accident it's there either. The iconography is compelling as well: all of those helicopters, blasting away Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"" as these charges drop on the island - asking for it, in monster movie fashion (messing with nature, you fools!), but this time there's the added element of how soldiers and civilians act, and recognizing who is ""King"" in the end.This is a spectacular good time at the movies, in case I didn't make that clear. All of the actors are doing excellent work, the kind that you would never get to see back when monster movies were in the realm of square B-movie territory. If anything this would be a splendid double feature with Jurassic Park (aside from the eye-roll at Jackson repeating a ""butts"" line straight-faced, as if the movie would be in trouble unless he did it), as both involve charismatic, memorable actors and relatively decent supporting characters facing off against monsters that are from another time and place, with snappy dialog, and visual effects that are out of this world. And the climax - my Kong! Spinkle some 70's Vietnam-Rock icing and you got yourself a blockbuster cake of exceptional proportions.","43 out of 83 found this helpful."

The story was unbelievable (Japanese back story, Vietnam war in which we attacked the poor Vietnamese, a Chinese chick to sell tickets in China and then gigantic creatures at war) with little to no thought devoted to making it believable. The whole film seemed to be rushed to the big screen for the sole purpose of making money after a script was written analysed to include everything needed to make cash (again the aforementioned elements, a reboot, a couple of chicks, different men from different races, using a famous character's story and name...) . I am so sorry, but King Kong had a story and motivations, it deserves to be one of the best story lines brought to the big screen full of emotional backstory and humanizing feeling. I feel Hollywood has overdone the whole reboot thing.","12 out of 24 found this helpful."

Set in the 70's this follows an expedition to the mysterious and newly discovered Skull Island.Evoking the vibe of 70's and 80's Vietnam war movies was a smart move and gives this film a style distinct from other Kong movies. The cinematography is very good with many striking images throughout the movie. The visual effects are outstanding.This is a more stylish B movie, with some horror elements and light gore, but the undertone is funny and fun. There's a stellar cast who all put in good performances, Samuel L Jackson is the standout and seems to be relishing in his antagonistic role.A special mention too for John C Reilly who's character is part eccentric idiot and part knowing elder sage, but the balanced performance makes this work well somehow.Some of the other characters lack depth and are a little stereotypical, but face it we're mainly here for Kong, and he is a formidable force of nature with a great screen presence. Did I mention the visual effects are fantastic? Haha.This delivers on the big screen spectacle and monster mayhem you would hope for, but doesn't hold much depth beyound that which is absolutely fine.

The creature design is at times astonishing, all of which means when the action sequences happen they're brilliant.

The CGI is good, the sets look great, the cast is adequate, and the story is fun. The film has a lot of beautiful shots and the colors are vibrant. I especially liked the northern lights. The costumes were decent and I enjoyed watching a big ape smash things. The fight scenes for Kong were great. They didn't get boring. He's dangerous to our characters and the story shows how he's needed to protect the island. The things that got in the way were continuity issues of time frame and the paper thin characters. The worst are played by Brie Larson, Tian Jing, and Tobby Kebbel. It's not the actors fault. They were given three characters we're supposed to care about but offer nothing to the story. While Jing and Kebbel's characters are not foremost in the story, Larson's character really wastes a lot of time to be the cute chick who's in the action. She's supposed to be the strong woman version of past damsels in the Kong Series. Problem is, those women were much stronger and more interesting than she ever was. First, they don't start off as the ""bad ass"" anti-war photographer. They start off as normal women in an dangerous situation. These women learn to survive with a massive animal who's probably going to eat them. They earn the animal's trust and establish boundaries (not well maintained mind you) which keeps the animal protecting them while they find a way to get out of their situation. Brie Larson's version is just a lame chick who cannot fight, looks pretty, and has little to no real reason to be Kong's interest (the other women were offered up to Kong which is why he's interested). It would have been better had Larson's and Jing's Character been combined. Jing's character was overshadowed and turned into another useless chick. That sucks because the two characters put into one would have been better than having two sub-par characters with little to no purpose. Honestly, why does anyone need a photographer on this adventure? Especially when you have characters like Randa and Brooks who already have cameras and a history of documenting research? At least Jing's Character could have had more screen time to explain her expertise and drive the story. But that doesn't matter. The film was still very entertaining.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

Well I am really disappointed. First of all, boring plot, couldn't hold myself to yawn within only 15min beginning. The opening scene in certain sandscape looked quite fake, thought I could recognise my country from the view behind.Second of all, I made comment base on a view of an Asian. The Chinese actress Tian Jing totally plays a role of poster girl, no quality lines for her whatsoever. Please next time if you feel the need to have an Asian-looking actress/actor better to recruit someone else with acting know-how. The fact to put a random-but-with-strong-network Asian actress on show is really an insult for me personally. These continuous actions to build such characters only create more perceptions about uninteresting, unimpressive rather stupid & boring Asians. Asian actresses/actors could do ways better than that & they deserve more space to act. The truth is I walked out after 25min so just those two for now. I have read one comment saying that real excitements only begins after first 20min (and really, for such a blockbuster you are ready to spare up to 20min of first impression that lame ?) So maybe I'll give it a try again this week for the later part, hopefully feeling better. For now, all I can see is disappointment.","6 out of 10 found this helpful."

OK, back to Kong, really not that bad, some parts were just as good as any Jurassic Park movie, if you like those movies with huge CGI monsters than this will be your cup of tea.

Therefore I think that this is probably the best Kong film I've seen, excluding 'The Simpsons' parody of course.It does have a very 'Full Metal Jacket' (1987), Apocalypse Now (1979) and the Vietnam chapter of 'Forrest Gump' (1994) sense to it, as in this version there are a lot of soldiers, who are still riled up, as the war has only just finished. The great soundtrack also adds to that vibe. There are elements of 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth' (1959) too.It's interesting to see Tom Hiddleston in a more action based role. I think I like it, but I'm not quite sure? As my mother said though, he's a nice shape. There are just a few times when he strikes an action man pose and it looks a bit unnatural. I suppose that with a face like that and eyes so beautiful, you can get away with anything.Does Samuel L. Jackson ever have a day off from being himself though? I am quite frankly getting tired of seeing him in everything. Either he has a huge gambling habit that he needs to work all the time to pay for or he's got some power over the producers to keep putting him in films. What's in those photos or on those files and who are they about?If I could see some diversity from him it wouldn't be so bad, but he's always just the same and it gets boring. I wonder if, like 'The Hulk', he's just always angry too?I'm not sure that the comic relief in the form of John C. Reilly was necessary either? I think that are hundreds of other actors that could have played both Sam and John's roles without them seeming so out of place or irritating.The special effects though are very well done and it's a good job that I know that these beasties are all created on a computer or I might not sleep at night.Although, on an island so far from what we could call ""The Norm"", who's to say that the creatures don't exist? The lizards are a bit too odd for me however and actually quite creepy.I really do like this one though. I think that the story is appropriate and it set up 'Godzilla Vs Kong' (2021) very well. It certainly delivers what you need from a film of this genre and keeps you interested. It's done at a sensible pace and the majority of the cast fit in without any issues.737.87/1000.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

The production design, sound, and sense of scale were really the only positives I could find. The soundtrack was enjoyable, but came off a bit cliché. The exact songs you'd expect to be in a Vietnam war film are front and center.The movie is all but devoid of humor. And I don't mean it takes itself too seriously or doesn't make time for jokes, I mean that the jokes are just hopelessly off the mark. Lines are delivered and it's almost like the editor left in a beat or two after each one to allow the crowd time to laugh without missing anything. This only made them more cringe-worthy because the movie was shamelessly telling you ""this is a funny part!"" while all we heard were crickets. For the first couple of them I found myself thinking ""there has to be more to the joke, I'll just wait for -- oh OK that was it."" There were a few sections of dialogue that were clearly rerecorded after filming. A person would be delivering a line and then, when the camera was at their back, or on someone else in the scene, the tone and cadence would be noticeably different than their lines before and after. And sometimes they didn't even bother to cover it up. There were two distinct moments where what the actor was mouthing wasn't remotely close to what you were hearing.Lastly, even with this star studded cast (Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larsen, John Goodman, and John C. Reilly) the writers still couldn't provide memorable characters. The development was so poor that out of all them I actually could only remember the name of Samuel L. Jackson's character by the end of the movie. But does that even count? I was only able to do so because you could see it prominently on his jacket throughout the film.I went in with high hopes, and while I did enjoy it more than the 3 hour offering from Peter Jackson in 2005, I'm still just not a fan. It would seem this story in general is not for me. Having said all this I'm still hopeful for Kong's planned crossover movie with another certain monster in a few years. It should afford the opportunity to break away from the familiar. For now, however, I'm stuck with another safe remake. 4/10.","11 out of 22 found this helpful."

I can't stand seeing an ugly gorilla killing cool dinosaurs. Initially I had skipped this movie and directly watched Godzilla: King of the Monsters, but seeing how many references of this movie that movie had in the post credits and the fact that I needed to watch this to understand Godzilla vs Kong is why I watched this movie in the first place (I still haven't watched Godzilla vs Kong though lmao). This movie, however, wasn't that bad. In fact the CGI is pretty good.But that doesn't change the fact that an ugly gorilla is killing cool looking Skullcrawlers here, although I was satisfied that he could win only with the human help. Samuel Jackson plays the role of an annoying general who gets his comeuppance (which is the reason why I have given it such a good rating). He was so irritating. When he said he will kill all the Skullcrawlers after he kills Kong I felt like going in the screen and slapping him. Like, just one scene ago your entire squad got thrashed by only one Skullcrawler child and here you're dreaming of taking down every single one of them you zoophobe!?The movie takes place on an island in the 70's. Although Kong gets very less screen time and there is too much talking and exposition, it wasn't as bad as the Godzilla movies. The human characters were actually interesting. I liked the part where one of them dies when a giant spider steps on him and everyone thinks it's a tree. The professor who explains the entire context of the tribes worshipping Kong was also an interesting story. In the end they all manage to get away from the island and tell the world about what they saw. It was a good ending. If they had done something like saying why they were going to keep it a secret I'd have legit given it a 1 star rating.The CGI has been done very well. Although it features a number of cool creatures (the Skullcrawlers especially), it does not induce the same frantasy feeling that Godzilla movies do. It only makes it feel like giant creatures fighting in an island. It doesn't feel ""legendary"", like what you feel when you watch King of the Monsters' trailer. It just looks... Meh.Kong: Skull Island may not be some very extraordinary movie, but you do have to watch it if you want to watch Godzilla vs Kong. It's a bit annoying but makes it up with the colour palette. I really hope this is the last time I'm seeing the ugly gorilla. Because I am never going to re-watch this.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

The story begins with two scientists who gather a military crew, a photographer, and a tracker to set foot on an uncharted island which they discovered its existence by satellite photos. The plot has nothing special, no twists, and is predictable. As for the cast, I believe gathering a team of the expensive cast like Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, and Brie Larson paid off. Music and soundtracks were nothing worth mentioning but the sound effects were perfect. A lot of scenes were built by CG which are good and sometimes more than good.Overall, this is a high-budget sci-fi movie with a lot of CG that is worth your while if you are into this fictional genre.

But if you enjoy the movies of Mr. Emmerich you will like this one also - lots of explosions, here and there some humorous scenes, some (cgi-)monsters and ofc King Kong and last but not least, tons of inconsistencies and forgettable 2-dimensional characters. So if you like Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, 2012 etc. watch this version of King Kong, if you don't like such movies, skip this one. Summa summarum: another waste of a fantastic character like the last Tarzan endeavor.p.s. sometimes I suspect Hollywood got some script-generating- algorithm developed and saves the money for writers, of such generic ""quality"" are many of the Hollywood products of past years, Skull Island is another proof of this theory ;)","16 out of 35 found this helpful."

Peter Jackson's 2005 remake was a boring rehash. When I first heard there was coming another I was like well they have to drag the franchise out for another try. Several big actors were to be in it but I had never heard of the director. But then the trailer and marketing for it started coming and it looked quite interesting and also and maybe especially it looked different. So eventually I actually went to the cinema to see Kong: Skull Island. Luckily that I did because this is really a movie which should be seen in the cinema.Kong: Skull Island is the definition of a popcorn movie. Where the 2005 movie was drawn out and almost pretentious this movie wastes no time to get to the action and adventure. The action is outstanding in entertainment. Obviously there is a lot of cgi. However I'm not against computer made effects just for no reason. Some things are hard to do in other ways and as long as it doesn't feel like it's used for laziness sake it's fine. And in this movie it works fine. The action in this movie was among the most exciting I saw last year. Some complained about the characters being thin and while that criticism does have a point I don't think it matters much here. This is a fun action adventure that doesn't need deeply developed characters. They are not what's important. They are just enough for this type of movie. And the performances are good. Samuel L Jackson is the bad*** that he always is and does so well, Tom Hiddleston gives us a glimpse that he could definitely play James Bond, Brie Larson works well with what she's got even if it's not a lot. The best is John C. Reilly, his character is the most interesting and performance the most entertaining. Simple they may be but they do all have some distinct personality. Minor complaints are that many of the quotes that are meant as jokes don't land but for me it wasn't a big issue, the movie is funnier in other ways. Like previously stated I knew nothing about the director who it turns out had only directed one other movie but he totally nailed this one. He gets great performances even if the script probably didn't give much to work with. I love the look of the movie, the style it's done in. The shots of helicopters flying over the island and Kong silhouette against the sun. It could have taken this grim and gloomy look which I'm so glad it didn't. Another thing is the music, while there is tunes that are written for it the movie uses a lot of songs from the era when it is set which works perfectly. Having a lot of well known songs can work greatly in the right kind of movie but not all. Kong: Skull Island was one of the most surprisingly good movies in 2017. A movie that knows what it is and embraces it. It's campy and over the top and I like it. No one would claim it to be any amazing piece of work but I believe the filmmakers totally know it and all for the better. I have seen a lot of 2017 movies and Kong: Skull Island was while definitely not the best but one of the most thoroughly entertaining. See Kong: Skull Island if you haven't already. I have several times.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

Yes this is meant to be a bashing, crashing, CGI action movie, but it still needs to make sense why it's happening. Even as someone who is a self proclaimed tree-hugger the obviousness of the film's agenda was maddening because everything about it was so overt. It just didn't make sense and that drove me nuts throughout.The production value was great, CGI was convincing, and I loved the cast. I thought they all did well and played the parts as they were written very well, too. The action sequences also packed a massive punch.

"","","Not exactly a ""remake"", but contains much of the premise of finding Kong.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3767904/?ref_=tt_urv","TxMike","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066/?ref_=tt_urv","30 July 2017","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay, and of course the picture and sound are flawless. Not only the direct sound and the ample surround sounds, but also great use of a deep bass subwoofer track. Saw it again October 2018 and enjoyed it as much the second time.This Kong movie deviates quite far from the 1933 ""King Kong"" which culminates in Manhattan with Kong climbing the Empire State building. In this version modern (1973) satellite images discover a previously unknown island, they called it Skull Island. A small group of explorers convince a Senator to fund a trip so that a competing country doesn't get there before a USA expedition.The mission includes military men and Army helicopters and their first encounter with this giant of an ape doesn't go very well. With all helicopters downed and many killed, those on the ground must find a way to get to a prearranged rescue spot on the north side of the island.Tom Hiddleston as James Conrad was recruited for his fighting skills. Samuel L. Jackson is the hard-nosed officer Preston Packard. Pretty Brie Larson is in the movie as eye candy, as experienced correspondent photographer Mason Weaver. She was using an authentic period Leica camera and really was taking photos during filming.As they are moving through the forest of the island they encounter John C. Reilly as Hank Marlow, a soldier who had been on the island for 28 years, since WW2, and knew nothing about the outside world but became their key to escape the island.There are many battles with giant prehistoric beasts of various sorts that have survived on the island, Kong actually is the one who keeps them in check, keeps them from overcoming the world. It was filmed in some really exotic, beautiful areas of Vietnam.An interesting and entertaining take on the Kong story.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

It doesn't even make much sense to create an origin story for Kong because his movies have always explained the origins... but they did it anyway. For the bigger purpose to add the king ape into the newest Godzilla reboot. You do remember 2014's mediocre ""Godzilla"", starring Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe et al? You don't? Hopefully you will still like to see the sequel Godzilla: King of Monsters"" coming in 2019 March, where G and Kong will meet finally (again). Anyway, about the experience at hand. Skull Island"" reaches wide cinema release this weekend. It's probably partially an experiment, to see how early in the year the masses are ready to shell out their hard-earned for run-of-the-mill epics usually more suitable for summer season.The movie cost 190 million dollars and I am glad to report that the producers have put this for good use. Everything looks amazing and for a big dumb adventure like this, there's unusually big and varied line of actresses/ actors. Casting team has done a fine job indeed. We have: * some always super-solid supporting star players (John Goodman, Samuel L. Jackson), * an acclaimed indie actress offering some feminine beauty (Brie Larson), * also always-reliable surprise player who can do both drama and comedy (John C. Reilly), * and a bunch of good likable actors that you are sure you know from somewhere, even if you can't recall the names (such as Tom Hiddleston – Loki from Thor"", Corey Hawkins, John Ortiz, Toby Kebbell – doubling as a motion capture actor for Kong, Shea Whigham et al).The only odd choice is to criminally underuse China's rising star actress Tian Jing. She's here but can't do much. She's not used to add beauty, she's not gonna offer some kick-ass action scenes as in The Great Wall"" alongside Matt Damon. Why cast her at all if you have no need for her?What's surprising is that actors are not here just to hold our attention between grand action setpieces. Their performances have heart and persuasiveness which is something of an achievement, considering that much of their acting time was probably spent in front of the empty green canvas. John C. Reilly is the main man here actually, he has the meatiest character and also the side-mission to act as a comic relief without turning into a joke. As usual, I love him and what he does with the material. Just the perfect balance between obscure, funny and crazy.The monsters look awesome as well and meeting them is worth your time and ticket money. I watched Kong: Skull Island"" in IMAX and 3D, and both have actually been put to good use here. But I am sure everything looks good in standard"" 2D as well. ""Skull Island"" sure is a looker, not only monsters and fighting but the locations as well which make everything look truly epic. Filmed in Hawaii, Vietnam and Australia by the way.The only reason I am not willing to give the result a higher score is the screenplay. It's just a bunch of old tired clichés and, to add insult to the injury, the story has been left to sit uncomfortably between two different chairs in at least two important aspects. Firstly, the story's is too clichéd and unoriginal to really grab any adult viewer BUT there's too much violence to gladly recommend it as a family thing. Secondly, the plot moves constantly between being very serious and just light-hearted which makes it uneven and sometimes hard to take.In my mind, they should have modernized soldier characters, right now it feels like anachronism – something from old Kong movies. The army marches in and just tries to destroy everything which feels pretty disgusting in the enlightened"" times of 21st century. If it wasn't all so serious, at least it could be taken as social commentary or black comedy or something. Even Jurassic's and Godzilla's latest outings have fresh-er approach to monster movies which involves more than senseless killing.So you will get an odd combo where mindless destruction alternates with light-hearted adventure. Is it really proper approach for PG-13 family movie? Am I too sensitive here?","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

The cinematography of the island is very pretty and with the exception of few scenes look very real. Yet, all the characters, with the exception of Samuel L. Jackson and John C Reilly, are fairly basic. Brie Larson doesn't get much to do which is a shame and Tom Hiddleston has a cool action scene but have no depth as a character. Some of the decisions made by the characters made little sense and had me and my friends puzzled and laughing at some stupid moments. I like the island and all the different monsters, especially Kong. Kong is the best part of the film, and every scene with him is very good. Though they hardly go into the ""humanity"" of Kong which previous versions, Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong particularly, did very well. Overall I enjoyed the film, but wish there was more in the character department for me to connect with. Bring the popcorn and stay to the end of the credits.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

Though the largest ape to ever live (At least in movies) was so popular in Hollywood and appeared time to time on the screens was last seen in 2005 with Peter Jackson behind the script. Jordan has given some new colors to the original Kong with a modulated script.Unlike other Kong movies or monster movie you don't have to wait long to meet Kong instead he shows up in the first scene itself. Though Kong's screen presence is reduced, still he impresses us whenever he shows up. The fights between Kong and the other monsters are a treat to watch.Since frame one the movie is on the script. The character introductions are crisp and fast. We land in Skull Island within the first 15 minutes into the movie. The enchanting visuals keep the audience hooked. Jordan along with Larry Fong has captured the island with some appealing visuals. The slow motion effect adds up to the excitement.The monsters that pop up time to time enthralls and we could here wows now and then in the theatre. The final battle between Kong and the Skull Crawler is the top notch. Apart from all the background score is the best thing I enjoyed about the movie. The songs like Jefferson Airplane (""White Rabbit""), Black Sabbath (""Paranoid""), Creedence Clearwater Revival (""Bad Moon Rising"") and David Bowie (""Ziggy Stardust"") were used to perfection.Lags: Though the movie is great up to some extend it does have many down falls. The story doesn't fall in line and the editing adds up to the misery. Few forced scenes might raise our doubt over the perfection of the movie.The movie has a strong cast, but except Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reily no one has much to offer (Only for marketing). Apart from all Kong is not so emotional this time which is rather unlikely in Kong movies. He just shares a brief moment with Brie where she touches him, but that isn't emotional.At times some funny one liners are thrown in but fades before it settles down. The slow motion effect is good, but a little too much.Final words: Lags apart Kong: Skull Island is a must watch if you love monster movies. Children would love it and are advised to watch it with parent – The movie is violent (A little). The post credits show that more monster movies are to follow and next time it would be a fight between Godzilla and the Kong.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

I have good news for you: the big ape of Kong: Skull Island hits the screen immediately before the opening credits in all his grandness, and appears constantly throughout the film with constant action and explosions in the mix. Yet even without the ape on screen all the time, the amount of swords, flames, helicopters, bombs, and Skullcrushers satisfactorily draw out everything moment by moment in an approach comparative to various scenes in Apocalypse Now.So whether if you're a millennial or a baby boomer, the action should satisfy. Standard to the tradition of Skull Island, other behemoths are accompanied to confront both Kong and the humans in search for him. These camouflaged beasts include a swamp ox, a log insect, a giant spider amongst a bamboo forest, reptilian birds, and a kraken who becomes Kong's dinner. Other colorful sights on this god forsaken island range from the mesmerizing northern lights to the horrific pale-tinted mass grave of great ape skeletons, creating a believable look to a testing world against man's successes.Would such an experience keep you talking in the long run? Will you get pumped for Kong's eventual confrontation against Godzilla?Well, let's rewind the clock to answer that question, shall we?As the movie starts, a World War II soldier crash lands on a deserted island in 1944, only to come face to sword against a Japanese warrior. Compared to past King Kong movies, this slightly different period setting receives a rather poor treatment; I mean, when the first five minutes persuades us to cheer on a US soldier fighting against one of the Pearl Harbor bombers, has racism really changed at all by 2017 standards?Then the opening credits shows historical footage of man's scientific progress up until 1973. Then we see a researcher intent on proposing a government-funded trip to an unexplored destination named ""Skull Island,"" the one island God did not finish creating. They compare it to the Bermuda Triangle, as nobody has ever come back alive. So right at the Vietnam War's end, a team of US soldiers, investigators, and a photographer set out to explore. Eventually they find the same soldier who crash landed in 1944, and introduce the old soldier to the worlds' robust change since he left humanity, and team up with him to head back home. Although could man really be king here? Especially when the castaway tribe worships a 200 foot tall ape?Kong may be an epic time for all you men out there, but you ladies may be napping once or twice, as your only mode of connection is Oscar winner Brie Larson (Room, Short Term 12), who exists here purely to play THAT kind of female lead. You know, the one who exists just so women have a celebrity name to gush over. The one who gets wet while wearing a skimpy gray tank top. If you're still not underwhelmed, what if I told you about her romantic subplot, one that meets absolutely no resolution?You may not even notice any predictable romantic subplot anyway, as there are so many millimeter thick cardboard cutout characters, none of which have a proper introduction to tell you who they are as human beings. Some of them are even there purely for comic relief's sake. The large cast's screen time balance of screen time has so little attention, you don't feel any hint of tension or sorrow whenever one of them gets killed or mauled.Now one question still remains: how will it be when Kong has to fight Godzilla in 2020? I can absolutely presume the fight will be epic. I mean, if Kong can deliver the nonstop action and cinematic grandness we asked for, while also learning its lessons from 2014's Godzilla, then it should turn out entertaining enough.On the other hand, if you prefer a much deeper story featuring characters who are worth cheering on, then you'd probably be better off watching Peter Jackson's version as opposed to investing in future films similar to Kong: Skull Island. It may not be a particularly good movie, nor was it trying to be, but it's still a pretty sweet thrill ride!","12 out of 25 found this helpful."

Samuel L Jackson was not great, i didn't like him in this role. I kept thinking of his lines from Pulp Fiction every time he spoke. I kept thinking he would shout out a similar line to his Snakes on a Plane signature remark. The rest of the cast was okay but some of the characters were unnecessary. That was no problem as the action spoke louder than the chance of any ruination of a movie by the same old Armageddon,Prometheus, & Interstellar dumb crew members on a super serious mission.I like the 1976 and 2005 King Kong movies too, but this one is my new favorite. I read in many reviews here that if you like this movie you must be a real dummy. I don't get why anyone would say that. This was better than the last two Godzilla movies any way you slice it. I saw this at an IMAX in Real D and it blew me away. I'll buy it on DVD when it comes out on DVD. Let the haters hate, because I predict word of mouth is going to make this a very successful film.

From an easy plot, interesting characters to the allure of the mighty Kong himself this film should satisfy. If you've had a long day and just want to watch a movie this would be the right choice. However it appears quite forgettable in terms of the other Kong movies and other films in general. King Kong has been a cinematic classic for a long time. The different story line sadly was not better than the original. The ancient people who inhabit the island and live in Kong's protection pales in comparison to the classic Kong being transported to New York and climbing to a skyscraper with the female he's fallen for as he battles planes. Peter Jackson's remake and the 1933 original are better in plot. The unusual romance was so grand and remarkable to watch. The CGI and special effects for Kong were interesting. The mythical creature closely resembled an erect male which questioned its realism. Jackson was more realistic in his portrayal of an actual beast like Kong and 1933 cannot be cited so much because special effects were limited to what they are now. In 2017 it was surprisingly unimpressive, I have a feeling that in years to come this Kong might be used as an example of how limited the effects were in the past and how far they have later come. In all these respects it definitely will be forgettable and its rating on this site might drop over time.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

It works well as the former, not so well as the latter. In the opening act and the denouement during the closing credits, when the film tries to take itself too seriously all of the flaws in the film become grating and distracting. When it is more of a comedic adventure, the flaws are not as noticeable and forgiven by the viewer. There are so many ridiculous aspects to this film that it can only work as a comedy, and John C Reilly excels in this department, in fact he brings the film to life and I started to view it as a bit of a humorous satire and thought all the opening cliches were actually meant to be clumsy and annoying; suddenly the film worked for me. Then the cringeworthy and unnecessary homecoming scene almost undid all that sentiment. Great CGI and action sequences; entertaining.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

Written by Dan Gilroy (Nightcrawler), Max Borenstein (2014's Godzilla), and Derek Connolly (Jurassic World), the movie follows a team of scientists, soldiers, and adventurers on a journey to explore a mythical, uncharted island in the Pacific, as dangerous as it is beautiful.If it was only spectacle and size that defined a great genre movie then 'Kong: Skull Island' would have had it all- unfortunately that's not the case. Size does matter, but not over and above aspects of story-telling and technicalities other than CGI, that help make a movie experience more real and involving. The representation of Kong as protector to the native tribesmen , other dwarfed inhabitants and aggressor to the bunched -up rest who puts his survival in peril, is also not clearly drawn. How does Kong differentiate between one human and the next, especially when they all come from the same group who invaded his island and made an attempt on his life? That's a question left unanswered.Although none of that should bother you.It's hard to hate on a movie that wants nothing more than to take you on a ride, and that's precisely what Kong: Skull Island does. With some truly jaw-dropping visuals from director of photography Larry Fong (of Watchmen, Lost, Super 8, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice), a colourful cast of thin but endearing characters, and some of the most bad-ass Kong action committed to the screen, Kong: Skull Island is a solidly entertaining entry in the ape's ever-expanding lore. And be sure to stay after the credits for a little tease at what's to come next from the ""MonsterVerse."" My inner-child was grinning ear-to- ear.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

No care was taken for character development. Also, it's not clear whether the focus is on the the ape or on the island itself. There is quite a bit of humor that is attempted here, but most of it comes out of nowhere and seems desperate. Samuel Jackson strikes the right tone of crazy amid the chaos, otherwise, if we check the rest of the casting crew, the acting is almost one-dimensional. The action and visuals are dazzling and immersive. Neither a sequel nor prequel, but the SFX are better, especially with Kong's CGI' close-ups. And there is no love-dove like the Naomi Watts- Kong relationship. There is some fun to be had and it's not a bad film in any way, but a film like this could have been so much better. In a nutshell, Kong: Skull Island is disposable popcorn mumbo-jumbo fare. My significant digit score: 6.4/10","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

But bigger doesn't necessarily mean better: while this latest great ape adventure is a slight improvement over Peter Jackson's bloated 2005 remake of the '33 classic, it's a monster movie desperately in need of a decent plot. The special effects laden action sequences cannot fail to impress, but the story does not.The extremely basic screenplay takes a group of scientists and soldiers, has them embark on an expedition to the titular uncharted island, where they encounter Kong, who knocks them for six. The survivors must make their way to a rendezvous point on the North side of the island, avoiding being eaten by a variety of massive creatures or getting trodden on by the oversized simian. And that's about it. Kong battles a giant octopus, a massive crab/spider attacks the humans, vicious birds swoop out the sky, and nasty lizard creatures crawl from beneath the island's surface, all of which is mindlessly entertaining, but not in the least bit inspired.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for token eye candy Brie Larson, who strips to a figure hugging vest in an attempt to distract viewers from the lack of fresh ideas.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

Without this, there is no essence, no point to the film, unless it is now wanton carnage and stupid acting. Even during the one 30 moment of mechanical romantic interlude where the girl, in absolute FEMBOT manner, touches the face of Kong, the stupid ape could not get that ""Straight Outta Compton"" look off his face!

If you're looking for compelling human characters to go with those fights, then you walked into the wrong auditorium.Kong:Skull Island is the second film in the still-forming Monsterverse, the first being 2014's Godzilla. As such, there are several threads to tie these two films together. Don't worry, there are no real spoilers here.Of course, the main point of this film is to see King Kong fight some monsters, but the story before that involves John Goodman's character, an agent of Monarch, the monster organization from Godzilla, lead an expedition to Skull Island. Ostensibly, they are there to survey an uncharted island that's been inaccessible for centuries, but as the humans soon discover there's more to the mission than first thought.To qualify the opening statement, this film is really not about any of the people shown. As such, no character is given any real development or subtext except for John C. Reilly's character, a stranded World War II fighter pilot named Marlow (read as reference to Apocalypse Now, which this film clearly emulates, down to its Vietnam-era setting and themes.) At times, the human characters get their brief hints at deep moments, dragging the scenes out too long, until some are inevitably killed by one creature or another.However, by far the best parts of this film are the creatures. Obviously Kong is the main creature, and the CGI work on him is incredibly detailed. But the other creatures as well, such as a giant water buffalo, giant spiders, and especially the lizard-like Skullcrawlers, are all entertaining to look at whether the humans are (trying) to kill them or Kong is bashing them apart.This film is really about the monsters, as well it should be. All of the great monster movies of old followed the same basic set-up. Some human story that gets characters to go on some vaguely-defined mission that quickly falls out of importance in favor of epic battle scenes between two or more monsters, broken up every so often by more human scenes which serve only as a rest break for the audience between battle scenes.This film follows that model to a tee, and in a sense is a response to criticism of 2014's Godzilla which had hardly any great battle scenes between Godzilla and the MUTOs, and too much human interaction with characters we didn't necessarily care about.The humans do indeed take more of a back seat in Kong, and there are way more creature battles and action scenes. However, the humans still have slightly too much screen time, and at these times the movie plods.Nevertheless, this film is worth it for the creature battles alone, and the end credit scene which reveals so much tantalizing promise for the future.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

But with Brie Larson along the big guy still has an eye for the ladies though he never becomes obsessed like he was with Fay Wray. It's the end of the Vietnam War, but John Goodman who's a Frank Buck type hunter and explorer with some Capitol Hill influence has gotten the government to underwrite an expedition to a newly discovered uncharted island. He's even gotten the cooperation of the government in this endeavor. An airborne squadron of paratroopers headed by Colonel Samuel L. Jackson are to give him support. These troops ain't real happy as their going stateside is being delayed.This island has all kinds of strange monsters, prehistoric hunter/gatherers. and a big ape who watches over the people and the walled stockade they've built to prevent them from being the lunch special for the monsters. They will need all that military firepower to stay alive and as you can gather very few make it out alive.One thing though, this ain't Jurassic Park where a lot of plant eating dinosaurs are around. Everybody here is a flesh eater. No wonder that vegetation is so lush and so treacherous.Kong: Skull Island I suspect will get a nomination or two in the technical categories next year.

I expected more from it, but what worked was the re-introduction of King Kong. The way he was handled was all right. I did overall liked this portrayal of Kong, he was more fierce and visceral. Even though I would have liked the movie to develop him more, since almost all of his scenes are about him doing action stuff. The very few moments when he calms down and lives normally were nice. But there wasn't enough for me to really buy into it and understand him. Because the other ""King Kong"" films do a good job of humanizing Kong so he doesn't become a generic evil monster. What makes him different compared to a lot of movie monsters is that he has a heart and some kind of emotional connection. This film would have needed to showcase more of that aspect of Kong's personality.They went the safe route with the story. I's pretty standard and predictable. It bugged me a bit because I wished they would go in a different direction. Well, they did go in a different direction... With the visual style and the tone. It's a fun and colorfully energized type of movie that doesn't take itself seriously often. I liked the few times it actually toned down and got more serious. Because a big thing this film lacked was a sense of awe and mystery. They show off Kong early on, so there's no time to build up the reveal. I like the Peter Jackson version a lot more because there's eeriness and mystery surrounding Skull Island. Just hearing about the legends of the creatures and exploring the mythology was something that I could get invested in. They leave nothing a mystery in this new film because there's much exposition on what's going on with Kong, his backstory and the different creatures on the island. Instead of gradually exploring it or having the audience realize things along the way, they spell it all out by talking about everything and not showing. Towards the final half they have some mysterious moments, but by then it was already too late for that. It spends more time trying to be retro and looking for moments to play songs from the 70's, rather than giving us a good story. The best character was John C. Reilly. I liked his story line, it was nice. Everyone else was just there basically playing themselves. Many actors were wasted. I'm looking at you Toby Kebbel. You are better than this.There is a Post-credit scene. It was OK, but underwhelming. It does promise a lot for the future and I hope they don't mess up anything they are hinting at, because it has huge potential. ""Kong: Skull Island"" is just an entertaining popcorn movie, don't expect much more. I'm happy that King Kong is back, but he deserves a better movie next time.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

So the creators of Kong: Skull Island listened.Kong Skull Island is pack with great sequences... when Kong is in the picture, its so much fun seeing him kick more monster butt on the big screen again, and the characters John C Reilly and Samuel Jackson are both great and shine in this film, and personally I thought Tom Hiddleston was a cool bad-ass who had little characterization, but lived up with his tricks.The problems are, them three I mentioned were the only ones with characterization, maybe Toby Kebball but I didn't care. The Characters are lame and bore me, I just wanted Kong, I wanted to love these characters like in Godzilla, that's why it never bored me. Another problem is, as I loved how Godzilla (2014) teased you from the beginning of a big fight but never showed adding anticipation, which is why the final battle is so AMAZING, due to its build up, if we already earlier on saw Godzilla fight, we would think ""well... I've already seen this"" But in this it shows too much Kong kicking ass that it ruined the final battle, don't worry I loved the scenes, its just that I didn't recognize that near the end, that this was a final battle as it was just the same as the earlier scenes, so it didn't wow me.But that end credits scene.... IS WORTH SPENDING ALL YOUR MONEY TO SEE Overall, it was okay and fun at points, just with big mistakes I hope they learn from it, as they seemed to listen to the Godzilla feedback.

What makes this one different? It channels ""Apocalypse Now"" big time, setting the action just after the Vietnam War and deploying a group of GIs from that conflict led by a bombastic lieutenant colonel who insists ""This is one war we're not gonna lose"" (yeh). Stupidly they start by carpet bombing Skull Island in the same way that the Americans did Vietnam with the same effect, except that this time it's not the Vietcong who are enraged but ugly, giant reptiles. I suppose another difference is that special effects have moved on, even in the decade since the last Kong movie, and there are some striking visuals and impressive CGI, but this effort is nowhere near as effective as Peter Jackson's 2005 blockbuster.The plot is minimal and the script often dire. Kong appears far too early and is not characterised as well as the three other films. And there is a massive waste of cinematic talent with the likes of John Goodman, John C Reilly, Tom Huddleston and Samuel L Jackson under-utilised and/or under- stretched, no more so than with the one female role where the talents of Brie Larson - recent Academy Award winner for ""Room"" - are squandered. If you sit through endless credits, you'll see a clip which appears to be setting up a sequel in which Kong faces off with Godzilla (apparently in a 2020 release).

(I hope this isn't considered a SPOILER) Beginning with the opening credits, displayed in a unique and original style setting the stage and explaining the plot while rapidly spanning from 1944 to 1973 as the cast is shown, the story leaps directly into the action, without all the talky exposition, while the end credits promise Things to Come. This is not only an exciting action adventure flick, but also a beautifully photographed film. Part of it is reminiscent of the WW2 movie A Walk in the Sun, and there will be many pointing out a resemblance in tone to Apocalypse Now.There were characters I hoped would survive and regretted when they didn't. A good many of them play against type, which is refreshing. Juxtaposition of some shots foreshadow later scenes. The parallels between scenes of Col. Packard and Kong in body language isn't to be missed and definitely points out these two characters' relationship.AS for the monsters themselves...original, imaginative, and definitely deadly. (Loved the giant water buffalo, by the way.) Beautiful scenery and creative filming, with unusual camera angles aren't to be missed. If I were asked,I'd nominate the cinematographer as well as the special effects people for Oscars. Having seen ALL the Kong films, from the original to the Jack Black version (which I also like in spite of critics views to ebb contrary), I easily give this one 10/10.","27 out of 52 found this helpful."

Jackson as the head of the Military team that goes in.  Instantly, the audience recognizes and understands their generic characters - based on the history of characters that these two have played - and it is like eating comfort food.  Add to this, Tom Hiddleston (Loki in the Marvel films) and Brie Larson (soon to be CAPTAIN MARVEL) as our hero and heroine, and we have a top 4 that are easy to watch and comforting in their presence.Now...add onto these 4...solid supporting characters.  From John Ortiz and Marc Evan Jackson as ""Corporate Suits"" caught in the fray to soldiers Shea Whigham, Jason Mitchell and Toby Kebbell (who also - magnificently - does the motion capture work as Kong) to Corey Hawkins and Tian Jing as young scientists, all do solid work, not a weak performance in the bunch.But the real surprise to me is the  wonderful, fun, turn by John C. Reilly as an Air Force pilot who has been stranded on the island for decades.  I blow hot and cold with Mr. Reilly's antics.  He can be very good and sympathetic (Boogey Nights, Chicago) or he can be bland when trying to be over-the-top zany (anything he does when he tries to match zany performance with Will Ferrell) but here he finds the right balance in fun, energy, pathos and grit.  He is, truly, the character I ended up rooting for in this filmClearly, the Producers (paired with the successful 2014 GODZILLA film), see a potential ""Cinematic Universe"" with these 2 characters.  Make sure you stay for the important scene at the end of the end credits - not just the ""home movies"" that are shown during the credits, but the actual scene at the end - and you will see how this film fits into the previous film and how they will be connected going forward.I, for one, am looking forward to more adventures in this Universe.Letter Grade: a solid B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)","18 out of 33 found this helpful."

With an up and coming director at the helm, a mightily impressive cast in tow and, of course, the iconic Kong himself on full show, the ingredients were there for this to be another great monster film.When a team of explorers and soldiers venture to an unchartered island in the Pacific, they get more than they bargained for when they realise the island is home to an array of giant creatures, including the mythic Kong.Let's get the few negatives I had with Kong: Skull Island out of the way first. I wasn't particularly a massive fan of how they blew their load too early by showing Kong pretty much within the first fifteen minutes, losing any sense of awe that this iconic monster deserves. Compare it to the way Gareth Edwards built up to Godzilla's reveal and it's almost as if there's a total lack of respect for Kong.Then there are the human characters and the film's screenplay, both void of any real weight. The characters are about as bland as they come and they're matched by some truly uninspired performances from the likes of Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, who really try their best with some awful dialogue. The most interesting character is Samuel L. Jackson's Preston Packard, who holds a real grudge against Kong however, they miss a chance for Jackson to go fully off the rails and his tirade against Kong comes across as half-hearted. John C. Reilly was the performance most people were worried about in this film but because of how his character is written into the film and the fact he isn't just an annoying joke machine, he is one of the best things about the film.It's easy to say this is a film about Kong so we shouldn't really worry about the human characters. If we are supposed to care about what happens to these characters then there simply has to be something about them for us to give a damn about. Unfortunately, this is a similar problem that Godzilla faced.Kong: Skull Island may be found lacking in some departments but I can't deny that there is still a lot of fun to be had with this film. Jordan Vogt-Roberts' film moves along at such a blistering pace and he certainly shows he can deliver an action sequence. I mentioned that the film lacks a sense of awe, particularly with the film moving from giant beast to giant beast so swiftly, but Vogt-Roberts manages to make amends with the final two set-pieces of the film, the final fight between Kong and a 'skull crawler' being the film's stand-out moment. Kong himself looks fantastic, brought to life through a motion-capture performance from Terry Notary, as do the rest of the visual effects, and the decision to shoot on location in places like Hawaii and Vietnam rather than in a green-screen studio amplifies the great visual effects work on this film, as does Larry Fong's cinematography.I'd have to say Kong: Skull Island left me a little disappointed, even if it does deliver plenty of action and has a post credits scene that left me excited for the future of the MonsterVerse. It certainly made me understand why there was no 'King' included in the title.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

It's a straight adventure tale featuring colossal monsters, shot in a style reminiscent of B-movies and comic books, evident in its use of Dutch angles and vivid colors. However, the inclusion of a heavy-handed Vietnam metaphor, reminiscent of ""Apocalypse Now,"" and song choices detract from the film's cohesion, serving mainly as a contrived device to contrast Kong's humanity against a villainous portrayal of Sam Jackson.While the characters fulfill their expected roles adequately, many, like Hiddleston and Larson's, feel underdeveloped and easily forgettable. The focus remains on the monsters, most of which are visually stunning and captivating, barring the unremarkable Skullcrawlers, whose introduction scene is cringe-worthy due to poorly delivered dialogue.In comparison to the new Godzilla film, this iteration of Kong stands out as a loud and proud B-movie infused with strong comic book influences, offering entertainment with a distinct style. The potential convergence of these worlds presents an intriguing prospect, as both franchises lend themselves well to an expanded universe. Ultimately, the film's essence aligns with the essence of these franchises - primed for an extended universe that embraces their nature.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

Why? Cause it sounds unique.""Is there really nobody else wondering why the actresses in a King Kong movie are so attracted to this giant ape? Honestly, I'm always asking myself the same question. Is it because Kong ""King of all places he appears in"" is such an impressive appearance, radiating power and protection? Or is it its primitive nature? No idea! But that monkey has good taste in my opinion. In every movie he's looking full of desire at the lady in distress who crossed his path yet again. Now, these are always women who'll drive that primitive monkey bananas (how appropriate). Also in this new Kong movie, the lady who's being helped by the dreaded monkey, looks breathtaking and appetizing.""Kong: Skull Island"" contains a number of successful facets I was quite enthusiastic about. Personally I thought that the soundtrack was superb. The action scenes are really masterful at times. And Brie ""The Gambler"" Larson walking around the whole movie in an undershirt, was a brilliant idea. Onslow in ""Keeping up appearances"" also wears it all the time, but isn't really a treat for the eyes. But looking at Brie Larson wearing such a piece of nothing, makes you forget there's also a giant monkey on the island. The rest isn't so impressive though. The story is quite superficial and simple. It merely serves as a steppingstone for an actionable monster story full of breathtaking graphic violence. Some ridiculous situations are of a laughable level and some scenes look as if they were copied from ""Apocalypse now"" (A kind of homage apparently). Even on the helicopters you'll see an identical sound system that spews deafening music from the 1970's, as in the mentioned milestone.Who cares? I don't. There's only one thing I expect when watching a new King Kong movie. An impressive and frightening creature. Certainly the moment he produces that famous primal roar. And to be honest, this is the first time I was wondering if it wasn't a real primate. Because it looks so lifelike. If they had made an intellectually story full of meaningful dialogues and scientific gibberish, it probably wouldn't be good either. Just compare the last ""Godzilla"" movie and this one. How many percent of screen time did Kong have in this picture compared to that other monster? In my view, it's remarkably more. You don't have to wait long for his appearance. After the entertaining second world war scene, with two rivals ending up on this cursed island (apparently there was no apocalyptic storm there at that time), you'll soon see those penetrating eyes of the giant monkey.It's the sophisticated special effects that will cause you to quickly forget about the imperfections in the story. For example, the first confrontation between Kong and the impending battalion of combat helicopters was portrayed phenomenally. But on the other hand it was so obnoxiously stupid. They are witnessing how a giant monkey destroys one helicopter after the other. Smashing every single aircraft into millions of pieces. And yet, there's no pilot who concludes that it might be better to send his heli into another direction. Away from the furious monster. Too much psychedelic music and hallucinogens during their tour in Vietnam might have something to do with it. When Brie Larson wants to lift a crashed heli just by herself so she could free a giant water buffalo, like a real animal activist, I almost choked in my popcorn.You can call most of the human characters caricatural. But in a way, they fit perfectly in this movie. Especially Samuel L. Jackson who crosses the island looking for retaliation and who's determined to kill Kong. The psychotic tirades of him with hollow expressions such as ""This is one war, we're not gonna loose"", sometimes seem pretty lame. But actually I enjoyed these silly rants. The same goes for John Goodman's character. A so-called scientist who has set up this expedition for other reasons than he initially explained. And then there's the Robinson Crusoe on duty, John C. Reilly, who has been on this island for years now and sees a possibility to escape from this hellhole (most funny personage). Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson are actually the most normal characters. One of them rolling with his muscles as a professional tracker. The other displaying some other muscles as an anti-war photographer.The rest of the cast is not that important eventually. They only serve as props and are being used as bait to the colorful collection of giant monsters. So expect a series of flying, sliced and crushed victims. But despite the thin story and the fact that human fellow actors only serve as decorative pieces, this monster film is a true spectacle. As a monster movie lover, you must admit that the battle between Kong and the giant octopus is nevertheless outstanding and fantastic enough to give you the heebie-jeebies. The teaser in the end predicts a sequel (Well,money still makes the world go round). It isn't something I'm looking forward to. But the terrifying confrontation between those two opponents, Kong and Godzilla, could use a reboot. Apparently we have to wait for that until 2020. Bring it on, for all I care.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

Having said that, as a fan of Peter Jackson's King Kong--one of my favorites films--I was disappointed when I watched Skull Island (on DVD only). I found the story not particularly engaging, nor the characters particularly likable (except Reilly). However, the monster aspect was great, and that probably is what attracts me to these movies in the first place. I would give those monster encounters a 10, and the rest of the movie a 5, hence a 7.

The action as always is centre stage, and CGI of the big monsters has little ever been done better. The Kong CGI was exceptionally good, and you actually felt a lot of empathy towards the character which was incredible instead of seeing it alone as some big graphic.The film though is carried by our leads and the storyline. Tom Hiddleston & Samuel L Jackson are excellent as hero & villain respectively on the little island with big beasties. They are given a better story than usual with a change, and it worked very well. It kept me engrossed, and any rehash of the original King Kongs etc would simply have bored me despite the action on the screen.However, there is no getting away that we've all seen too many big monster bashes in recent years. The Mavel & DC films are full of them, and as two of our leads here come from the Marvel stable, it feels like you are revising their old world. One sequence even reminded me of 300 with the slow motion hacking/slashing action scenes. That aside the rest was fine, you got to admire that they allowed it to be an adult aimed film rather than having a Disney-fied movie.As a big budget monster movie, it was good, and deserves more credit than it seems to have got so far. It's a great stab and different to the rest. If you find it to watch, give it a go.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

Well, that's not entirely the case in Kong: Skull Island.Originally titled Skull Island, this film feels much more like an exploration into the island itself than it does a King Kong film. With a run-time of 118 minutes, Kong maybe makes up about 25 minutes of that. To be fair, after several repetitive King Kong films, the franchise could use a refreshing take. But if you're going to make a King Kong film, you expect to see the giant ape more than some random humans. So, that's the first major issue.The second, and perhaps far more important, is that the script is downright awful. Even worse, the tone is all over the place. I expected that this film was going to take itself as seriously as the 2014 Godzilla film did, especially after several trailers that were clearly trying to emulate Apocalypse Now. What we got is more along the lines of the humor from a Fast & Furious movie that tries to veer into the seriousness of a DCEU film. Except, the humor never hits. My theater was packed, and not a single joke granted a crowd- wide laugh.However, the film is beautifully shot by Larry Fong and the action is impossible to take your eyes away from. Kong has never looked better, and the final fight between him and other creatures is about as impressive of an action sequence as you'll see all year. But Is it really a shock that every second Kong is on-screen is great and every time they cut to a human that you don't care about, the film dull and boring? When you have the likes of Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman, Jason Mitchell, and Toby Kebbell there should be at least one character worth rooting for, right? Well, as it turns out, John C. Reilly's 'Hank Marlow' is the only redeemable character worth mentioning. Hiddleston is useless, Jackson is way too over-the-top, Kebbell & Mitchell are annoying, and Larson is merely passable. I like all of these actors, but they got stuck with sloppily written characters that are far from fleshed out. Perhaps cutting out 5 or 6 of the leads and giving that screen time to either Kong, or to add depth to the more significant roles.I'm still invested in this ""monster-verse"" because I, like everyone else in the world, can't wait to see Kong & Godzilla duke it out for the ""King"" title in a few years. But pushing aside the main attraction for some good looking actors isn't what I want from a monster film. The thrills are a little too few and far in between.

Which, ironically, is often what this film is trying to go for. If I walked into the theater for this movie not knowing at all what it was, the first act (very first scene excluded) would make me think that it was a crappy Vietnam war film with way too many A-list actors. In reality, it is an OK monster movie with way too many A-list actors and absolutely no character development.This film started off pretty badly in all respects, but improved significantly after the actual monster came into the plot. Honestly, the monster and John C. Reilly's character are the only characters that get any real development, which is this movie's biggest problem. There are so many characters in this film, and they are all reduced to stereotypes. Tom Hiddleston is in this film just to be the handsome action hero and Brie Larson is there just to be the sexy main female lead. Larson gets no backstory whatsoever, and Hiddleston is reduced to one line that sounds like it was shoehorned in at the very last second. John Goodman's character has some backstory but he's so annoying it doesn't matter.All of the acting is mediocre, which is a shame because of the quality of actors put in this film. The only good performances are Samuel L. Jackson because he's Samuel L. Jackson, and John C. Reilly because he's occasionally funny. Other than that, good actors can be reduced to rubbish because of the bad script. Of course, this movie isn't complete garbage, and that is mostly because of the all the various monsters and explosions. Say what you will about Kong: Skull Island, but it is entertaining as hell. The monster fights are big and mindless, and that's honestly all anybody asked for when going into this film.If you go into Kong: Skull Island expecting mindless action, then you will most likely love it. However, if you watch it for literally any other reason, then you will find a mediocre monster movie that has been done a million times before.I give Kong: Skull Island a C+.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

This time, the plot takes place in 1973, after scientists discover the appearance of an island in the South Pacific that wasn't noticed before. There are a ton of links to the first movie with the mention of the Monarch corporation, the mention of nuclear tests in the 50s being an attack on monster size creatures and the mention of the sight of these monsters by more than the military.On the island, we discover that MUTOs (another nod to Godzilla) surface due to the activities of human scientific discovery causing rumblings in the Earth. A theory that the Earth is not a solid mass of rock, leading to the core of the Earth is first mentioned. When the military and the scientists arrive, Kong is the first creature noticed, and as always, the military attacks causing Kong to defend himself and kill some of the military, crashing the helicopters, and separating the people into two groups, plus one solo individual.As in Godzilla, Kong is revealed as a creature that defends the human inhabitants of the island against the monsters that dwell there. We discover massive creatures such as an octopus, a spider, and the main enemy skull creatures that keep appearing after the military bombs the island, thus getting their attention.I have never in my life rooted for Samuel L. Jackson to be killed, but oh was that satisfying. He became obsessed with killing Kong due to the initial encounter being so lethal.There is a side story of an American soldier that crashed on the island during WW2 and survived there all those years. He is used as the info dump to explain what is going on, as the natives there don't seem to speak.At the beginning of the credits there is a very sweet montage of the soldier returning home to meet, what appears to be his son. Also, the Monarch corporation seems to strengthen now that word may get out about the monster appearances.Kong defending the weak, and Godzilla defending the weak, continue to be mysterious. Three more movies exist in this universe, though at the time of this writing one doesn't come out until March 2024.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

I walked into it thinking, ""Seriously?!"" I mean, come on, it's King Kong, the sequel. How good can it be? Well apparently, actually pretty f'ing enjoyable. I am not giving it high marks because it was an Oscar Winner by any stretch, except maybe on the graphics, but I mean, that can be said for most movies these days. No, I am giving it props because I actually enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. It grabs you from the beginning and keeps hold through out. No joke, incredibly shot. Incredible respect for the director, who has apparently not done anything to this scale before far as I can tell. And Tom Hiddleston, if you haven't seen Night Manager, it will change your mind about him as an actor. Yeah, I mean he's got Loki going on, but this and that short Hulu/BBC/AMC collabo truly shows his range beyond the megalomaniac Asgardian. Really, this movie reminds me of Pacific Rim: another movie I went in with NO expectations except monster film, so no dialogue, less plot, worse acting, and somehow less direction, and like that one, I was thoroughly delighted. Maybe low expectations are best in films like this, but that's OK. I am tired of the super hyped CGI fest that promises everything and delivers nothing. Sometimes, a pleasant surprise is just what the doctor ordered, and while some of plot may be predictable, that still does not take away from you caring about the characters and hoping that they manage to survive what should be a no-win scenario, and getting your kicks from a few well placed jump scares, tremendous photography, and, I feel, poignant commentary on the human condition. If you're not into monster films though, this may not be for you. But if you have an inkling for giant impossible beings kicking the crap out of each other and puny humans caught in the middle, you just may want to give this a chance....","4 out of 5 found this helpful."

All of them, bar one, think they're going for geological or scientific study but it's not long before they come face to face with the island's bigger inhabitants.'Kong : Skull Island' does what it says on the tin. It's about a huge monster, with other huge monsters, on a mysterious island containing spectacular and foreboding landscapes, and how human beings who we don't care about, get eaten, squashed, blown up and human beings we do care about manage to escape to tell the fantastical tale to an unsuspecting world.All of the above is what you go for and all of the above is what you get when you watch this. One criticism is that a little more character development would have been welcome. Some of the cast feel like they're giving lacklustre performances here. The only one who really grabs me is John C. Reilly, playing a Ben Gunn type character who has been marooned away from civilisation for many years. His craziness and openness makes him likable but Reilly also adds the right amount of pathos when his character reveals his thoughts about the wife he left behind and the son that he's never seen.The special effects are good and I did find myself rooting for Kong in some of the fight scenes, with a self satisfied, smug look on my face when he wins the day (that's not a spoiler because it's a given that Kong will survive and win, he's Kong). The fight scenes are good although I don't think they're quite as good as the ones in the most recent Godzilla.Overall, a decent effort but I expect better from the next Kong movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

Reilly from Talladega Nights and a host of other things, and John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson who both need no introduction.The Kong story has been done time and again, most recently in 2005 with Jack Black. This version was a lot less drama and more action. They didn't dink around in this movie with delaying the unveiling of Kong, rather they gave us a glimpse early so as to not keep us in rapt anticipation like the '05 version. In that respect, they did well. But, the one consistent trope that is a constant bummer for me is the damsel in distress that Kong is enamored with. They downplayed that dynamic this time around so that the quasi-love affair/love triangle wasn't the story but it still had a part. I'm just not moved by the beast being tamed by the delicate white woman.""Kong: Skull Island"" offered a lot of ooh and aah moments, some obligatory humor and a strong anti-war message. I had no problems with any of it although they made Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) so over the top with his dogged pursuit of military action as the answer that it detracted from the movie.I liked this version better than the '05 one and I can't remember the '76 version that well. With reference to Kong as a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Object (M. U. T. O.) we can probably expect him to have an eventual showdown (or tag team effort) with Godzilla. That is a battle I'd pay to see.","2 out of 7 found this helpful."

It stars a lot of people, including, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman and John C. Reilly as a group of scientists and soldiers exploring a mysterious island. I've seen the main Kong films throughout the years and I have to say I do enjoy the concept of people finding an enormous gorilla on a primeval island; I always remember when I was younger being creeped out by Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong and at one point was quite obsessed with it; since then I've enjoyed the 1933 original and even watched the not-so-good 1976 attempt. Now though we see a different take on the character, one set in the 70s, and of a larger world.I'll start with what I enjoyed, and first and foremost would be both the soundtrack and original score. Being set in the 70s, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts gives us some great pieces of music to accompany various scenes giving the film an upbeat, feel-good vibe, similar to that of Guardians of the Galaxy, or The Martian. And Henry Jackman delivers a well-composed dramatic score which includes some 70s vibes.Another thing to enjoy is that this film is full of really cool moments; scenes or shots that intend for you to be awed. Whether it be a silhouette of choppers flying towards Kong or just the animals and people of the island being framed through the Brie Larson character's 1970 era camera lens which makes for a really nice touch. Vogt- Roberts certainly has an eye for interesting and unique camera set ups and there were some great ones in here I really loved as well as some epic wide shots that you could just frame.Now unfortunately it's these amazing moments and ""awe shots"" that sort bring the movie down for me. While it's great to have those kind of scenes, you can't rely on them. Kong: Skull Island was visually stunning, almost to a surreal sense at times, adding to the island mystery, but as far as story and script goes, it was a bit underdeveloped. For the first two-thirds of the movie it felt like the story was just quickly written dialogue to get us from one cool shot to the next. The characters hardly had any development and surprisingly the most fleshed-out and interesting character was John C. Reilly's Hank Marlow. Although Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson are certainly great actors and look great, their characters were very one-dimensional. Hiddleston's was a generic former military hunter/tracker man with convenient skills and Larson's was a photographer, and that was pretty much it. Sam Jackson and John Goodman are also great actors and have delivered some incredibly iconic characters but here even they almost seemed expendable at points.So although the film is let down script-wise and is quite unevenly paced throughout most of it the final third is really good as it flows much better and the creature is design is amazing. Kong looks great, as well as some of the other fearsome creatures that inhabit the island but the stand-out for me were the disturbingly hideous Skull Crawlers whose mere existence you were thankful were only fictional.In the end Kong: Skull Island isn't quite what I expected it to be but it is a great-looking monster-movie and even has an after-credit scene for those who like to get excited for what's to come.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

Reilly and the beloved Samuel L. Jackson.Predominantly set in 1973, the flick follows a purpose-built team of soldiers, scientists and stragglers as they head for the undiscovered Skull Island in search of the unknown. Here they stumble upon a beast trapped on the island known as Kong - a potentially misjudged anti-hero.Highly-anticipated by many, this sequel was - in my mind - always going to be either a complete masterpiece or bucketful of disappointment. To my surprise(/delight/sadness), it turned out to be neither. Whilst on the most part I would praise its' solid cinematography (some beautiful landscape and action shots), as well as Kongs' expert-use of CGI throughout, these couldn't save it from what appeared to me a watered-down premise with fortune-cookie-clichés being pulled out of a hat and inserted into every appropriate crevice.The acting standard as a whole is admittedly not bad - I have to give particular nod to Samuel L Jackson for finally producing a well played-out character (seriously, name me a role he's played well since Django Unchained and I'll be a monkey's uncle) - but I can't particularly criticise much of the performances throughout. Toby Kebbell (yes, that guy that's been in everything recently that you never remember the name of) and Brie Larson were probably the most bland - with Tom Hiddleston outshining most of his fellow cast members.The fight scenes were indeed the most entertaining part - well-timed, well thought-out and, at times, epic! Other than a slight overuse of slow-motion features, and a couple of ridiculous shots, I honestly quite enjoyed seeing not only the fights with Kong himself but the other internal exchanges (no spoilers, I promised!).Also, entirely blameless of the creators, but yet another movie this season with the insertion of JFK, Vietnam and 60's culture was really not needed (sorry guys!). Despite this, it redeemed itself slightly with some fairly enjoyable music throwbacks. Alongside these were plenty of well-utilised sound-effects and editing that I found rather enjoyable (a complete renunciation from the script).I was pleasantly surprised to find Kong: Skull Island didn't leave me wanting 2 hours of my life back; that said, given the choice I wouldn't waste another two rewatching it. Okay to pass the time, Kong exists. If you're after something more worthwhile, perhaps skip this and shove on Predator (terribly brilliant) or Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus (brilliantly terrible).showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/review-kong-skull-island.html","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

The goal? Bring together various properties based on massive city-stomping creatures and remake them for modern audiences. And here, just a few short years later, we have the long-awaited second chapter in this expanding franchise- 2017's hammy and quirky, but fairly entertaining ""Kong: Skull Island"", based of course on the classic character King Kong of cinematic royalty.Directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, the film is very much a sort-of throwback feature, taking notes and inspiration from various trashy B monster-movies of the 60's, 70's and 80's and giving them a modern day spit-and-polish with top-notch CGI and A-list on-screen talent. The result is a troubled but fun little excursion into the unknown, with all the old tropes and clichés that we know and (maybe) love and plenty of contemporary action and effects. Really, the film is your basic creature feature and your enjoyment will be heavily reliant on your love for the old stereotypes contained within. If you can have fun with the material and look past its faults and occasional over- reliance on what's come before, you'll have a fun time. If not? Well, you best steer clear.We follow a motley crew of characters in the 1970's from all walks of life... researchers, soldiers, a magazine photographer and a no- holds-barred anti-hero animal tracker- as they travel to the mythical ""Skull Island"", seemingly on a mission map out the only recently discovered landmass before the Russians. However, upon arrival, things take an interesting turn when it is discovered that the island is home to not only a local tribe of natives, but massive creatures of all types- including a great ape known as ""Kong."" Teaming up with a marooned World War II veteran, the group is forced into a fight to escape... but at the same time, a nefarious and over-the-edge Colonel amongst their numbers has his sights set on Kong for his own dark reasons...To get it out of the way, the cast is great for the most part. There's a lot of really solid performers here. From the likes of cinematic icons such as Samuel L. Jackson and John Goodman to modern day superstars like Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston... to comedy powerhouses like John C. Reilly, everyone is on point and giving it their all. While I do think some of the minor supporting characters and performances come up short (Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham in particular both being shockingly flat in comparison to their other work as soldiers along for the mission), all the lead players do very good work here and are a joy to watch. Terry Notary and Toby Kebbell (who also plays one of the soldiers) provide the various motion capture techniques that bring Kong to life, and to be fair, Kong and their combined performances are quite stunning. While his screen time is limited, Kong feels like a real living, breathing being and you do get some real emotion from his character. While I could nit-pick and argue that I preferred the character as he was portrayed in the previous 2005 reboot... Kong is definitely in good hands in the MonsterVerse.And when the film reaches its stride, it's just consistently fun and completely engaging. Director Vogt-Roberts delivers some wonderful visual powerhouse sequences of Kong and the other monsters of Skull Island going at it, and a few genuinely eerie moments as the characters struggle to survive. A stand-out scene involving a 10-story spider was among my favorite moments, as was a chilling bone-year chase sequence as our heroes must evade enormous underground creeps known as ""Skull Crawlers."" It's when the action picks up that the film started to win me over big-time, and I'm thankful that this point is reached relatively early on. However, the film is not perfect by a long stretch, and looking over the other reviews, I can definitely see the problems. In striving to make such a fun throw-back feature, the creative minds behind ""Kong"" do shoot themselves in the foot more than once. We've seen this story before. We know these types of characters. And we've all witnessed these very same dialog exchanges and bar-room brawls and epic battles many times before. It can make the film a chore in its earlier scenes, and rob some of the suspense because we know what's coming much of the time. It can be fun in how archetypal it all is... but it can also be quite frustrating. In addition, the writing for the bulk of the supporting roles is pretty abysmal, with the many side-characters feeling vapid and interchangeable, which lessens the impact of the film. The intent is noble, but the execution leaves quite a bit to be desired at times.Still, I had a decent time. The effects are outstanding, the performers likable and the monster battles completely and utterly glorious in their scale. ""Kong: Skull Island"" isn't the best film starring the massive monkey (I know he's not really a monkey)... but it's serviceable enough and sets the stage for other monsters to join in on the fun. It's a fun time at the movies. Nothing more. Nothing less. And so, I give it an about-average 6 out of 10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

Nonetheless, it is a satisfying experience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3663683/?ref_=tt_urv","Screen_Blitz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24623283/?ref_=tt_urv","16 March 2017","As an average monster B-movie, Kong: Skull Island does about everything it sets out to do. It is fast-paced, it is thrilling, and it is pure eye candy in terms of special effects. But when it comes to leveling up with previous iterations like the Peter Jackson installment back in 2005, it is perhaps less than successful as was Gareth Edward's 'Godzilla' in reaching the heights of the original Godzilla. Jordan Vogt-Roberts takes the director's chair to deliver an extravagant re-imagination of the giant gorilla. Blending in eye-popping special effects, visual spectacle, and sleek anti-war commentary, Roberts places the story of the giant gorilla in 70s Vietnam War period with visual heft that pays clear nods to Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' while attempting to retain the spirit of the popular Hollywood ape. Set in 1973, this film follows Bill Randa (played by John Goodman), a senior government official who leads a group of soldiers including British Air Service Captain James Conrad (played by Tom Hiddleston), U.S Army Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (played by Samuel L. Jackson), and U.S Army Major Jack Chapman (played by Toby Kebbell) along with a team of young soldiers and photojournalist Mason Weaver (played by Brie Larson) to an uncharted Pacific island where they encounter vicious creatures. Of course, the biggest threat of the island happens to be giant gorilla the size of a skyscraper who unleashes hell upon their arrival. With the help of World War II veteran Hank Marlow (played by John C. Reilly) who's been stranded on the island for nearly three decades, it is up to the big group to escape the island while surviving against the violent Gorilla and monstrous creature onslaught.There is definitely nothing special or subversive about Jordan Vogt-Roberts, and the quality of his direction is predictably undermined by the previous iterations of titular gorilla. Roberts's execution for the popular source material is bit more blockbuster-ized than what Hollywood has spawned in the past. When it comes to delivering the thrills however, gets the job done. The plot quickly kicks into gear during the first half-hour when the ensemble cast of characters arrive on the island in helicopters, and the thirty-story gorilla appears out of nowhere swatting the helicopters from the air, blowing them in smithereens. The tension only heats up when the cast is forced to face down a wide variety of freaky creatures including carnivorous pterodactyls and boney dinosaur-like creatures that eat humans for breakfast. And this is all complete with slick CGI and a wide plethora of explosions to feast the eyes. There is definitely a Jurassic Park vibe to handed here. Characters are attacked, some of them are eaten, and the there is a grueling creature-on-creature battle that erupts during the final stretch. Underneath it all is a hodgepodge of anti-war commentary and morality issues toward the end that play roles in the story, and Roberts does not hesitate to spew a few homages of old Vietnam War flicks from the 80s era. It is easy to interpret to story as a B-monster movie decorated as a war flick. In terms of characterizations, the majority of the characters who sadly depth, with only Samuel L. Jackson's Preston Packard and John C. Reilly's Hank Marlow only being well developed. And it is the latter that serves as the show-stealer of the pack. Sprouting with charisma and kind-hearted humor, Reilly gives arguably the biggest appeal. The rest of the cast give some alright performances, but it does little to redeem for the shallow development. Kong: Skull Island is an exhilarating monster flick blooming with thrills, shiny special effects, and a direction that fairly pays off. This rendition of the popular primate is far from a game-changer nor does it try to be one. To say the least, it is a fun pre-Summer flick. If you are craving to see a giant gorilla the size of a skyscraper wrecking havoc and smashing creatures to oblivion, this one will make that investment.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

Of course this movie isn't a serious drama and has some flaws, but I found it fun and entertaining nonetheless. It's not as bad as it is made out to be. Sure like all movies of this genre you have to turn off your brain and suspend all disbelief, but isn't that why we go to the movies in the first place? To escape reality? Like I said, I found this movie fun, entertaining, and a fast-paced ride. The cast was good and played their roles adequately. I also enjoyed some of the humor to the movie as well. Though, I have to admit I would like to see more of Tom Hiddleston's and Brie Larson's characters. Hopefully they are in a sequel. I thought the film made Kong out to be more of a protective guardian type which was alright with me. I liked to see a few more of the secondary character live. But, all in all, I enjoyed it. I guess if I had a complaint it would have been the lack of other prehistoric monsters in it. But, otherwise this is pure mindless, entertaining fun and should be viewed as such. Is it perfect no, but it is entertaining. The last time I listened to a critic about a movie I was bored out of my mind. So, if you want serious, critically acclaimed drama, this is not for you. But if you just want pure, dumb fun and action, this will fit the bill nicely.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

Kong: Skull Island has thinly written characters, extreme tonal dissonance, bad dialogue, and a complete and utter disregard for the talents of Oscar-winning actress Brie Larson, but it's absolutely glorious in its brazen spectacle. Its thin characters and tonal dissonance don't matter as much because it thoroughly commits to its premise, and it seems like the movie is one ridiculous–but hilarious–visual gag after another. The bad dialogue is all part of the fun. It's not trying to be something it's not, and that's something I appreciate in any movie, especially a nostalgia-laced B-movie blockbuster about a giant ape.Some might draw connections to the time era explored or the interplay between man and nature, but the movie succeeds at its main goal: entertain the hell out of the audience. Actors like Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson are (pretty) pieces of cardboard in this, but seasoned vets like Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly thoroughly understand what it is they're being asked to do. They both ham it up big time, with Vogt-Roberts's visual flourishes adding to their performances in beautiful ways throughout. They both give pitch perfect performances that are 100% appropriate for their roles, and Reilly in particular becomes the heart and soul of the story. As an actor, the best response to a movie like this is to embrace the ridiculous, and Jackson and Reilly certainly do.However, the ridiculous can sometimes move aside to reveal a visually stunning movie with a large heart. The production design is gorgeous, and the classic shot–a character whose back is turned to us, staring up in awe and fear at Kong–is breathtaking. The movie itself has that type of reaction to its own character, to its own force of nature, looking up in wonder and childish glee as Kong destroys another piece of its surroundings. This is big, bold, and confident filmmaking, precisely because the movie understands what it's not.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."
"6","/10","A much different take on the King Kong franchise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3660695/?ref_=tt_urv","eparazak","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur71275352/?ref_=tt_urv","12 March 2017","After the Vietnam war, a team of scientists and military men investigate an uncharted island full of ferocious monsters including an ape named Kong.This movie acts as a new installment to the King Kong franchise, an a much different take at that. Personally, I'm one of those people who wasn't extremely fond of the 2005 King Kong remake and because of that, I was anticipating this movie. Unfortunately, it ended up being a mixed bag.To start with the bads, I found some of the green-screening way too obvious. This trend can first be seen during the beginning of the movie as some of the backgrounds don't match up with ones from the last or next shots, as an example. Another issue I had was with the ending. Without spoiling anything, I have to say that the ending of the movie feels unfinished; it left me confused and had me asking myself: ""Wait, that's it?"" However, my main issue with the movie is that despite the fact that the movie's title has the name Kong in it, we barely see him outside of the beginning and ending, and that's pretty disappointing for me. As someone who wanted to see more of King Kong throughout the film, it kind of is a letdown to see that he only has very few appearances. My final complaint has to be that the movie feels too different from its previous installments. When you go into a remake or reboot of an older movie, you'd expect them to at least somewhat follow the formula of the original work. That's not the case here, as it seems like the film is trying to be its own thing. Granted, they do pay homages to the original movie, but it doesn't save this from being one of the movie's weaknesses.Now let's take a look at the goods. To start, the environments were beautiful. The movie gives us a breathtaking look at an uncharted island and it makes you want to see it for yourself. Another strength of the movie has to be the action scenes. The action scenes just looked plain awesome and they were the highlight of the film. The action scenes had a lot of engaging and gripping moments that left me on the edge of my seat. I don't want to spoil the movie, so if you'd like to watch the action scenes in this, then you should go see it for yourselves. The last strength of the movie is that it feels different; it's both the film's strength and weakness. The only real positive I can say about the movie being different is that it does a great job at being its own thing.Overall, I find the movie to be a mixed bag. I like the action scenes, environment and the fact that it's trying to do something different with the franchise; although that is a weakness as well as the fact that we don't see the star very often.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

Though the movie was equipped with an outstanding line up of actors, the abundant action and vehemence that followed the monster formulaic plot created chaos in individual performances. The Skull Island expedition crew included a group of militants lead by Preston Packard(Samuel L Jackson), some geologists who look nothing like geologists, the 'experienced' James Conrad(Tom Hiddleston) recruited by Bill Randa (John Goodman) and a beautiful anti-war photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). They all shared a common trait - idiocy !◘Half of their team bit the dust combating Kong, a quarter of the rest were eaten by ""Skull crawlers' (it's a really cool name) and still Sam Jackson wants to hunt the mighty King. In short the cast reflected a bunch of morons mimicking each other at the time of a Jurassic Park situation. BTW, this felt like a Jurassic Park 3 rip off! ◘3D was spectacular. Monsters had a decent amount of screen time (unlike Godzilla). The sound effects were good.. So, where technicality prevailed, cliché deep rooted and story sucked.

First, this movie's violence is extremely well used, placed, and made. The CGI in this movie was some of the best I have literally ever seen. Coming from the guy who thought Tarkin in Rogue One was amazing. The next best thing in this movie is the acting, and before you think this guy has some low standards listen. This movie is not supposed to be an ""acting movie."" the characters are there to have five or six to like and one or two to love. and this casting assemble killed this and understood that. This is a person who loves retro, throwbacks, and all styles paradise. REASONS I LOVED IT!! ONE - They toned down the love affair between the lead female charter and kong. TWO - The two leads that so happen to be opposite genders don't have to fall in love. THREE - Kong, for the most part, is saving HIS ISLAND more than the humans. FOUR - The movie realizes that it's not a FREAKING REALISTIC MOVIE!! You can have things like a man using a samurai sword and unconventional uses of violence to make it BADASS (ONE OF THE MAIN REASON Tarantino IS LOVED SO MUCH!!!) FIVE - it's downright hilarious in so many scenes. If you hate movies designed for just making money and love to see an original action-packed film this comes both in such an amazing way.","24 out of 48 found this helpful."

The underlying and rather obvious justification is to make way for a future crossover with another tired franchise (hello Godzilla) as money-making scheme - the same way Marvel has been doing for the past decade, revisiting, rebooting and ultimately exhausting Spider Man's and Hulk's properties.On paper I blamed this reboot, seeing as Peter Jackson's 2005 passion project was both overlong and over-the-top but fun and engaging in equal measure. He provided an ambitious scope, not only on a technical level, to an iconic property rendering a product that is proud and respectful of its legacy but also autonomous on its own.This 2017's outing however lacks both the same comprehensive talent and commitment and, just 12 years after that last successful adaptation, feels rather soon and unnecessary. For entertainment purposes though, all this reasoning and opposition could be waived if done right - and for a moment, as the first promotional materials started emerging (specially an astounding first trailer), it seem like it was. Nevertheless, Kong: Skull Island is guilty of not only proving those initial fears right, as it is of being utterly pedestrian and cheesy to an annoying degree.The story (save for the time setting), the functional autopilot characters and the motivations are the same and nothing shows a glimmer of originality or audacity. Don't get me wrong, that is not necessarily a bad thing - some summer blockbusters and recent entertainment tent poles have had the same approach with very enjoying results (Prometheus did that for me, for instance). I found myself continuously trying to find a saving grace for Kong: Skull Island, because the seamlessly magnificent cinematography and direction (of the action scenes particularly) kept me interested, kept me awed, kept me rooting - all to the point where the film had spiraled out of control into pure formulaic tawdry formula beyond redemption. The film knows it is cheesy and Vogt knows that's its selling point and that's what we came for but the forceful toleration of suspension of disbelief and exaggeration beyond reason implies we have ever cared for any of the human characters or for the central Kong, a misunderstood hero and protector. But no, we have never cared.","6 out of 13 found this helpful."

We have a script that innovates within the franchise, because even without the ""King"" in the name, Kong is king of an island and fight against Cajus - no dinosaurs this time - the script innovates and at the same time we all know their endings, The film tells the story of researcher Bill Randa (John Goodman), who in 1973 departed to explore an island that until then is isolated and unknown to the rest of the world. We have a very digital photograph, the chroma key jumps, and Kong's scanning is not very perfectionistic, sometimes even to notice its pixelization, and we also have the old focus on the sun of the apocalypse now - After all, we have references to war Of Vietnam - references that are wide open in their soundtrack, with a good rock of the 70s, its assembly is good, its rhythm does not get to mesmerize but it pleases, and its direction of art desires, its camera angles are great , Focus on the eyes creating a Mexican stalemate between Kong and his ""Enemies"", to the best style - Guarding the due proportions - Sergio Leone. We have one of the best blockbuster films I've seen that goes from John Goofman to Brie Larson, to Samuel L. Jackson and Tom Hiddleston, but incredible as it may seem, this cast is completely expendable, John Reilly even does A good performance, and Samuel Jackson is the least worst as ever, Oscar winner Brie Larson seems to have no desire at all, but let's give a discount, fianl this movie is from Kong, the gorilla now bigger than normal goes well, Despite the regular quality of its effects, it punches, kicks, picks up trunk, judo punches and detonates Cajus, that is, plays its role. ""Kong"" is a film for the nostalgic of monsters or for those who want to enjoy a Sunday afternoon with the family, because it is fun and good to watch and not even that bad.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

At some stage, I couldn't understand what the mission was because it got very confusing and plain. Looking at the positives though, CGI was totally top notch, Kong was scary, powerful and his engagements with other creatures were very interesting. Acting was also OK, Tom Hiddleston & Samuel L Jackson delivered, the other actors weren't bad either.

A worthy reboot (remake) of the very famous monster! I was very very entertained with this movie. It was full of surprising scenes and many crazy fight scenes between Kong and the soldiers, plus Kong and other monsters. The special effects of this movie were absolutely wonderful. Kong was created using motion capture techniques and the rest of the monsters were very lifelike (and scary). The sound effects were very good. There were so many moments where we would be surprised by the sudden movement (with those shocking sounds) during the movie. What I loved about the movie was also the essence of King Kong story line like in previous movies were also captured, such as Kong's fight with major monsters, the intention of people to conquer him and even his fascination to the female character. And the time of the story which was in the 1970s also added a nice oldies feel to the movie. My wife also highlighted that she felt the movie was having a real 1970s sense which I think was due to the good make up (1970s hair style, suits) and equipments like the old choppers or Walkie Talkie you would usually see in movies with Vietnam wars.Another thing that I loved about this movie was that the introductions of the characters did not take too long and it was moving in quite fast pace to the main story in the island. The film was almost perfect in providing nonstop entertainment and my wife and I also really enjoyed the full movie. At the top I have mentioned that the movie is a worthy reboot since I believe this movie excel in comparison to the 2005 version. Despite that movie's quite loyal to the earlier 1930s and 1970s versions, I felt that the 2005 movie was not giving the wow factor and scary feeling of what King Kong was supposed to make to audience. Anyway, in conclusion to this movie, I definitely say it is one of the coolest action monster movie. There was not a lot of drama in it, just pure adrenaline pumping action film. The movie also had some brief funny moments and touching moment before the end. Oh before I forgot, this movie has got a post credit scene. So better watch out for it coz the scene would provide you some very interesting insight and exciting future films. So for those of you who had not seen the movie yet, please make sure you watch it as I am sure you would be very entertained with this film. Those who prefer to watch drama or romance or Oscar winning movie, then I would recommend to see it without over thinking and just enjoy the movie.For my complete review: Pls see michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id","24 out of 48 found this helpful."

I enjoy creature movies. Even as a kid I enjoyed creature movies (as distinguished from monster movies, which I'm also fond of). From the classics to the (very) low budget ones on late night TV to the fear-mongering from Japan  I enjoy them all. Of course the most fascinating of the bunch is King Kong, and this version arrives 84 years after the still magnificent 1933 version from Merian C Cooper and featuring Fay Wray.This time there is no shootout on The Empire State Building, and the connection between Kong and the girl is limited to a few knowing glances. Most of the film takes place on Kong's island  one he shares with some other creatures (not rodents) of unusual size. Unlike Spielberg in Jaws, who teased us for half the movie before finally revealing the shark, we get a glimpse of the imposing Kong very early on.The cast is the best yet for a creature feature. John Goodman and Corey Hawkins play scientists/conspiracy theorists; Tom Hiddleston plays the world's only mercenary with perfect hair and skin; Brie Larson is a self-described anti-war photographer; while Samuel L Jackson, Shea Whigham, Thomas Mann and Toby Kebbell play military men on their last mission at the end of the Vietnam War. The most colorful character is played by John C Riley – an eccentric WWII survivor who has been living on the island since 1944.Jordan Vogt-Roberts directs this version, and his resume of The Kings of Summer and mostly TV work begs the question of how the heck did he get this gig? Fortunately he has cinematographer Larry Fong alongside, and his significant big action picture experience is obvious in the breath-taking helicopter scene (as well as many others). It's impossible not to notice the extreme love shown to Apocalypse Now and even Jurassic Park. Some of the shots and tone seem as if pulled directly from those films  even moreso than the original King Kong. We even get Samuel L Jackson recycling his ""hold onto your butts"" line.There is plenty here to satisfy us lovers of creature features, though this version certainly lacks the emotional impact of Fay Wray and Naomi Watts connecting with Kong ... not much Beauty, but plenty of Beast. It's certainly recommended that you stay for the post-credits scene that sets the stage for 2020.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

The plot is fast-paced from start to finish; you won't see much fillers or subplots in this movie - lots of roaming and running around in the jungle with non-stop action.

The monster battles were also amusing.There is really nothing in the movie that we haven't seen before in past King Kong films, but have to see this one is miles better than Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of the original 1933 classic.Grade B-","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

The editing is too quick, each shot lasting 2 seconds and switching to a completely different scene. There was too many narratives happening at once, too many characters to focus on at once, the writing was very predictable and there were far too many unnecessary cliché lines. However, the biggest downfall of this film was Samuel Jackson overacting, don't get me wrong, he's a good actor but he never should of been in this film. The combination of the directors choices and his character just didn't work. The only good bits of this film was the beautiful scenes between Kong, Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson. I expected more of this film, instead all I got was a typical Hollywood 'guns out' rewrite.","6 out of 13 found this helpful."

Basically because it makes Kong feel like a towering monster!But it has its issues. The movie lacks a good dialog. It could have used some catch-phrases to give it some appeal. And although the character development wasn't bad, it needed an identifiable main character.The film, at times, also insults our intelligence. Basically, if a pilot sees a helicopter get swatted down by a huge monster, perhaps the other pilots would change course or retreat! Or at least be smart enough not to fly their choppers within arms' length of an unknown monster!That being said... The concept was good and intriguing. The visual setting was a feast for the eyes. I felt the real physical landscapes blended with the CGI sets very well. This was done better than a lot of recently released action movies.'Kong: Skull Island' isn't going to win any major awards.

I was hoping for a little bit more depth than it offered. That's not to say anyone was bad in it at all, they were simply not brought together in a very strong manner.Being a fan of Peter Jackson's Kong it's hard not to go into this wondering how it might compare. Whilst Jackson's Kong is a nice retelling of the original, this is definitely your Die Hard 5 version of King Kong. That is to say, the characterization, the sense of doom, even the tugging of the heart strings in Jackson's Kong do not cross over into Skull Island at all.The characters here are 2 dimensional, with only one having a name I remember (because it's the same as a computer manufacturer) and I'm fresh out of the cinema earlier this evening. Oh and Kong of course, he's one I can name...! ""That's what I call them... You call them what you want"" line in the movie can definitely be applied to the characters in this film, they honestly could be called tom dick and harry and it'd have no different effect.But, given that this is a more in-line with the Godzilla franchise (and apparently a setup for a Godzilla sequel?) it does provide much more thrills and spills than the more recent Godzilla movie, giving a hint that at least the Kong vs Godzilla movie could be entertaining enough.There are a few nice action sequences. I'm not really sure what made up the rest of the film, in my mind, some silly stuff, like covering several miles in seemingly seconds, second-rate banter & monsters coming out of nowhere clichés left right and centre.So it's fun. Come the ending I was ready to leave and didn't bother with whatever showed over the credits. It was fine as a no-brainer action movie, but it was a very mediocre ride for the Kong fan in me. Worth a watch, if you can flush any interest in any earlier Kong film's first - but that's just my opinion. 6/10!","1 out of 4 found this helpful."
"7","/10","It may not be as iconic as the 1933 classic, Kong Skull Island is a fun monster movie that has a roar","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3662699/?ref_=tt_urv","RforFilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv","15 March 2017","It's safe to say that out of the many iconic moments in cinema (Dorothy discovering herself in a world of Technicolor in Wizard of Oz, Charles Foster Kane saying ""Rosebud"" before his death in Citizen Kane and the entire finale of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World), many people can recall the image of a giant gorilla attacking planes off of the Empire State Building in King Kong. Though it may sound like something out of a B movie, people tend to forget that King Kong was once the true king of the world with some of the most impressive special effects of the time. I highly recommend the documentaries about the making of the 1933 film.Aside from a couple of sequels and remakes in 1976 and 2005, there hasn't been more exploration of the world Kong lives in. Sure, we know he's a large ape, but the island that he called home had dinosaurs, giant spiders, and various monsters. That itself is a goldmine for more fantasy-like exploration. With the popularity of the American remake of Godzilla, it made sense that Warner Brothers would want to revive the eighth wonder of the world. The world is given more exploration in Kong: Skull Island.In 1973, government scientist William Randa (played by John Goodman) gets approval to lead an expedition to an uncharted island that had been blocked by bad weather. He hires a military group in Saigon called the Sky Devils, a former Vietnam helicopter squadron led by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (played by Samuel L. Jackson) for escort. He also hires a former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (played by Tom Hiddleston) and photojournalist Mason Weaver (played by Brie Larson). All together in a helicopter convey, they make it through the island, but are quickly brought down by a gorilla standing over a hundred feet.The survivors are split into two group with both planning on heading north to the rendezvous point where there only hope for rescue is in three days. While Randa, Packard, and some of the solders start searching for fellow crew, Conrad, Weaver and the rest of the survivors are found by a tribe of Iwi natives, but are assured by a WWII pilot whose been stuck there for thirty years Hank Marlow (played by John C. Reilly) that they are friendly. It's discovered that Kong is worshiped as a god to protect them from the larger lizard creatures on the island. Along with those, giant spiders, and King Kong himself, its race against time to see who can make it.For a spin off about King Kong, my expectations were low. The good news is that Kong: Skull Island happens to be good monster movie. Good, but not great. Half of that has to do with the casting. While John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson have a lot of good scenes (including a subtle Jurassic Park reference), neither Tom Hiddleston nor Brie Larson are that interesting. Both actors are trying, but the script simply makes their characters empty shells of leading men and women. But lets face it, the real star of the movie happens to be Kong. Unlike Godzilla, which took a lot of time away from the monster, here we get more of the giant ape and him fighting the various creatures of Skull Island. I love his design and of how more animalistic his personality is, even more so then the 2005 remake.Though the characters aren't strong, what makes up for it is the atmosphere and tome. It's clear that a lot of influence was taken from Apocalypse Now, Jurassic Park and of course King Kong. It all meshes into a beautiful looking picture that fits right alongside the multiple Vietnam war movies. I'm not sure who was responsible for the cinematography, but they deserve a lot of accolades.I'll give this seven Kongs out of ten. While I can't see thing alongside the original King Kong in a state of icon-like phrase, it's a fun popcorn monster movie. It gives you what you want fast and manages to keep the tone going. I have to give this a lot of credit for running under two hours. With a lot of blockbusters going well over that, it's nice to see a movie that knows how long it needs to be. As long as you can accept this a blockbuster, then I'm sure you'll have some fun. Get to the theaters and see if this roars some excitement into you.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

No way, somebody said they even walked out after an hour, why? It was a King Kong monster movie, made specifically to tie him in to the Godzilla franchise, I don't know what some people were expecting to see. I wasn't expecting a script on a par with The Godfather or acting that wouldn't be out of place in a serious Oscar contender, I was expecting Kong and some other big monsters to fight it out in a totally unrealistic way while an annoying human subplot got in the way for the best part of 2 hours, as is standard practice in good old monsters movies going back to the original Kong via many a Godzilla flick and all the many rip offs in between.Bottom line is is it as good as the original 1933 film? No, it isn't. Is it as good as the 1970s remake? Yes, it's probably a bit better. Is it as good as Peter Jacksons version? Seeing as how it isn't 3 hours long and as boring as watching paint dry I'd say its a good deal better.

The films in this monster verse include 'Godzilla', 'Pacific Rim', and now 'Kong'. I gotta say, going into this film I expected the worst. I expected it to be the typical Marvel-esque film where it tries a little bit too hard to make you like its characters and ends in an unnecessarily over the top action sequence between an underdeveloped villain. But I'm happy to report that this film is not like that, at all. What is interesting about these three monster movies is that they all feel incredibly unique to the filmmakers. They all have a distinct voice and style that no other ""franchise"" has. They are very much the director's film. Not the studios. This is one of the weirdest, most horrifically violent PG-13 studio films I have seen in quite some time. It actually remained me a great deal of 'The Great Wall'. Except this film seems to have a slight sense of self-awareness. This actually shocked me. It almost makes fun of itself and the films that are like it. It has the typical character sacrifice scene near the end except he just gets whipped a mile away from the action and just dies. It's not heroic, he just dies for basically no reason. It's scenes like this that really make this film work. Characters say goofy lines right before getting smashed to pieces, there's tons of color, and the camera is constantly on the move.In many ways, it feels like a Micheal Bay movie that is actually aware of itself. It knows how dumb it is and it plays it up to ludicrous degrees. I mean, a guy literally gets impaled by a giant ant for crying out loud. If you're taking this film seriously, you're doing it wrong. If you think this is just a typical action movie and aren't open to what is about to happen you'll probably hate this film.Because it is that typical action movie we all expected. The characters are flat as boards and they don't really do much aside from being smashed to death. Not to mention it features a giant monster that punches other giant monsters in their stupid faces. So, if you aren't ready to accept the fact that this film is almost making fun of itself then you probably shouldn't see this. However, if you want to see gigantic action set pieces and corny dialogue ripped straight out of the 1980's then boy do I have a movie for you. This is the first massive scale action movie in a long time that is just an action movie. It knows exactly what it is and it doesn't screw around with hardly anything else. It doesn't really bother setting up characters or anything like that. It shows us where all these people are in their lives and then it just goes.Within twenty minutes King Kong is tearing apart helicopters and crushing people to death. And from then on, the film does not stop moving. It's actually so frantically paced that you really don't have time to think about the paper thin characters or lack of story. It just goes from one action sequence to the next in such haste that nothing else really matters. That being said I do have one major flaw that almost ruins the entire film.The editing here is an absolute travesty. This film is so poorly edited that it's borderline incoherent. There are scenes that abruptly end and transition into a completely different area featuring the same characters. They will be in one place and without warning the film will cut to an entirely different location at an entirely different time of day but it stays with the same characters the whole time. The editing is so aggressive and rushed that even some of the action scenes move too quickly to get a sense for what is happening.But, aside from that, this film is thoroughly enjoyable. There a few parts that drag just a bit and that editing is in complete disarray, but I loved this film. It's such a breath of fresh air in a genre over saturated by people wearing capes that we vaguely care about. What 'Kong' does better than so many of these other action movies is that it just is a movie. It doesn't blatantly attempt to set up a sequel or take itself more seriously than it needed too. It knows that it's dumb and it plays on that. It's goofy, overblown, and often times downright weird, yet that's why I love it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

The whole franchise building thing hasn't worked out well for most studios and frankly the last Godzilla movie was a bit of a dud except for the final act.So, I went to this movie with a little hope of it being any good. And when the movie started I was surprised!I don't think most people will appreciate the human characters because we are not in the theatre to see them, and Tom Hiddleston's English accent is a little distracting. I also didn't know why a Oscar winning actress would want to play a character so thinly written. She is there just so there can be a girl among all the guys. She held her own though, with what she had been given.But let just get to the good part, the hero of this movie is the cinematographer. The scale presented in this movie was outstanding. There is scene where Sam L Jackson is looking at Kong and the camera goes behind his head just to show the difference in scale and size. Each frame was brilliant, the helicopter shots were awesome, and the King fight scenes were better that that of Godzilla!In the end, I had a lot of fun with this one...the movie was funny and commanding.

From what I saw in the trailers, the cinematography and CGI looked amazing. I was worried that the story would suffer from the focus on cinematography and CGI. Thank god it was better than I expected.Here's the good.The cinematography and CGI is amazing in this movie, the best I've seen from any movie this year. Each shot is fantastic and interesting and the CGI is realistic and blends perfectly with the actors.The acting is fun to say the least. Each actor added something to the story, no one was underused and everyone had a purpose. Samuel L. Jackson and Thomas Mann stood out to me. Both of their performances were memorable and entertaining.The story is very fun. It's what I expected but even that is good. It's a story about a group of people that go and investigate this mysterious island right after the end of the Vietnam war. When they arrive, they discover this island is not what they expected. One thing that added a lot to the overall vibe of the film is that it was in a post Vietnam war setting. It added a lot to the entertainment and set a good tone, it wouldn't have been as good as it is without the time period it's set in. The best part of this movie is easily the end credits scene.Here's the bad.The story isn't all that great. I understand that this movie is just trying to be fun, which is perfectly okay, but if you're going to do that you can't take yourself too seriously, and this movie did that. There were a few cheesy parts but they weren't that bad. A few jokes didn't hit with the audience and weren't that funny. The ending of the movie falls flat. The payoff wasn't all that great and happened fairly fast.There was one character that I think took away from the overall quality of the film. John C. Reilly's character wasn't all that great. He overacted for most of the movie and acted like a cartoon. Only some of his jokes hit with the audience.Overall, Kong Skull Island is a good popcorn movie where you can turn off your brain for a while and watch a movie with some A+ cinematography and CGI. The characters have good chemistry with each other, even if some aren't all that great. It's good to see Kong back on the big screen.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

Pictures & Legendary Entertainment's MonsterVerse, after Godzilla(2014). A group of scientists, American soldiers, a British secret service agent & a photojournalist, travel to an unknown island in the Pacific. After arriving on the island, they soon discover that it is home to a giant ape, named Kong(Terry Notary). However, soon the group realizes that Kong is not the most dangerous thing on the island. Now, these guys have to do whatever they can to escape from Skull Island. Kong: Skull Island is a great film. This movie doesn't waste too much time establishing the backstories of its various characters. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has realized that people have come to watch the titular character in action & not watch the daily lives of its human characters. This is how it surpasses Godzilla(2014). That film took way too much time establishing the human characters & barely highlighted the titular monster. The story is pretty straightforward but, that's what we expect from a movie like this. The visual effects are flawless. The CGI-rendered King Kong, the skull crawlers & various other creatures in the movie, look extremely realistic. The action set pieces are fantastic & look even better in 3D. The highlight of the film is the climactic set piece. The cast do their best, with the star of the show clearly being the mighty ape. Tom Hiddleston is superb as James Conrad. Samuel L. Jackson is spectacular as Preston Packard. Brie Larson is outstanding as Mason Weaver. John C. Reilly is awesome as Hank Marlow. John Goodman is good as Bill Randa. Corey Hawkins is amazing as Houston Brooks. John Ortiz, Tian Jing, Toby Kebbell, Jason Mitchell, Shea Whigham, Thomas Mann, Eugene Cordero & Marc Evan Jackson are brilliant as Victor Nieves, San, Jack Chapman, Mills, Cole, Slivko, Reles & Landsat Steve, respectively. Last but not the least, Terry Notary is mind blowing in his motion capture performance, as Kong. Kong: Skull Island is a must watch for fans of monster movies & everyone who watched Godzilla(2014). I can't wait for 2020's epic clash, Godzilla vs. Kong.","18 out of 35 found this helpful."

The visual effects of the new King Kong movie are more spectacular and in-your-face than those of Peter Jackson's film, but I suspect you understand why that doesn't necessarily make them better and I hope it goes without saying that they're not as mind-boggling as that which Willis O'Brien pulled off in 1933. The only thing they did was make the ape bigger so why did we even need to see this reboot? Simple. Because we need to get the cinematic universe based around the new Godzilla rolling, because Lord knows every fictional character ever invented needs a cinematic universe now. Why even go to the movies if there aren't 20 other movies that you kinda-sorta-not-really have to see beforehand?Of course Godzilla has had a multi-picture franchise in the past, including one fight with a resized Kong, but this was back when people didn't run a risk of getting tired of the idea. Then again, I've watched enough Cinemassacre to get a decent idea of how good the original Toho films were so maybe I'm wrong. And besides, when you've got CGI on your side, I hear audiences are not so stubborn these days after all.Kong: Skull Island takes place in the 1970's so one might think of it as a quasi-sequel to the original King Kong tale. John Goodman, as government official Bill Randa, assembles a team of scientists, US soldiers, and others to go on an expedition to a hidden island in the South Pacific and discover just why it has kept itself off mankind's maps. It doesn't take long before they realize that ancient forces roam there, and that there is very little hope of them leaving the island or avoiding the horrors that threaten them. This includes, I'm sure you've figured out, a towering gorilla who needs no introduction.The team in question contains Tom Hiddleston as a retired SAS Captain and Vietnam veteran, Brie Larson as a photographer whose presence in the first manned mission to an anomalous island surrounded by a perpetual thunderstorm is at best disagreeable, Corey Hawkins as a geologist working under John Goodman and trying to put the moves on a young biologist played by Jing Tian, Toby Kebbell as a US Major who yearns for home, John C. Reilly as a lost World War II pilot who has lived amongst the island natives for quite some time, and several other characters that exist only to be killed off. Terry Notary provides the motion-capture for Kong (why apes in film can't ever have the same limitations on their ability to emote as real-life Hominidae I know not) but it feels like wasted effort. Usually when he appears in this movie, he doesn't do anything terribly important and is mostly there to fill a screentime quota so as to keep the ""just show the damn monster"" crowd happy.It's astonishing how little King Kong actually does in this movie, and how you change your mind about wanting to see him do things once it finally happens and promptly goes on for too long. The rest of the film is dedicated to abrupt moments of action that are forgotten about as suddenly as they appear and cut together in such a way that there's very little time to wrap your head around which characters are in which group and where that group is at the moment. I can't say we ever get to know any of them especially well either (which would be why Gareth Edwards' Godzilla was more successful in its decision to focus on the humans more than the monsters), nor do we get a solid idea of who our main protagonist is. Samuel L. Jackson, whom I forgot to mention, makes up a walking ""stubborn military leader who refuses to listen"" cliché so that one's easier.Throughout the film, all I could think about were other things that it reminded me of. The first half or so feels so much like a video game it's fascinating. First we get the obligatory 20 minute cutscene; then the gameplay suddenly starts and prompts you to use the WASD keys to dodge lightning strikes and later Kong himself; then we get another cutscene; then we get a random boss fight against a titanic spider where you need to hit its weak spots to kill it.Other than that, Kong gets most of its ideas from other films. The subterranean lizards that Kong fights look like the Cloverfield monster with fewer appendages, the forced banter between the army guys feels like something out of a less genuine Black Hawk Down, and there are several homages to Jurassic Park which, distracting as they may be, are admittedly a bit more intentional. It also brought to mind Aliens, Apocalypse Now, and the works of Michael Bay in general - with its CG fireballs, overused slow-motion, shots of helicopters against sunset backgrounds, and awkwardly inserted comedy. The characters aren't much smarter than your standard Michael Bay inventions either.Kong isn't entirely worthless. The visual effects team, the camera people and the sound designers have done a great job giving King Kong an awesome presence, and some of the references to old Toho kaiju have a charm to them. These aren't spoilers, by the way. Nothing is a spoiler anymore. The cliffhanger at the end of this film's credit sequence will not shock you if you have open eyes and ears and know that Legendary Entertainment have already announced Godzilla vs. Kong. Here's hoping the next Pacific Rim plays into it somehow.","3 out of 5 found this helpful."
"8","/10","A 7/10 film that revels in being a 7/10 film. However, I give it an 8.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3846949/?ref_=tt_urv","Cluey","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5133397/?ref_=tt_urv","1 November 2017","I saw this film on the same day as Logan, and while that film was great it didn't leave as much of an impression on me as it seems to have done for other people.Kong Skull Island - however - gets me excited thinking about it.Let me clarify. For me there's nothing better than a film that knowingly commits to genre schlock and style. Something which Skull Island does in spades. The film wastes very little time getting to the action, which puts many people off this take but for me was an enormous breath of fresh air. We all know what King Kong looks like, we all know his M.O and we all know how these films go: first a foot, then a hand, then a glimpse here and there before there's a big scene with some screaming woman tied to a post before the monster can be seen in all its glory. Not here. Here we get straight to it, and I appreciate the film for not taking us down the same old path.This film belongs to a new wave of film-making which is using pulp and new technology to carve its own film language. The influences here don't come from the oft dug classic directors and films - the influence here is pop-culture, pulp and anime. It sounds like a recipe for the most juvenile and dumb crap ever - but in choosing which elements to lift from each of these carefully, the film manages to create something really interesting. There's spots here of 50's B sci-fi, Vietnam movies and studio Ghibli films and it creates a very textured and rich set of visual moments. On that note, this is a very visual and visceral film. The characters are pretty stock here - though enjoyable enough to watch, especially John C Reilly and Samuel L Jackson, who chew through the jungle with aplomb - their motivations are about as straightforward as you can get. The majority of the cast just want to get off the island except for Jackson, who wants to blow the hell out of a giant monkey and then get off the island (largely because he's salty about the U.S pulling out of 'Nam and wants to have a victory). The straightforward narrative is pretty perfect for this sort of film, as there's nothing worse than a B-movie trying and failing to do complex character motivation (well there is, a serious film trying and failing, because then you don't even have the popcorn factor to fall back on). The objectives are all clear and nothing gets in the way of the action.Which is amazing. Everything you want from this sort of creature feature is here. Giant spiders, weird dinosaurs giant octopuses all make an appearance and are combated in a variety of crazy and inventive ways. If you don't get a little quiver of excitement as Kong smashes a snake monster with a rusty anchor from a shipwreck then you are not wired for this sort of film.Anyway, it's great fun","8 out of 13 found this helpful."

I felt from the very beginning the movie was a bit pacey and progressed too fast into the adventure and exploration of the island. There were some parts that were intriguing, especially the special effects, leading into the arrival into the island. However, the film did massively lack in acting, script and general sense of story line. I felt the acting wasn't convincing, and lacked emotion, and did not evoke much emotion within me. The only thing I felt the film had going for it was the incredible special effects, which is why I gave this film a 6 star rating. There were some really great scenes of action, shock and surprise. I believe this film is worth watching, but I wouldn't consider it a personal favourite. Definitely worth a watch though!","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

Maybe photography (?). But like literally the rest of it's aspect are super bad, even for somebody who just wants to watch a movie where a big monkey fights against big stuff and/or humans, or for a movie where big stuff/monkey terrorizes and kills humans (I was expecting the last one but it's not even able to achieve that). There's a lot of nonsensical stuff happening all around, that leaves you wondering when did it happen. There's a lot of unnecessary drama that the slow motion simply makes it even worse. Uninteresting characters which have a slight hint of where they are going, but they don't have enough development to actually get somewhere (a few super bad jokes, the typical ""awkward"" scene that now movies love to have but really just appear in the worst moments). Special effects aren't all that good really (not bad, but not amazing). There's not even enough killing/terrorizing! pretty much all the deaths are of people you barely see nor remember their names, the ones that are supposed to be relevant characters have funny/dumb deaths that end up being for nothing, which only deepens how irrelevant they where because of how bland they were! They show some natives of skull island but since they try so hard to make them all serious and respectable they leave them just as objects with a face that stares at the camera. I think the writers also try to make a statement about unnecessary wars and/or US imperialism but its sustained on like two or three lines and a few bad scenes, so even that is lost. Along with all of that the movie is super long so it makes you wonder where did all that time go inside the movie. Overall, a super bad movie by all standards, it tries so hard to be so serious but it's just plain bad.","3 out of 5 found this helpful."

"7","/10","Review - Kong: Skull Island - Surprisingly enjoyable.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3658254/?ref_=tt_urv","AlexFalzon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12561850/?ref_=tt_urv","10 March 2017","Man, the tone in this film is all over the place and I mean that in the best way possible. It never stops feeling strange, but it also never feels wrong, either. We'll be enjoying a light-hearted scene set to the tune of a '70s rock song. Suddenly, gruesomely, fatally, we have a terrifying encounter with an enormous monster. Then we're back with another '70s hit over a montage as our protagonists journey to their next obstacle. It's bizarre, and it works.If you're expecting to see that same Kong story with which you are familiar, alter those expectations radically. Kong never leaves Skull Island, never kidnaps a blonde, and is around five times larger than you've ever seen him before (unless you saw Japan's 1962 film King Kong vs. Godzilla). Unlike the original film, Skull Island is set in 1973, immediately after Nixon pulls out of Vietnam, and, oh, boy, do the filmmakers have fun with this. As well as the aforementioned soundtrack, the score, cinematography, even the film's posters all channel the era, with nods to Apocalypse Now sometimes taking up entire scenes.This isn't to take away too much from the creativity of the film. The excellent cinematography is the work of Larry Fong, who's done a bunch of Zack Snyder films, and the CGI is phenomenal, with a couple of very small exceptions with regard to the small(er) animals that drifted just a little too far into the uncanny.Our characters (a helicopter squadron and a group of scientists, neatly separated by colour, as well as a tracker, a photographer, and three members of the mysterious organisation ""Monarch"", which you may remember from 2014's Godzilla) head to the strange island after picking it up for the first time via satellite (what if something good's there and the Russians get it!?). After Kong, they also meet the other denizens of the island – enormous buffaloes and spiders, new, fictional monstrosities, and good old human natives. At this point the objectives of the characters divide; some want to flee the island, some want to hide and wait for rescue, others still enter Ahab territory and are resolved to take down the big gorilla himself.The screenplay has obviously gone over a couple of drastic revisions. Characters say things like ""this happened in '72"", which is a little weird, because the film is set in '73. Why not just say ""last year""? I can only guess that the year in which the film is set changed during pre/production.Tom Hiddleston and John Goodman are solid. Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson somehow manage to deliver excellent performances in a very silly (but fun!) movie. John C. Reilly is great, blending that great sense of humour and timing with just the right dosage of sobering heartbreak that comes with being stranded on an island for thirty years; he crashed during World War II.Many cute references are sprinkled throughout the film, and done so in a charmingly subtle way; ""Hold onto your butts"" says Jackson's character. I breathed a sigh of relief when they elected not to actually play Ride of the Valkyries during an already extremely Apocalypse-Nowy sequence. It's actually a pretty clever movie, and I was very pleasantly surprised.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) is hired as a guide for the expedition, as well as Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackaon) and his platoon, photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) and other members to join the expedition. A few minutes from being in air territory, the helicopters are shot down by King Kong and the survival of the characters begins. In the course of history will be revealed the true intentions of certain members of the expedition causing more setbacks. Despite this they find another ally, Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a pilot lost for years who survived within the tribe of the island.Considering that the cast contains an acclaimed British actor, an Oscar winner actress and two actors nominated to the same, I must say that in terms of performance was just acceptable but not beyond that. The script has as pro, to be divided in several events due to the separation of the expedition but not beyond this, the rest will be to escape of the island and to survive the beasts inside the same.As a recommendation, wait for the credits, where it is shown that this movie is just the prelude to a bigger project.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

Kong even lets Bri stroke his snout, but never has an issue with Tom Hiddleston standing beside her. He's not love sick as in 2005.Samuel Jackson chews up more scenery than the monsters. But that adds to the fun. John C. Riley adds a marvelous touch as a WW2 soldier stuck on the island for decades, a little nutty but able to get along with every one.

Kong: Skull Island is easily the best film about Kong since the original.

The backstory feels a little rushed, especially for a two hour film, but that means we don't have to wait very long for the main character to make his appearance. There are many elements and story lines which mirror the original story while still telling a new one. Visual effects are wonderful, as is the soundtrack.

"7","/10","Skull Island isn't impressively intelligent but it is overwhelmingly gorgeous and a kickass spectacle worthy of the big screen.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3658999/?ref_=tt_urv","LloydBayer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20871749/?ref_=tt_urv","10 March 2017","Right from its opening scene - a cheesy montage that would come into play during the second half of the film - Kong: Skull Island is a reiteration that size matters at the movies. If BIG is what you want, then that's exactly what you get – big budget, big effects and an ape, much, much bigger than his cinematic forefathers from the 1933 classic to the 2005 epic from Peter Jackson. But unlike Jackson's bitter-sweet romanticization of beauty and the beast (which has always been at the heart of a King Kong film) Skull Island is neither a prequel nor a sequel in Kong's storyline. It isn't entirely a reboot either because none of the characters from the previous films are brought back in this film. Instead, this version feels like a pilot episode in its own cinematic universe. Set in 1973 and just after US forces have all but accepted defeat in Vietnam, we follow a group of explorers and American GIs who set out to geo-map the titular but unchartered island. Their grand entrance into the storm shrouded island is the first of a series of kickass spectacles and essentially why you would want to watch this film on the biggest screen possible. It's also the new Kong's awesome introduction in all his colossal gloryand fury. After their Hueys are extended the same welcome as annoying mosquitoes, the group is divided into two teams in an increasingly hostile environment. One team is led by John Goodman's government agent posing as a scientist along with Samuel L. Jackson in a cakewalk role as a vengeful Vietnam veteran. Led by Tom Hiddleston as a tracker and Brie Larson as a war photographer (who serves no real purpose except the tradition that Kong has a thing for blondes), the second team makes an interesting discovery – a stranded WWII pilot (John C. Reilly) is just as eager to leave the island as they are.What sets this film apart from previous Kong lore is the instantly noticeable visual splendour, an aesthetic that seems like a very obvious love letter to Apocalypse Now (1979) but mixed with the cheese and chowder of a Jurassic Park adventure. This in turn wreaks havoc on the tone of the film, resulting in constant shifts between bombastic action, dead-eye terror, pop culture, political and ecological allegories, and whimsy humour including show stealing levity from Reilly. Add to that a stellar cast stuck with stereotypical roles in a telegraphed screenplay and you get an old school monster movie mash with teeth bigger than its bite. But then, who are we kidding? Anyone paying to watch this film will expect their money's worth of copious eye candy and that's precisely what Skull Island promises in return.Despite being a novice behind the lens, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts can be credited with the creation of a tentpole film that is overwhelmingly gorgeous even if it isn't impressively intelligent. Spectacular action, photorealistic CGI, surreal cinematography, and era specific soundtrack will keep you entertained but it's the deliberate tease at the end that will leave you wanting more. If not New York, maybe Japan? Come 2020, we'll know for sure.","1 out of 6 found this helpful."

But I was pleasantly surprised coming out of the theater that this movie kept my attention for as long as it did.The cast of this film: Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L.

Does this make you hate the characters? Not really but Sam L. was channeling Captain Ahab from Moby Dick thru parts of this movie.But does it make you care about them? Not really either.Overall the plot is really nothing special, SURVIVE is basically it. The action thru the parts of the film are exciting to watch but it does suffer from some slower moments which seemed like they wanted to build up tension but never really surfaced.

The editing almost breaks the movie. Some scenes are cut in half, to show another scene, which is then cut in half to go on with the first scene that was cut in half.

Growing up, nothing wrapped up the Thanksgiving holidays like the showings of the Japanese Monster movies (that, and March of the Wooden Soldiers). They were a Thanksgiving staple right along the cranberry sauce and turkey.By today's standards, some younger folks would see them as laughable or amateurish because of their simplistic methods in bringing GIANT monsters to life without the use of Computer Generated Images (CGI).2014 gave us a newer, modern Godzilla. I loved this movie as to me, it paid homage to the classic Godzilla in little ways that some true fans might pick up.This brings me to the subject of this review; KONG: Skull Island. First off, the movie gives us a unique telling of the story by changing the time-line of the story and therefore giving it a different feel to the 2014 Godzilla. The CGI was fantastic and they even went as far as to have Kong stand more erect, like the TOHO Studios Kong from the 60's (due to a man being in the Kong suit). The cast all did a fine job and each made their characters interesting. I particularly liked John Goodman and John C. Riley's performances. Tom Hiddleston did a fine job as the male lead and was noticeably slightly buffed up than his portrayal as Thor's brother, Loki. Samuel Jackson played... Samuel Jackson. LOL... The movie stayed on point and covered the science aspect just enough to give it a follow-able story and yet not too much to bore kids in the audience.The 3D effects in the film really stood out and were not overbearing or obnoxious. There were plenty of creatures to keep Kong occupied and us entertained throughout the story.If you do plan on seeing this... please stay to the very, very end of the end credits.

I suppose the writers must have thought, ""Oh, what the heck. By now, everybody knows the protagonists are to stumble into a ginormous monkey. Let's start blowing things up from the get-go instead."" So KK blasts on the screen (and in your face) barely 15 minutes after the opening credits (in a two-hour film).It barrels south from there. Cartoonish, made-in-Japan-like creatures, tons of gooey, revolting gore, silly people, sillier situations. Oh, and did I mention aurora borealis ... In the middle of the South Pacific? Did they leave any cliché out? Nope. Everything is there, right down to the assertive, macho-like, snarky female photographer, who's capable of lifting a helicopter that not even a huge, prehistoric water buffalo could dislodge. Does our Kong fall for the gutsy photographer? Perish the thought! This is the new millennium. Nobody, not eve big apes objectify women. Can't have that. No, once Kong slaps the chopper off the water buffalo's back, he spots the photographer, gives her a regally disdainful look, turns around and walks away.

The plot serves primarily as a vehicle for showcasing monster battles and spectacular set pieces rather than delivering a compelling narrative.Overall, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is a fun, visually impressive film that entertains but falls short in terms of character development and story complexity.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

But then a satellite reveals an uncharted island, surrounded by eternal storms and hazardous waters. An island shaped like a skull.Kong: Skull Island is just about what it needs to be. What I mean by that is that it is honest. It is a trashy B-flick straight from the pages of pulp magazines. It has it all, from Vietnam War filled with bloodhungry soldiers to giant apes to dinosaurs to a tribe of painted savages to primordial monsters. It has a jaunty soundtrack, some cool special effects, one-liners, gory deaths and enough action scenes to make your blood pressure shoot for the stratosphere.And if you can go in with those kinds of expectations, it's exactly the film you're looking for. But if you go in looking for anything else, you'll end up leaving disappointed. Because while this film has some big names, from Samuel L. Jackson to Tom Hiddleston, it is not a well-acted film. Not at all. Sure Jackson and Hiddleston are probably two of the most entertaining performances, but even they cannot forge diamonds out of something like this. And they shouldn't need to.Furthermore, the monsters. aside from Kong, have really lazy designs, the natives are just a bit cringy and there are perhaps one or two too many characters for the maximum effectiveness and screen-time.Still, I did like it. Is it trash? Most certainly, but it is entertaining trash with great style and enough tongue-in-cheek to make it forgivable. Recommended for all fans of the pulp genre.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

This is a very easy watch with a great cast, impressive special effects and a surprisingly dark tone in places with some gory and gross moments.
The action scenes look amazing and are highly stylised using bright colors, smoke and explosions to great effect and the monsters look awesome especially Kong. You can see individual hairs on his body and wrinkles on his leathery palms, it's very cool. Apparently the monster designs were influenced by Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke and i can actually see that.
You'd be silly going in to this expecting an Oscar winning tour de force like There Will Be Blood, this a high octane action adventure movie with massive monsters bashing the hell out of eachother. There isn't much character development but everyone still provides a decent performance especially Samuel L Jackson as a hard as nails and pretty unlikeable US army Lieutenant Colonel who needs war to survive. John C. Reilly is also a joy to watch.
There's a lot of small moments and details which you might not see first time round as well and i like that.
It's a fun time, go see this movie.","6 out of 9 found this helpful."

It's fun seeing what happens to the human characters and you definitely route for King Kong all the way.There is some unsubtle but provocative imagery showing humans raping the environment that works quite well, particularly to make you want them to suffer at the teeth of the numerous monsters.The climactic showdown pitting certain monsters against each other and involving the human characters is an entertaining spectacle to watch.Generally the visuals are excellent. It has some strong cinematography, colour grading, and art design that pays tribute to other movies like 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon', 'Jurassic Park' and the original 'King Kong'. If you place a lot of importance on computer generated imagery then you will love the creature animation.I think having a cast with John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson, and John C Reilly helps lift a fairly weak script and make it more watchable than it should be.There is a cracking soundtrack that includes a number of great songs, but I can't help but feel they are largely wasted in a movie like this other than to give a sense of period.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

The land where God did not finish creation . . . the place where myth and science meet."" Bill Randa (John Goodman)In Kong: Skull Island, the real science is the creation by director Jordan Vogt-Roberts and writers of a believable myth, gigantism run amok with a hundred-foot gorilla and other nasty, very large pre-historic monsters. By paying homage to 1933 filmmakers Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedack's Kong, this film shows myths can be reworked to maintain their original power while complementing the proceedings with new angles of vision.Although Skull Island is a place of death as monsters battle for control, it still houses benign natives and visiting guests like tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). The dark side is Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), who not only represents the tunnel vision of present-day militarism but also the myth of the sexually powerful black man, a cultural companion to the imposing Kong.However, this Kong has grown in sensitivity over 84 years: He protects the island's good denizens from the devils below and he respects the new blonde Fay Wray, Mason Weaver: ""People here used to live in fear, from everything. Then something strange happened: some of the monsters here started protecting them from the other monsters trying to kill them."" Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly). This is a Kong to love more than fear. Gone is the threatening sexuality of the early Kong with his probing fingers; here is a monster more like a schoolboy seeing a beautiful teacher and protecting her.Notable are this film's allusions to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (Conrad as last name of this hero and Marlow, Heart's narrator, and the last name of this WW II leftover Hank, played by Reilly with a wry detachment, a welcome antidote to almost everyone else's grave demeanor). The multiple shots of an over-sized sun and makeshift patrol boat leave no doubt of this film's debt to Apocalypse Now.Kong: Skull Island is a modern fable about our collaboration with nature and the menace of the military-industrial complex (consider the current budget proposal's lavish military spending). Beyond that, it's darn good story telling accompanied by state-of-the-art graphics to make the experience a marvel rather than a menace.""Kong's a pretty good king. Keeps to himself, mostly. But you don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs, unless you're picking a fight."" Marlow","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

Coincidentally, that's the same island that King Kong lives on, along with multiple other monsters. The movie basically blows through the whole beginning, introducing the characters and basic motivations. For the most part, I was fine with that, but once they reach the island the characters themselves cease to have character, though they had little before. They're just robots with an objective. When the movie tries to develop two characters' relationship at one point, the conversation is just playful banter that lasts all of 30 seconds. It's a formula for developing characters that has worked to show how well actors can play off each other, but it doesn't work here because of how generic and rushed it is. Furthermore, one particular character gets thrown into the mix way too early. I don't want to spoil his role for those who don't know, but it's John C. Reilly's character. He shows up in the first 30 minutes, and in context it doesn't make sense. I mostly went to this movie because every review I read or watched said that Kong himself was great, so I figured it'd at least be a fun time at the movies that would be better in a cinema. Sure, Kong was good, for all three of his scenes. Seriously, I started to forget that this was a King Kong movie. And it seemed like the writers forgot too, because he kinda just showed up on occasion to remind the audience what the movie was called. He wasn't even the biggest threat on Skull Island, he was just kind of there. As far as the exciting parts of this movie go, the action set pieces are great. They set up for something epic and exciting. But the action itself often falls kind of flat. Sure, it's mostly fun, but it's kind of dumb too. And some shots based around these sets don't make sense. There's a point where the characters are looking down at a dip in the land with giant bones in it. Then they go down and it's full of green fog that varies in thickness. So where did the fog come from? How is it that they could see clearly from above, but barely could from within? It just doesn't make sense, and in Kong's opening scene the time of day constantly switches between midday to late evening, and it's so distracting. Sure, it's a pretty shot, but it took me out of the action, and that isn't a good thing. And in addition to that, a lot of the cool monsters you may have seen in the trailers are better in the trailer than in the movie. Lot's of monster fights happen before we can even care about any of the characters, so when people are dying I was simply detached. But the fights proved to be so short-lived that there was no time to really even get excited. Again, the set pieces are great but the action itself is mediocre. I'm sure most people saw 'The Jungle Book' from 2016 and noticed how great the CGI is. So my question now is, how is it that a whole year later we can get bad CGI? Seriously, there were scenes in this movie where the monsters and the characters were together and it looked horribly fake. It was actually pretty cringe-worthy at times, and I did. A lot. It got to the point where my friend next to me asked if I wanted to leave. I still saw it through, though. But man, it all looked so fake. It looked like a video game, and not one where graphics were the main concern. The monsters themselves were cool, sure, but they just didn't look real. And on top of that, the tone was all over the place. First the characters are excited, then it's serious, then their laughing and playing records and having fun, then their dying, then they start laughing again. It's like it tried to use comedy sometimes but instead they just destroyed the tone. It was so inconsistent in this way, and again it distances the audience from the movie. It abruptly removes you from where you just were to relocate you to a new box of feelings, and that journey is just awkward and weird. It's like the movie really doesn't know what it is, but it's trying to find itself. Despite all this, the movie gets better towards the end. By the last half hour, it is where it should have been at the beginning in terms of characters. So there was a level of excitement, and the expected fight with Kong versus big bad monster proves to be a great time, and moreover tends to be rather well shot. Overall Kong: Skull Island was a movie where the lack of characters made it difficult to get invested, and as such the result was a garbage fire. It's not an enjoyable movie. It's not pretty, it's not interesting, and it's barely even fun. The actors tried their best with what they were given, and I admired how willing the movie was about killing off major characters at points other than the very end, but still there was nothing to save this movie where it was. There is a good movie hidden in here somewhere, I am certain of that, but it isn't this one. In the end I would advise you to avoid this movie and wait for it to come to Netflix if you haven't seen it, like the last Godzilla movie did. Contrary to expectations of excitement, this is a rather boring movie, and the price of admission is simply not worth your hard-earned money.","5 out of 11 found this helpful."

This has been the story from the 30s till the extraordinary remake by Peter Jackson. However, this movie doesn't stick to the rituals of the story, as it tells the story of the beast in his own land, without the famous Empire State Scene, without being captured. The Graphics are great, however, there has not been much development between this version and Jackson's version technically. Having a cast consisting of super talented actors like Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larsson, Samuel L. Jackson, John C. Reilly and John Goodman. However, their performances were very average except Reilly maybe. The opening scene of the movie was very very good. Incorporating Kong in a fight with Godzilla -which is the next move for this universe- would be pretty tough as Kong is much smaller and Godzilla is a lot stronger. We are talking about a beast which can breathe Fire against an ape. However, it is gonna be fantastic watching that battle. Skull Island borrows lots of elements from Apocalypse Now. You'd feel that you are watching a second part of it only this time, Marlon Brando has evolved and became this giant ape. I believe that this borrowing was to make the movie more acclaimed, Yet the ultimate result of the movie is that it's a fun ride that is easily forgettable and would never stick to anyone's mind just like Godzilla. The only difference is that Godzilla was a sequel to an awful movie while Kong was following a very good one. Perhaps the comparison between King Kong and Skull Island have hurt the movie","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

While I liked Peter Jackson's version, this definetly blows it out of the water! It's totally epic! I'm surprised this wasn't released in the summer, because it's definely got that summer blockbuster feel. One criticism people had with 2014's ""Godzilla"" was that it moved too slowly and took forever for Godzilla to actually show up, and I agree. This fixes that mistake by showing Kong in the opening scene to tide us over, and then doing the buildup. The tone and feel of this movie reminded me of ""Indiana Jones."" It's a fun island survival movie. In my opinion, one thing ""Godzilla"" suffered from was the human characters just weren't that interesting. That was not the case here. The characters are written very well, with clear goals and conflicts. The scale of Kong and the island as a whole are impressively huge. Do not watch this movie on your phone. Watch it on the biggest screen possible with an epic sound system for full immersion. Keep in mind the movie, in my opinion, really pushes the PG-13 rating. Some of the violence and deaths can get really brutal. Yet it still manages to balance it out with humor. (Particularly from John C. Reilly's character.) Godzilla had a very dark, bleak, and overall depressing and hopeless tone. (Although those monster fight sequences were awesome!!!!!) This has an action movie tone and is extremely intense at times. Some of the creatures they came up with for the island are really cool, and definetely not stuff I felt I had seen before. It's impressive that a movie that's been remade and redone again and again and again since the 30's still manages to bring something new to the table, while also retaining that classic feel.

This is the third remake/reboot of King Kong. Though essential elements of the original remain, Kong: Skull Island (2017) is set in 1973, at the end of the Vietnam War. It is replete with counter-culture references and music from the period, with the addition of a marooned WW2 vet to appeal to Baby Boomers and their parents alike. Nostalgia is the only explanation I have for why this film has gotten such good reviews. The dialog, acting, plot, and CGI are all mediocre. Its only redeeming quality is the ending fight scene between Kong and a giant skullcrawler called Ramarak.The plot is straightforward. Bill Randa (John Goodman), a monster-hunter, attains funding to travel to an uncharted Pacific island under the guise of a geologic mapping expedition. He enlists the help of former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), and ""antiwar"" photojournalist Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), alongside various Landsat employees.Once over the island, they encounter Kong, who smashes their helicopters. The survivors find a primitive tribe living on the island, alongside a stranded WW2 fighter pilot, Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly). From there, they must cross the island to safety while avoiding over-sized creatures and carnivorous skullcrawlers.While the 2005 Peter Jackson remake staring Jack Black wasn't great either, I preferred that version of Kong. He was essentially just a giant silver-back gorilla, with complex emotions and mannerisms copied from real life. In contrast, this Kong was as tall as a skyscraper, walked upright, and had two emotional states: pensive and roaring loudly. He's also somehow impervious to .30 cal machine gun bullets, fire, and razor-sharp teeth.1973 was an interesting setting for a Kong movie. In many ways this hearkens back to the 1976 remake, which also takes place in the '70s and features a helicopter battle with the monster. The settings, music, props, and cinematography all carefully reflect that period. In this time line, Bill Randa is eager to reach the island before newly launched U.S. satellites can map it, revealing its secrets. Randa sees President Richard Nixon announce troop withdrawal from Vietnam, and determines he must attain funding for his expedition before the war ends and Congress tightens its budget. Historically, the Earth Resources Technology Satellite was launched on July 23, 1972. It wasn't called Landsat until 1975–a minor discrepancy.Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard comes close to being the film's primary antagonist. As commander of an air cavalry squadron, the Sky Devils, Packard is the arch-typical ""warrior without a war."" ""We didn't lose the war,"" he tells Mason Weaver, ""we abandoned it."" He relishes the chance to go on one final mission. When Kong ravages his squadron, destroys his helicopters, and kills his men, Packard becomes obsessed with revenge. He refuses to leave any man behind, taking his remaining troops on what seems like a suicide mission to recover Major Jack Chapman (Toby Kebbell). When Chapman dies, he persists with his determination to kill Kong.While Packard is supposed to the bad guy, he's the only character whose motivations make sense. After Hank Marlow explains Kong has been protecting the tribesmen from skullcrawlers, James Conrad tells Packard that Kong was ""just defending his territory"" when he attacked their helicopters. Uh, OK? Unlike Conrad, who has no emotional ties to any other character, Packard has served with these men in war, presumably for years. He has an obligation to protect his men and recover them if they go missing. Can you blame him for being a little angry when he sees them butchered by a giant ape? Something else bothered me. Throughout the film, the main characters are covered in bile, muck, mud, dirt, blood, smoke, and scorched by flames, yet remain relatively unscathed. Mason Weaver and biologist San Lin (Tian Jing)'s hair and makeup are perfect. They also barely react to their environment. In one scene, they stumble on a boneyard with the skeletons of Kong's parents, killed by skullcrawlers. ""Do you smell that?"" Marlow asks. ""That's death."" Yet no character reacts to the smell at all, probably because they're standing in front of a green screen. Later, Weaver and Conrad stand face-to-face with Kong, again with no reaction. I'm betting a giant gorilla that eats squid smells pretty bad. At least in the 1976 version, Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange's characters are dirty, wet, and their clothes are torn in the jungle.The movie credits photojournalists like Mason Weaver for ending the Vietnam War, using photographs of war's horrors to stoke antiwar sentiment back home. Likewise, Bill Randa hopes to use photography to prove the existence of monsters on Skull Island. On several occasions, the audience sees the exotic creatures and settings through Weaver's camera lens. In one scene, a skullcrawler swallows Randa and his camera. The camera flash reveals its location in the smoke to the other characters, allowing them to escape. I thought this theme, the power of cameras and photography, was one interesting aspect of this film.Overall, Kong: Skull Island wasn't as bad as its predecessors, but fell short in many critical areas. John C. Reilly, and Samuel L Jackson to some extent (in the vein of Snakes on a Plane and Deep Blue Sea), was there for comic relief, but the jokes fell flat. John Goodman is also traditionally a comedic actor, and Brie Larson is mostly known for playing Natalie ""Envy"" Adams in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. So I wasn't sure whether this was supposed to be a campy, fun monster movie, a commentary on the Vietnam War, or an action-packed adventure film. Whatever it was supposed to be, it never rose above the level of a typical popcorn flick.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

This movie blew my mind when I first saw it, but watching it recently, it doesn't hold up. It is a movie that could've been great if there weren't so many flaws that could've been fixed easily.Kong Skull Island has a lot of great actors in the movie. Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, John C. Reilly and John Goodman star in this film. They are all good in this movie, but they are so bland characters that you can't really rune for. These characters are just people that run away from kong and that's about it. They are blank slates that aren't interesting at all and even if they have good acting, their blandness makes that trait much weaker. There are some very dumb moments that could've been taken out of the film, and some scenes happen and they don't make much sense in terms of how that scene happened. There is also a lot of obvious cgi in the movie and some scenes look very artificial.The action sequences in this movie are very entertaining and are a big redeeming factor in this movie. King Kong looks like a beast in this movie and so do all the other monsters in this movie. The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is watchable and disposable. Dan Gilroy wrote the screenplay for this movie with a bunch of less talented writers, and if it was just Dan Gilroy writing the screenplay for this movie, I'd be okay with that. Middle school Austin really liked this movie, but 9th grade Austin thought this movie was just meh. If they just gave the main characters some backstory with some interest, and if the stupid plot points were removed, this film would've been way more entertaining. I'd give this movie a 5/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

If you want to see the most cinematically impressive Kong to date then this is your movie, but if you want anything more story wise you might be a bit let down. The 1933 Kong is a cinematic masterpiece, and the 1976 remake is good in its own right. The 2005 Peter Jackson version was a solid representation of Kong using the newest technology and effects, but still staying relativity true to the story. Understanding that Kong: Skull island is not a remake, but a reboot for future Legendary Pictures monster brawls will help some story confusion. This is not the same Kong as those previous, and it does not follow the old story lines. Kong: Skull Island's story had a good amount of promise, the problem is the script and characters did not fit. Samuel L. Jackson and John Goodman have their usual screen presence, but the characters they are portraying are not ones we as the audience generally care about. None of the other characters are worth much either, besides being food for the many monstrous residents of Skull Island. This version of Kong however is impressive. Easily the most destructive, aggressive, and largest Kong to date. When Kong is on the screen the movie is awesome. Great visual effects and camera angles really give the action some impact. Kong is what holds this movie together and makes it at least a decent entry into the franchise.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

But at its heart King Kong is a popcorn movie. The characters are two dimensional at best, only existing to move the plot forward, the dialogue is corny and the movie is nonstop monster action once the big monkey comes tearing out of the jungle. In that vein Kong: Skull Island is the true successor to the 1933 original.Dino De Laurentiis's 1976 remake was a drab and cynical attempt to recreate the original with modern themes of corporate greed, Peter Jackson's version was a mythologized, larger than life fantasy film, and the Japanese Kong movies are so far from Merian C. Cooper's original vision that they occupy their own unique space in giant monster history. Kong: Skull Island works in the same way that the original works. It has a fast paced plot that serves to get us to the monster action as quickly as possible, it has simple but functional (and well acted) characters that serve the same purpose, and once Kong is introduced it is a nonstop action thrill ride featuring, like the original, many violent and creative ways to kill off nameless human characters.It has a truly striking visual style that looks like a graphic novel come to life, and it borrows its warm orange and green color palette from Apocalypse Now. Kong: Skull Island is probably the best movie to come out of the Legendary Monster Universe. I bumped up my rating to a 9 after watching the Blu Ray version, which somehow looks even better than I remember it looking in the theater.","2 out of 2 found this helpful."

Also along for the journey is Mason Weaver an awarded journalist/photographer. Getting to the island proves to be a struggle as the Island is surrounded by a dangerous storm system, but once past that you are welcomed by a beautifully contained ecosystem.

A power struggle ensures and we learn without a shadow of a doubt who is the true King of Skull Island.The wonder and excitement brought back to life for this classic franchise. This film delivered some fantastic unique plot lines making for a truly refreshing entry for Kong/Godzilla fans and just plain movie fans in general. The use of CGI is prevalent yet needed to even make a movie like this work and it looks fantastic, generally in this kind of movie it tries to highlight the action over the dialog but not here. Tip of the top CGI but with the plot and dialog that is just as strong and stacks together beautifully. The cast speaks for itself, already cemented stars in Samuel L & John C, and a few up and coming stars in Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson & Jason Mitchell.

Plot: When the Vietnam War ends, Bill Randa (John Goodman) and his partner Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) from the Monarch organization succeed to get the financing for an expedition to the recently discovered Skull Island from Senator Willis. He hires the former Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to guide the expedition; a group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L.Jackson); and the awarded journalist and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). On the arrival, the helicopters need to cross a storm and soon they drop bombs on the forest to map the seismology of the island. Soon they are attacked by a huge gorilla called Kong that destroys the helicopters and kills part of the crew and scatter the rest through the island. The group commanded by Conrad meets Hank Marlow (John C.Railey), a survivor from the World War II that lives with a tribe of natives. He explains that Kong protects the island and the natives from underground monsters and shall not be killed. But Colonel Packard is insane seeking revenge for his men that died.My Review: Kong: Skull Island is not just a Kong film but more as a Skull Island film as it got more scope to show its hidden monsters like a giant spider,yak,grasshopper,jurassic period birds and the villain of Temple Run game. (It's not a joke!) Kong is so predictable for a monster film (not like Godzilla) but what goes wrong is its uneven point of view.Even though the character introductions took time it seemed interesting.The movie raised hopes from the scene where they enter the dangerous storm to the scene where Kong smashes their choppers.The entry of Kong and its fight with the choppers is one of the most entertaining and thrilling moments of the year.But unfortunately,this is the end of the good part! There are more lot of monsters and characters in the movie which looks meddled and made the whole movie a mess.When the giant spider attacks,I thought it would be eye-spectacle but it disappointed.All the other monsters are so boring and none of them are scary enough.Even the main villain monster looks silly like the monster in Temple Run.While the King Kong has epic fight with dinosaurs in 2005 version,2017 version lacks such epic moments.The visual effects, the CGI, the overly well-done post-production and DI (digital intermediate) make this Kong outing sexier than it should be. 3D is worth adding a lot of depth into the beautiful Skull Island.In collaboration with cinematographer Larry Fong, the director has made a feature that, in between all of the messy characters and monsters,finds legitimate beauty in the epic landscapes. Combined with a guitar-heavy soundtrack powered by the sounds of Creedence Clearwater Revival, David Bowie, Black Sabbath and more, Kong: Skull Island has an unmistakable, realistic, and story-enhancing aesthetic that gives the film a relief and distinct flavor.The major disappointment is star-cast and Brie-Larson is huge disappointment.After a Oscar-Winning performance I expected a lot from Brie Larson.I know that we shouldn't expect performance from these films,but Brie Larson is totally lost on this film.Tom Hiddleston is Mr.Cool in this film even when the situations are worse.Is it supposed to be inspiring?. John Railey is the only one who put up some note-worthy performance.So,Kong: Skull Island is a messy King Kong film with lot of monsters,lot of characters and lot of boredom.My rating 5.75/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

Kong: Skull Island is everything I wanted it to be, and even more! I love a good popcorn flick, I love a good monster movie, and I certainly love good adventure movies, but it can be said that they are very, very rare. Kong: Skull Island did just that. Yes, the characters are one, maybe two-dimensional, yes the story is full of cliches, the characters are stereotypical, but, me, personally, I was captured by the movie.The visual effects are absolutely spectacular, I can't recall better CGI, compared to this epic movie, except the new Planet Of The Apes trilogy, maybe. The cinematography was sooo beautiful, the sceneries were astonishing, there were moments were I just stood with my mouth open, trying to digest the gorgeous creation, that the crew of this film showed us. The first and the last battle scenes were amazing, I have never seen such a beautiful destruction in a movie. The director of photography showed us miraculous and stunning imagery, very, very colourful. I just loved the scene where Conrad was slashing blue-blooded pterodactyls with a samurai sword, while green poison gases were exploding in the background.I loved that the movie was not shy to show us some violence, besides the PG-13 rating, it was pretty brutal at times. Not many box-office hits do this. The 2 hours passed by magically, I was so engrossed by the magic of this place. The monster battles and the other creatures designs were darn creative.I am a big fan of dramas, big fan of movies full with life lessons and meaning, but c'mon, guys, this was special. We have to give the credits, when something is so professionally made. The example I can think of (because, mostly I am a horror movie fan) is the first Conjuring. That movie was a huuge cliche, but it was soo well made, that it became one of the best modern horror movies. Same az this gem.I dunno, maybe it's just because i love jungles, and I love war movies, but judging by most of the top reviews, I am not alone.Recommended with two hands for everybody!","2 out of 2 found this helpful."

And Legendary's shared cinematic universe. I watched this film at its original release date and never saw it again. Not because I deeply disliked it or anything of that level, but I never felt a strong desire to rewatch it. I remember feeling indifferent towards the movie since it didn't really surprise me in any aspect. If there's one thing no one can complain about MonsterVerse, it's the jaw-dropping visuals that would evolve beyond the wildest expectations as years went by, but even these didn't blow me away completely in this film. Nevertheless, a small part of me had high hopes for this rewatch...The screenplays of these first two movies are pretty similar concerning their narrative structure. Naturally, most of the runtime is spent with human characters who, in this case, wander around an uncharted land supposedly to perform geologic studies. This time, more monsters are displayed on-screen besides Kong and his main adversary, leading to more action sequences, most in broad daylight, which is a major plus. Basically, any viewer is able to follow every fight, even the ones that happen at night since they're beautifully shot by Larry Fong (DP), who uses fire as a lighting device to produce some wallpaper-worthy images. Kong looks incredible, and the monster fights are utterly riveting.The monsters' visuals hold up strong for most of the runtime, except when humans get involved. Despite a fantastic scene between Kong and Samuel L. Jackson's character, some of the humans vs. Monsters sequences are way too weird. Several feature too noticeable green screen, mixing humans and monsters in close proximity, which didn't work as seamlessly as intended. Still, viewers who complained about the lack of Godzilla in his own flick will be more satisfied not only with the increase of action sequences but also with the main monster's sightings. Kong is a visible, powerful presence throughout the film, and Jordan Vogt-Roberts used him right when the movie needed the big monkey the most.However, the characters are so hollow, cliche, insignificant, and underdeveloped that the time spent with them is much heavier than in the previous film, which is by far, the biggest problem with this movie. It's true that Godzilla doesn't deliver a perfect balance between humans and monsters, but at least the former group feels like such. From clear motivations to well-defined personalities, the protagonists are quite compelling and captivating, making the third act reach greater levels of excitement and overall impact. The short period of monsters fighting each other is so efficient and feels so good that viewers left the theaters demanding more, but this feeling only arose due to the time spent with the human characters that offered bigger stakes to the last act.Vogt-Roberts' film features a great cast, no doubt about it, but only John C. Reilly's character gets a decent arc. Therefore, despite spending more time with humans and seeing fewer monsters in Godzilla, Kong: Skull Island feels slower and lazier (so many unnecessary exposition dumps), ultimately transforming the higher amount of action less impactful. In addition to this, a couple of likable characters meet their end in an extremely underwhelming, embarrassingly illogical manner, which always leaves me a bit annoyed. I wish the screenwriters delved more into Kong's story through other methods besides generic exposition, but at least they keep the ""balance of nature"" overarching narrative from the cinematic universe.Technically, I already applauded the visuals above, but I'll do it again. Kong truly is a beauty of a monster. Any wide shots of him standing up are outstanding, but the one with the sunset in the background is a gorgeous painting on the screen. Henry Jackman's score is definitely exciting, possessing a memorable Kong's theme music. Tom Hiddleston (Thor films, Avengers: Infinity War) and Brie Larson (Captain Marvel, Avengers: Endgame) make a good duo, but John C. Reilly (The Lobster, Tale of Tales) steals the spotlight. The editing (Richard Pearson) could be a lot better, but overall, it's a well-produced blockbuster, as expected.Kong: Skull Island doesn't reach the level of the previous MonsterVerse's installment, but it's far from being a massive disappointment. Jordan Vogt-Roberts' sophomore movie follows a similar narrative structure to Godzilla, just with more action sequences (visible and in daylight), more monsters, and a visually stunning Kong. However, most of the runtime stills belong to the humans who, unfortunately, are nowhere near to being as compelling as in the previous film. Except for John C. Reilly's character, everyone else is incredibly hollow, annoyingly cliche, and significantly underdeveloped, making the time spent with them quite heavy. The excessive reliance on lazy exposition scenes also drags the movie, ultimately turning the monster battles less satisfying. Some narrative decisions concerning certain characters are questionable, to say the least, but overall, I believe it still offers what viewers are looking for. Huge praise to Larry Fong's beautiful cinematography and Henry Jackman's addictive score.Rating: C+","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

I was disappointed because I expected more. One of its major problems was the villain lizard thingy in the movie which for the whole entire movie concentrated on. King Kong is supposed to contain different dinosaurs all with the aim of killing. The other king Kong movies had that under their grip but this concentrated too much on the lizard which even didn't really impress me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Because of them I avoided it, but a day on the couch with a virus led me to give it a go, and I'm glad I did - it's fun and entertaining.
The photography and vfx truly stunning. The story is what you'd expect from a Kong film with a lot of the usual Kong clichés, but it wouldn't be a Kong film without them.
It has a very contemporary message about the the insanity of the conflict between humanity and nature,to whom the earth really belongs.
Kong himself is magnificent, and the film style is something like a cross between Jurassic Park and the early Tomb Raider games. It is far better than the 2005 Peter Jackson version.

Nobody is going to be handing an Oscar to Brie Larson or Tom Hiddleston for their work in this movie but they're both pretty good. Probably the only person who rises above looking slightly bored is John C. Reilly. He seems to be having a lot fun with the character and the story picks up when he shows up. Samuel L. Jackson is fine but seems arbitrarily angry throughout. The movie looks great though. I didn't see it in the theatre but I'd imagine it was even more visually appealing. It has some great colour that gives it a 70s feel without feeling retro. I read some complaints of distracting slow-mo but it didn't bother me. This is the DoP of Sucker Punch and Batman v Superman but I don't think he's 'unleashed' like those movies. As for the story it never really rises above passable. They go to Skull Island and King Kong is there. Obviously there's a bit more to it than that but it never rises above monsters attacking people. Do a lot of people do dumb things to move the plot forward? Yes. Did I find that distracting? Not really. It never becomes more than a pretty movie that has so-so fights and too many characters. Don't go out of your way to watch it but hey as a cheap rental? For sure!","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

This also does contain great visuals and incredible cinematography that shows us the world of Skull Island. The one thing that surprises me is how thrilling the movie can be. I won't spoil the movie, but there can be times it would contain bloody scenes. And the action is stunningly engaging. Maybe there can be some issues like how the characters are pretty weak and the story isn't the best for a monster movie. But those cannot keep this from being a fun adventure action movie. If you're a fan of monster movies and would like to see more of an island Kong lives, this can be the one to check out. In fact, I thought it was better than the 2014 Godzilla movie.

As a matter of fact his movie acting is the same as his commercial persona. I cannot understand the good ratings this movie received. Someone must have gotten paid off. The only movie that I think was worse than Skull Island is Noah with Russel Crowe. I think theaters should be required to refund your money if you walk out within the first fifteen minutes.

"6","/10","""Kong: Skull Island"" contains enjoyable action scenes, but is lacking in characters","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3681359/?ref_=tt_urv","midas-jacobs","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur49348973/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2017","A team has discovered an unknown island and was sent to that place to research it. But at arrival they entered the domain of Kong Jordan Vogt-Roberts was the director of this film and he also wasn't really the problem of the film. Visually this film looks good, but that's also the best the film has to offer. The color grading was good enough and gave it a more vintage look and the cinematography overall was pretty good. The director had somewhat sense of scale, because he liked to put a human, as tiny as possible into the frame with Kong, who is ginormous in comparison to said human portrayed on screen. But that immediately brings me to one of the problems of the film: Kong. Well, how he looked at least, because even though he didn't visually look good, the scenes with him in them were the best that you can find in the film. Kong just looked very CGI to me, and he was the best looking CGI creature in the movie. This film is filled with moments in which the CGI is overwhelming. If they'd used more props, or went to location a bit more, this would've changed the movie quite a bit. Especially in the night scenes you could see that they were filmed in a set and that the backdrop consisted out of a green screen. And sometimes the film also goes into the ridiculous department with the CGI by showing the northern lights. Yes, the northern lights, you read that right. I know that they went on location numerous times, but some scenes then were shot in complete green rooms. Another aspect the movie failed at was the tone. It tried to be a drama, and action film, an over the top action film, a comedy, a serious film and all these things did not fit together at all. Often enough it tried to be taken seriously, when just unintentional funny stuff was going on, or it tried to be funny, when there was just nothing to laugh at.The actors were just doing what the script was offering them, which is not a lot. The cast of this film is phenomenal, but underused. They have Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Toby Kebbell, Samuel Jackson, John C. Reilly, John Goodman The list goes on and on. All actors gave good performances, and were only likable due to their natural charisma. Samuel Jackson and John C. Reilly only managed to make their jokes work because of their on screen charisma. But some actors also had no chemistry together on screen and those were the little group of soldiers who were under Samuel Jackson's command. None of them felt like they liked each other and their relationship felt forced from the beginning.The screenplay was the main problem with this film, because dear god, what did they do with the characters? Well, the characters that don't exist, because I've just watched two hours of hollow, empty, characterless human beings interact with each other, interchanged with some awesome scenes of Kong. But they had set up some things to create some interesting character, yet they completely forget about those things. In the beginning of the film for example we see Samuel Jackson's character with a bottle of alcohol, and he seems to be distant in the conversation he's having, which in my opinion insinuates the fact that he might be an alcoholic after the Vietnam War, but they never do anything with that set up character trait throughout the whole movie. The character of Toby Kebbell was given some character by having him write to his son, which practically made him together with John C. Reilly the most developed characters of them all, and the film has quite a lot of characters. John C. Reilly was stranded on the island for a very long time and we get to hear a bit about his past, but most of the time we get to re-hear what he has said before, so that really didn't add a lot to his character. Tom Hiddelston's character is just there to be cool, he's a tracker and that's pretty much all to his character. There's one scene where he talks about his past with Brie Larson, but that scene added very little to me caring for that character. There's also this ridiculous scene involving him in which he just asks for a sword and starts chopping things up, while magically having put on a gasmask with one hand, just to create one badass, senseless looking shot, which wasn't worth it at all. And if you want to know something more about Brie Larson's character: she's a photographer. The dialogue overall was just fine, there were some cheesy one liners, and bad jokes, but as a whole, it didn't achieve much.In the end ""Kong: Skull Island"" wasn't a good movie at all, it was quite disappointing even. The acting was good and the action scenes were enjoyable, but the characters were lacking and the CGI wasn't the greatest. That's why this film gets just a 5.6/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

Going into Kong:Skull Island you would expect to see a film of giant legendary monsters causing havoc with the human cast and having a ruckus between themselves. This is exactly what you get and it's all the better for it.People will go to this film wanting to see a superbly rendered CGI gigantic ape swatting helicopters, hurling and treading on minor characters and going hand-to-hand, teeth-to-teeth with other giant mutated beasties and you get that in spades. The action is pretty relentless throughout and because the cast if full of character actors rather than stars anyone could be on the menu.Those actors do what they need to in their roles without needing to push their abilities. Jackson, Hiddleston, Larsen, Goodman, Hawkins and the rest are all very capable actors who clearly know that they won't be the reason people pay their money to see this film but strike the exact note their roles require. A special note for John C Reilly though who is the character and performance which lingers longest after the credits have rolled.The film isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination and if you think about it too much probably won't make a lot of sense, but its a two hour enjoyable monster movie and there's absolutely no harm in that.Oh and one last thing....being of a certain vintage absolutely loved the soundtrack","14 out of 27 found this helpful."

Apart from the fact they have totally miscast some characters (Hiddleston especially) and the movies saving grace was John C Reilly, Kong: Skull Island was actually pretty entertaining.I went into this knowing it'd be very Hollywood, so I expected nothing less. Why people were expecting more is beyond me. We knew the characters would be clichéd. We knew that Kong would reign supreme. We knew we'd see a load of weird creatures (one thing I hate about the Kong story is the creatures, but I know it has to be there). The story is what it is, it was never going to be some superb script up for Oscars and stuff. Yes, Hiddleston and Larson are beautiful people so we knew they would just be there for eye candy. All I wanted to see was a good Monster Movie, and luckily for me I got it.The story reminded me of Jurassic Park 3. Lots of things were similar, with the Kong spin. Someone lures them all to the Island for one reason, then knowingly tells them it was all for a different reason. They go on the hunt for someone on the Island. There was even a boat they used to try to escape and a few other nods too. It was all very similar to me, but obviously a lot better.Reilly stole the show when he eventually showed up. Hiddleston was a horrendous choice, but I usually like him. Jackson just turns up anywhere nowadays, so his presence in films now really doesn't excite me.Overall, this movie does what it sets out to do. No it isn't perfect but if you go into it expecting a classic, you will be disappointed. One thing I will say is I much preferred this to the 2005 Kong. Apart from the small snippet where Kong came to NYC in the 2005 version, the rest of that movie for me was terrible.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

It's not for the squeamish, however.With the genuine shocks of adrenaline and the action geared towards 3-D viewing, Kong: Skull Island feels like a two-hour roller coaster ride but there's an honest attempt at characterization and story.There's a loosely-established mythology that Kong is the last of his kind and protector to a tribe of very indigenous looking people and a necessary balance to the ecosystem from the dangers of a very ugly creature called the skull duggers and yada yada yada. The film's need for moral parable is precipitated by the fact that Samuel L Jackson (who normally plays such level-headed characters) plays a military commander who's attitudes towards animals are evil with a capital ""E"" which sets up the main narrative conflict of the film, prompting the need for the good guys to step in and rescue Kong from animal cruelty. Perhaps, it's because of the Vietnam setting that the film has an anti-military stance as Jackson's character represents militarism run amok.Chief among the good guys is a castaway played by John C. Rielly who is both a throwback to 50's B-movies (other reviews liken him to ""Apocalypse Now"") and an endearing character in his own right as a castaway who has been stranded on Kong Island for nearly three decades. Brie Larson makes her first big post-Oscar move in style as a Ripley-esque action heroine and Thomas Hiddlestone proves that this guy has a future as a leading man (piggybacking on his great performance in the in ""Night Manager"").""Kong: Skull Island"" is beautifully shot and highly entertaining provided you can stomach it.","14 out of 27 found this helpful."

There were sequels, there were a couple of Japanese things, and in the 70s there was a painfully slow and tedious movie only notable for containing Jessica Lange's all- time worst performance.More recently Peter Jackson attempted to turn the story into a LOTR- style epic, resulting in a few good scenes drowned in sheer bulk.Skull Island is in some ways a return to the simplicity of the original. There's a giant ape on an island of monsters, there's a bunch of people getting killed, and there's a lot of action. The shortest Kong movie in some time, coming in at well under two hours, the film gets in a lot of action and even has room for a madness-of-war, Vietnam-inspired undercurrent (which feels a little random but basically works).The best action scene is Kong versus the helicopters. It's a very intense sequence that, like many scenes in the movie, is a sort of call-back to something in the original. It's unfortunate that the movie can't match that scene elsewhere, but it's generally quite entertaining all the same. I do think it's possible that if you edited the Jackson film from 3 hours to the length of this one it might be the better movie, but based on what was released, Skull Island is easily the best Kong reboot.Skull Island isn't too attached to the original story, which is fine by me. It even virtually ditches the whole ape/girl romance, which went from obsessive love in the original to weirdly sexual in the 70s to girl-as-pet from Jackson to a sort of mutual respect thing in this one. The movie also stays on the island - no empire state building this time around. There's room for a sequel, but I hope this franchise continues to do its own thing.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

A must see & quite a perfect entertaining flick for monster movie lovers. I understand how or why some of the critics are complaining on cheesy dialog & lack of character development parts of the film but to me, those issues were nicely compensated by releasing one after another vicious, weird & interesting massive creatures on screen along through the ""survey job"" turned survival journey of an expedition team on Skull Island. Moreover, this time it isn't that tragic 'The Beauty & the Beast' tale of a colossal ape who all just wanted to have a long date with his woman of love but ended up falling down dead from the Empire State Building. This Kong is quite an angry young lad who's damn serious about protecting his territory and its all helpless inhabitants & creatures from anything that's threatening his kingdom. The epic final battle was a treat to watch & will be remain as something to highly regard & talked about for the monster lovers for a long time. My only complaint is that they really did showed too much (almost all the creatures) on those countless clips & trailers before the release that left little amount of surprise in terms of newly introduced M.U.T.Os for 'MonsterVerse'.","15 out of 30 found this helpful."

In Kong: Skull Island the great ape roars back onto the screen in this spectacular reboot of the classic monster movie. In the 1970s a group of scientists, soldiers and government agents make the epic journey to a remote, uncharted Pacific island in the Pacific Ocean the largest ocean on Planet Earth. But its natural beauty is soon revealed to harbour terrifying secrets in the form of enormous ape King Kong, revered by the locals as a god. But there are even deadlier threats to be faced if the team want to make it off the island alive, namely the man-eating, subterranean skull- crawlers. The latest instalment in Warner Bros' ongoing shared monster universe that began with 2014's Godzilla, this all-action creature feature presents us with the largest incarnation of the rampagingly iconic Kong yet.

So I will give Kong: Skull Island an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say Kong: Skull Island is worth seeing if you like monster / creature films like the previous King Kong films, The Planet Of The Apes films, the Godzilla films, the Jurassic Park films, A Monster Calls, Warcraft: The Beginning, Battleship, the Anaconda films, Deep Blue Sea, Snakes On A Plane, Aliens VS Predator films, The Thing films amongst others. So if you get the chance to see Kong: Skull Island in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.","11 out of 21 found this helpful."

Colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), a mercenary tracker (Tom Hiddleston), a photojournalist (Brie Larson) and a government official (John Goodman) arrive to find a 50-foot gorilla protecting the natives from subterranean creatures that roam the atoll.Conflict erupts when half of the party wants to kill Kong and the other half wants to save him.The most dynamic incarnation of the 80-year old ape, this fast-paced update set in 1973 doesn't waste time with exposition or character development. Instead it gets right down to eye-popping creature clashes that excite much more than they engage. Incidentally, the only way to pacify an enormous primate is with a gigantic tire swing.

Jackson, John Goodman & John C. Reilly besides Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson (of Room fame). The movie takes all these characters to the mysterious Skull Island where not just Kong but a string of other creatures awaits them. What starts as a geological expedition eventually turns into a game of survival.Tom Hiddleston plays one of its kind action hero who does not get to fire a single bullet throughout the movie but he does manage to break off his 'godly' image with this movie. Brie Larson is vibrant as the 'anti-war photojournalist' who lands up exactly in the middle of a war like situation. It's great to see John Goodman and especially John C. Reilly come back in their true form and give some great performances here. Now coming to Samuel L. Jackson, who does it simply with his eyes. No actor could dare stare back at King Kong with the kind of hatred in his eyes, the way he does. His character has multiple layers and he showcases shades of grey here. All said and done, the cinematography by Larry Fong is outstanding. Each and every shot in the movie is beautiful. A monster adventure movie has to have some great camera-work and the camera-work in Kong is the highlight of the movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

The previews I had seen before looked promising; however, I have never liked Kong movies before. This one was very different. I liked the changes and all the surprises in this version, taking place in 1973 after the Vietnam War. Some parts of the film were very intense and violent and parts were sprinkled with welcome humor, mostly because of the character of Hank Marlow, played by John C Reilly. I recommend this movie for adult viewing. The acting, writing, directing, filming, sets and cgi/special effects were all top notch. If you haven't seen the movie yet I have 2 recommendations for you. Watch all the way past the credits for the surprise ending AND keep your eye on the actor Toby Kebbell, who until now I thought just played the part of the soldier, Jack Chapman. I can't say any more without ruining this review with spoilers. Go see the movie.","12 out of 24 found this helpful."

"5","/10","Great special effects with no decent story makes Kong; Skull Island a dull movie.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3659526/?ref_=tt_urv","nzswanny","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53890134/?ref_=tt_urv","11 March 2017","Spoiler free!Let me start off first by saying that I didn't actually like the look of this film in the first place. It looked like cheap garbage, even if the action scenes looked good. It looked as if it was going to be something like the Clash Of The Titans remake. I scrolled down to the comments of the trailer on YouTube, and I was actually surprised to see the positive feedback for the film. I said, ""Oh, alright,"" because I could semi-understand that there was a particular taste toward the type of film they were going for in the trailer. I didn't think it looked that great, because it wasn't my cup of tea. I thought that a loud movie with loud guns was not good enough for my standard of a good film. I think the big point of why that was such a strong opinion for me though is because the 1933 King Kong movie is one of my favorite movies of all time. Same goes to the 2005 one, which was a loud film with loud guns and in a different style with the original, but the director still knew how to keep it as a stable good film, letting it flow well with great pacing and good acting, along with memorable scenes that weren't in the 1933 one. Kong: Skull Island, however, felt that it would be rushed and rather cliché, and not really my idea of a good film.I watched the film, and I have to say, it just wasn't my taste. It seemed too loud and unoriginal, with forced humor that didn't get even a snicker out of me. The audience I was in the cinema with, however, found the film to be very pleasing, and laughed along with the forced humor, so maybe I just wasn't getting the film? It had no memorable scenes, no good direction for where it was going, and ended up as another cliché blockbuster action movie in my opinion. Of course, as I can clearly see, most people like that sort of film, so I can clearly classify myself as no sheep, and admit that even if it isn't my taste, it's plenty of other people's taste.So, I found it to be a dull movie with nothing new. If you, like me, only like loud movies with loud guns if they have a substance to it, then I'd say you'd dislike this film. If you are the normal person who loves movies with big, epic action scenes with tons of CGI and loud blockbuster music, then this should be right up your alley. Overall, I rate this a 5.4/10 for the average rating, however, if it were my personal opinion to rate, I'd rate the film a 3.9/10. If you loved the look of the trailer, though, you'll get exactly what you expect, and probably have a good time.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

But after the ride I just HAD to see this.That being said, Kong still managed to surprise me in a positive way. Here's my breakdown of the things I liked:-KONG IS KING: Honestly, the Kong scenes were spectacular and he looked awesome. To me, the action scenes didn't look overly CGI'd. I thought they did a great job. I was rooting for Kong the whole time basically. And that's what made the suspense of the movie so great, too. There was also some heartfelt ape-human interaction going on (not too cheesy luckily).-NEW MONSTERS: This time, Kong has to fight two sides - while Samuel L. Jackson's character has gone bananas and wants to kill Kong at all costs, there are new, strong creatures lurking from below.-GREAT CAST: If you expect great character development, Kong is not the movie. BUT I thought Tom Hiddleston, John Goodman, Brie Larson and esp. one of my favorite actors, John C. Reilly did a great job in keeping it interesting and fun.If you're up for a fun movie, I'd say go watch this in your cinema with 3D glasses on. This is a movie that works on the big screen, so you can enjoy all the effects.","6 out of 10 found this helpful."

Kong: Skull Island happens to come pretty close to succeeding.A fascinating prologue rewrites some history and sets up an alternate universe in which the existence of a massive gorilla seems somewhat plausible. Brie Larson (the Room star who blew audiences away with her performance of a mother forced to raise a child under terrible constraint) gives a wonderful performance which plays a large part in lifting this film out of the trash heap. At first, I was skeptical about her choice to take on the role of Mason Weaver. But after a breathtaking helicopter scene, her presence begins to make sense: Larson clearly sought a fun role after the depressing elements of Room. And she is able to have fun while still bringing a sense of immense presence through a performance that will have audiences laughing out loud. Her co-star, Tom Hiddleston, is equally funny as a witty tracker looking for riches. The final piece of the puzzle is a wonderful performance by Samuel L. Jackson as a vigilante of sorts. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts does a good job of pulling this all together. But the real star of the show behind the scenes was the sound technician for giving the film one of the greatest soundtracks since films like Watchmen and games like Mass Effect reignited my belief in the film soundtrack as an art. The result is an exciting return to Kong's universe that reignites an otherwise wilting franchise. Audiences of most persuasions will appreciate this as a strong entry into the annals of genre-defying action cinema.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

It's mass marketed nonsense aimed at the lowest comment denominator. I guess I would have to include myself in that bracket, because I thoroughly enjoyed it! We'll ignore Peter Jackson's recently take on the 'King Kong' story, as it bears no relevance here. Instead, back in 1973 the U.S. government discover an island that's remained hidden throughout the years and decide to send in a team to investigate. We're treated to a brief introduction to all the major players and a quick briefing on board the battleship which reminded me of something out of 'Aliens.' And, while we're on the subject of 'Aliens' Ripley would be most proud about the way the military starts dropping bombs all over the island (with a view to 'study' it – no, seriously). So, while helicopters do their best to 'nuke the site from orbit' one of the island's indigenous occupants – an oversize monkey – doesn't take kindly to this course of action and takes down every last one of them, leaving those few survivors not blown up in the massacre to do their best to make their way across the island to the pick-up point before something even worse happens to them.Now, it's not just enraged monkeys who they have to worry about. They have natives, giant spiders and horrible lizard-things who live underground to contend with. And they soon realise that Kong is the least of their problems! I'm lead to believe that this will be the first in a line of these movies, some even crossing Kong over with other existing franchises ('Godzilla' anyone?) so naturally Kong is – justifiably – the star. However, this does mean that some of the humans are kind of left in the background a bit. It does try to handle quite a large cast and not all of them get the screen time they deserve.Arguably the film's (human) star is Tom Hiddleston. He's basically everything you'd expect a fantasy/action film's leading man to look like. And, as anyone who's seen him in action as Loki in any of the Marvel films, you'll know he's got the screen presence to pull off the leading man role. And, I'm sure he can. He just never really gets the chance here. It just feels like he never gets a true chance to shine as there are so many other people to also feature that he's only there to look manly and give us a possible hint at a romance with the obligatory female co-star. Of course when you also have Samuel L Jackson among the cast, you really need to give him something to do as you don't want to run the risk of wasting acting talent like his. And, to be fair, he does his best with all the screen time he's afforded and the 'stare-down' between him and Kong is truly chilling. John C Reilly is also worthy of a mention, simply because he balances some much-needed humour with a role that allows him to be more than just the standard 'comic relief.' Now, with any film where there's a strong element of danger in it, you expect there to be a bunch of cast members who are there only to make up the numbers and will be routinely killed off at various points in the film. 'Kong: Skull Island' certainly has plenty of these and – yes – most end up in the belly of a giant arachnid or something. However – without wishing to spoil anything – a few of them make it further into the film than you'd imagine. They're given next to no screen time, yet they last longer than characters you've grown closer to. Of course all human stars play second fiddle to the 'real' star of the show – the titular character 'Kong' himself, who is looking pretty good for his age! In other words the computer effects used to bring him to life are realistic enough to give him more than just your standard CGI monster. And, isn't he the real reason we're going to watch this film? If there is a down-point it's that it's a little long and some scenes seem a bit drawn out. Plus, when Kong smacks down on other CGI creatures, the effects do blur together a bit into one fast-moving mess (but at least it's still not as bad as any of the Transformers movies!). However, if you're expecting a popcorn flick which, despite hardly re-inventing the wheel as far as plot and character development go, you should get some enjoyment in seeing Kong battle it out against all manner of human and monster foe. It's not meant to be a great work of art, so please forgive it its failing and enjoy it for what it is. Let's just hope that whatever sequels and crossovers its success spawns don't dip in quality too much (Transformers, I'm thinking of you again!).","6 out of 10 found this helpful."

Sure, there isn't a blonde woman being kidnapped, and sure there isn't a scene where Kong climes up a skyscraper.. but not relying on the tropes of the series doesn't excuse the unimaginative storyline here. It's aesthetic is a Vietnam war film. CCR blasts the soundtrack. You know where this is going. The characters are wooden. The only thing they've got going for them is their star power. John Goodman does a good job as always. John C. Reilly is a treat to see. However, Samuel L. Jackson is Samuel L. Jackson.. again. Also, the jumps scares.. why? Why is Hollywood still relying on jump scares in the horror/sci-fy genre? I'm sick of it. The sound dies down and BOOM a creature pops out. This happens a dozen times here. Enough. The effects in Kong are as good as they should be, but it's certainly not a standout. The new Planet of the Apes series is truly wowing with realistic looking apes.

It's a world known to movie fans to be full of prehistoric or unnaturally gigantic monsters, and things are very much the same in Jordan Vogt-Roberts' entertaining big-budget update. Anyone fearing a retread of the story told back in 1933 and never bettered since can relax, as Kong: Skull Island is less interested in exploring the incredibly fragile relationship between man and nature than it is with smashing helicopters to pieces in front of a gorgeous sunset.Both a follow-up to 2014's Godzilla and a build-up to the upcoming smack-down cross-over between two of the big screen's most famous abominations, Kong carries on the tone by making its human characters infinitely less interesting than the big guy we all came to see. Early trailers and posters before the film's release teased a tone akin to the great Vietnam War , especially Apocalypse Now, but there are little similarities other than the famous shot from Coppola's movie of helicopters flying by a setting sun and the 1973 setting. This is big, dumb fun, and little more, but that is by no means a bad thing. Peter Jackson tried earnestly back in 2005 to tell the traditional story with a mixture of heart and spectacle, with mixed results. It climaxed with the ape's relocation to the mainland and his tragic end at the top of the Empire State Building, but here, once government agents/scientists Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) seal the required funds and hit the island, we never leave.At just shy of 2 hours, Skull Island struggles to handle the unnecessarily expansive cast of characters, and boy are they bland. Tom Hiddleston's British Special Forces captain James Conrad (an obvious nod to Heart of Darkness author Joseph Conrad) is the closest thing we have to a lead, but this is only because he is handsome and warns the others of danger. They are escorted by Samuel L. Jackson's Preston Packard, a Lieutenant Colonel in charge of a helicopter squadron called the Sky Devils whose idea of scientific study is to bomb the s**t out of the island upon arrival. Among the rag-tag bunch of monkey-food soldiers are the grizzled Cole (Shea Whigham), and Jack Chapman (Toby Kebbell, who also performs the motion-capture for Kong), an eager-to-please young buck with a questionable American accent. In a somewhat baffling move, they also invite photojournalist Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) on a mission you would expect the Army to want to keep quiet.At one point, I counted three concurrent story lines. Supporting characters such as John Ortiz's Nieves and Tian Jing's San are played by familiar faces but serve absolutely no purpose, and only John C. Reilly's stranded World War II veteran Hank Marlow brings any heart and soul to the story. Yet, Roberts knows how to make carnage look incredibly cool, and this is the meanest, leanest and biggest Kong to date. Helicopters are torn to shreds, a giant octopus (living in fresh water?) is brutally devoured, and soldiers are swallowed whole - Kong doesn't have time to share a tender moment with a beautiful woman lying in his palm. When the action shifts away from the puny humans and to the titular powerhouse, the film is so damn exciting that you can, for a short time, forgive the film's many misgivings and clichés. It's unlikely that the 1933 original will ever be topped, so it's pleasing that Kong: Skull Island at least makes an attempt to try something a little different. For a B-movie dressed up as an A-movie with only one memorable character who isn't simian, it certainly entertains.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

He is pretty very sparingly used in this film all things considered. But unlike his Giant Lizard counterpart, we actually get to see him much more clearly. There are several really well taken shots of him in this movie. Plus, the way that he is animated in this movie is really well done. There are a few moments in this film where we get to see more of his humanity come through. And of course, the ape level of action is pretty cool to watch, especially at the end.There were several action scenes in this movie, but most of them aren't because of Kong. Some of the survival action scenes because of the Island were done pretty well. The storytelling, and personality of Skull Island comes through in this movie fairly well. The cinematography of the Island is shot really well.But of course, the downside once again in these movies comes to us courtesy of the uncompelling human character stories. I will say that comparatively to the last movie, the human characters were not as flat thankfully. Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Sam Jackson, and especially John C. Reily made this movie a lot more interesting character wise. They played there Respective characters well, and led the movie just fine. Do I think they could've been given so much more to do, YES. But regardless, they were good.Overall, I do think this movie is a better movie than 2014's Godzilla. As much as I wanted to like this, I think it's fair to put this as a film that is better than ok. But nowhere near the greatness that it could've been.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Below are a few of the ancient reasons why we Kong will always be King:Jungle Fever: Skull Island is one the surface unlike anything else on planet earth as we see an array of inhabitants each living their lives to the sound of one drum beat. I felt enamoured at times with depth of Kong's home turf although some of it did feel like a music video due to off- beat yet comical acting. CGI is pretty much the only way I'll ever be able to experience what seeing Kong in the flesh might actually be like unless Big Foot comes out of retirement and releases an autobiography. The Island as a place I'll be honest is a little cliché' but that being said it works, sometimes the writing is on the wall in this scenario it's the pre-historic caveman-esque Frederick Flintstone drawings which really denote Kong as friend and not foe. The island itself is pretty a much homage to Apocalypse Now, but we do get elements of Bear Grylls/Ray Mears seep through. Based loosely on Vietnam this jungle definitely makes you consider what you may need in a survival kit.Guns and Roses: This is not a film which could produce an Oscar nominee on paper it has a strong cast with Hiddlestone, Goodman, J.C Reilly and Jackson. Although the wise man once said ""there's never smoke without fire"" that fire I'm referring to is more or less a campfire. On screen the actual dialogue between the characters in a serious sense is irrelevant as everyone has their own agenda and lives by their principles anyway. However, the comedic value at times produces genuine moments of laughter – honestly I almost spilt my popcorn over the person next to me. Okay that's a lie as nobody buys popcorn but I did laugh which is something I wasn't prepared for so kudos to the writers. At times I felt like I was watching actors being themselves instead of playing a fleshed out character, in other words Jackson just seemed assertive, loud and nonsensical. Whereas Hiddlestone was clearly using this as a stepping stone for an Indiana Jones comes James Bond audition as he was cool, calm and collective in situations where you might need to reach for the duvet. Goodman/Reilly began as serious characters but ended up as a Captain Jack Sparrow tribute act, although at times it was touching and felt slightly genuine. There are other male characters but they mostly became cannon fodder and didn't really leave a lasting impression only in a comical sense. Overall the guns a.k.a. the men gave an enjoyable performance which did at times create moments which will stick in the memory.The only rose within this film was the empowering anti-war photographer which was played out by Brie Larson. I'll be honest I've seen stronger performances – the character had a brilliant start and came out the traps as smart, quick-witted and humorous. As per all (original) Hollywood flicks this wouldn't last long and there must be something in the air within the Jungle as she'd gone head-over-heels for Hiddleston's action man demeanour. Once the love-bug had been instilled her character just lost momentum serving as a backup dancer to Hiddlestone. Although Larson's character did come good once again giving a convincing and heartfelt moment with Kong.Forrest Gump: Kong was at times like a kid in a toy store and other times a menacing, commanding and authoritative figure. The terrifying figure of Kong looms large but as does Kong's heart and soul which is frequently misunderstood (in order to reinforce fear) but deep down Kong has a lot of inner-demons. Skull Island's Kong is the best Kong I've seen in a long while this because we see a lot more of Kong that you might expect and he's been humanised to the point where you think he could be just a really hairy punter down at your local. Kong's heart of gold is exemplified as he wanders about aimlessly at times producing good-will acts for those around him almost similar to Earl in My Name is Earl. Humanising Kong destroys the reputation of the big-guy it's like seeing Uncle Phil cry over food in the Fresh Prince. Although humanising Kong and conquering man's fear of the unknown has always been the super-glue to the franchise without this element it would just be a cruel hunting show. Kong needs to do little to get people in awe and I feel this will always hold the behemoth in good stead, I really did enjoy the moments of intense drama Kong produced in this edition of his life story.The Kings Speech: I definitely felt Kong's presence and I feel I'll Skull Island of the bucket list for now but in short, I feel Skull Island is a must see. There are moments of awe, humour and genuine high-quality drama which make you wince a little causing you to be throw popcorn wildly in the air. This franchise will never cease to amaze as the backbone of what makes Kong great is believable. Kong scores a loud and almost defining 7/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

BOTH films are different, Peter Jackson version is more serious tone with tiny at the moment humour, whereas Kong Skull island is more of action comedy. I have to say it was disappointing and hard to sit through. The story was unbalance on to where these ""Skull Crawlers"" came from. Lack of adventure, didn't explore this new fascinating world. Lack of character development so you couldn't care less when characters died. Towards the end it went to typical Hollywood film, big explosion Michael Bay style and typical female character as a damsel in distress. The only thing that kept me watching was Samuel L. Jackson and John Goodman. I've said a lot of harsh words to his film, it is entertaining with some giggles to it, but I felt it didn't need to go that direction. If the next squeal is what I think it is, I don't want to see any jokey moments when it should be a serious fight between the two kings/ gods.","5 out of 13 found this helpful."

Now this movie is titled after King Kong, but its not just the king himself, in the 2005 version the king destroys dinosaurs and other creatures while Kong: skull island has a whole range of creatures, call it Kong and friends: skull island. In the 2005 version of King Kong which went for 3 hours and 10 minutes it took half the movie to reveal King Kong, in this one you see an early view of Kong straight away. Kong: skull island goes for 2 hours, which I thought was good because it didn't drag the movie on for to long, it went straight the point. The movies cast was spectacular. J.K. Simmons and Michael Keaton were originally supposed to be cast ed in this film but both had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, which I thought worked out well because the bad ass Samuel L. Jackson took Simmons place and John C. Reilly took over Keaton's role.Actors: as I said, I loved the cast for this movie, Tom Hiddleston as James Conrad, a hired soldier for the team, Samuel L. Jackson as Preston Packard was the chief, John Goodman as Bill Randa who was one of the geologists, and more. Jason Mitchell and Corey Hawkins both played in Straight Outta Compton with Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre and Jason Mitchell as Eazy E and returned again to play in Kong: skull island which was great. You can also tell John Goodman has aged in This movie. Director: Jordan Vogt-Roberts created the look of the new King Kong to look similar to the first King Kong in 1933. Editing: the editing in the movie was great, there was great shots and clips of the movie that blow you away. Kong himself looked good and horrific and so did all the other creatures. Feedback: Now, no matter who you are, go see this movie. In my opinion everyone would love this movie. The whole movie is so entertaining, there's not much scenes which bore you with scientific information in this movie, it is action packed, like a huge gorilla the size of a building destroying and killing everything in its path, its just spectacular. To me there was no faults in this movie except for a off leading ending that wasn't fully satisfying. There is a after credits scene with Godzilla, which I missed and found out later. I was also surprised to find out that a majority of the film was filmed in Gold Coast, Australia. If your want to see a movie with friends or just want to Catch a flick, go see Kong: skull Island in theaters Now! I rate Kong: Skull Island a 8.2/10Check out my YouTube channel, to find more reviews including this one at : Real Kritics","11 out of 22 found this helpful."
"6","/10","I wanna give this Monsterverse a chance.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5168747/?ref_=tt_urv","richarddillomes","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur84619064/?ref_=tt_urv","7 October 2019","So apparently they're working on a MonsterVerse, inspired by MCU no doubt, and this is the second installment after 2014's Godzilla. While Kong: Skull Island is eons away from even being on the same level as the weakest of the MCU titles (I'm looking at you The Incredible Hulk), they're faring much better compared to the planned Dark Universe featuring monsters of the smaller kind such as vampires, werewolves and the lot. Depending on who you ask, the first movie is either 2014's Dracula Untold or 2017's The Mummy, both received negative reviews and the latter considered as a box-office dud.Given that perspective, bear with me as I try to save this 8th movie from the King Kong franchise so we can look forward to 2020's Godzilla vs. King Kong movie. I do remember having seen a Kong movie as a kid, and I'm assuming that it's 1986's King Kong Lives. I may or may have not seen Peter Jackson's King Kong in 2005 but I'll be sure to remember having seen this version years from now. Not that it's a testament to the movie's quality, but more of because I want to give their planned multiverse a chance.Starring Loki, Nick Fury and Captain Marvel, I mean Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson and Brie Larson, along with other heavily armed men, they set out for an island that had a way of keeping itself away from the world's prying eyes, and they start bombing it even before they landed and as expected all hell breaks loose when they face a young Kong and puts them in their place early on. But humans being the idiots that we are, goes after it even as they're told Kong is protecting them from other monsters lurking within the island. With natural selection taking its course (thankfully), the heroes live to see another day until they go on to their next expedition.Almost everything in the movie was done by the numbers. I tried to guess what was gonna happen next, especially at the beginning and I got most of it correct. Cue the handsome lead playing pool in a bar. Cue the rock music. Cue the ride into sunset shot. Cue the guitar riffs. Cue the suspicious female lead. Cue Samuel L. Jackson spouting out expletives. While it's predictability was annoying (I can still tell the difference between an homage and lazy writing so don't @ me), there were some really cool shots, one being the close-up of Samuel L. Jackson's eyes then fading into Kong's. The fight scenes and effects were believable enough to keep you on the edge of your seats and the island itself and it's mystery is akin to when we first stepped inside Jurassic Park. Also of note is the director's vision on how to differentiate his Kong from the others before it: it's still in its adolescent years and was left to fend for itself surrounded by the creatures that killed it's parents shortly after it was born. Making something mysterious relatable and accessible was a brilliant move and should bode well for the franchise as we head on to the next installments about beasts we only know we should be afraid of.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

I was curious about how they were going to reboot Kong and bring him to the Godzilla universe since King Kong the original was a pretty conclusive story. The premise is ""Scientists, soldiers and adventurers unite to explore a mythical, uncharted island in the Pacific Ocean. Cut off from everything they know, they venture into the domain of the mighty Kong, igniting the ultimate battle between man and nature. As their mission of discovery soon becomes one of survival, they must fight to escape from a primal world where humanity does not belong"". So is Kong a great reboot or a piece of banana peel?Firstly, the visuals and cinematography by Larry Fong are gorgeous. Some stunning shots are proper eye candy. Due to the location of where they filmed, we also got some interesting environments to look at as well compared to the grey dull city from Godzilla (2014). The cinematographer and director perfectly capture the Vietnam War-style and incorporates it into a monster movie. It sounds like it shouldn't work but it does mesh well. Additionally, there is a very talented cast in this movie including Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson, John Goodman, John C. Reilly and more. All of them give great performances with props to Samuel L Jackson for striking the right craziness that fits the movie.I also really enjoyed the design of Skull Island which looks beautiful but lies a lot of scary stuff. The monster designs all look brilliant from the giant Spider to the giant Moose and the scary Skull crawlers. I also really enjoyed the action scenes including the ones that are just the humans. They are all fun to watch but the Kong scenes are the most exhilarating. Kong: Skull Island also goes in a drastically different tone compared to Godzilla (2014) by being way more over the top and comedic. It's fine and there are some funny moments in there.However, there are too many characters in this movie. It's obvious most of them are expendable but the movie spends a fair amount of time on these expendables characters which feel like padding for time. It also feels like it is taking screen time from the leading main characters. Furthermore, it doesn't even take the time to fully delve into our leading characters, James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), motives or backstories. There is a later part where these characters make what is an important decision but you don't get why they decide to do it or the weight behind the decision because we the audience barely know anything about them. On top of that, all the supporting characters are very one-dimensional so there ain't any interesting characters whatsoever. Loads of characters die and the movie tries to portray this in a serious and meaningful, but it comes off as ironically funny. For example, one character chooses to delay the monster with other characters screaming for them to not do it but he then dies hilariously.The movie also goes at an incredibly fast pace and never really takes a moment to breathe some life into Kong and the human characters. It just goes from point A to B and then it's over. This can be fine if the things that occurred had good dialogue but it doesn't. There is a lot of dialogue that adds nothing to the plot and just feels like more padding to get the runtime closer to 2 hours. For example, some characters give real cryptic statements like ""Sometimes the enemy doesn't exist until you go looking for them"". Yeah, that sounds cool and all but what does that have to do with Kong punching a giant lizard? It's just wasteful dialogue.Overall, Kong Skull Island is silly but very entertaining. It's nowhere near as good as the original King Kong but it certainly works as a serviceable popcorn movie. If Kong ever gets another solo outing then hopefully they utilize Kong's connection with humans more as that is an advantage he has over Godzilla for a more compelling story.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

The people who enter Skull Island are colonialists and cinematography and photography are among their weapons, while Kong is the visual-effects marvel of a monster-as-movie to be captured and released back upon the ""civilized"" world. In this case, he's but one American movie among an entire legion of Japanese kaiju in the so-called Monsterverse. The after-credits scene actually works well in this regard.Quite the cross-fertilization the Monsterverse has with the template cinematic universe of the MCU, what with borrowing Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson, as well as John C. Reilly, I guess, and returning them afterwards with interest in the form of Brie Larson. And, this is on top of the would-be Maximoff twins making out in the first Monsterverse entry, ""Godzilla"" (2014). Even compared to Loki, Fury and Captain Marvel, though, their characters here are thin. An amoral mercenary, a warmonger commander, an ""anti-war"" photojournalist and some obsessed monster hunters, OK and what else is there to flesh them out as characters? Oh, that's it. Only Reilly holds some interest as to what will happen to him, providing both the picture's comic relief and, besides the giant ape created in computers, the emotional center that one might've thought would be occupied by Hiddleston and Larson, but they'd be wrong. Meanwhile, Jackson goes superficial ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) levels of insane, while other familiar faces, like John Goodman or Richard Jenkins, are wasted.Other than a bunch of CGI fighting, including some quite good shots of Kong's confrontation with the helicopters, the filmmakers did well to have a couple of their characters equipped with cinematographic and photographic cameras--making them the on-screen surrogate filmmakers in addition to being hollow characters. Unlike the 1933 original, we don't get the surrogate spectators of New York being attacked by the monster from the stage, although there's a reference to Kong's being chained before that here. At least, as all the dialogue makes very clear, the picture acknowledges its metaphor of Vietnam War type imperialist folly and in Kong's eternal battle with the lizards the ecological importance of predators. And, on that last account, is the main fantasy of these giant monster movies: that people may be held in check by not being the apex predator. Kong is just a movie, though--he doesn't exist, but there are plenty of Colonel Packards to go around letting loose skull crawlers, or whatever you want to call it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

The cast, including Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, delivers solid performances amidst the chaos of colossal creatures. The film editing maintains a brisk pace, ensuring the audience is never far from the next jaw-dropping encounter. While the music may not linger in memory, it effectively enhances the tension of the monster-filled narrative. The movie's strength lies in its stunning cinematography, capturing the mythical beauty and danger of Skull Island. However, the weakness emerges in a somewhat predictable plot that doesn't deviate far from the monster movie formula. With a 6/10 rating, ""Kong: Skull Island"" offers a satisfying blend of monster mayhem and cinematic spectacle, even if it doesn't redefine the genre.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

As part of Legendary's ""Gods & Monsters"" universe, we encounter Kong himself...without the Empire State Building. A group of soldiers, explorers, photographers, geologists, biologists and every other ""ologist"" venture forth to Skull Island. Uncharted territory, unique creatures and full of mysterious enigmas. What do they do? Drop seismic bombs. What the actual flip!? No scientist in their right mind would drop a barrage of bombs to determine the island's activity. It's unfortunate this occurs right at the start, it left a sour taste throughout the entire film. Which is a shame because the action, cinematography, sound effects and pacing were all decent. Watching Kong, in all his CGI glory, wreck through a fleet of helicopters by javelining trees, stomping on soldiers and just generally making a mess felt satisfying. Serves them right! You hurt nature, well...nature is just going to bite back, using a gargantuan primate's teeth. Really adored the cinematography and colour palette, embedding various micro slow motion shots to enhance the action. Green, red, blue...it's extremely colourful and vibrant. Unfortunately though, the characters are lifeless and wasted. I literally did not care for any of them...no wait, John C Reilly's character was likeable. That's about it. Eat them, shoot them, explode them, drown them, stomp on them, slap them onto mountain sides...I don't care. Which, in turn, makes the story all that much boring as well. What I admired about 'Godzilla' was that less is more. We see Kong in the first five minutes so there is no mystery or intrigue. It sounds like I'm being too harsh, I did enjoy this. The visual effects were splendid, action was well filmed and everything looked aesthetically pleasing. As I've said before in various reviews, style without substance does not make a great film.

"6","/10","Skull Island is a festival of clichés and stereotypes that fails to prove itself as anything more than mere entertainment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6271196/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","14 November 2020","Leaving aside classic history, the film quickly settled in 1973, immediately after the North American departure from the Vietnam War. Such a troubled moment not only brings a political aspect to the plot, very lightly, but it is also the justification for the great influence of the director: Apocalypse Now, considered by many to be the greatest war movie ever made! The feature directed by Coppola appears on the scene at various times: be it by yellowish photography and in warm tones, by the dynamics of the military involving the war, by the repeated use of helicopters with the reddish sun in the background or by a short scene, but of immense symbolism: a man smiling with pleasure, savoring the explosions caused by the bombs on Skull Island, reflected in his sunglasses. More Bill Kilgore from Apocalypse Now, impossible!Only Kong appears, and the problem is not even the existence of the giant monkey, but the turnaround it causes in the story that follows. If the first clash of the island's king is even impressive, causing the viewer to be immersed in the position of crew member of the helicopter, from then on the itinerary is diluted in an impressive poverty. With everyone on dry land, the personality of each co-protagonist is prominently highlighted. None of them are well developed, either because they are there or because of their intentions since then. Worse: good actors, like Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, are completely wasted, since the plot does not exploit the anti-hero air with which Hiddleston is presented and even Larson never leaves the classic ""blonde from Kong"" posture. The two protagonists, who should transcend and consummate journeys, or at least serve better as interpreters in the bond they establish with the viewer, are indebted: Hiddleston and Larson, underdeveloped since the beginning of the film.
Vogt-Roberts is also very creative in conducting the show. Although dominated by visual effects and CGI creatures, such as Peter Jackson's King Kong, the film's great conflicts benefit from an agile and elaborate virtual camera, which constantly circulates the action and offers slow-motion views in a style similar to that of Zack Snyder. The director also deserves credit for the precise and punctual use of super close-ups in the characters' eyes, something that accentuates the conflict between Jackson's military and the giant gorilla, as well as the grand open plans that value the vast difference in size between Kong - very expressive thanks to motion capture by Toby Kebell - and the rest of the humans. In addition to all this admirable visual care, it is worth mentioning at least the exquisite work of editing and mixing the sound of the feature, which explodes in beating strings and still offers small moments of brilliance, such as when soldiers try to locate a creature following the sound of a camera stuck in your stomach.Partly a war movie, partly a pulp adventure, the feature film directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts manages to amuse while exploring conflicts that are at the heart of the human species. The plot shows a group of explorers and military men who set out to explore the island that gives the film its title. There you will find not only King Kong, but also a wide variety of monsters ranging from giant spiders to eyeless lizards. A very interesting point is that Kong: The Skull Island knows what it is, without trying to be a deep war drama and without also becoming a satire on itself. In his references, Vogt-Roberts knows how to work with visual elements from Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Predator, Full Metal Jacket and Good Morning, Vietnam to create a tropical, cynical and destructive atmosphere by nature - just like the real conflict portrayed in all these influences.In addition to its latent pop aspect loaded with references from films, videogames and anime, Kong: Skull Island brings with it a political aspect present in the 70s, giving a new perspective to the old conflict of Man vs Nature and how the wars and the choice of enemies in the real world. Vogt-Roberts materializes the mixture of these two halves in a bobble head by Richard Nixon present in one of the helicopters that arrives on the island. The soundtrack is also a show on its own, with tracks ranging from Creedence Clearwater Revival to Black Sabbath through David Bowie in the middle of it all. ""Paranoid"", ""Ziggy Stardust"" and ""Bad Moon Rising"" are some of the songs that are present in the feature.Skull Island is capable of making Kong a god of its own mythology, something that none of the previous films actually did. For the natives, the monkey is the ultimate protector against other dangerous creatures in the area. Last of his kind, he spends his days fighting various threats and wandering aimlessly around the island, protecting his subjects and the world from unimaginable threats
The monsters that inhabit the island also have an interesting design, mixing elements like branches and leaves on their bodies. The Skeleton Climbers, the main antagonists of the feature, resemble a mix of reptiles and convey an almost palpable feeling of disgust. Finally, it is impossible to stop talking about Kong. At first, the animal's scale seemed disproportionate, but on canvas it is a credible size in relation to the island and the other monsters. With far less expression than the gorilla in the film directed by Peter Jackson in 2005, this version of Kong is more like a disciplined warrior who needs to defend his people. No passion for the human of the expedition, just a ruler doing his duty.
However, apart from the look and that fun experience provided by pyrotechnics, there is nothing very memorable about this Kong. The script is fraught with problems, presenting successive scenes that border on embarrassment. If, at the beginning, there was already a strange feeling about the existence of a samurai sword inside the cockpit of a war plane (???), there is the ""teleportation"" of two characters, who were not in the helicopters, to the place where the survivors are. - serious failure of continuity! Shortly afterwards, Brie Larson tries to lift a helicopter on her own and, later on, presents an unbelievable speech in the face of a discussion between other characters. Hiddleston, for his part, has his usual hero scene wearing a gas mask to, still surrounded by toxic gas, remove the protection and move on - are there physical limits around the gas in an open environment? John Goodman, always wide-eyed, completely loses his role in the plot, while Samuel L. Jackson takes on the schematic tone of his character for good.Unlike the 2005 version of Peter Jackson, who knows how to build the narrative taking care to present the characters and the relationships he has with each other, the opposite happens here. The script is straightforward, does not waste time introducing characters and is constructed in a way that each situation simply leads to another encounter, another fight until it reaches the obvious climax. It is the basic formula of Hollywood action cinema at its peak. Making the most of its unusual premise, Kong: Skull Island is a festival of clichés and stereotypes that fails to prove itself as anything more than mere entertainment, but that at least makes it worth the visit to the cinema and offers a careful plastic care hands of your talented director.The visual effects are prodigiously breathtaking, combined with a spectacular photograph of the competent Larry Fong. The instrumental score was composed by Henry Jackman and positively accompanies the rhythm of the film, but it is not one of the best ever composed by him. And the nostalgic, who hope to find the famous and iconic scene of the giant monkey hanging from the top of the Empire State Building, will come across an adventure filled with rock, sunsets, napalm explosions, a sergeant thirsty for revenge, a crazy stuck on an island. However, what should animate most is the promise that this Kong will cross its path with something much bigger in the future, since the post-credit scene confirms an unexpected cinematic universe.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

I wasn't disappointed, nor was I impressed. The movie was what I thought it was going to be. Allow me to go further.Synopsis: A diverse team of scientists, soldiers and adventurers unite to explore a mythical, uncharted island in the Pacific, as dangerous as it is beautiful. Cut off from everything they know, the team ventures into the domain of the mighty Kong, igniting the ultimate battle between man and nature. As their mission of discovery becomes one of survival, they must fight to escape a primal Eden in which humanity does not belong. Starring: Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman Director: Jordan Vogt-RobertsFirst thing: How many Marvel actors can this put in this one movie? Apparently there are rumors out there that Mr. Goodman is going to be part of the MCU here soon as well. You will not hear me complain about that.So, let's get the vegetables out of the way. There are two things that hurt the movie more than anything else. One was that almost all the action scenes were made to be slo-mo. All it did was add time to the movie. If the action would have been normal speed there could have been ten minutes taken out. Sure, the slo-mo was able to add more to the scenes, but it just became senseless after a while.The other thing was the initial humor. The un-initial humor was okay, but when people tried to be funny in the movie, it only hurt. I know John C. Reilly was added for the humor, but it didn't work in the long run.The best thing about this movie? Sam L. Jackson. Sure, you can tell what he was going to do from the time you saw him first pop up on the screen, but it was fun waiting for it. He played the part perfectly.The other actors, aside from Mr. Reilly, were good in their roles. Tom and Brie played off each other quite well. Sadly we won't get to see them together in another movie. I'll explain that in a minute.Maybe if the director wouldn't have used the slo-mo so much I would say he did a good job. But he didn't, so I won't.The story was perfect for what they were trying to do. They set up the MonsterVerse, as they call it at the production company, in the right way. Using the full name for M.U.T.O. confused quite a few people. Not to toot my own horn, but: toot-toot. I understood what was happening from the second I heard the full name. The after- credits scene only solidified what was happening.Final Thoughts: Watch the movie. It is a fun movie. Of course, watch Godzilla first, then watch this movie. You'll thank yourself for that.Rating: 7 out of 10","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

Wait... is Sharknado a monster movie?
Well, it doesn't really matter, cause this is probably worse than Sharknado.The story is absolutely ridiculous. It started of ok, somewhat plausible but as the movie went on, it quickly deteriorated into more and more absurd.There is a female lead, a photographer. She is clearly there to be the female heroine and save save the day. But there is absolutely no thought as to how she should do it. This makes her role, her lines stupid to the extreme.
Three people walk onto a wild island and see a giant monkey.
The military guy says ""lets kill it"".
The scientist guy says ""lets study it"".
The female photographer heroine says ""this is crazy, stop"".
Somehow, everyone listens to the photographer who has no survival skills, no military skills and no scientific knowledge. She didn't even say anything, didn't even give any instruction on what to do but everybody stops arguing, after all ""it's crazy"".
Now, since the argument is over and she didn't propose any farther topics of discussion, what does the movie do? Well, why not just cut to the next scene with a shot of the giant monkey.Oh yeah, lets not forget that Kong is indestructible. It can not be killed by bullets, nor explosives, nor burn in fire. Even it's fur doesn't burn in fire, much less skin.Listen, and understand! That Kong is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until this movie is awful!","3 out of 7 found this helpful."

He had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. This movie introduced a new benchmark for all monster- type movies.The story was simple. A group of scientists alongside a military escort went to Skull Island to investigate the hypothesis that monsters do exist. But they did not know what the monsters were. As a result, they were poorly prepared for what was awaiting their arrival. The military escort did not know what ""that"" was when first spotted, and it resulted in complete and total destruction. Their air crafts had no chance against King Kong's massive size and strength. I enjoyed that there was a good balance between King Kong's screen time versus the survivors trying to make it off the deadly island before it was too late.Preston Packard, played by Samuel L. Jackson, was absolutely annoying. He was arrogant, and he kept on putting his own personal gain over his team's survival. His objective was to kill King Kong. He did not care how many of his men and women he would lose; he wanted King Kong dead. He did not care about the skull crushers (giant lizard things) either, and they were the real threat on Skull Island. But despite Packard knowing this, he still did not care. It was selfish and illogical for him to do that.Kank Marlow, played by John C. Reilly, was too funny. He had me laughing because his sense of humor when facing death was on point.The end credits left us with a scene for an upcoming sequel. But this sequel will be with none other, Godzilla! It will be awesome to see what happens with the King Kong versus Godzilla in the future.","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

Sadly, that is about all I can say for the movie, since it really does have nothing else. The cast is severely underused, therefore I had no connection with any of the characters whatsoever. The writing is BAD, seriously bad. Almost all of the dialogue was either painfully obvious exposition or simply unnecessary quips that would even feel out of place in a terrible late-night B movie. The main creatures (aside from Kong) feel very uninspired and the species that Kong frequently fights becomes very boring to look at almost immediately.If you're looking for some mindless entertainment with pretty visuals then Kong might be it, but don't expect anything more than that.","3 out of 7 found this helpful."

The film is about Kong and so he has much more screentime than Godzilla back in 2014. The action scenes have really good CGI, are very entertaining and good directed. Unfortunately you really see that there are a lot of scenes cut off. So suddenly characters appear that you have not seen in this movie until yet. The tone also changes suddenly to fast. For example, when they arive in the Skull island, you hear paranoid from black sabbath and the suddenly kong appears and you have really dramatic music. The next problem is, that Brie Larson's character has not got a personality. The only two characters that are interestingly written are Samuel l jackson's and John C.

And that was essentially all that this movie turned out to be, sad to say.So this movie is supposed to be a prequel to the older ""King Kong"" movies, and the audience is supposed to believe that the secrets of Skull Island and the secrets of the existence of the mighty Kong managed to be a secret and kept quiet by all those who managed to escape from the Island alive? Sure, why not... Plausible? No, hardly so. But let's roll with it, for the sake of the entertainment purposes.So the story, in all its simplicity, is about a group of scientists, funded by the American government, and assisted by the US armed forces, venture to a mysterious Island shrouded in a perpetual mist, where they are to look into what mysteries the Island hold. And they find a place where nature is merciless and evolved beyond the rest of the world.I found the story to be way too simplistic and far fetched to be a worthy addition to the ""King Kong"" legacy. Sure, this was a visually stimulating movie, but it just didn't make sense. None of it did! So a small group of secluded islands harbor growth of natural predators to monstrous sizes of gargantuan proportions. Makes any sense? No, hardly so. Especially since you get to see like only a single gargantuan spider, one ape (not counting the skeletal remains in the graveyard) and some oddly-shaped reptilian beings. The ecosystem just doesn't make sense. How would there be enough food for such creatures? Would they feast upon one another, yes? But why isn't there more of them then?The characters in the movie were two-dimensional and lacking anything that even remotely would be anything like character depth and growth. It was like watching clones and drones milling about. Especially characters like Hank Marlow (played by John C. Reilly). He had been there since World War II, yet managed to elude learning to speak the native language of those tribesmen on the Island, yet he lived among them? Sure, that was just believable. And also the painfully generic and stereotypical Preston Packard character (played by Samuel L. Jackson). Wow, just wow! That character was the epitome of how you make a character as generic and pointless as you possibly can.The visual effects were off the charts, though. ""Kong: Skull Island"", as I mentioned earlier, is an effects movie. And I do applaud the special effects team, because they really mustered up here and came together with something very pleasing to the eye. It all looked very real and had so many nice touches in the details.""Kong: Skull Island"" was not an overly impressive movie, not in the slightest. It is the type of movie that you watch, then check it off your watch-list, and you quickly forget about it, just as you did with Peter Jacksons take on the original ""King Kong"" movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

The 2017 Action/Adventure film was a letdown to Kong enthusiasts who have followed his legacy since his first appearance in media in 1933. As I got ready to come see this movie, I looked into the Director, Jordan Vogt-Roberts, who won the Narrative Feature Audience Award. That got my hopes up along with waiting so anxiously to see the next side of Kong. With opening weekend sold 61,015,000 tickets I couldn't wait any longer. I could have waited longer; with good intentions of a back story to Kong's legacy the plot was quick to get to the guns firing and vicious action. I found it very hard to relate to any of the characters throughout its entirety. If you looked closer to the details the movie holds handfuls of factual errors. From the uniforms the soldiers were wearing in the movie. In the 1970's the breast pockets were not sloped. Or when Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) refers to James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) as ""Captain"" however his collar was bronze and had the oak leaf symbol which was instead rank of Major in the Army. The helicopters in flight during the movie were CH53E Super Stallions didn't begins flight till 1974 and didn't fly in fleet until 1981. These are some, but not all of the little differences that occurred that distract from the movie itself if the audience catches on to the guns in different positions during every cut back to each person. In the words of Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly) ""But you don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs, unless you're picking a fight."" Which pretty much grasps this movie as a whole. It was too quick to violence and gun fair there was no inclination of characters moral development as the movie progresses to exploring the uncharted island. There was no change in character development in any advance to keep the audience engaged in more than the dropping of overly exaggerated destructive bombs. This movie was the movie to see if one was looking for what to do in a sandbox near you.","3 out of 7 found this helpful."

There are elements in this movie that are universal to all King Kong movies, but it still manages to stand on its own in this very diverse (at least quality-wise) franchise.Directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, Kong: Skull Island stars Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson. In supporting roles we see Samuel L. Jackson, John C. Riley, John Goodman, as well as many, many others.In this re-telling of the King Kong story, the expedition to Skull Island is led by a government agent Bill Randa, played by John Goodman. The official objective is to prove the so-called Hollow Earth theory, but what Randa actually wants is to prove the existence of monsters that once ruled the Earth.Randa, together with seismologist Houston Brooks and biologist San Lin, recruits an expert tracker James Conrad, played by the de-Lokified Tom Hiddleston.Since this is a government operation, the team is escorted by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard, played by Sam Jackson who's giving a wonderfully over-the-top performance. Preston and his men are about to end their tour in Vietnam, but Preston is more than happy to go on one last mission, much to the rest of the soldiers' chagrin.The last to join this ragtag team of lovable misfits is Brie Larson's anti-war photographer Mason Weaver. Just like Randa, Weaver keeps her true intentions to herself, as she believes this expedition to be a covert military operation, one she is set on exposing.They arrive at Skull Island, marvelling at the untamed beauty of it, but when they drop the explosives to map out the island, the explosions attract King Kong himself. He kills most of the team, with survivors getting split in two groups, separated by square miles of hostile jungle, and now we have our movie.Kong: Skull Island takes place in 1973. The decision to make this movie a period piece had to with the film's place in the Monster Universe that Legendary Pictures set up with 2014's Godzilla. Studio decisions aside, this could have been a thematic decision as well.1973 is the end of an era; a time of great disillusionment in the US. The times are unstable; the general mood is one of war-weariness and disappointment, and our characters are supposed to reflect this collective state of mind.Sam Jackson's character is by far the best one to capture this disillusionment. Jackson describes him as Ahab, and the similarities are everything but subtle. He is the Ahab of this movie, but his quest for revenge against Kong is very-well motivated. He is a soldier who's about to go home for good. His war is over, and he plunges into this new mission head-first, desperate to give his life meaning again. It's his own selfish desires that get his men killed. So, here you have a good conflict, a good way to drive an already unstable character off the deep end. He sees Kong as the enemy and treats the expedition as a military operation.I wish the other members of this star-studded team were as fun to watch as Sam Jackson, which is a real bummer, considering the talent that has been jammed into this flick. The exception here is John C. Riley, who plays a soldier who's been stranded on Skull Island since WWII. He provides the comedy, and is an overall warm presence in this movie.Tom Hiddleston is insanely attractive as the leading man, and Brie Larson is very beautiful. Their characters have potential, him as the disillusioned former military, and her as the war-weary photo-journalist. I say potential, because initially, their characters were supposed to have more meat on them.For instance, Dan Gilroy, who was one of the screenwriters, wanted Larson's character to be more jaded so that her ""emotional awakening"" after meeting Kong would be a bigger deal. Instead, she starts off as a righteous anti-war journalist determined to expose the government, and she stays that way until the end. Her emotional connection to Kong doesn't change anything, it just makes her motivation stronger.What I'm trying to say is that there was potential here to go deeper, to have the characters undergo some fundamental changes, but even with the cast as talented as this one, Kong: Skull Island still ends up being a movie about pretty people running from scary monsters.Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's a monster flick - its first priority is to be entertaining. Okay, its first priority is to make money at the box office, which it did, so everyone's a winner.Watching Kong: Skull Island made me think about how little monster movies have changed since 1933 brought us the original King Kong. They have become increasingly more progressive (read: politically correct), and we can't even compare production values and visual effects (though, the '33 Kong still looks pretty dope), but even eighty years later, the core of these movies remains the same: here's a beautiful breeding pair; here are some scary monsters. Now watch them run around for a couple of hours. Why try to change something that works, right?Still, I wish Kong: Skull Island had been more than just an enjoyable treat. Like I said, the potential was there. Take San Lin, played by actress Jing Tian, for instance. Initially, she was going to have more screen-time and be a - how should I put it? - a real person. I don't know who's idea it was to cut her role down to just a couple of lines of dialogue, but it's this kind of decisions that make the difference between a great movie and a movie that's just entertaining.John Gatins, writer of the second draft of the script cited Apocalypse Now as a major inspiration for Kong: Skull Island, and it shows. This movie borrows heavily not just from Apocalypse Now but from other war movies, like Platoon, so much so that at times Kong: Skull Island looks more like a war movie than an adventure movie.But the main parallel you can draw between this monster movie and the war movies it was inspired by is the general idea of the heroes venturing into the unknown land to smite the enemy only to realize that the situation is far more complicated.Despite its many, many flaws, Kong: Skull Island is a very fun movie. It's a very kind-hearted movie with some very positive themes. There is an anti-war sentiment; but the movie also rests on a general idea that people are good. There is a nice scene at the indigenous people's village where Larson takes pictures of these people and bonds with them. It's supposed to be a growing moment for her character and maybe it's a little manipulative.

More specifically it's a movie about people stuck in an unexplored habitat where they face pre-historic monsters. It's not really a remake of King Kong, because it leaves out most (if not all) iconic moments from the previous versions, and it also tells a story completely of its own.The highlight of the movie is, beyond a doubt, the visuals. There are some glorious shots in this movie, and perhaps the best ones being those that are obviously influenced by previous media set in the Vietnam war era. The creature design is also really neat. King Kong is massive, and he's also definitely not an ape as we know them. They've taken more inspiration from the old doll (from the first movie), than the more natural looking Kong from Jackson's remake. And it works really well! There's other creatures as well, some of them quite neat and interesting. Some of them I would have loved to see more of, but the ""skullcrawlers"" (which are highlights as an important enemy) are disappointing design wise. They look like a generic baddie in a monster film.The plot itself is OK, but there's nothing really special or interesting about it. There are some great performances, but also some talent that is completely wasted in roles with hardly any airtime.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

However, despite the visual effects - I saw it in 3-D - I never really engaged with any of the characters, apart from the Richard Attenborough-style mad doctor.It is a familiar pattern of one action scene after another. Whilst this may enthrall young audiences, I actually found it quite boring and over-long.In all, it was King Kong - meets Jurassic Park - meets Hacksaw Ridge - meets Any Film With Peculiar Beasts.I scored it seven as I LOVE King Kong, and the concept of a primitive olde-worlde island covered in the skulls of prehistoric monsters appeals to me greatly. The primitive tribe is an excellent example of costume and makeup. The beautiful Japanese girl should have had more of a leading role than having to play support to the tired female-in-distress wearing the skimpiest clothing in the lookalike style of Laura Dern.It's a rehash of all the Kong films you ever saw. Storyline could have been better. Soundtrack is a 70's style 'Good Morning Veitnam'.","0 out of 7 found this helpful."

I went in excited to see what this fantastic cast could come up with. Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John Goodman, Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly. All incredible actors and yet all in some way underrated when it comes to their craft. So were they able to turn on the brilliance? Yes, indeed they were. The only one of the five who gave a weak effort in my opinion was John Goodman. His character seems like he's going to be the star early in the film, but then fades into oblivion as things go along. The rest all gave great performances but the best of the five for me was Reilly. He really turned the charm on and was given some great one-liners to work with. He was definitely my favourite part of the movie.As for the movie itself I was a little skeptical going in. I hadn't really enjoyed 2014's 'Godzilla' at all, and knowing this was a follow on in the same universe had me apprehensive. Luckily though, this was a far superior film in almost every way. The first (actually technically second) time you see Kong in the film is quite a mind-blowing moment. The share size they decided to make him is quite overwhelming and impressive. All the creatures in this movie though are made absolutely terrifically and look great. The action sequences (particularly the one near the end) are filmed exquisitely and are absorbing to watch.When the 'Godzilla vs. Kong' film is made they need to make sure they lean a lot heavier on Kong and less so on Godzilla. Kong is unquestionably a superior character and makes for far better films. He's relatable is why. People see themselves in him to an extent I believe. 'Kong: Skull Island' was a very good film that I would highly recommend.","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

Is it really that hard to keep things realistic while monsters run amuck?
As other reviews have mentioned, there are too many scenes and events that are just impossible to accept. Remember, the audience is already being asked to believe that a giant ape and other monsters exist on this island. Do they also need to buy that helicopters can fly in close formation through a hurricane? There are just too many dumb things that happen that didn't need to happen.
Not everything in this movie sucks. The monster fight scenes are fantastic. Kong, always a creative fighter, uses his brain and his brawn when he goes into battle. The sound design is also great. In fact, I love all of the creature designs. It's just too bad that a dumb story and poorly drawn characters surround these wonderful set pieces.
The Samuel Jackson character is by far the worst one in the movie. The cliched angry military leader who's willing to risk his men and his life for vengeance. Seriously, all the military choices in this movie are horrible and make them seem totally incompetent.
I gave the movie a 6/10 because of the monster fight scenes.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

However, was so disappointed.

It came out during the Golden years of Hollywood Horror, with such films as Frankenstein (1931), Dracula (1931), Dr. Jekly & Mr. Hyde (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), etc. To this date those classics (mostly from Universal) remain the best of breed. Attempts to re-make the classic Kong in 1976 (Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange) and 2005 Jack Black, Naomi Watts) both failed. In the original, the cast (Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong), the director (Merian Cooper), producer (David O Selznick) and the animation (Willis O'Brian) are all first rate. (FWIW – Willis was the mentor to Ray Harryhausen who is perhaps even better known for his work on stop-action animation) Kong has been in several other films, mostly Japanese including King Kong vs Godzilla (1962) and King Kong Escapes (1967). There was even a ""Son of Kong"" released just a few months after the original, re- starring Robert Armstrong but absent Fay Wray. The current film has a large cast (Samuel Jacklson, John Goodman, John C Riley, Tom Hiddleston).Uniformly they do a good job, especially Riley and Jackson. The director is virtually unknown but the writer Dan Gilroy has done some good projects like Real Steel (2011), The Bourne Legacy (2012) and Nightcrawler (2014). Photography is excellent.This 2017 version is clearly superior to the other versions, except for the original. The anti-war ecology theme is a bit heavy handed, but the real problem is the ""monsters"" who are done very poorly, and even Kong gives us very little more than the 1933 version did. In fact, I'm going to say, even less. Also, we're missing the romance.","4 out of 11 found this helpful."

The reason he stood out to me was how dedicated he was to his mission; he didn't want to reason with anybody because of the fact that Kong had killed many of his men.The story line was amazing and very well put together, in the movie they showed many ""easter eggs"" relating to other monsters in other movies.

"5","/10","A mediocre cover version of other films","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3678948/?ref_=tt_urv","The_Film_Anorak","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur9716432/?ref_=tt_urv","6 April 2017","Kong: Skull Island is an updated version of the King Kong story, set in the 70s as the Vietnam War is coming to a close. It makes no reference to any other Kong incidents or story lines, with no continuity from the original King Kong or either of the remakes. The premise is that advances in satellite photography have revealed something interesting on a previously uncharted island in the Pacific, and a scientific expedition with military support sets off to discover its secrets. The era and location in which the film is set draw inspiration from Vietnam films, especially Apocalypse now, alongside Western and Asian monster movies. These inspirations and the look and sound of the film suggest it wants to evoke the atmosphere and mood of the 70s, and of the power of the modern world facing up to the awesome power of the natural world. None of these promises are delivered in the finished film, which only manages to be an average-quality blockbuster with impressive effects and nothing else to commend it.Part of the problem is that every theme and visual image has been done before, fairly extensively, as has every character and plot trope. This is at minimum the tenth Kong-related film unleashed on the public, along with countless pop-culture references to giant apes swiping at aircraft. Effects movies featuring giant creatures are standard fare for modern audiences, from Jurassic Park onward - and various plot lines from the Jurassic Park sequels show up here. That's not necessarily a problem, as most films these days do their fair share of recycling, but to stand out from the rest a film with such familiar content needs some sort of new element or fresh perspective. Kong: Skull Island simply doesn't have that.The mediocre end result is all the more noticeable because it makes reference to a number of ideas that could have been interesting if they'd been explored more fully or given any kind of new twist. There are two different groups of scientists with different reasons for being there, and a sceptical government not sure of the value of being there. The military contingent on the expedition has different motivations and responds differently to events on the Island. There are references to the Cold War and Vietnam, and a couple of points about human impact on the environment and the need to look harder at what is the real danger they are facing. But none of it goes any further than a couple of quick references to establish the plot, in the same way that it gives you short bursts of various songs of the era before cutting them off.The film also fails to do anything with its characters and the potential for conflict or drama between tired veterans of the Vietnam War, an anti- war photographer who might be seen as unpopular with the soldiers, and scientists with various agendas. Tom Hiddleston's character is a great example of how the cast is pretty much left hanging once they've been introduced. He is used pretty much as the theme park guide to shepherd the characters from Act 1 through to Act 3, and otherwise has nothing to do except look buff and stern while all hell breaks loose. It couldn't be more obvious that it's all an excuse for various large computer-generated images to bash seven shades out of other computer-generated images. The rest is just window dressing, an attempt to resonate with other, better films which makes it suffer by comparison. That makes the film a perfectly acceptable way to spend two hours, but no more than that. It will be forgotten long before the films it imitates because it doesn't give you anything or anyone to care about.There are good things in the film, to be fair. The various action scenes are well-staged, with some lively creature battles and shocks and thrills. The third act is genuinely gripping, and Kong himself is very well- realised. The director makes good use of the locations and produces some striking visuals, albeit mostly referencing other films. Although they are mostly poorly-served by the finished script (Samuel L Jackson and John Goodman have particularly thankless tasks), the actors are all very watchable and make the most of any opportunity they get to shine. Brie Larson does a good job, and it can at least be said that the female characters are no more lacking in depth than their male counterparts. (The film does however conspicuously fail the Bechdel test). Perhaps the best thing in the film is John C. Reilly, who has the job of Basil Exposition filling in the gaps in the story while also providing a quirky charm and emotional core to the film. For all the film's weaknesses, it's reasonably entertaining overall and chugs along at a decent pace; it's certainly not a *bad* film, in the way that Batman vs Superman or the sequels to Transformers were bad. None of which gets past the fact this has all been done before, and better.With the people involved, behind and in front of the camera, it had the potential to be a lot better than this. In the end the studio seems to have made sure no real individuality or originality was allowed to get in the way of their desire to sell popcorn and put some hollow spectacle on screen for a few weeks. They apparently hope to use this as a launch pad for more creature movies; they are presumably counting on box office returns rather than any real audience enthusiasm to support their plan.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

The movie takes place in the early 70′s and the entire movie has that vibe. As the movie starts the soundtrack of classic 70′s rock lit up the theater and really blended well with the whole island vibe. This is a great movie that seemed more concerned with a good story than focusing on the big monkey himself and that is a good thing.A crew of military and scientific people head to an island never before seen until recent satellite images discover it for the first time. From the beginning the crew realizes the man heading the expedition, John Goodman, knows more than he is letting on. Everyone still goes along with it all for their own reasons that are fleshed out as the movie progresses. Samuel Jackson plays a army general not quite done with the battlefield. Tom Hiddleston is a tracker who is searching for something more. Brie Larson is a photographer looking to snap the next big thing. If this sounds like a Marvel reunion then this is the movie for you. Everyone plays their part in this film and while there are plenty of different characters they are all fleshed out just enough to make you want to know more. As with giant cast movies the filmmakers could have dropped the ball like a certain Star Wars movie but that didn't happen here. All the characters have their own quirks especially the incredible John C Reilly. Kong himself is a technical marvel. At this point in the game CGI really is make or brake and him along with all the other creatures on the island are beautifully rendered. The island itself is also stunning. The whole filming process really had me ooing and awing at everything. This was a very colorful movie fill with very vibrant scenes. Along with that it was really well shot with a lot of thought put into making the movie feel like an art piece. It is hard to describe exact shots but it's the sort of thing that you will know when you see the film.As I stated earlier, the soundtrack really added to the movie. There were many songs that were perfect for the film along with a really great score. This was a really great telling of Kong and a perfect entry into the monster franchise that started with Godzilla. Speaking of which, there is an after credits scene that fleshes more of that world out so I would recommend staying until the final credits roll.Overall this was a fantastic movie. Perfect for the whole family. Perfect for fans of Steve Brule. This is a great movie to go to after having a personal pan pizza that you might have waited too long in line for. It is also is the type of movie for a fan of big screen monsters but also cinephiles who love a little art in their movies. Go feast your eyes on this flick.","9 out of 18 found this helpful."

Transplanting Kong into the sun-drenched Vietnam War era is the first step towards lightening the mood, with a cracking 70s soundtrack, playful Apocalypse Now references and vibrant cinematography all amplifying the fun factor. But lets face it, this more action-adventure-ish take on Kong is all about its set pieces. Luckily, they range from very good to downright amazing, with top-notch CGI throughout. The final showdown between skyscraper-sized ancient beasts is a suitably epic climax, although the standout is an explosive and exhilarating introduction (excluding a sneak peek in the pre-credits scene) to the eponymous gorilla. The sheer scale of Kong is showcased in glorious moments throughout this sequence, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts combining slow motion, a rumbling sound design and tricky one-shot takes to immerse and elate. Action aside, there's a nice streak of casual humour to offset the death and destruction, and the noteworthy cast—Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Toby Kebbell, John C. Reilly—ham it up in the best way possible. To the movie's detriment, however, is a script that is fundamentally lazy, only providing enough background info on characters so we ostensibly care whether they live or die, yet without following through on majority of subplots. This lack of depth results in some of the 'emotional' moments either falling awkwardly flat or providing unintentional comic relief. Not as narratively rich as previous King Kong films, but certainly more exciting and visually pleasing, Kong: Skull Island is an exuberant and action-packed blockbuster that rightfully doesn't take itself too seriously.","9 out of 18 found this helpful."

But as time passed, and with each new trailer they rolled out, I became more and more apprehensive. I was worried they were going to butcher the mythos into some third-rate Marvel wannabe or something. Thankfully, I was wrong; Kong: Skull Island is a great time at the movies!It's kind of what I remember blockbusters were, when I was a kid. Adventure, fantasy, monsters, without trying to be overly pretentious... and lots and lots of popcorn- munching action. Man, this movie has a lot of it, so buckle up! If you were disappointed with the lack of monster-stomping madness in 2014's Godzilla, Kong: Skull Island has you covered.The characters, the dialogue, etc. it's all (mostly) good, and the movie didn't let me down on that front, as I'd feared. But let's not kid ourselves, this is a monster movie, and that means it really all hinges on one thing...I'm pleased to say that this is probably my favourite iteration of Kong since the 1933 original. As you probably know, he's an absolute behemoth. Way bigger than we've known him in the past. But, thankfully, Kong is far and away the most well developed character. He's a protector, a peaceseeker, and the keeper of balance in Skull Island's chaotic ecosystem. But when forced to protect his island, he's absolutely brutal. He's a total barroom brawler. We've never seen a Kong like this before, and I loved every second of it! I'll tell you, Godzilla definitely has his work cut out for him in 2020!So, go see Kong: Skull Island, order a jumbo popcorn, don't overthink it, just get lost in the world and you'll have a hell of a time!","8 out of 16 found this helpful."

He is King Kong! This giant ape is to Hollywood what Godzilla is to Japan, having undergone multiple remakes ever since the classic movie from 1933. From the cheesy but fun 1976 version to the fairy tale-like period piece by Peter Jackson of LORD OF THE RINGS fame, to being borrowed by Japan for a couple of movies and facing off against Godzilla himself. Not to mention the deluge of imitators cashing in on the giant ape Monster concept.Unlike previous attempts by Hollywood, KONG: SKULL ISLAND is not a remake of the classic tragedy. The original movie and its remakes were centred around a tragic ""damsel and Monster"" pseudo romance: people go to a mysterious island, Kong saves damsel in distress, falls for her, gets brought back to America, runs amok, captures damsel, gets killed by aeroplanes. This 2017 movie eschews that tired storyline for an original one set during the closing chapters of the Vietnam war.Out to prove the existence of ancient mega-sized monsters, Bill Randa and Houston Brooks of the MONARCH organisation tag along with an expedition to a recently discovered island shrouded in storm clouds. With them are photojournalist Mason Weaver, biologist San Li, survivalist Conrad as their guide, Scientists from LANDSAT on a geological survey and a team of soldiers as escort. I loved the pacing of the set up and the plot evokes a sense of nostalgia. It is an exploration into the unknown, a little like Jurassic park with a team of unlikely heroes sent to a mysterious island, tragedy happens and they pull together to survive. The strange colossal creatures are revealed and portrayed in a way similar to the appearance of the first dinosaur in the classic Steven Spielberg movie, with that sense of awe and majesty.Unlike Jurassic Park however, Kong is not a peaceful herbivore but a fierce protector guarding a dark secret beneath the island. The awe turns to horror as The humans' actions have awoken an ancient menace, angering Kong who decimates the helicopters and scatters the group. Conrad leads half of the group toward an evacuation site while Colonel Packard gathers what remains of men to strike back at Kong for killing his comrades. But the island holds many fearsome secrets and their only hope for defeating a blood thirsty race of predators is Kong.Right from the get go, the all star cast nails it! Spot on delivery and portrayal of every character, their motivations and quirks completely fleshed out. They are not particularly complex, many of the soldiers fall into the ""typical squad"" mold that we have seen in many other movies featuring squads of soldiers, but the main characters are great. Tom Hiddleston's Conrad oozes badass charm and undergoes an arc that brings him from aloof loner out for himself to someone who puts the date of his teammates before himself. Samuel L Jackson's Packard is my favourite character. His quest for revenge against Kong and his slow descent into madness feels like something out of Apocalypse Now. It is a natural progression of his arc and the best part is that it does not feel contrived. His reasons are noble, having failed his men before and not wanting to fail them again. His relationship wit Kong becomes a sort of Ahab/Moby Dick dynamic which leads to a powerful pro-environmental message about humanity's tendency to destroy what they do not understand or cannot control.The main attraction however are the giant monsters rendered in CGI using motion capture. The effects are magnificent, rendered primarily by Industrial Lights and Magic (ILM) the studio behind the effects of Transformers and Star Wars. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts brings clear camera-work with wide angles and sweeping shots allowing the action to be beheld in full. The cinematography by Larry Fong is astounding in itself, imbuing Skull Island with a rich atmosphere of unrestrained beauty. The shot near the opening of Kong rising against a setting sun is just one example of the many breathtaking sequences. My only gripe was how Kong's fur was rendered. There seems to be an unexplainable stiffness to the fur which at times looks less natural than 2005's rendition by Weta Digital.By all counts, KONG: SKULL ISLAND is a rip roaring adventure with a sense of nostalgia accompanied by magnificent visuals, and clear action scenes pushing the boundaries of the giant Monster movie genre. It gives equal focus to both human characters and its titular titan, never getting bogged down in either element. The icing on the cake? KONG: SKULL ISLAND sets up a shared Monster universe, a ""Monsterverse"", and a sequel where the King will face off against a God.","5 out of 9 found this helpful."

I went in wanting to see some awesome monster fights, good set-up for 2020's Godzilla vs. King Kong, some great visual effects, and just a fun time at the movies. And I got all of that. For people concerned about Kong in this movie... don't be. I was upset with how much screen time Godzilla got in his own movie, but Kong gets the right amount of time here. He's on just enough to satisfy fans, but is off screen enough to let other elements of the film shine. When Kong fights in this movie, it is absolutely incredible. I don't think there's anything in here that is as iconic as Kong versus the T-Rexes in King Kong, but the fights with the Skull Crawlers and the other creatures were amazing to watch. It was so fun and exhilarating. The visuals in this movie are also stunning.

They assemble a crack team of experts, including Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), and head off, but what they don't expect to encounter is an undiscovered tribe of natives, and an island inhabited by monsters, most notably, the massive, mighty Kong. Things get heated when men are killed and Colonel Packard turns hostile.It's pretty safe to say that Kong is one of the most enduring franchises in film history. Since his first outing in the early thirties, he has been re-adapted for the screen several times, with varying degrees of success, but it's probably retained a lot of its appeal by sticking to a period time frame, at least in the 2005 version I saw, while I'm not really sure about the lambasted 1976 version that I didn't. By never branching out into present day and keeping a nostalgic sense of times gone by to give it a distinctive touch. And so this new addition has rolled by, but in spite of some awesome special effects, it's a totally underwhelming spectacle compared to the ones that have gone before.Another device the previous instalments of Kong employed was to build up a great sense of mystery and awe before the great beast unveiled himself on the screen, creating a sense of foreboding and tension before he is seen, yet in Jordan Vogt-Roberts's flat imagining, he appears almost immediately upon arrival at Skull Island and it just gets more derivative from there. Not that you'll care about the fate of anyone, as an all star cast manage to portray a selection of the most bland, stalemate characters you could ever imagine, compered with an implausible non-entity of a plot.The effects are as awesome as ever, but this just doesn't have anything else going for it to justify such a lengthy running time. **","3 out of 8 found this helpful."

Exploring the unknown? There's more to see. Remember the 1933 movie ""King Kong""? Well, this is like happened before the blonde beauty, before he was removed from his home. ""KONG: SKULL ISLAND"", is the origin of the majestic ape that ruled the island. We do know that Kong is the last of his kind. His family was wiped out by some reptilian creatures that terrorized the island. When two groups of people come to the island: an expedition group, and a military escort led by Lt. Colonel Packard(Samuel L. Jackson). His team laid out bombs on the island that awoke the protector, Kong. He attacks the team and scatters the expedition team. In 1944, an airplane pilot name Hank Marlow(John C. Reilly) encountered Kong along with his Japanese adversary. When they became friends, his friend Ikari was killed by the Skullcrawlers, and he has his sword to remember him with. When the bombs awoke the Skullcrawlers, it was up to Kong to stop them. Knowing that the colonel is a vindictive madman, they would rather help Kong instead. And the legend of Kong is known. Samuel L. Jackson recalls the ""Hold on to your butts"" catchphrase made famous in ""Jurassic Park"". Too bad he had to stoop so low to destroy a legend. I remember watching the 2005 version of the 1933 remake. The fight scenes are remarkable. I liked it when Kong ripped out the viscera of the Skullcrawler. No wonder Kong was such a legend.

Helis approaching within arm's reach of Kong - dumb. No reason for the gunfire initially, but makes good action film. Why do fairly large caliber weapons used throughout have surprisingly little effect? 5. Where did the natives get the machinery to make their finely woven, consistently dyed cloth? And their steel bladed weapons? 6. Military portrayal was way over the top not real, especially the belligerent Colonel. Came across as more humorous than villainous. Very fakey insubordination scenes. 7. Why do male leads in action movies almost always have the tight, ultra-short sleeve t-shirt muscle look - feelings of compensatory inadequacy, narcissism? Obvious they are about as athletic as a wet noodle, anyway. 8. OK, Kong's parents dead, but where are the thousands more needed to genetically maintain this kind?

This is exactly what it was but somehow managed to be subversive enough in its presentation that I had a lot of fun watching it.This is supposed to take place in the same universe as the Godzilla film of 2014. That is why King Kong is the size of a 30 story building, in hopes that he can throw down with Godzilla in a crossover film. Unlike Godzilla however, this film didn't shy away with showing as much Kong as possible and it was glorious. The scenes where Kong smashes helicopters and fights monsters had that perfect blend of over-the- top action and just being visceral. And the violence in this film had a degree of macabre, so there were moments I was like gasping and chuckling saying ""Oh my god!"". So many characters get picked off at unexpected moments that it kept the film really suspenseful.Now this film follows a trend where this is the sophomore film of a director who's debut was a low budget indie film. I think studios do this so that the director is easy to push around and you can cheap out on his share of the budget. And I think the director knew this so he decided to mess around with the audience. There is so much weird dialogue about nothing and I swear the median shot length of the first act was around 1 second because it kept quick cutting. And rather than being annoyed with it, I embraced it and only make me like it more as I placed myself in the directors shoes.The plot was also weird to say the least especially the setting. Why they wanted the film to be set during the Vietnam War confuses me still. Is it because they wanted to represent a demoralized military force being defeated again by a primitive enemy? Or to push Samuel L Jackson's character as really jaded as he is a Colonel in the US Army. Either way it really worked, because what we ended up getting was a mix of Apocalypse Now, an adventure film, a monster film, a b- movie and Moby Dick.The characters in this film were a mixed bag. Loki and much of the cast were uninteresting and one dimensional. I don't recall Loki ever going through a character arc and all the blonde girl was characterized as an anti-war shutterbug. The two most interesting characters were played by John C Reilly and Samuel L Jackson. Reilly plays a WW2 pilot who crash landed on the island and had survived off the natives. He was so eccentric and funny and I loved him. Samuel L Jackson though stole the show. As mentioned he plays a very Jaded US Army Colonel who basically becomes the Captain Ahab of the film. I love it when he plays these intense unhinged characters and was so glad he could fit this into his filming schedule. Please keep making movies Sam, I beg you!So yea, I highly recommend this. Its a very entertaining film that doesn't take itself too seriously unlike Godzilla 2014 did. It has a lot of the generic big budget action tropes but it also manages to mess with your expectations.","4 out of 7 found this helpful."

Brie Larson was sexy but didn't provide much to her character either. Even John Goodman was almost invisible. The direction was original, tho I could have done without the slow motion bits.

Actually I was just waiting to see pretentious effect rumble movie. I was glad to see I was wrong. Of course the biggest thing in this movie are great CGI-effects, but surprisingly there is something more too. There is some great ragging to Americans about Vietnam war and also a reminding that sometimes it is better to let earths nature to alone or we might face even bigger problems in future. Quite clear parable to climate change and present human kind. Even movie has these ""deeper meanings"" it is fundamentally funny and stupid effect rumble movie. Of course there is also that Beauty and the Beast aspect, like in every Kong movie.The storytelling and movie action are thrilling and great to watch. Some great evergreen songs slates movie action and cgi-effects greatly and quite enjoyable way. At the beginning of the movie it is very clearly who are the bad guys of yhe story and earn to get killed by Kong. Actually Kong is the stories Biggest lonely hero (in all way), who keeps safe the rest of Island inhabitants.Although the story is quite stupid and brainless effect rumble, it has it's good moments too. Crazy scenes is easy to laugh and in many way they are the best part of the movie. CGI-effects are great and in their silliness surprisingly believable. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has created very enjoyable neoromanticism Kong-story in quite old fashion way. The biggest lesson of the movie is that the human is the biggest monster of the nature and they should learn their lesson, before we have to face even bigger catastrophe.

My movie theatre-working friend had not yet watched it either so this turned out to be the first time for both of us. In summary: This was quite a different take on Kong and his living quarters on Skull Island with many human characters that we get very much involved in caring about and thrilling in how they resolve to take care of things. And, yes, the fights Kong gets involved in are very exciting to watch. I should note that we watched this in regular screen, not IMAX or 3-D though if we had, it might have been even more thrilling! I really don't want to reveal anymore so I'll just say that me and my friend definitely recommend Kong: Skull Island.","5 out of 10 found this helpful."

That is if they're even real reviews.As an example, you have someone below that writes: I'm not one to stop a film half way through, I like to see things to the end but this is one of the rare times I actually had to put myself out of misery and press the stop button. -Wait a minute there darlin. By pressing the stop button and stopping it half way through, you mean you watched it on a television or computer (or you're just lying).They go on to say: Now I didn't get a chance to see this film at the cinema, which I'm now very grateful for. -How does one get home viewing before it is on the market besides downloading it illegally? And if you did, you then come and complain about it even though by your own admission you didn't see all of it?They continue: After seeing the trailer for this film, I clicked on this title optimistically. I then saw Samuel. L Jackson was part of the cast and then my doubt began. -Basically you're saying you saw him in the trailer, but didn't connect the dots, an then you go on to base your review on one actor?It goes on: For me, any film which includes animals has to do their research and this was another reason as to why I switched off.

Usually movies of this genre have the same basic set up: an overly long introduction, a dull process of discovering the ""monster"", different sequences of the monster wrecking havoc, and then dragging out the film until all problems are solved.The great thing about Skull Island: it does none of those things. The movie starts, throws you through brutal and unexpected death and destruction - and then keeps going. There were multiple moments where I was legitimately shocked how unforgiving this movie was. The best part? It quickly wraps up while you are still completely enthralled in Skull Island. What Kong lacks in story and character development, it makes up with some of the best action sequences I've ever seen in theaters.

Nothing but trite clichés and utter stupidities. What is lost in the equation is the capacity for narrative film to be idiosyncratic and critical. One might object that a rendition of King Kong on a Skull Island was never intended to provoke thought or be relevant to our social or political lives, to which I say ""exactly!"" This piece of garbage is a grotesque exercise in market speculation, one that vampirically draws upon the talents of very capable technicians, actors, designers, etc. by virtue of its bloated budget alone. The two-fold effect of the film is first the empty distraction it provides to all concerned, and second, as previously mentioned, the all-important revenue generated.

This is the best King Kong film out there in my opinion.The ensemble cast was great with Samuel L Jackson (The Hateful Eight) Tom Hiddleston (Thor:Ragnarok)
Brie Larson (Captain Marvel)
John.C.Reilly (Step Brothers)
John Goodman (Arachnophobia) & some other's but these are the main stars & i liked Tom Huddleston playing a posh British mercenary as I've only seen him as the dark gothic evil brother of Thor in the Marvel Connected Universe films but he's good here as a smart & tough guide through the dangerous Skull Island.
Samuel L Jackson is great & intense with a serious strong performance as a troubled Captain fresh from Vietnam as this is set in 1973 just after the Americans pulled out.
I like the period setting of the 70's & it looks fantastic with excellent production design & greats visuals & fantastic cinematography as well as outstanding special fx!!!
Kong looks Amazing.This is definitely an old fashioned Jungle Adventure film with a group of explorer's & rescuers heading into the strange unknown world of Skull Island that's full of massive creatures that have been hidden from the world.
My favourite of the cast was the hilarious & touching performance from John.C.Reilly who plays a survivor from WW2 who crashed on the island & has been the ever since, he's great fun.
All in all this is great entertainment & full of Awesome monsters & battles & Soldiers fighting creatures & bits of homage to Apocalypse Now & old Explorer Adventure monster movies of the past. Great Fun.
If you like Monster Movies or Creature Features like The Meg, Congo, Jurassic Park films, Godzilla & all those types of fun films then you will definitely enjoy this film, it's the best KING KONG film ever made in my opinion.","3 out of 5 found this helpful."

It's also the second film in Legendary's new monster universe franchise, called MonsterVerse, following 2014's 'GODZILLA' and leading up to a planned crossover film (in 2020) titled 'GODZILLA VS. KONG'. The story deals with a couple of government agents, and their military escorts, investigating an uncharted island, in the Pacific Ocean, where they're attacked by a giant monster known as Kong. The movie was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts (who also helmed the 2013 indie coming-of-age flick 'THE KINGS OF SUMMER') and it was written by Dan Gilroy and Max Borenstein. The film stars Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Thomas Mann, Shea Whigham, Tobby Kebbell, John Ortiz, Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell. It's been a huge hit at the Box Office, and it's also gotten mostly positive reviews from critics. I really enjoyed it as well.A government agent, named Bill Randa (Goodman), and a seismologist, named Houston Brooks (Hawkins), lead an expedition to map out an uncharted island, in the Pacific Ocean, known as 'Skull Island'. They hire the Sky Devils Helicopter squadron, lead by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Jackson), and a former British Special Air Service Captain, named James Conrad (Hiddleston), to escort them. A photojournalist, named Mason Weaver (Larson), who thinks the expedition has sinister motives, also joins the team. Once they reach the island, the group realizes there's a very large creature there, known as Kong, that is unhappy with their presence.The movie is action-packed, and a lot of fun. I love monster flicks, and this is definitely a really well made one. It's not as epic as Peter Jackson's 2005 remake, or the 1933 original, but it's still a more than decent installment in the long running series. It's also definitely a lot better than the 2014 'GODZILLA' reboot. I look forward to the upcoming crossover flick (with both classic movie monsters in it), and more entries in the new MonsterVerse franchise!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b6j-_hcq7Wo","4 out of 8 found this helpful."

Look at this rip off of ripoffs ; nothing of the former noted. Hollywood has become a special effects machine, mostly filled with a lot of violence (but no boobies because that supposedly by these producers could be offensive (?!!!) ) Violence, action, no story, no acting needed anymore these last ten years or so. this garbage is a perfect example how hollywood nowadays denies their roots, and just complies by what they think is what moviegoers nowadays want to see. I will not go into all the stupid inaddequasies in the movie, as many, thank Kong !, already did before me, we, movielovers are surely not taken seriously sad sad sad, the cinema screen now belongs to violent, and/or bloody action movies, not to watch a well written, well acted, well produced story, alas ; but we still have Europeen Cinema !","3 out of 10 found this helpful."

A feeling, sadly, that quickly faded and left me with a bad taste in my mouth upon actually viewing the film. A three hour movie about a giant ape and more than an hour and a half in you still haven't seen said ape?! Grrr. So, it was with muted expectations, fingers crossed, hoping for the best and fearing the worse I ventured to check out Jordan Vogt-Roberts latest installment of Kong.Boy am I glad I did. Everything I hated about the last Kong movie starting with being halfway through the film and still not having a Kong sighting has been addressed and how. Vogt-Roberts and company waste no time setting up and getting to the crux of the story. Namely, Kong. After all, that's what made me want to see the movie.And Kong: Skull Island is quite the movie. Part Apocalypse Now, part Heart of Darkness with a dash of Moby Dick beautifully blended with an A rate movie version of the classic B rated monster movie, Kong thrills, entertains, wows, and triumphs.The star studded cast lead by the incomparable Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, and John C. Reilly, Brie Larson, and Tom Hiddleston ground this well written fantasy in reality and keep it riveting. While set in the past, this Kong is fresh and current. The characters are more than mere backdrops for the beast and are nuanced and three dimensional.The directing and cinematography is beautiful. The music on point and serves the story well. The action and CGI work is stellar. CGI Kong is such a far cry from the slow, lumbering Kong of the past. The subtle expressions and emotions are and additional layer of delight.Have a couple of hours? Take a trip to Skull Island, you won't be disappointed. I'm giving Kong a solid 9 so don't miss it on the big screen. Also, make sure you stay through the credits. Yes, after the complete credit roll things go to black for a few seconds, then more is revealed.","4 out of 8 found this helpful."

They soon encounter a 100 ft gorilla that smashes the helicopters and so we embark on a non-stop adventure encountering all sorts of giant animals all ready to eat our heroes. There is also a giant dinosaur type predator that seems to be the arch enemy of Kong so look forward to plenty of animal antics there. As usual in a Kong film the gorilla gets smitten by the leading lady which is quite remarkable as non of the humans seems to show any interest in the very beautiful Brie Larson. Personally I find her smile devastating. The special effects are terrific and the whole movie zips along at a frantic pace and I loved it, in fact, sorry when it ended. I dislike night scenes in movies and I was very glad that this mostly takes place in daylight which is also a big bonus.

The ultimate portrayal though was in Peter Jackson's 2005 depiction of the monstrous primate. Naomi Watts was outstanding in her portrayal of the blond heroine who ""liked"" Kong and saw in him what nobody else could, that there was more to him than just a raging beast. He had a heart underneath and simply wanted to have the one he liked and who gave him enjoyment to be around.I remember the 1976 version touched on Kong's sensitive and caring side when he placed Jessica Lange down as the planes were attacking him on top of The World Trade Centre and she screamed at him to pick her back up again to avoid the onslaught of fire power. I got teary eyed when I saw that scene at the theater as a kid, but after viewing it a couple of years ago on the movie channel with adult eyes, it's laughable now.The ultimate version though has to be Peter Jackson's 2005 depiction. The Kong I liked was perfectly captured in CGI and was so well done that you can actually feel the emotions for that primitive and misunderstood creature. His ordeal on top of the Empire State Building strongly showed how much he cared for his blonde human and she for him.Well, along comes this version and Kong this time is depicted as a raging and roaring ape on his home turf who seems dangerous and menacing at first, but is gradually looked upon as a savior of sorts. He's HUGE and appears to reach the upper heights of the atmosphere at times. He's also not one to mess around with when attacked by the bombs of military helicopters. This is also a pleasing version of him. He's seen as a dangerous threat at first to the Vietnam War crew from the 1970s who went there to discover an unknown realm of the world, but they grow to learn that he was just acting in self defense for their aggressive bombing of his island.The one who truly stands for me though is John C. Reilly as A World War II Vet who had been stranded on Skull island for 29 years and who wanted to one day see his pregnant wife again. He also knew the true facts about Kong and how he could be a savior to those on the island, such as that native tribe he became a strong part of.Anyway, this is indeed a pleasing movie though Samuel L. Jackson's part as an arrogant and ignorant Lieutenant Colonel bent on discovering the site of fallen comrades and ignoring all advice about the dangers of the island, gets tiring and annoying after awhile. Brutes like him have been portrayed much too often in war films.Kong does spend a lot of time though looking majestically huge and angrily roaring, but his depiction in this version does bring overtones of Peter Jackson's 2005 Kong, though in a less humanly way. Kong is always in a rage and looks vicious to boot, but it fits the atmosphere of the story. Skull Island is not the most pleasant place to be. It's definitely not a tropical paradise like Hawaii, but it does carry about it a mysterious and intriguing element that is always captivating. I mean, who doesn't like mysterious lands where creatures out of the ordinary roam?I do recommend this version of the gigantic ape though it's far from being the best version. Peter Jackson's 'King Kong"" is far the best out of them all, but don't hesitate to give this one a try. It's pleasing to watch and entertaining as well. It carries on the tradition of depicting Kong as not all bad, that there's more to him than just being a primitive and destructive ape. He has feelings too.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

My only complaint, and it's a big one, was the casting of Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson.Tom Hiddleston was just not right for this role. He wasn't convincing and I felt he struggled with his characters role. Now Samuel L. Jackson did NOT struggle with his role, but he over-played it. I mean to the point where he was annoying me. He was playing his ""mfk- ing snakes on a plane"" attitude and it was just waaay too much in this film. Had he toned it down a few (well, quite a few) notches, I could've put up with him. A far as I'm concerned, those two ruined this film for me.Now Brie Larson, John C.

My criticism of the special effects is that with the SFX technology available today they could have been much, much better.Also the stupid things that did, or didn't occur were laughable.For example: When the ship carrying everyone to Skull Island was seen on an overhead shot there were 3 helicopters on the deck but when the flight launched to penetrate the weather front surrounding the island there were about 2 dozen choppers.The ship could never have carried that many helicopters because it was simply too small to carry that many and even if there was room how could they have gotten the others on deck in order to launch them because there was no lift to bring the aircraft onto the deck? Another gaff was when a number of 'toxic' gas canisters exploded and the gas was spread over a wide area and enveloped those still alive. Only one put his gas mask on but all the others just carried on without the slightest problem, not even a small cough.It is such a pity that this movie was let down by such poor direction and continuity because it had the makings of a great remake.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

The directing-editing is solid, the cinematography above average, while the vfx is top-notch, though not so extreme as its ""counterpart"" from the Godzilla franchise, ""King of the monsters"".

Not a sincere moment in the whole thing. Just action and CGI cartoonery for the sake of it. Set in the 1970s but little effort is made to make it seem authentic to that era. Everything is too clean, too pretty, too modern. Textbook Hollywood polish. Seems like the only reason it's even set back then is to shoehorn in some anti-military angle that is out of tone with the rest of the story. None of the performances resonate. There's the occasional chuckle at some of the characters' lines but that's it. Once John C. Reilly shows up, it practically becomes a full-blown comedy.Lots of things don't make sense, like a giant squid in what appears to be a few feet of water. The special effects are so-so but nothing that reinvents the wheel. In some places they are outright bad. The designs for the skullcrawler creatures is very unimpressive. The movie advocates the Hollow Earth theory, which amused me to no end mainly because I know how that triggers some people. Another annoying thing is this gag that never works but is used more than once: a person suddenly discovers a part of their natural surroundings is actually a monster. ""Oh don't sit on that log"" and such. It's a pathetic attempt at some kind of jump scare and they use it a few times. Ugh. All that being said, it's entertaining for what it is: dumb action movie with giant creatures. Go into it with that expectation and you'll probably be fine with it. Expect anything remotely intelligent and you'll have a bad two hours.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."
"10","/10","AWESOME KONG REMAKE WITH BREATHTAKING ACTION AND VISUAL EFFECTS!!! WORTH WATCHING MOVIE WITH EPIC CINEMATOGRAPGHY!!! EVERY FRAME FEELS LIKE A PAINTING WORTH SITTING IN!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4565185/?ref_=tt_urv","span-82449","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur90270447/?ref_=tt_urv","6 January 2019","A lot of good filmakers have made a movie regarding Kong, but few of them have reached the height of the inense action and good visual effects that Jordan Vogt-Roberts created with ""Kong: Skull Island"". I rate it 8/10, for I liked it far more than I expected, but that doesn't mean it is perfect. At the end of the day, ""Kong: Skull Islnad"" can't decide what kind of movie it wants to be. The attention to detail in fight scenes, where every weapon, lightbulb, and slick patch of ground is accounted for, doesn't translate to an ending that seems powerful, but ultimately says little of substance.The two main advantages of this movie are the following: Fist of all, it does it's work and duty as a remake very well, for it is almost totally different than it's also awesome premake, ""King Kong"" by Peter Jackson. Both movies are awesome but in a different way and this makes more interesting watching the second one, for most possibly you have already seen the first one, since you are reading this review and you want to see more of Kong. So as Jackson focuses on the quote ""It wasn't the airplanes that got him, it was beauty killed the beast"", so emphasizes director Roberts on quotes such as ""We're all going to die together out here"". Also, it takes place during the Vietnam War in 1973, while ""King Kong"" in year 1933 and this change in the setting differs the whole atmosphere of the films. Secondly, as I mentioned before the action and the visuals are very good and about the visual effects oscar nomination, I have to say that it was whorth it.However, there are of course some disadvantages that I will mention quickly in bullett points: -Brie Larson's annoying preformance, which isn't a great deal, thanks to Tom Hiddleston's great acting skills.
-Very, very few obvious plot holes (actually I remember only one, so again there isn't any problem nor with that one).
-And of course the this one word ""Helicopters"", a scene that isn't realistic and from the one side makes the soldiers look foolish, only to show from the other side Kong's great power.To sum up it is a worth watching movie with epic cinematography. Every frame feels like a painting worth sitting in. Must see movie. However, be as always cautious, you should always remember not to have high expectations, in order not to ruin an okay-movie!

Shame about the movie.'Kong skull island' does seem to me at least to be better than the other two currently extant films in the monsterverse: the underdone 'Godzilla' and the overwrought 'Godzilla king of the monsters'.....how its monster conceivably fits with the same cinematic universe as the monsters depicted in those two films is a stark question that the next film in the sequence will be detailed to answer.As a sci-fi/fantasy adventure monster film this has enough cool set piece silly season monster violence to make a fine trailer but the paucity of supporting quality from any facet of the film leaves it threadbare at feature film length. Unless you are attached to a certain era of American Vietnam anti-war films beyond rational sane levels.Definitely don't take any human characters or behaviours or situations or interactions to heart.....which is a shame because that's exactly what those vaunted aforementioned American movies that this film intensively references were trying at.As a King Kong movie (which is probably an unfair, even invalid way of evaluating it in all honesty.) it is superficial and lacking in a full sense of humanity in the representation of Kong even when bringing into the equation the complete skeletal remains of both Kong's parents and a flashback (noble) death scenario.As the second part of the putative monsterverse it kinda opens questions that might give 2020's 'Godzilla vs Kong' a lot of problems......but if the film makers involved in charting this franchise have good answers to these questions.....it might make for a better film than this or either of the Godzilla prep fight films.Overall I rate this a watchable 4/10 and I would rather watch this than either of the Godzilla instalments because I think that this film at least develops a style in it's visual storytelling that gives it a more memorable distinctiveness. That's worth a star more in my ratings than either of Godzilla's efforts!","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

It's a great looking spectacle with fun action, and an all-around entertaining flick. There isn't much to it beyond that, but it's not trying to be anything more either. For what the film is it works fine, though could have been improved in some areas. I was cautiously optimistic about seeing this film as it's supposed to be in the same universe as Godzilla 2014, which was one of the biggest letdowns in recent memory, in my opinion. Also, I am not a big fan of Peter Jackson's King Kong. It's good, but not really my cup of tea. It was a great looking film with some good action, but it was far too long, and got really boring in places for me. Thankfully, this film definitely more entertaining than Godzilla or King Kong (2005), but does have some of the same issues as the former.The story is very simple. A new island is discovered via satellite and is dubbed Skull Island. A team is sent to the island to study the geography and wildlife. They then get attacked by King Kong, as well as other giant creatures that call the island home. Now our main characters must survive and find a way to get off the island.What this film definitely has going for it is the spectacle. The film looks great, from the cinematography to the score, to the special effects. Unlike Godzilla 2014, which only showed Godzilla full-on for maybe two scenes that only last a few seconds, this film shows us Kong in his full glory very early on and we do see quite a bit of him throughout the movie. Though, I wish we could've seen him more. Also unlike Godzilla 2014 where all the Godzilla action is in the background, when we see Kong in action it's in the forefront and it is very pleasing to watch. All of the action was well-done I thought. If you want to see giant monster action like I did you will get your money's worth. If nothing else, this is an entertaining movie.The movie has good pacing too. It wastes almost no time in getting to what the audience came to see the movie for.The characters aren't the strongest. This was one of the things that killed the Godzilla movie for me. Not only was there barely any Godzilla in favor of the humans, but the characters were some of the blandest I've ever seen. A block of wood is less bland than they were.I think the main issue in this film is that there are too many characters, and many of them get lost in the shuffle. Some characters you forget are even in the film like John Goodman's. Though, the cast here is better than Godzilla because of the actors. Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, John C. Reilly, and John Goodman all do a good job performance-wise, though the script lets them down a little. Samuel L. Jackson's character goes through an arc in this film that I did not entirely like and the film could've done without.The characters here are definitely more fun here than Godzilla, despite my issues with them. I was with them enough where I wasn't bored with the movie, which is something. The movie does attempt to be more fun, unlike Godzilla which was entirely joyless. However, while some of the jokes land others fall flat. Some of the humor comes off as quite awkward and conflicts with the tone of the film.Overall, Kong Skull Island was a fun experience. If you're looking for a fun monster movie you should have a good time. If you want anything more you might be disappointed. It has great monster action and is a beautiful looking film. The human characters aren't the most interesting, but are still pretty fun to watch. It certainly did not kill the movie for me like it did Godzilla.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

Although this movie has great visuals, well scenery and Kong looks visually stunning, it's story or most of its main characters just aren't interesting enough.Tom Hiddleston is a solid actor but he's dull as a leading action hero. Samuel L. Jackson plays his typical angry character and Brie Larson is okay. Though it's John C. Riley's character who steals the scenes abs comes out most memorable.Some decent action scenes and some nice looking kills from the monsters but not enough excitement or joy. We didn't care much for the lesser characters when they died. With a predictable outcome and a plot that doesn't quite reach its full potential, this movie isn't that great as it could have been.

The movie didn't really have an identity.

My family tried to decide which of our intrepid explorers would buy the farm first - we all guessed wrongly, which was the only surprise of the night.A film about giant herbivores and giant carnivores on an island - sound familiar? Yes, I thought it would. The corny dialogue will sound familiar too. If you're still wondering whether or not to see this film, just remember it's a couple of hours of your life you'll never get back and life is precious.

Skull Island really dives into it; after a teasing hook of an intro, we see Kong 20min in and then it's just one incredible action scene after another, spiced with amazing effects and stylish cinematography, paced well enough with some cliche but tolerable dramatics and narrative. The Samuel L Jackson vs Kong theme was a bit too forced for me but it kind of adds him as a villain in addition to Kong and the other awesome creatures in the movie.

But this was a pleasant surprise for its reasonably built characters, immersive environment and captivating monsters.It's genuinely nice to look at - with a visual aesthetic you wouldn't expect from a film like this. And many of the monster fights are visceral in a way most other CGI big creature features fall short - so you
do care for and believe in the giant protagonist.Of course the humans are the least interesting part, and there's too much of them. A particular side quest into a jungle tribe kingdom dragged on.

I won't go in to them all for your sake. However, here's one scene that sets the tone quite well for what I'm saying, for what comes and goes quite frequently in the second half of the movie:Brie Larson's character is having problems taking a ""long exposure image"" of the northern lights (although they're close to the equator), due to a ""malfunctioning"" camera flash. Instead she gets aided with a cigarette lighter so that she can adjust the exposure (?). That makes NO sense!! To point out the absurdity a bit more: It was bright outside (!), no long exposure was needed (0.5 seconds at most), bright enough to see the camera equipment and all the scenery. Also - you can't lighten the northern light with a flash, nor see the exposure settings on a camera thanks to it! It literally burns for a split second!!The scene was less than 30 seconds and managed to get all that wrong in that short of time. Yeah, you get the image,.. 👍","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

Now something I didn't like about Godzilla was the pacing and this does a lot better pacing then the last movie. But the only thing I hate about movies like this is there is always one unlivable character and that the Colonel Packard Samuel L. Jackson did a good job it's the writing that ruined it.

For me the point of the movie was the monsters and the monster action. The designs of the creatures was pretty incredible, all the creatures in this movie were very very cool to see, their size and the detail made on them was really nice to see. 
the Island felt like a great place, felt scary but beautiful. And Kong was just amazing to see, This kong was a lot cooler than the Kong from Jackson's movie. and this movie was a lot more entertaining and engaging. 
I Did like the human characters a lot as well. John C Reily was the greatest thing about the movie, the funniest and most interesting character. He was my favorite character. I really loved Brie Larson and I really liked Tom as well.

The pacing, and the straightforward allegories, all worked well and the visuals are just amazing. This is one of the best-looking Hollywood blockbusters of recent times. There is a commitment to style that is rarely seen in tentpole films without polarizing the reception to it.

""Dragged a little, early on"".
""Not many creatures"".IntroductionHey guys, so after travelling to Italy in the world of cider, and travelling to Worthing and Yarmouth recently. P.s All available on my blog reaseadotorg,
I am now travelling into a magical world in the Pacific. A world unlike anything my senses have ever witnessed. Prepare for THE Kong: Skull island movie review !!!A 2017 Fantasy Sci-fi, with lots of action and massive creatures worth a watch ?You bet son...Yeah, I mean the film was cool. Good music, good characters, good scenery. There were quite a few weaknesses but none that a mountain-sized gorilla couldn't cover up ... See more below:StorylineThe storyline, without giving too much away, was understandable for all the family. It was frustratingly basic for the Uber intelligent though. Yes it had action, pretty good effects and graphics, and a few key events with different settings. Beyond this though, there was something missing. I'm guessing it wasn't a mountain-sized ape, but more likely, stuff which could've happened that wasn't made so predictable.Part of the blame lies with the script here.
For example, If you say:
""When I go to the park, there will be a kid on a swing"".
Then go to the park, and when you get there and Ryan is indeed (on the swing), that discovery isn't particularly dramatic. It doesn't say ...
BOOM !!
like a surprise.
More
""Oh right, yeah"".The rest of the blame, lies with the actual events that happened, not having enough going on. Maybe a few more creatures or natural events would've compensated for this ...Fortunately, the scenery was changed regularly. With characters travelling quite a bit. This was a good touch, and certainly made things more entertaining.
GenreAs for a Sci-fi/fantasy, the film was good. All characters had excellent graphics and effects. The genre was only let down by the number of characters that existed. There certainly could have been quite a lot more. This would have made the fantasy even more fantastic. I would say, this would be better categorised as an action/fantasy rather than Sci-fi, because despite some scientists being involved, there is very little science actually in the film. At least compared to the level of action.
CharactersThe lead roles had good diversity and plenty of character personalities, with ideas coming to light throughout. The interactions were insightful enough to regret characters being harmed, yet were slightly basic.
I'd suggest a few less characters, to improve the emotional connection to their roles.
Despite this ...
The costume variety only enhanced this aspect of the film, and with a few big names, the characters were on the whole well-played.MusicThe music was applied where necessary, to compensate for less action. With restraint at times, where other sounds were more significant to the impact of the scene. This is an area frequently underperformed, but for this film, the balance of when music was played, and it's type, was effectively incorporated.
SummaryAn action-packed, travelling fantasy film, with plenty of costume and scenery effects to leave you satisfied.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

Not amazing, not something I think everyone should watch at least once (or I'd have given it 9 stars), it doesn't speak to me in an extremely personal way (or I'd have given it 10), but it is very good. I would recommend it for any monster movie fan and any fan of Vietnam War movies.It wasn't really doing the standard King Kong story. Much of the ""Kong protecting a blonde lady from dinosaurs"" plot is left out completely, though smaller story elements remain. The new elements they added to replace the old story cast the original story elements which remain in a fruitful new light. It ultimately isn't much like the 30s film or Peter Jackson's remake at all. Instead, it was more like the 70s monster movie stylistically. However, in terms of its themes, it is a clear student of *Apocalypse Now*. In all seriousness, you will definitely enjoy this movie more if *Apocalypse Now* is in your recent memory.The movie takes place immediately after the retreat from Vietnam. As such, the moral status of that war linger in the subtext throughout the movie. As a direct result, this movie's interpretation of the Skull Island natives is much more charitable than any other version. They are thoroughly sympathetic characters rather than the almost farcically mindless ""savages"" from Jackson's version. The filmmakers also don't project a fetish for whiteness onto them like the 30s version does.Vietnam figures into the film in a second, more important, way. In the wake of our defeat (by a less ""civilized"" enemy), the American military's masculinity has been wounded and humiliated. Their attempt to destroy Kong in order to prove to themselves that their ""civilization"" is still powerful is the film's heart. I was worried, from the trailers, that the movie would just be a hyper-masculine contest between ""Man"" and ""Kong,"" but it instead completely re-frames this in a more self-aware and critical light.In the 30s, when industry and civilization seem to have conquered nature, it was appropriate for King Kong to be a story of the tragic defeat of natural force at the hand of machines. But after Vietnam, it is appropriate for the story to have significantly more doubt about our own control over the world. This movie turns this doubt into a legitimately compelling anti-colonial allegory.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."
"1","/10","A peaceful animal being attacked for no good reason.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8803716/?ref_=tt_urv","naroiden","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65598730/?ref_=tt_urv","16 January 2023","I saw this movie when I was in the army but alas I didn't had the chance to watch the whole movie so I decided to watch it today. So the theme of the movie is how people attack for no good reason therefore the movie starts from WW2, then Vietnam and then basically for no good reason some people go to an unknown island with an army and hand-picked experts in a particular field regarding this expedition like they going to a family trip out of the city to enjoy the picnic and for no good reason they attack to a giant ape that is the guardian of the island and of course this animal defends its home, other animals and itself from these people who spread into the island like a virus and attack other animals for no reason while they enjoying how monster they are. It's not a nice entertainment to watch people being a monster and primitive.Homo sapiens as the animal species you know as ""humans"" are the only animal species that kill for fun and the only animal species that kill its own kind basically for no good reason. Other animal species are peaceful but they only attack to hunt and to defend their own life or their own species. When an animal fears for their own life and/or their loved ones they lose their mind and protect themselves by doing what's necessary but only humans attack as a form of entertainment and they can be too insane and mentally ill to feel good when they believe they are a survivor and whatnot like it matters. Even bears, wolves and sharks (the most popular fearsome animals by humans) don't disrespect the territory of other animals unless they are hungry so even these animals care to live in peace which is why animals stay away from where people live unless they are too hungry but people hunt animals for useless stuff like making an animal species go extinct just because to use dead bodies of these animal species to produce makeup stuff and whatnot trivial stuff. Would you feel good when an alien race uses the dead bodies of humans to produce makeup? So in this movie we see the unfiltered POV on how evolution took a wrong turn and thus homo sapiens came into existence and how they attack themselves and other species for no good reason.The movie itself doesn't target a particular audience therefore they tried to make the movie have stuff that can interest every kind of usual audience but it backfired for me: Visuals somewhat seem childish therefore it's repulsive. For example, they sit in a bar and for some reason the bar has an artistic lighting style like they are not after hiring a crew for the team but their main goal is being a model for an artistic photo shot - artistic direction-wise that bar scene didn't make sense. In the movie there is a particular man and woman to interest perverts as sexual objects and therefore there was a somewhat romantic aspect of the movie which wasn't apropos for a movie like this. Why there are lots of weird animal species and why we had to watch some soldiers surviving on that island and being killed by these weird animals? Why there are native humans there and how could they even survive? Why there are so many pointless and trivial conversations in the movie?Whoever developed this movie may think complexity and deep lore are always a good thing but in reality as an ordinary audience we decided to watch this movie because of its poster and the name of the movie obviously. In the poster we see a giant ape and soldiers so we think a giant ape attacking to people so people have to defend themselves but the poster misleads the audience so we watch the movie and realize the movie is way more complex than the poster makes it seem. I got bored of its first 20 minutes due to too many lectures on the goal of some men and them searching for particular crew members for the team. I never liked such movies. Just get to the point fast. Then I didn't like to see people attacking a peaceful animal for no good reason which the moment the giant ape was being attacked was probably why most audiences stopped watching the movie and hated the movie. Whoever wrote the story should learn people don't like to watch people attacking an animal for no good reason. That's why basic stories tend to start with how some evil endangers innocent people and then we learn what some people do to protect these innocent people so the audience can be okay with people attack to this evil being. But in this movie the real evil being was never the giant ape. The real evil being was always the humans so how the audience as a human being would be entertained to watch an innocent giant ape defending itself from humans? Thanks to writers and directors for reminding me how we as humans should be shamed to be human and we should wish to reincarnate as a cat in our next life. I bet so many kids were traumatized watching this nonsense movie. Any decent human being would hate this movie. The whole movie is like watching some home burglars attacking a dog that tries to defend itself and the house from home burglars - that's not a nice thing to watch.Other than these, the cinematography is textbook. Nothing creative at all. Visual art-direction targets the young audience by making the visual cartoonish-style that kids love with lively colours and all but the visuals and theme of the movie are not in harmony therefore the art-direction is very wrong in this movie. When a movie is depressive you use a non-lively depressive colour filter to make the audience feel what kind of reality the movie has. But in this movie visual style is like some innocent summer fun like some family enjoying swimming on Miami beach but in reality in this movie people and lots of animals die horribly and they do anything to survive. Watching this movie is like listening to some happy melody that has very depressive lyrics.Psychology-wise what characters does doesn't make sense. The writers clearly didn't understand being a soldier is ensuring peace, not being a terrorist even to animals therefore what the commander does doesn't make sense. A soldier understands even the enemy soldier is after protecting themselves and their own country and that's why a soldier respects animals who protect their own land and whatever. Weirdly the writers understood the psychologycal state of two enemy WW2 soldiers but then how could they write a story that soldiers attacking an obvious guardian of the island? Soldiers are not hunters so this movie itself insults soldiers. A soldier is a soldier no matter the era, culture and country they lived in. So in this movie soldiers are made fun of and labelled as hunters. Hunters kill for fun, soldiers are not a killer. Soldiers are protectors of peace. If the army of a country is not a protector of peace then they are no soldiers, they are a terrorist. If soldiers are used to killing animals then they are no soldiers, they are hunters. No soldier is okay being a terrorist and hunter which is basically why soldiers don't like wars as any sane people. But in this movie soldiers are made to seem like they love action and pointless war which is an insult to soldiers. What do you think a real soldier is? Don't think, go learn.This movie could be better if the script was decent. I'm actually surprised if the movie company didn't have a decent quality control team or something because obviously this movie is bad so I have no idea how they were okay to even release this movie. Even its IMDB score is actually higher than I expected. It's not so bad movie but bad decisions are all over the place therefore I cannot recommend the movie.","3 out of 16 found this helpful."

Whilst its predecessor, Godzilla (2014) was aiming to be a serious disaster film, Kong: Skull Island simply wanted to be a fun popcorn film and on that front, it succeeds. There were some great special effects and monster action: Larry Fong's (Zack Sydner's regular cinematographer) influence was felt during action sequences like the one at gas vents.As well as the action, there was a horror feel to film with some characters getting some gruesome deaths, especially for a film rated 12. Kong: Skull Island did feel a bit too similar to Peter Jackson's King Kong but that was also a fun blockbuster so hardly a bad reference point.I'm surprised that Jordan Vogt-Roberts didn't get to direct more blockbusters since he did such a good job with this one.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

This movie looks absolutely stunning. Larry Fong found some real magic in the cinematography, and I loved the dramatic color choices director Jordan Vogt-Roberts and his team made when adding the visual effects. It gave a striking look to each set piece, and it seemed that each big moment was unique. I can take a movie that is loaded with CGI things fighting CGI things if it's all going to look this good. Speaking of which, there were a number of interesting creatures in this film, which drew me in and made this island nation a one-of-a-kind world that was different from others I've seen in movies from the past.However, what I have found makes giant monster movies a struggle is the disconnect with anything human. Often the people are faceless masses just there to scream when the creatures attack. Kong: Skull Island didn't quite fall into that trap, because we do follow a somewhat small band of people. I will say, there are probably still a few too many people, as they don't have time to develop backstory and character arcs for everyone. Instead they all become a bit one-dimensional. That being said, I liked how they all filled traditional roles, even if Samuel L. Jackson was over-the-top with his vengeful streak, and Brie Larson was a bit flat as the token damsel in distress. Even if I didn't get to know these people all that well, they were engaging enough that I was invested in their adventure.Another thing worth mentioning is the time period they chose to set this film. Placing it during the Vietnam War was an interesting idea. They took things to the extreme when establishing the setting, with everything from the conversations to the same cliched songs we hear in every movie focused on that war. However, I thought it was a smart choice in the long run because we can infer some things about the past experiences of the soldiers. Finally, I have to mention how John C. Reilly did a lot to try and steal this movie. He was quite funny, and had the most fascinating story arc out of all the characters (including King Kong himself.) To sum up, Kong: Skull Island isn't a perfect movie, but it had so many of the key entertaining elements spot on that I didn't mind. This is a movie I will gladly seek out again, and is by far my favorite film featuring that big chest-pounding ape.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

Hmm...let's try again...""Is that a monkey?""...Yeah, now we have the right beauty and her beast tale. This remake, newly titled Kong: Skull Island, has no real love story or any remote emotional connection. Beauty does not kill the beast in this update. No, instead, we have boredom that kills the moviegoer. While the CGI is very well done, especially the immaculate detailing of matted fur and expressive eyes on our big silly ape, other features are sorely missing, like believable characters, a plot that makes sense, action sequences that build tension, dialog that sounds authentic. Would that the filmmakers had spent more energy and effort on a convincing script, the film could have at least been entertaining. It just wastes everyone's time. The King Kong legend dates back to 1933, with numerous remakes (including the vastly superior one by Peter Jackson in 2005). But our reboot begins in 1943 until it fast forwards to 1973. The plot (as before) involves a group of explorers who venture onto a primitive island filled with monsters, historic beasts, and a big galoot of a gorilla. This time, however, Kong rules over the island (sans the King, because no one likes a monarchy anymore). Not only is our ape ""as big as a building"", he is literally a treehugger who cares about ecological balance. When he feasts his eyes on the lovely Mason Weaver (Brie Larson, a poor-man's substitute for Fay Wray), there is no love interest. It's more of a mutual admiration society, as if she is an active member in PETA.While no animals were injured in the making of this film, several fine actors have certainly damaged their reputations. Such talented actors like Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Shea Whigham, and the aforementioned Ms. Larson, are wasted in their underdeveloped roles. Only John C. Reilly succeeds in making his character interesting.Besides the fine special effects, the only other redeeming feature is the stunning cinematography by Larry Fong that does impress, although his photography aligns itself too frequently to Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now with its wartime imagery of whirling helicopters and red-lit skies. But one has to admire that he set the bar high for his goal.The direction by Jordan Vogt-Roberts is not that lofty. It is merely adequate. He stages the action scenes well enough but relies too heavily with a 1970's pop soundtrack that overstates everything. All seems rote and predictable. The dangers the characters face are not the least exciting as there is no build-up or tension. His pacing of the film is off-kilter. (The film takes a good half hour even before the mission begins.)However, the majority of the blame goes to its rightful source, the screenplay-by-committee team of Dan Gilroy, Max Borenstein, and Derek Connolly. They strand the actors on the island with banal conversation, long tedious exposition, and stock characters. (At one point, the travelers are warned about the giant ants on this isle, but they never make an appearance in this misguided adventure/fantasy. Nary a crumb in sight.)Kong: Skull Island is just not a very enjoyable movie experience. The CGI holds your interest momentarily, but there are no real scares or thrills in this monster movie. This Kong may be a lot bigger, but it's not a whole lot better.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

They either really impress us, or turn us into monsters as we tear the movie apart. Tonight, the ""King"" of monster returns to the silver screen, in what looks to be a high-definition adventure made for the theater technology. With an all-star cast including Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, and John Goodman this could be the giant monster flick we have been hoping. Robbie K is back with another review, hoping to shed some light on Kong: Skull Island. LIKES:  Human perspective  Awesome Visuals  Awesome Soundtrack  Action  John C. ReillySUMMARY: Most monster movies are often focused on the monster (or man in a rubber costume) wreaking havoc on the environment, only occasionally panning on a human actor. This rendition of Kong shifted that balance back to the humans, putting the tale more from there trek across the killer island. Don't get heated though, because Skull Island has plenty of moments centered on the big ape and all hisnaked glory. Kong isn't the only visual the movie has to offer though, as the team is able to create the nightmare that is skull island in fantastic displays of CGI and real life setting. The environment has a culmination of setting that capture both the beauty and horror that an isolated, prehistoric ecosystem has to offer. The flora, and inanimate stone structures, aren't the only impressive visual though. Skull Island's fauna are also stunning to watch, imaginative creatures that fit well into habitats they call home. Both my friend and I agreed the team did an awesome job crafting monsters that dwell in your darkest dreams, giving them bark, bit, and in some cases slime to truly be deadly. Visuals aside, the soundtrack also has some diversity to it. Our humans theme song seems to be songs from the 70s that will have you classic rock groupies smiling with glee. While those who like powerful symphony work, will enjoy the edge the orchestra brings to the more exciting parts. Speaking of excitement, Kong: Skull Island brings the action to the full front. Unlike Godzilla (2014), Kong doesn't skimp on the monsters actually doing something other than walk around. Much of the movie involves the humans lighting the creatures up with their guns as they dodge lethal appendages. Yet Kong himself has his moments to shine, in heart pounding, special effects laden sequences that will have you screaming in delight. I myself was impressed with Kong's sweet wrestling moves, including the epic finishes our WWE guys only dream of copying. Sound like too much action? Not to worry, John C Reilly has got you covered with well- timed, well-delivered comedy to lighten the mood. DISLIKES:  Story is okay  Uneven characters  Rushed Scenes  Cheesy MomentsSUMMARY: The story of King Kong has been told in so many iterations, but most of these renditions give the beast a lot of character outside of wrestling champion. In this telling, the story takes a major dip in favor of the action. As laid out in the trailers, Skull Island's main premise is survival, with a majority of the plot focusing on our human casts journey to get off the land. Oh sure, they try to inject a few other morals into the mix (including vengeance and love) and they do try to give Kong some other qualities in an attempt to develop him. However, many of these extra points shallowly developed, lost to the special effects and battles waiting in the jungle. I missed the deeper nature to Kong's character, but I give props for venturing off the traditional path. In addition to the simplistic story, Kong's Skull Island also has some editing/developmental issues for me. First off, the uneven characters. Our band of humans is a little skewed, with some getting decent development to others being just another pretty face (that may or may not get devoured). It's the problem when hiring big casts, but this reviewer would have liked a little more backstory to add some emotional turmoil to the mix. The shallow character development paints predictable targets on most of their backs, leading to rushed moments where a character is abruptly, and in some cases pointlessly, eliminated. Sure, it keeps in theme with the island is always hungry, but Skull Island's team needed to go in a clean-up these hasty moments. Ironically, the one thing (outside of the action) they focused on was the anger/hate between Kong and Jackson. Yours truly found the intense stare off and peeing contest between the two to be a touch overdramatic and drawn out. Suspense building? Maybe. Ridiculous? You bet it is. The VERDICT:Both my friend and I agree that Skull Island is one of the better portrayals of the King of the Jungle. With impressive visuals, dangerous environment, and fantastic battles, this is the monster movie we have been waiting for. While there are some story elements that need tweaking and some balance restored, the film gives me faith for future giants vs. human films and the inevitable sequels to come. With all the special effects and action, yours truly recommends this one for the theater, and could see it having some extra oomph in 3-D. And despite what you may expect, one should stick around when the lights go down. You might just find yourself stoked for what is to come. My Scores: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0","5 out of 12 found this helpful."

The same theme is central to every King Kong film: beauty tames the savage beast. However, that aspect is just subtext in this movie; the main story and themes differ completely from previous variations. The reason for this change is because ""Kong: Skull Island"" is not another King Kong remake at all. It's a completely different beast that just happens to have King Kong in it (although a Kong that is far larger than your average iteration).Due to this freedom, ""Kong: Skull Island"" pursues far more relevant themes than previous Kong movies. The film takes place at the end of the Vietnam war and takes full advantage of that traumatizing time. Within this vehicle, there's subtext on nation building that's fascinating, but the core ideas that this movie explores are the role of the warrior when there is no war, particularly, when they come home defeated. For the most part, the majority are just happy to go home to their families, but far more disturbingly is the soldier looking for the next war.Into this vacuum steps Samuel L Jackson's Preston Packard. In a movie with lots of solid acting, Jackson standouts. He is a man driven by rage, however, he never acts unreasonably. It's easy to see why he would command a unit and why men follow him. Focused and determined, he pursues his next victory at any cost. At face value, most of his ideas appear insane, but when he speaks his ideas and motivations never seem entirely outlandish. Through this, the movie explores the ideas of what war does to its warriors.Unabashedly, the movie never neglects the concept that big monsters giving each other a thrashing is awesome. Despite the serious themes this movie explores, it never forgets that it's just a fun monster versus monster beat-em-up B movie. Fortunately, unlike the American ""Godzilla"" from a couple of years ago, the audience experiences as much action as it could handle. Further, the effects are simply spectacular. None of ""The Great Wall""'s green dogs here, more comparable would be the effects from last year's ""The Jungle Book"". Most the creatures and especially Kong himself look very real.Sure, there are times where I feel like editing skipped minor story points occasionally making the audience wonder how some characters got from point A to point D, but this is an infrequent occurrence. Also, outside of Preston Packard and Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly is the other big standout in the cast) all the characters are rather underdeveloped. Still all in all, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is a film far better than it has any right to be.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

I don't care that this isn't the classic King Kong narrative we're used to-the entire point of a remake is, after all, to build off of or change the original in some way.What I do care about is that this is a monster movie that fails in a number of regards. The biggest problem is that this movie doesn't know if it wants to be a weird kaiju-centric remake of Moby Dick, an environmentalist film or a cheeseball monster movie. So Jordan Vordt-Roberts said ""**** it, let's do all of them"". The result has all of the tonal whiplash you'd expect, plus the complete inability to do any of those ideas justice. I didn't even mention the utterly godawful script and bizarre shifts in style.The '5' then is for at least delivering some cool monster-fighting, CGI and general braindead entertainment. In fact the only improvement over 2014's Godzilla (the first MonsterVerse film) is that this one is better at showing off the main character. Kong has immediate presence where Godzilla was hidden by darkness, dust, more darkness and that movie's editor. Godzilla, on the other hand, knew what it wanted to be, and did that fairly well.

The story is okay and the plot is average. But the acting and the directing was terrible. I am not saying that the cast was not good, it was their performance in the movie which was a huge let down. The most lame scene was when, after few decades John C. Reilly saw people from the outside world and there was no real enthusiasm in his reaction. Not to mention the excellent condition of his outfit after so many years.Now about acting. Throughout the film, seeing the amazing creatures for the first time in their life, there was no actual awe or fear in the actors' or actresses' eyes or even in their body language. It was as if every day they watch this sort of animals in the street. And even when they tried to interact with these animals, their behavior was unrealistic as if they are staring at a wall. They should have practice acting using green screen before the actual shooting. Only then they could have given a better performance than this, which frankly looked like they were interacting with wall without any real emotion. They should watch and learn from the film Okja to learn how to act with a imaginary animal. If a little child could perform so nicely then it should be easier for them.Director also have to take the blame for their performance because he failed to bring out the realistic performance out from them because he didn't provide them the necessary motivation, persuasion or even the feeling of real life environment of the scenes in the set. The movie has great CGI though. So if you like those kind of effects then you might even enjoy the film. But performance-wise there is nothing to see really.Not Recommended.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

This is an all out creature feature...It is called Skull Island because that's where the action takes place with all the neat creatures. There is a LOT of screen time devoted to Kong and the monsters. Kong: Skull Island is the perfect monster movie. It's an epic display of what a popcorn movie should be.In 1944, in the midst of World War II, two fighter pilots – an American soldier named Hank Marlow and a Japanese soldier named Gunpei Ikari – parachute onto an island in the South Pacific after a dogfight. They both engage in close combat, with Ikari gaining the upper hand, but the fight is interrupted by a behemoth ape known as Kong.In 1973, U.S. government agent Bill Randa hires former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad, a skilled tracker, to guide an expedition to map out an island known as ""Skull Island"" and with a Vietnam War helicopter squadron led by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard and his subordinates, Major Jack Chapman and Captain Earl Cole. Upon arrival at Skull Island, Packard's men begin dropping explosives developed by seismologist Houston Brooks to map out the island. However, the air unit is attacked by Kong, who kills a number of military personnel and scatters the others across the island.After being confronted by Packard, Randa reveals his affiliation to the secret government organization Monarch, which was trying to prove the existence of monsters and determine their threat to humanity. The other survivors (Conrad, Weaver, Brooks, biologist San Lin, soldier Reg Slivko, and Landsat employee Victor Nieves) try to get to a rendezvous point to meet a resupply team arriving in three days' time. They encounter the local Iwi natives and an older Marlow. He reveals that Kong is the island's guardian, worshiped as a god by the natives for protecting the island's inhabitants from many predators, including reptilian underground monsters dubbed ""Skullcrawlers"". They have killed Kong's ancestors, leaving him as the last of his kind, and that one of the Skullcrawlers killed Ikari.Packard's group begins making their way to Chapman, whose helicopter crash-landed elsewhere. Meanwhile, Chapman is ambushed and eaten by a Skullcrawler. Jame Conrad's group helps Marlow complete a boat built from parts scavenged from Marlow and Ikari's downed planes. They ride the boat down the river, and manage to secure communication with Packard's group, but the boat is attacked by pterosaur-like creatures which kill Nieves. They regroup with Packard, who insists on searching for Chapman, though his true objective is to find and kill Kong.There, the same Skullcrawler that devoured Chapman attacks the group, killing Randa and many soldiers before dying in a flammable gas explosion triggered by Weaver. Learning about Chapman's death, a vengeful Packard blames Kong for the deaths of his men and becomes determined to kill Kong. The two groups part ways, with Packard's group laying a trap for Kong, while the non-military personnel head back to the boat. As Conrad and Weaver encounter Kong, Packard's group triggers napalm explosions to lure him in. Kong charges to the lake, where they manage to incapacitate him with ignited gasoline, though Woodward is killed. Conrad's group arrives and persuades the other soldiers to spare Kong, but Packard refuses to stand down. Then, a massive Skullcrawler. Emerges from the lake. Packard is crushed to death by a recovering Kong. The Skullcrawler overpowers Kong in a brief battle and then chases the survivors. Kong returns to rescue the others and with help from the humans, kills the beast by ripping out its innards. He saves Weaver from drowning, and allows the surviving humans to leave the island.During the credits, Marlow returns home, reuniting with his wife, meeting his son for the first time, and watching a Chicago Cubs game on television. In a post-credits scene, Conrad and Weaver are detained by Monarch and informed by Brooks and Lin that Kong is not the only monster to roam the world. As proof, they are shown archive footage of cave paintings depicting Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

The place is dangerous and mysterious and the team is headed by Samuel Jackson. The 3D effects are fully enjoyable and worth watching. All the creatures shown are extremely dangerous and reminds you of Avatar. Story is good and takes u back to the old saying which says man is more dangerous to nature and if you invade others territory, they will try to protect in whatever way they can. The crash scenes and full fledged introduction of Kong is simply outstanding and proves man as a mere toy in the hands of all the animals. Not to forget the funny moments and dialogues between Cole and his friend. Music is progressive and gives a feel of the movie in a grand way. Lastly the island is definitely not a place you would try to enter.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

Despite this lackluster track record, WB took a gamble with green lighting 2017's follow-up effort 'Kong: Skull Island.' While the film is equally bloated from a budget standpoint, it takes a step backward even further in terms of quality.'Skull Island' follows a somewhat intriguing premise of following monster chasers (John Goodman and Corey Hawkins) and a post-Vietnam military escort (headed up by trigger-happy Samuel L. Jackson) as they explore an uncharted island in the Pacific. On paper, this all sounds fine and good, but as we get deeper into the film, it's clear director Jordan Vogt-Roberts is presiding over just a tired old formula of ""pick them off one-by-one."" From an acting standpoint, the roles are written very stereotypically, so even though there are some strong actors cast (Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly), they are not done any favors. Whether an antiwar idealistic photo journalist, meek scientists or a jaded yet-adventure-hungry former British special opps agent, all of these characters are just wooden and hollow.As for the actual events of the film, there are a few scenes that are kind of new and different, but the vast majority feels like it's a rehash of many other films we've seen before, including 'Jurassic Park,' 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and others. Sure, it's pretty standard to see Hollywood recycle things here and there, but when the majority of a film feels like deja vu, that definitely works against it. As for the CGI, it's good but not spectacular, and so there are next to no good aspects of 'Skull Island.'Sure, there are some who will be entertained by 'Kong: Skull Island' due to its action sequences and formulaic flow. But that doesn't change the fact that it's pretty flawed and generally a mess of a movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

The final product is a disjointed, illogical mash-up of a film that includes every Vietnam War movie cliche shoe-horned with great contrivance into a King Kong story. This film goes to absurd lengths to include scenes of Huey helicopters approaching an LZ to a late 60's rock-and-roll soundtrack and soldiers wading chest deep through rice paddies. Somewhere amidst this is a bland, script and a cast that is entirely forgettable except for a wildly miscast Samuel L. Jackson and a rather pointless John C. Reilly.

It's a movie about a giant gorilla.....a giant gorilla. The name says as much. So, if you could not wrap your head around that premise and went in expecting a 'grounded-in-reality' plot line, then you're the one being stupid.And as far as realism and coherent storytelling go, it is still far better than Peter Jackson's version from 2005 (Sorry, Peter, love your other work i.e LotR).At the same time it is also not good enough to warrant a 10 on IMDb from me, primarily because it ultimately lacks a certain 'wow' factor which you need to have if you're trying to reboot a franchise for the 3rd or 4th time.So what's good about it ?Well, it's entertaining, for sure ! You have all the regular capers that you would expect from a giant monster flick such as a 'tall-as-a-building' Kong swatting down military helicopters like they are flies, thumping his chest while roaring and a few other monsters thrown into the mix for Kong to fight (which makes for a few excellently shot set pieces in the film).The acting ? Well, not Tom Hiddleston's best work, somehow i cant see him as an action hero, but he delivers a solid performance nonetheless. Brie Larson's character is thankfully not your typical damsel in distress that you would expect, although her character is saved from death a couple of times in the movie. However a diversion from the regular plot where Kong is supposed to kidnap the most good looking girl who eventually falls for him is a welcome one. Sam Jackson basically plays Sam Jackson who is furious at Kong for pwning his helicopter squadron and is on a 'Captain Ahab' type revenge quest; and he does it well. John C Riley's character was a pleasant surprise and they have given his character some good closure at the end.And the plot itself ? All i'll say is that it's a basic plot, good enough for a monster movie and actually quite coherently played out on the screen. Like i said before, don't go in expecting realism from a giant monkey movie.So what's bad about it ? Well, only that it ultimately does not have enough new material to be a ground-breaking reboot.So, all-in-all.... Definitely worth a watch! Not only entertaining enough on it's own but also a solid start to what will hopefully go on to become a very cool 'Monster-verse'.Oh yes, what about the 'Monster-verse' ?! Well, be sure to watch the post-credits scene :-) :-)","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

Instead of a comic book we get a well designed production more on the level of the graphic novel.Attention to period detail (1973) is nearly 100 percent, from wrist watches, military uniforms and weapons, tactical gear, radios, tape recorders, record players, cameras, aircraft, automobiles, scientific equipment, most of it checks out as authentic.The only thing I spotted as incorrect was a brief view of an animated color computer graphic that wouldn't have been possible for at least another twenty years, but that's all.The CGI goes without saying. The use of it to make the most disgusting creatures come to life is as good as it can get. Kong battles away with these many monsters with great dramatic flair. One is an eighty foot tall spider that really gave me the creeps. Anachriods are not my thing, and the movie didn't help me with that at all.As the story progresses, the military/science team meet up with a mute indigenous people who have lived on the island for thousands of years. Again, attention to detail is immaculate.You would have no problem believing this was an actual race completely cut off from the rest of the civilized world had you ever met them.However, there were a couple of unbelievable and ridiculous scenarios that threatened my suspension of dis-belief. First, there is no such thing as an island with it's own savage storm system that keeps it hidden and nearly impenetrable. If you have a scientific mind at all, you'll find this idea laughable.Second, the military blundering that occurs when the helicopter pilots first encounter the giant ape, which gets everybody stranded in the first place, is overwhelmingly dumb and hard to swallow.Instead of retreating, all the pilots simply fly mindlessly straight at Kong who bats them all out of the sky one by one. Duh.But it is an action movie, and that's what you get, regardless of the lack of logic or reason here and there.Great fun for all ages.Your teenage boys will love it. Your teenage girls will probably not.Oh, and Samuel Jackson doesn't drop a single F-bomb through the whole movie.I found that refreshing.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."
"9","/10","The best treatment of King Kong in over 80 years.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4705906/?ref_=tt_urv","Benjamin-M-Weilert","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur100116496/?ref_=tt_urv","8 March 2019","Given how incredibly groundbreaking the special effects in the original King Kong (1933) were, I can understand why they keep re-using this character. Of course, while King Kong (1976) was mislabeled as ""original"" in its advertising, the advancements in CGI made King Kong (2005) at least as visually stunning as its 1933 predecessor. Still, the story has remained the same: humans visit Skull Island, humans find Kong, humans bring Kong to New York, Kong climbs the tallest building, and humans kill Kong. Consequently, I didn't have much of an expectation of Kong: Skull Island (2017), since I thought I knew what the plot would be.I can honestly say that Kong: Skull Island is the best adaptation of this character since 1933. A few choices helped to create an original story that deviated from the norm. Sure, humans go to Skull Island to find Kong, but the other creatures they find there are as fantastical as the gigantic Kong, who appears to be larger than any other version I've seen of him. Aside from the beautiful and artistic cinematography accentuating the intense fight sequences between Kong and his foes (be they human or otherwise), the fact that the film is set in the time shortly after the Vietnam War gave it a vastly different feel than any of the other Kong films in the franchise.Fortunately, the action was excellent. Additionally, the brief moments of levity interspersed throughout helped to keep the movie moving along at a good pace. I knew going into this film that it was part of a larger cinematic universe which includes Godzilla (2014), so while some characters and elements in Kong: Skull Island felt unused, I am sure they'll become relevant when Godzilla vs. Kong (2020) rolls around. In fact, part of the reason I gave this film my attention was that its predecessor was incredibly entertaining. Of course, I didn't know Kong: Skull Island was a prequel of sorts until the post-credits scene, but that just makes me want to see the next films in the franchise even more.The best treatment of King Kong in over 80 years, I give Kong: Skull Island 4.5 stars out of 5.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

Kong is featured plenty in this film and the action, both human and monster, is constant and adrenaline inducing.All performers did great. To be honest, I didn't feel anyone was a standout performance but they were all notable and entertaining. If I could choose any standouts it would be John C.

Both in terms of events and behaviours of characters. A great example of this is Rose in Titanic who sprouts off a love of Freud and Picasso. This movie harks back a few decades and does an extremely good job at portraying the genders from the 70s in an honest and realistic fashion. This will most probably infuriate sexist people like feminists as it contradicts almost everything they say. In particular, I enjoyed the sass of the female photographer (you know, when women were supposedly obedient little zombies, which they -never- have been..)The movie is a combination of old school war movie and action flick. I'm not a big fan of most war movies, however, they played this one well. You get some semblance of testosterone but it's fairly tame compared to movies like Apocalypse Now.What this movie does that's unique is that there are male characters with a spine (very rare in movies today - see the new Star Wars movies as an example of modern propaganda). They don't behave in a particularly sexist or idiotic fashion (again, rare for today's standards, but was very common to see decent male characters up until a few years ago. Now ""revisionism"" is the norm thanks to feminism).The special effects are very well done. The scale of the digital effects is impressive. It is reminiscent of films like BFG and Hugo. It gives you a great appreciation for just how big some of these creatures are.The acting on the whole is solid. In fact, i'm hard pressed to think of a character who is a let down. The weakest of the characters is probably Jing Tian who feels out of place.if you're looking for something very fresh (and retro) from Hollywood (especially if you're sick of EVERY movie having an over- aggressive female lead and all-male idiot cast) then this is the movie for you. If you're a feminist, I strongly suggest you avoid this one as you will be highly offended that all males aren't weak, sexist idiots.I'd most probably suggest the movie as being suitable for 12 years and over. There is some violence and plenty of scenes to get the adrenaline flowing.Well done Hollywood. This shows that you can make a movie without extreme sexism, even if it's only occasionally.+Sexism Free, Realistic Portrayal of genders from the 70s, Very good digital effects-Nothing exceptional other than its lack of sexism (which is rare)","3 out of 8 found this helpful."

Since everyone knows the basic story of KIng Kong, there is, of course, no suspense and none is to be expected except in the details of the characters' various predicaments (and of course, which of the cast of characters will be killed in a nasty and/or surprising manner). So, that leaves the story and the cast to carry the movie, as well as the special effects we expect.The director said that he was strongly influenced by video games, and it clearly shows. This is a film for an audience satisfied by ""big monsters"" and lots of automatic weapons. The acting is workmanlike and professional, as you'd expect from the talented lead actors, but you can see they're sleep-walking through their roles: Oh look, Samuel L. Jackson playing a military hard-ass Tom Hiddleston playing a reserved British ex-soldier with hidden mental and character strengths John C. O'Reilly playing a lovable oddball eccentric Wake me when the director has an actor playing against type, please.Big insects and lizards: check. Angry huge gorilla: check. Spectacular and wild scenery and location: check. Mysterious natives: check. Soldiers trying to kill huge creatures with small arms and being crushed when the creatures and insects just won't die: check. Obvious references to other films (armed boat going down a river in Vietnam-war era, manned by soldiers, with rock music blasting—hmm,let me think) and the Joseph Conrad novella: check.Compared to the outstanding and nuanced 2005 Peter Jackson film, this one looks like it was scripted and directed by a nine-year old sitting in front of his PlayStation, and aimed at a similar audience.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

The writers need to find other jobs, they sure can't sell an idea.Some of the problems include a group of soldiers escorting a crew of geologists but bring enough arms for a small war including napalm. Where's the justification in that? A soldier who has lived on the island for 28 years but never asked or consulted about what to do. He even says Í've been here for 28 years but what do I know?' Launching helicopters in a lightening storm. Who thought that was a good idea? You don't know what you are going into but hey, let's play bad American music over loud speakers and announce ourselves. And the ever present American attitude of kill everything, even if it was their fault. The spider was way out of proportion to the rest of the animals. Really dumb stuff.The cast weren't too bad although the Samual L Jackson persona is the same in every movie he makes and it wore thin years ago.I did like the monsters though. Great creativity and that is what saves this abysmally told story. This is the first time I cheered everytime a creature killed someone stupid. :-)

I liked it, so this based on how I perceived and viewed it. Hope this is helpful to all of you!Kong: Skull Island (2017) - You have three great actors/actress in this film: Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston, and Samuel Jackson. The three characters from Marvel movies. This movie was great! Of course, it is better than the original and the remake of King Kong (2005). The CGI in this was terrific and real. I am excited to see King Kong vs. Godzilla! This is worth it!King Kong (2005) - This was really good! Surprisingly, Jack Black was in it. The movie did really good with special effects and all. King Kong looked great! I feel like this remake was better than the first remake.King Kong Lives (1986) - It was pretty good. Surprised to see the lady who played Sarah Connor in this movie. You get to see King Kong and Female Kong escaping, along with having Baby Kong in this movie. The movie is pretty great. The ending was sad, but happy as well.King Kong (1976) - It was not bad, but it was a bit different. I liked it since it is not animation anymore, and they have improved in making King Kong look real. It is different, but it is still worth the watch. It was entertaining, you could say.King Kong Escapes (1968) - Surprised to see King Kong fighting with his Cyborg King Kong! It was not that bad. Worth the watch and entertainable!King Kong vs. Godzilla (1963) - It was pretty cool. King Kong fighting with Godzilla was awesome! You might tell some of them are fake when it comes to vehicles and trains getting stomped and destroyed. At the same time, it is pretty cool and great to watch! Can't wait to see the remake of this movie!Son of Kong (1933) - I did not expect King Kong to have a son! This was pretty good. King Kong's son looked shorter, but he looked pretty cool. Same animation like they did with King Kong in the first movie. It's pretty cool to see what it was like before CGI existed. Great movie!King Kong (1933) - Not bad! The animation of King Kong looked great! Of course, CGI wasn't there in the 30s, but it was still a great movie! They did really well with this movie and King Kong since they did not have technologies back then to have that realistic touch to King Kong. It may be horrible to those who are used to CGI or realistic look and feel to it, but it is interesting and entertaining.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

Kong: Skull Island, unashamedly flogs the dusty bones of a cliche horse that died 40 years ago.It's a film which annoyingly includes all of the cliche cinema tropes - yet fails spectacularly on every level. The weak attempt at comedy falls dead on the ground, and the acceptable CGI simply can't redeem the obscenely bad script, acting, or internal logic. Everything in this film was a horrific cliche, from the dialogue, to the camera direction, to the Asian character whose main presence seemed to be cut from the film.If watching giant creatures do battle is your thing, then the now 5 year old Pacific Rim is infinitely better.

The characters also act very unreasonable and depressed. They didn't even try to act like they were surprised to see a giant monster.I know the majestic mountain scenery of Ha Long Bay is extremely wonderful and beautiful, but they (the crew) shouldn't deny that it's too absurd compared to creatures in nature: No animal is so big that it can live in an environment with so small plants.

He is back, well rested and ready to ensue some fresh havoc. This is not a remake, or a sequel, though it feels like it can go hand in hand with the original as far as the thrills are concerned. The cast really brings their A Game and the overall film packs a wallop with some of the best CGI that I've seen. The characters (although not the brightest bunch) play likable and generally somewhat believable roles; and Kong has never looked better! The film is loaded with thrills and chills, creeps and crawls, jump scares, and a shocking amount of gore for a PG-13 feature. I bet it was a kill away from a R-Rating, this wouldn't have flew under the PG-13 radar 30 years ago. All in all, a MUST SEE for any King Kong fan, or anyone desiring to have a truly thrilling and terrifying time!

The direction and screenplay keep the story moving largely by pepping in vaguely satirical barbs about the situation and genre. It makes the film rather fun and the cheese delectably cheesy. Sure the film is glorified B-movie that mixes Apocalypse Now for ill-considered reasons but boy was the adventure exciting, the vistas engaging and the fights brutal.Reilly's Hank is easily the best part. He is funny and hits the perfect tone for this sort of film. And the character's fate is almost moving which isn't what one should expect from a film like this. The Cub fandom of Hank was a nice a clever touch. I sure hope the character lived to see 2016.The art direction/creature design is good. Skull Island has been done several times, and similar lost world environments have been created. This one stands out because of mixing in more types of creatures and the Skulls (lizards) are a striking design. The native tribe of Skull Island has a neat look as well; the film largely avoids the implicit racism that King Kong always seems to embody. This was a really fun adventure.

In the words of Lieutenant Colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), America has ""abandoned"" the war, not ""lost"" it. This is a perfect opportunity for government scientist Bill Randa (John Goodman) to get the funding and man-power that he needs to discover and explore Skull Island, an uncharted and legendary island somewhere in the Pacific. Packard and his men are assigned the task of bringing the expedition via helicopter to the island, while Randa also recruits a former SAS soldier with a speciality in tracking and map-reading to come along. When they get there, they discover that the island is home and ruled by a giant ape named Kong.This is no Peter Jackson Kong. I'm a fan of his 2005 remake of the 1930s classic. Skull island in Jackson's film was a grim place full of shadowy peril and brilliant looking monsters. Skull island in this 2017 version looks more like a holiday brochure. The monsters are poor. The only thing it has going for it is Kong himself, who looks incredible, and was the only enjoyable thing about this film. Everything else is atrocious.

"5","/10","Weak-but-entertaining monster movie.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3663040/?ref_=tt_urv","DannyDnB","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65242171/?ref_=tt_urv","16 March 2017","Since this movie was released last Friday, it has garnered a fairly positive reception. Seeing it being talked about so positively aroused an eager interest, mostly due to my love of the King Kong character, which led me to see it a few days ago. Do I think that it lived up to the hype? No. I do not.Now, that does not mean to say that I did not derive any enjoyment from the picture, because I did, but boy, this movie has issues.The movie begins by introducing us to the various characters who are brought together by John Goodman and Corey Hawkins' characters, two men who are leading an expedition to an uncharted island. Once there they inevitably run into the famous ape, as well as some other scary creatures. This is an extremely formulaic plot present in every King Kong movie. However, the problem I had with this film wasn't necessarily over the simple structure, but more so the poor execution of said structure.The human characters feel paper thin and lazily written. The dialogue they are given is even worse. Tom Hiddlestone and Brie Larsson are two particular characters who are given no development whatsoever, yet the movie puts them in situations where it feels like we are supposed to care for them. The only two characters that were given any kind of development were John C. Reilly and Samual L. Jackson. Everyone else felt like they were part of a B-movie.Now, negative out of the way, I must say that Kong and the other creatures on the island are the high-points of the film for me. Everyone one of them feels realistic, with personality. Their movements flow and add weight, particularly with Kong himself. I found myself wanting the monsters on screen whenever they weren't, and I wasn't let down on that end.It's a pity the weak characters take away from the greatness of the titular beast, but it's safe to say that anyone who wants to see King Kong beating the crap out of mysterious monsters will not be disappointed. Just don't expect to remember the movie two weeks down the line.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

I thought it was a good idea to place it in the time frame of the 1970's. Kong the ape was front and center and King Kong really was a king this time. The story was a good one--in another movie John C. Reilly's Robinson Curuso-type character would have stolen the show. But in this one each of the actors share screen time almost equally. The sound track features snippets of some of the best rock music ever recorded, and I liked the references to ""Heart of Darkness"" and the influences of Francis Ford Coppolla's ""Apocalypse Now"".","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

It manages a few laughs, which doesn't hurt, and isn't entirely brainless: the environmental message of the 70s version is in there somewhere, without spoiling the fun.In fact I think it's like one of those Doug McClure 'Lost World' films of the 70s - which I used to love - but produced to a much higher standard.

The best part about this film for me is without a doubt the characters. They are all very well developed and the relationships between them are established brilliantly, all meeting each other for the first time at the beginning, and we get to see it grow as the plot progresses, with everyone having to rely on each other. These characters intrigued me far more than any movie monster would. As a matter of fact, the poorest part of this film for me was actually King Kong himself. While he is beautifully rendered through CGI, he held the plot back. The characters could have been putting in to a much dire, exciting situations if a giant gorilla did not have to be there main threat, when there are easily scarier monsters out there in this universe. I honestly think it would have been a lot better if it was not a King Kong movie. The performances are stellar, each cast member having great chemistry with one another and bringing this world to life. Tom Hiddleston brings great charisma to his part, Brie Larson is charming, John Goodman is mysterious and Samuel L. Jackson is as intimidating as ever. However, the highlight for me was John C. Reilly, he is both the funniest and the most layered character, bring great depth to Hank Marlow, and his scene at the end is very heartwarming. It has very engaging characters, which for me, is why its worth watching. Well acted and development, Kong: Skull Island is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good adventure film. A group of scientists and soldiers are sent on a journey to Skull Island, an uncharted island that may hide some never before seen creatures.Best Performance: John C. Reilly","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

We have a group of scientists, a platoon of soldiers due to return home from the Vietnam war, and a man running an expedition with a hidden agenda, put all these factions together on an island inhabited by monsters and there is bound to be bloodshed. Tom Hiddleston smouldered in slow motion as a man hired for his tracking skills, Brie Larson tossed her hair provocatively as the pushy woman photographer and Samuel L Jackson delivered an epic performance as Lt Col Packard, a man who is not yet ready to leave the war and who is letting his fighting spirit cloud his decision making process. This group of people made odd bedfellows but add a tribe of non speaking painted natives, a huge primate and some outstandingly ugly reptilian monsters and you have a movie that keeps you interested from start to finish.

And all I can say is that it was a very pleasant surprise watching, the setting and all things surrounding the story-line are much different then previous movies. Yes the story-line is predictable (think Jurassic Park predictable) but it is very entertaining and the 3D is very well done adding some more depth to the movie. If your looking for a big bad-ass (albeit predictable) action movie to watch in the theatre's this for sure is the right pick.

Furthermore, the film strikes the audience with a dynamic perspective of the antagonist/protagonist role, both switching back and forth between the characters. The only discrepancy -- In my opinion, the film was overcast; there were too many characters (in the beginning) which disappoint an entertained audience with urges to see character development. For the ones you do get to know, John C. Reilly is just delightful and brings humor to the unfortunate events that occur. I saw this film in IMAX, so I can't confidently speak on the cinematography, however, the mise-en-scene is inclusive of all the right working parts to make the visuals virtually unparalleled by any other sci-fi/action film of late.

"4","/10","A Film That Contains Some Extremely Entertaining King Kong Throwdown Scenes, But Has Everything Else At A Dull","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3680052/?ref_=tt_urv","Gresh854","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur40127150/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 2017","I kept an open mind going into this film considering the trailers caught my attention since they made the film look extremely energetic, but there still was a possibility of this film flunking. I know it kills me to say this since I actually wanted this film to be solid, but I honestly think Skull Island was mediocre at best. This is an action film that is full of some super entertaining monster and of course King Kong action, destruction scenes, but in its entirety, it was a very flawed film. Now what I did however like about this film were a couple of things. One was the whole idea of the Skull Island aspect. All the monsters in this movie look super cool and have a very intensifying aspect to them that caught my attention. A majority of these monsters also have some pretty cool chaos scenes. Also Kong in this film had some pretty cool moments of destruction particularly the first time you see Kong. The scene lasts around 5 minutes and it is glorious, I absolutely loved that scene. Now that I've got that out of the way, I'm going to tell you why this film really didn't work for me. This film feels like it was rushed. For one the characters in this film are extremely poorly developed, I honestly couldn't care about any of them. The acting in the film from most of the actors and actresses, were for the most part really good. It's just that there was nothing for me to latch onto, or relate to with these characters since they have such vague character development. There is no sense of suspense when these characters are in danger, because I really couldn't care if they died, and that was hugely disappointing in my opinion. The only character that was slightly developed was surprisingly, John C Reily's character. Even so, John C Reily's character still didn't have that much of a pull on me, he was just the only character the film actually tries to make you care about. Now one thing that really upset me was Samuel's Jackson's character. Now I am a huge Samuel Jackson fan I've loved almost all of his performances in every film he's been in even the bad ones. For the first time ever I actually think I have found a Samuel Jackson role I have hated. Samuel Jackson's character in this film at first is just alright, but then he progressively becomes this over the top, un-charismatic, and unintelligent character who does some really stupid decisions with his military men, that bothered me so much. Something else that really bothered me in this film was the comedy. For me at least, 10% of the jokes land, and they are actually pretty funny. The other 90%, feels extremely forced. Almost every single scene in this film is always trying to be funny and it just got super annoying and repetitive after a while. This film also contains a really good soundtrack, with some extremely good 70s war songs. Well, unfortunately this movie decides to play these songs whenever they want at the most random times. Kind of like Suicide Squad, the soundtrack is good, but the way they interconnect that soundtrack with the film is done poorly. Also, some of the editing and plot points in this film are done a bit poorly. The editing isn't choppy too many times in this film, but when it is it's very noticeable. There are also some really bad green screen usage in this film. Some of the green screen looked really fake. This film at times looks very artificial an unrealistic, and I really wish they actually used natural backgrounds more often for this film. Even some of the CGI looks bad at times, which is bad considering this film mostly relies on CGI. But by far my hugest complaint about this film is without a doubt, the final decision that happens at the very end of the film. I have scene many movies in my life, but the certain decision that a couple of characters make towards the end, is one of the most random, unanswered, and pointless decisions, I have ever seen on film. I don't want to spoil it in case you haven't watched the film but when you see the film you'll know it. Hint, its the extremely random decision that is made ""after"" another group makes a stupid decision. My final flaw with this film is that at times it tries to be Jurassic Park. I know I shouldn't compare a film like Jurassic Park, with a simple monster movie like this one but I need to mention this. A couple of scenes in this movie are almost exact rip offs of scenes from Jurassic Park, and if you've scene Jurassic Park you will most likely know what scenes I'm talking about. Guys, Girls, I don't think I have to say anymore, Kong Skull Island was a huge disappointment. Right now at the time I'm writing this review, it's got a 77% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 7.1 on IMDb. To be honest I don't understand why this film is getting solid praise, especially from critics, but honestly if you like this movie, good for you, I am legitimately happy for you. To me though, I honestly found Kong Skull Island to be a huge mess that contained some really awesome monster destruction scenes thrown into it. If you like films like Transformers or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, you might like this film cause it falls under the same line as a mindless CGI extreme action festive. I'm going to give Kong Skull Island a grade of a C- and a IMDb score of a 5/10.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

"5","/10","An Average Monster Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7657252/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2021","With Godzilla vs Kong coming to the UK next week, I thought it was about time to re-watch the previous film involving one of the characters Kong: Skull Island and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of people from different backgrounds travel to an unmapped island in order to see what is there when they come up against the King of the island - Kong.Main Character
For these monster films, I always think the most important character is that of the monster and Kong is done fantastically well in this film. Kong is huge in this film and it is at its best when it shows him just wrecking shop and it is showcased incredibly well. There is some humanity to Kong and I think the film does a really good job in showing that and making him a more likeable creature. But then we get the human lead played by Tom Hiddleston and this is an actor I really like but he kind of sleepwalks through this film and offers very little. His character is paper thin and it just feels like he doesn't fit the role he is given and I think similar to Aaron Taylor Johnson in Godzilla these lead human casts struggle against there larger counterpart.Supporting Characters
Samuel L Jackson plays an Army leader in the film and he is having some fun and living up in his role. He is basically the main one going up against Kong and it is very cool seeing what feels like these two forces of nature going head to head and really Jackson is the only person I imagine playing this role. John C Reilly has a role here and I think when I watched the film before I didn't like him but now I thought he was a really entertaining part of the film and adds heart to the feeling of the film. Towards the last act he literally became the only person I cared about and wanted to see get off of the island and credit has to go to him for that. But the rest of the cast did very little for me, Brie Larson is similar to Hiddleston. She is an actor I like but her character offers very little and the two of them have very little chemistry together and again I think it is mostly the script which makes them feel like weak characters. John Goodman starts off okay, but the film basically forgets about him and he becomes more weird as a character and it feels like a missed opportunity to use his great acting talent. Also Toby Kebbell is a good actor who is totally wasted in this film and he literally could have been played by anybody and that is a clear waste.Story
The story has some good elements to it, the background and characterisation of Kong is really well handled and I did like the fact that the film managed to create this feeling of anyone could be taken out at any point which few films can do. But this film fails in making you care about the majority of the human characters and with this cast that is almost a crime and the film does suffer from that in a large way.Script
This is the weakest element of the film and for me really hinders the actors portrayal of the characters. None of them are given anything interesting about them and the script does nothing to make you care and even though there is a giant ape fighting creatures you still need human characters to care about when they are the main elements of the film.Style
Now onto the best part of the film, this film looks fantastic and has some awesome action sequences. The film does the right thing in not hiding Kong and has plenty of scenes with him throwing down with his fantastic look. The film is paced well and I was never bored which makes this part of the film at least a success.Overall
Overall, Kong: Skull Island is an average film. Everything to do with Kong is great it is just the human element of the film that holds it back and for me unless you are a big Kong fan this is worth a miss this time.Rating - 5/10.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

Bags of it in fact. It's effects and set pieces are gorgeous to look at for a start, and some of the monsters are very creative and even disturbing. On paper too the cast is very good for an action flick. But unfortunately 'Kong: Skull Island' tumbles off a cliff like a Dinosaur having a stroke.The film incorporates a lot of borrowed visuals, which in small amounts may be forgivable, but when its from films like 'Apocalypse Now' then Kong Skull Island only suffers by comparison.As regards characters, Bree Larson brings her usual smug and two dimensions to the screen, Samuel L Jackson his barking soldier routine and Tom Hiddleston tries his hand at tight pants macho posing. Hiddleston is the best by far, which says a lot when he did not even have to try hard. Any bit of furniture could out act the talent vacuum that is Larson. That is about the depth of the characters in this movie. Extras are picked off with an alarming ease not seen since early black and white Tarzan movies.This film is bubblegum, but it fails to justify its high budget and so wastes what are occasionally thoughtful and ingenious visuals. A 'watch one and delete' sort of movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

Sometimes, it's better to make once or max twice of the same character's story and let it be. If you make more, it doesn't turn out to be a movie anymore. It clearly looks like a competition of who's story, graphics, actors are better and we end up wasting time and money.The height of Kong, the way he walks make him look like a Bigfoot. Bigfoot(s) as the monster(s) on an unchartered Island would have made a better story. The graphics were more of the 90's. The storyline had so many goof ups that it was noticeable the very first time you see the movie. The 2005 King Kong movie, simply ""Wow"". IMDB agrees with me. This is what i would carry on as the story of King Kong and pray that another Kong movie is never made.It's watchable once or maybe not.Peace out!","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

Didn't they do that about ten years ago with very overlong mediocre results ? In other words it's not really a film I had any interest in seeing . That said my mind was quickly changed by the very good word of mouth , especially with all the references made to APOCALYPSE NOW and other 'Nam war films so gave it a chance I certainly wasn't disappointed with these references . In fact my one criticism of the early part of the movie is just how overdone the references are and you can't fail to notice them and the Doors soundtrack is conspicuous by its absence . Subtlety isn't a strength of this Hollywood blockbuster Where the strength lies is just how enjoyable it is as an action blockbuster full of explosions , gunfire and stunts . You remember in the Peter Jackson remake where the only good bit is the characters get attacked by assorted creepy crawlers in the gorge ? Well here director Jordan Vogt Roberts takes a leaf out of the highlight of the Jackson version and gives the audience what they're anticipating - a high body count featuring gory deaths . I was personally surprised by just how gory some of the deaths were in a 12 cert film and the screenplay isn't afraid to kill off characters If there's a downside to all this then it's down to the fact that no film can really compare to the 1933 original which perhaps still remains the greatest monster movie of all time , even after all these long decades . Regardless of that KONG SKULL ISLAND stands tall on its own hind-legsAnd Tom Hiddleston gets top billing ? He's a certainty for Bond isn't he ?","2 out of 14 found this helpful."

That ending however raises only below average expectations for the sequels.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The storm, flora and fauna, the green atmosphere, the petroleum absorbed surfaces, aurora borealis, the native people and their appearance, all were fantastic.

The film actually follows quite a few main characters but the film never gets over crowded. Everyone in the film does a spectacular job. I personally really enjoyed John C. Reilly's portrayal of his character and how his personal storyline progressed. The cinematography is truly beautiful in this film. The effects of the film are also very realistic and make the film very visually engaging. The helicopter sequence at the beginning of the film is a good example of this. Overall, I think this is a really good film that brings back the feel of the old adventure films of the past.

I'm open-minded about sequels and imagine that Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack (directors of the outstanding 1933 original) would have loved to have the technology that went into this film available to them, but for me, ultimately 'Kong: Skull Island' wasn't all that satisfying. Unfortunately, far more effort was put into the CGI, battle scenes, and setting itself up for sequels than there was in the script, creating what are more than one-dimensional characters, and giving those characters motivations that made sense. It's too bad that the creativity used to create cool monsters wasn't used to avoid plot holes and clichés. Taken in the right spirit or with the right people (e.g. friends who can laugh at the silliness or maybe a young teen), there is some entertainment value here, but one can't help but wish the film was a complete package.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

But this Kong film is a breath of fresh air, compared to the 2005 remake of the classic Kong from 1933. How was the film?I really enjoyed the film. Great CGI, along with great action, and set pieces. Only thing setting this apart from being much greater is the cinematography and characters(besides three of them).The cinematography doesn't do much to distinguish the size of the characters and the size of Kong. To many times you'll question the scope is uneven and is noticeable. And for the characters. Most of them are have no room to layer themselves in the plot. They're mostly your run of the mill, disaster team built squad of characters. Find the island, put together team, got to island, no connection but to survive, etc.But the best characters within the film is the WWII pilot portrayed by John C. Reilly(Hank Marlow), John Goodman(Bill Randa), and believe or not, Samuel L. Jackson(Preston Packard).John C. Reilly stills the show as the most lovable character. He is what glues the other characters together once he enters the scene. John Goodman, underutilized as he was, still makes good use of his screen time. And Sam Jackson portrays a really good broken captain in a battle between man and beastI recommend this film if your wanting to see an excitingly good monster flick. 8/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

A nice and simple plot as needed, for these classic movies of cinema serves pure simplicity and a pinch of madness. In my opinion this film decently inserts the character of Kong with many visually beautiful moments but I think they have to devote much more time to the conflicts and the real and beautiful beatings instead of creating many unnecessary stories between the characters, of which (though well characterized) I didn't give a damn about anything. The actors have convinced me enough seen also the great presences of Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson and Brie Larson, but also the others I liked, as an example John C. Reilly. I liked the direction a lot and it was clear and simple, while the photography is great and beautiful, there are times when my eyes shone. The setting is spectacular and the sound and music are good. A negative note of the film is perhaps the rhythm, a film a bit too long for the duration it could have, also because much of the initial part of the film could be disposed of. The CGI and the special effects are another 2 big points in favor, especially the CGI of Kong, crazy. The ending convinced me enough. Kong: Skull Island made me want to see the other Monsterverse movies. Recommended!.

At least it's not a direct re-make, but rather a sort of re-imagining. It has a good soundtrack - Stooges, Sabbath, Creedence, Bowie - and a few pretty good action/fight scenes. It's spends 30min introducing most of the characters and seeding a plot, but it seems pointless, since you hardly learn anyone's name. And as for the plot - not sure how it took three people to write this screenplay!There seem to be a lot of shots that were made just for the trailer - zooming into Kong's eyes; Kong in front of giant sun/moon (how can you see either setting, if there's a perpetual storm?); 12 helicopters flying into the storm/sun; Kong slow-mo chest thumping. Kong's obviously not the bad guy, but he's not the star either - probably with less than 30min screen time, as he fights giant lizards. I'm not sure if Packard (Jackson) or Conrad (Hiddleston) is either, since no-one's the hero or has that much to do. Larson is OK, Goodman's wasted, but Marlow (Reilly) saves the day with some almost-humour. At least some of it was filmed in Queensland, although you can tell the bits that were filmed in Hawaii, as it looks like 'Jurassic Park'!Of the three King Kong films I've seen (1933, 2005, 2017), this is probably my least favourite - they seem to be on a slowly-deteriorating scale. Also, what's up with Jackson's right eye near the end? It seems about 75% bigger than his left eye in a few shots! Anyway, predictable ending, nothing ventured, nothing gained. Hard to get too attached to Kong when we have such well-developed CGI characters in the current 'Planet of the Apes' series.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Cut off from everything they know, they venture into the domain of the mighty Kong, igniting the ultimate battle between man and nature. As their mission of discovery soon becomes one of survival, they must fight to escape from a primal world where humanity does not belong.This movie is dull, its lazy, it's poorly acted and written and lacks any real charm or true enjoyment value that excuses these flaws. While it does contain some interesting and inventive action, that small amount of satisfaction doesn't clean the slate of everything that came before it. You don't care about any of the characters and the movie just lacks a certain charm that makes it truly enjoyable. Vogt-Roberts does a decent job with the giant, climactic battle esc shots but fails at anything to do with talking or whatnot. Personally, I don't think you'll get your moneys worth with this movie and I can't see many people enjoying it that much. There is no real story here and anything even related to it is quickly pushed aside. The 'plot' was just an excuse to get 'big things' fighting but even that is kept at a bare minimum and could have been done better.Tom Hiddleston was FINE as James Conrad but you can tell he was phoning it in. Brie Larson was very weak as Mason Weaver and the man who is everything(Samuel L Jackon) was also really poor. Both of their characters didn't flow in one straight arc and neither of them really needed to exist. Both John C Reily and John Goodman were fine as John Marlow and Bill Randa respectively. The main issue with this movie is that none of the characters are likable and every attempt to make them appear human or relatable was so blatantly forced in. You may argue that this is KONG's movie but then why not make him the complete priority and not focus on any of the humans.Vogt-Roberts does a great job at shooting the huge scenes to do with Kong in this movie but fails drastically at any scenes that try to involve human emotion or contact or happiness. To this movie's credit, however, all the effects were pretty good(even if I feel they could have been a little more creative at points).This movie's main strength is the cool and inventive action. While this is well done, it's so short lived and the setup to it doesn't live up to the climax. I understand that it would probably get repetitive if the whole movie was just Kong fighting but they could have either added more or made the actual climax feel more powerful. Any and all attempts at humour in this movie backfired. This movie's primary directive would have been to properly introduce Kong to this Monster-verse and to younger audiences. I personally feel that it failed at this goal and could have been handled so much better and so much more creatively. On a side note, the final scene of this movie were John Goodman goes home is shot like it's genuine footage and if the text 'Based on a True Story' popped on screen at that moment in time, I would have gave this movie a perfect score because that would have been amazing.In conclusion, this movie is dull, the characters are boring and the climax doesn't live up to the hype set up by the movie. I don't feel like this movie is worth any money and is just not worth watching.4/10Wouldn't Recommend","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

The problem with this franchise has been the part with the humans .

Because it is a cinematic syphilis on steroids
 
And here is a list of main reasons for the negative labeling:
 
As for the positives: it had a big budget and you can tell it right away. And yes, it is entertaining to watch palm trees vs. helicopters combat, amplified by a slow down of a song; and yes, the final fight is also impressing. Aside from the graphical artifacts with colors in the 2D version and its issues with sharpness of image, the whole technical side of this movie is at the top. But that is the core problem with this one: that is has no core. It is just a shiny packaging with nothing inside but some explosions and fights mixed with some clichés and with only a tiny pinch of essence
 
And so, a king size pile of turd in a colorful wrapping paper deserves a 3/10. Although it is a comforting thought, that this reincarnation of King Kong only three months after its premiere has a mere 6.8 rating on the IMDb, while the previous one by Peter Jackson initially had 8.3 but it took a decade to bring it down to a more appropriate 7.2 grade.

It touches a bit on Kong's backstory and it really builds up to a whole new world of extraordinary things while keeping you entertained with action, humor and intrigue. Nothing feels forced.

There are at least 5 characters there that can be considered ""mainstream"" in the story, as it would be humanly possible to approach all the past (or whatever those people want) from them, and still feature Kong and the other monster on the Island without making it a Transformers movie? At less think about that, before starts hate the film (It's like Rogue One, the main character of the movie isn't a real character, but the whole universe that they live).Anyway, for me the movie focuses on what's really important. The characters are not empty bags just waiting to be killed, they just do not have their background stories explored, but you can see a chemistry between the group, a friendship between the soldiers, some sense of danger in the middle of it all. And above all, the story goes on in a line so straightforward and cool, with incredible action scenes, and others that simply fill your eyes with such beauty.The sense of adventure is also something very present there, and that accompanies the whole story and makes it an excellent experience. About the effects, only one or two scenes in the whole movie come to bother, and seem to laugh a little, in a way, other than that, the CGI is almost perfect.In short, Kong is an extremely entertaining film, which makes two hours look like 20 minutes, a story that plays its part in presenting the big gorilla again in theaters and being a flawless blockbuster, which easily serves as an excellent pastime.PS: I can't wait to see King Kong vs Godzilla!","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

The cinematography as a whole was great and there's some fantastic shots in the film. The best thing about this film is that it knows what it is, it's a big dumb monster film and it excels at being that. The dialogue is shockingly bad for most of the film and the acting is sub-standard so if you're going into this film expecting anything more than giant monsters fighting each other then you should probably go elsewhere. The action is great and there's some inventive camera shots. Even though I have said the acting is poor the film still has a great cast. The two problems I have with this movie is it lacked any kind of suspense leading up to Kong's reveal and I also thought it ended abruptly. I thought the soundtrack was great too. There's also an after credits scene which is worth staying for too. Overall I would recommend this as it's exactly what it says on the tin, big dumb fun with giant monsters that you can just switch off for 2 hours and enjoy.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

Skull Island promised to up the ante and go 'big' with this new and scaled up Kong but the results really isn't that good at all. There was perhaps only 2 scenes in which we get big fights of Kong, which were really good yet as I said 2 only, most of the time the film just attempts to build suspense by not revealing where Kong is 'hiding' which really doesn't make much sense because he is a gigantic gorilla on this one tiny island. Although most the acting is uninspiring and the characters were generic and predictable, Samuel L Jackson was probably the saving grace of this film playing a relatively interesting and unique character unlike the rest, likes of Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston, a rather shame by the sound of these names. This film felt lacking both in character development and in fun, large scale monster battles and seems rather like a build up solely for the purpose of pitting Kong against Godzilla in the upcoming feature film. Not much attention was given to this film but for what it's worth this film was simply mediocre and just fine.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

First of all; Brie Larson didn't need to be there, other than to show sympathy and empathy for Kong. She plays a photographer, who will not be able to publish her photos, because it's a top-secret government mission and also John Goodman's character (who only speaks exposition throughout the film), has a camera, so she wasn't needed, AT ALL.The directorial choices are SO WEIRD it hurts. One time they show a guy getting dropped into Kong's mouth and then stupidly cut to a guy eating a sandwich and then later show a guy actually get eaten. Those weird ""camera on top of a gun""-scenes are so unnecessary.The characters were very clichéd and their choices were idiotic. Shea Whigham's character's proposed ""sacrifice/Come and get me""- scene is stupid in an another level.Samuel L. Jackson's character I kind of understand (he doesn't want to think the war is lost and that they conceded and he wants to prove himself) but his scenes are ridiculous and he seems typecast (I mean he says ""Hold to your butts"" in one scene. Just. No.)Tom Hiddleston and others are just there and Hiddleston is their leader. (That's about it. The Japanese character barely has any lines and I can't remember what was her role, I guess she was Corey Hawkins' assistant oslt and all the others are just stereotypes)John C. Reilly is probably the most compelling character in the film and literally only who has an arc (Younger version of his character is shown landing to the island in flashbacks) but when he leaves the tribe, he's lived for nearly 30 years, it's literally just; ""Well, I guess this is goodbye... Bye!"" That was pretty... well stupid and bland. I mean, the last scene of the film (not counting the after- credit scene) is Reilly returning to his family and having a hot dog, BECAUSE THAT HAD MORE DEVELOPMENT THAN Oscar WINNER BRIE LARSON AND TOM HIDDLESTON!The good stuff (I guess) is the special effects and motion capture for Kong (though the constant size changes are hair-ripping, I mean that Kong's hand in the mountain in one scene is as big as half of Kong in all the other scenes), that one scene at the tribe where they visually show Kong's story via paintings, the gory stuff was cool also (although it makes the tone feel more messy, which is annoying, but I respect the studio for having balls by making this PG-13 rated blockbuster be this graphic) + the fight scenes with Kong and monsters were okay and the designs for them were good.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."
"8","/10","Stunning thrills and chills. A modern Hollywood A film done in the vein of the classic B-movie monster flicks of the past.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3781292/?ref_=tt_urv","dgluth","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur51344480/?ref_=tt_urv","15 August 2017","I'll start by saying I feel compelled to leave my opinion on this film here because of all the overwhelmingly negative reviews pasted to this site. I genuinely believe the majority of these film-goers did not watch this film with proper expectations. How you can be disappointed with this movie boggles the mind. Perhaps I connected with the film due to my childhood love for monster movies, having grown up on renting Godzilla, Gamera, King Kong, and other VHSes. At its core Kong:Skull Island is a classic B-movie monster flick. We have a cast of colorful characters marooned on an island of deadly beasts. What follows the brief setup of why they're there is a good- time monster romp full of non-stop action and gorgeous visuals. Its a bloody good time, pg-13 violence aside.The setup is pretty cool, giving us the origins of a monster-hunting agency out to find Kaiju after reports flood in of mysterious run- ins with legendary beasts. Goodman is as always spot-on, if a bit under-utilized, as the enigmatic leader of Monarch. He syncs up with Samuel L. Jackson, who does a dazzling job as the leader of his ragtag group of Vietnam vets. The group of soldiers all do great in their own right, but their inevitable deaths are never felt by the audience because we all know they're really there to be monster- fodder. Hiddleston and Larson are passable as the dynamic, handsome leading couple (of sorts, they never spark much of an on screen connection and the movie bypasses any stereotypical love plot) but are honestly never given much to do. Larson in particular is used poorly, and isn't given much of a chance to shine in the boy's club of a cast. This aside, the absolute standout of the cast is John C. Reilly. He seems to truly be at home and having a blast playing a WW2 pilot who crash-landed on the island and has been stranded there for 30 years. Reilly is at once comic relief and exposition, giving his experience on the island to other characters and helping explain the environment they are as well stranded in. The jokes are great and never fall flat. As soon as the cast arrives on the island, things kick into immediate overdrive. Kong shows up very quickly and causes all sorts of hell for the helicopter squadron. From there, it's non-stop thrills and chills as the team is split up and taken out one-by-one. The visuals are spectacular, from the special effects to the cinematography. A lot of care went into this production and the results absolutely shine. Its a gorgeous film, with endless eye candy. Now before you think I'm judging this film on just its style over its substance, I believe it handled the concept of Kong in an new and refreshing way. The monsters inhabiting the island are reminiscent of the pre-historic world themes the original classic utilized, but remain fresh in their design. The ""Skull Crawlers"" are stand-out monster villains and are given a creepy and cool design that puts them above the pack of average CGI monsters. The background is rife with detail, particularly in the village of the local residents of Skull Island. They live in the burnt out wreckage of ships that have run-aground on the isle and the design of the village is very interesting. The film also runs with the theme that 2014's Godzilla had (which now is a shared cinematic universe with Kong, call me excited), in that Kong is a great equalizer. He exists to ensure that other creatures like the Skull Crawlers don't take over the habitat of the island. I think this adds a regal nature to his character and elevates him above his ""misunderstood beast"" persona that has been explored in the three previous renditions of Kong. That leaves me with my final praise for the film, Kong himself. He's never looked better, and his size adds a formidable power that a smaller Kong lacks. You could argue this removes any subtlety to the character, but if you were paying attention you'd see I enjoy this film for its loud, proud presentation of a classic character. Kong:Skull Island is a good time that doesn't require a lot of thought, nor does it ever ask that much from you. If you can appreciate b- movie cinema, give this one an absolute look. It's an absolute blast.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Later I saw the original and the second Kaiju film I saw in theaters was Pacific Rim and well you know what was third. After the success of Godzilla 2014 it seems that legendary pictures decided to go ahead and bring the second cinematic universe in film history the monsterverse. In this new iteration of Kong, Bill Randa of Monarch is given the go-ahead to go to Skull Island with a military escort. When they get there however they drop bombs unleashing monsters that killed Kong's family. Kong trashes the planes and destroys most of Colonel Packards men. James Conard teams up with Mason Weaver and a few others who crashed near them and learn about the island and Kong with the help of Hank Marlow who's been stuck on Skull Island since 1944. When they meet up with Colonel Packard and a few of his men they go searching for Jack but with the Skullcrawlers on the surface now it's up to Kong to protect them. This classical b-movie monster goodness. A major complaint fans had with the 2014 Godzilla was that they kept cutting the fights off and he was barley in the movie. You have nothing to worry about here folks when Kong's on screen, he's on screen and it's awesome! People complained that the human characters weren't that interesting but then again they're not boring so... yeah. The actors were great too. There were some silly moments like when Kong's about to eat someone and then it cuts to a guy eating a sandwich. The world of Skull Island is just incredible it was very cool that they shot on location and then in studio for the monster effects. This is by far my favorite iteration of Kong, it was great fun fantastical romp that was classic b-movie monster goodness with epic fights, decent acting and nice shots of the beautiful locations. I'm giving Kong: Skull Island a five out of five.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

I am not sure a remake of a giant monkey movie can ever be successful but this movie does its best to bring out the worst.

JacksonIt is the age of cinematic universes – collecting individual properties under franchise umbrellas is practically commonplace. We can now anticipate the likes of Godzilla and King Kong clashing in cinemas for our enjoyment. That already happened? In 1962, you say?Ahem. Dubbed the ""MonsterVerse"" by Legendary Pictures, giant monsters resurface from some unspecified primordial age to stomp and munch on humans, and otherwise make a mess of civilization. Three years following 2014's Hollywood rendition of Godzilla comes Kong: Skull Island. A journey through jungles, testing camaraderie, pitting man (and woman) against nature. Think of it as Jurassic Park meets Apocalypse Now. Minus the profundity of Copolla's film. And with less notable characters than the one with dinosaurs. Well, I tried.The Vietnam War is the backdrop here, complete with not one but two Credence Clearwater Revival songs. A soldier platoon is commissioned to safeguard a small team of scientists on a mission to chart a newly discovered island. Skull Island, they call it. You already knew that. Additionally, a no-nonsense tracker and an anti-war photojournalist are recruited for their expertise. They beset upon the island aboard an aircraft carrier, then proceed through a perpetually raging storm – wait, I'm sure this flock of helicopters couldn't possibly have fit on deck...All the more humans to die horribly for our enjoyment, I suppose.Before long, Kong is spectacularly revealed, which will surely persist as one of the most memorable events from the movie. A colossus of manlike shape blotting out the setting sun, Kong swats down the helicopters with effortless brutality. Watching the metal crumble in his hands just might bring a devilish grin to your face.The visual effects are vaguely cartoonish. Bold saturated colors and some blatant use of green screen. Once I became accustomed to it I appreciated the stylization. It's a preferable aesthetic when compared to the drab, washed out look typically seen in modern blockbusters. In fact, I'd say it's in harmonious marriage with the breakneck tonal shifts of the film.Now stranded on the island, as consequence of Kong's wrath, the fractured group must make it to a far off evacuation site if they want any hope of survival. The island proves far more treacherous than they could have foreseen. Over-sized insects and reptiles pluck their lives away like delicate petals.The monsters are varied and many. Things that fly and swarm. That lumber, docile. Or pursue hungrily. You will witness Kong grapple a giant octopus and pummel scaly, skull faced creatures. If you came looking for monster action then rest assured this aspect of the film is faultless. It's a consistently thrilling showcase of kaiju combat. The climactic battle, in particular, made me feel like a giddy child smashing action figures against each other. I mean that in the most positive sense.The human side of the film is not as arresting. Characterization is mostly obvious and familiar. It's certainly a better than average effort but I never found myself particularly invested. The characters are, at the very least, defined. And juggling this many, that's more of a compliment than it sounds. Note that none of them escape the shadow of Kong, who is an ever imposing figure.The actors play their parts accordingly, but some are sadly underutilized (John Goodman for example). The standouts being Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly. The character of Packard and his downward spiral are excellently captured by Jackson's biting temperament.What could easily slip into melodrama is often countered by humor. Many jokes miss their target, however. Nothing truly unforgivable, except maybe when a certain character labels the craft he's riding in a ""ploat."" It's a boat made out of plane scrap. Yup.On the topic of humor, I had my concerns for John C. Reilly's role based off trailers. I predicted nothing more than one-note comic relief, but was pleasantly proved wrong. He quickly became the most endearing of the bunch. A man stranded on the island after an ill- fated dogfight during the heat of World War II. The years of unhealthy encounters with the island's monstrous inhabitants, the distance from the civilization he most understood, and prolonged contact with the unsociable natives, turned him more than a little odd. At times a man of congeniality, at others a man of dubious quality. Some times even adorable.Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts presents his diverse influences, sprinkling in tasteful homages to Neon Genesis Evangelion and Metal Gear (among others). Expect nods to the original King Kong as well, including the big ape liberating himself from chains and the requisite ""beauty and the beast"" moment.For a movie absolutely stuffed to capacity, that it withstands its own weight is a wonder. Driven by a director with clear passion, Kong: Skull Island is seductive; a ceaseless cataclysm of monster action. Unless you have a predisposed affection for giant monsters there's a good chance you'll be unfulfilled by this offering. Otherwise, what you get is a fearless tribute to Kong and his ilk.Verdict: Moderately High RecommendationFor more reviews check out http://unsleepinghorror.com/","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Tom Hiddleston plays the main character who is pretty bland unfortunately as is John Goodman's role in the flick. really if you have seen a modern American monster movie then you have seen these two characters over and over again to the point that it really isn't the enjoyable portion of the movie. Really I can say the same for Sam Jackson's role in the movie but since it is Sam Jackson in the role he automatically makes the role more enjoyable than it has much of a right to be. Really the only really interesting character is that of John C. Rielly who is the focus of the easily best scenes of the movie which makes the movie much more enjoyable to watch.But you didn't come to this movie for characters did you? You came for a monster and for a monster fight didn't you? Well lucky for you the special effects are actually really good. better than I thought a movie like this would actually have. The fights themselves are decent enough but they feel like they kind of come out of nowhere with very little build up from the film. Really I'm not convinced that I want to recommend because if you want to watch a good modern monster fight then there's Pacific Rim, if you wanted a monster flick with better character there's Monster, and really if you want a better King Kong movie there's the original so I really couldn't recommend this as freely as I feel I should be able to.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

It's just lame.This depiction of another adventure for King Kong, involving modern day military and civilians, along with a WWII castaway, has many problems, but it boils down to two main ones that affect any possible enjoyment of this action adventure.First, there is not one piece of credible motivation other than some running from monsters. Not one character is believable, particularly the one played by Samuel Jackson. For the actors, this has to be a huge embarrassment.Fans will claim it's meant to be just dumb fun, but it isn't ""fun"" when it alienates the viewer the way this movie does. The ""likable"" character has to be from Chicago, which is just another of the three big cities (the other two being NYC and LA) that alienate everyone else. There has never been a likable character from the three cities of self righteous superiority complex beings, and only the geeks keep them in power.Aside from a few bits of running and fear, nothing is credible. And so there is nothing any person can relate to.Which leads to the second problem. The movie abounds with the usual ho hum overuse of action shots that just deaden the air. The people who make this ignorance and the people who enjoy it are apparently the people who try to eat an entire wedding cake in one bite. Aside from those people, this movie alienates everyone else.The problem is obviously that it is maintained first by ""storyboard"" first, with story second. This failure is the result of that philosophy. There is no inspiration, which leads to no credible character motivation. Best example is the ""storyboard"" depiction of Sam Jackson glaring at carnage. It looks more like a comic book artist at work, not an inspired writer. People whose hands can make pictures don't necessarily have inspiration, as we see here. It's just goofy poses for pre-first grade thinking.The movie doesn't stink. It just doesn't do anything special. It's a waste.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

Sure, I love a good character arch, plot devices, morals, meanings and twists but I also go to the movies to be entertained! Amazingly though, this movie does convey heart as well as humour (however dark it may be.) The movie is visually stunning and takes you on an epic adventure with really cool creatures and landscapes added in to, really convey what a different world this island is. It also manages to change our perceptions of certain characters and plot lines as well as subverting certain character archetypes. As well as great performances by all the main and side characters, in that they all had their own little idiosyncrasies and we even get small bits of back story for side characters, so they don't feel like random cannon fodder to be thrown to the monsters. Saying this, it is a great movie on it's own but manages to craftily put in clues and hints that, once put in conjunction with the post-credits scene does a great job of succinctly making it an addition and one of the building blocks of the Monsters Universe. As I said though, while this movie does provoke some thought and hit you a little in the feels, it isn't a deep, meaningful exploration of the human psyche, nor is it asking any eternal man vs. beast questions but not every movie has too! It is purely for entertainment purposes and like any good action adventure movie, it'll get your heart pounding and adrenaline up while taking you on a crazy journey.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

The non feasibility of the action completely ruins it for any thinking person. There are like a dozen or more helicopters and every one of the pilots does not understand the simple concept of flying up out of the reach of a giant gorilla and going the other way. On the contrary, many of them fly right towards it. Not 5 minutes pass and something else implausible happens (like a spider sticking its leg through a man's mouth and impaling him. Then they try to tell us that a tribe of humans have been living in such a hostile environment for more than 28 years? That is just too implausible. Also when Kong was fighting the squid a piece of the squid flies off towards the camera and travels about 1000 feet in one second. That is nearly the speed of sound. Kong has a cut on his arm, but this is a creature that swats helicopters out of the air without getting cuts on his hands. Samuel Jackson says ""these men did not die in vain"", but they all clearly did. What an incredibly bad movie that could have been good considering the budget and the great cast. This is one of the biggest wastes ever. I am not willing to suspend disbelief as much as this garbage is asking us to.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

And not the standard sequel that would normally follow the island chapter of King Kong. Overall, this Kong is the same formula as all the Kongs, with only cosmetic changes in motivations, Villagers, visitors, beastly antagonists, island, the same large monkey. There were tweaks, with a military aspect on the island, as well as a castaway, that helped to broaden its framework. Ever sine 76, we have had Kong remakes that have accelerated and condensed into smaller and smaller time frames between Kongs. I don't get this. Is Hollywood really that stupid? Maybe. But this time, there is at least a hope for something different in the future. If you keep remaking the wheel, its going to go flat eventually. If what I see is true, then there are possibilities here. The acting was good as you would expect from a block-buster. Huddleston was good, as was Larson and Jackson. and Goodman was as good as he usually is, this time with less to flesh out his character as well. The flick is worth the watch. Lets hope the sequels don't disappoint.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Well, I can't say it was a disappointment, because I really wasn't expecting very much at all and to be fair, it lived up to expectations. It's not how much you spend on CGI that matters, but rather how you use them (or overuse them in this case). This was a sanitised Kong. It always felt like a CGI creation - there was nothing animalistic about it, ever. It wasn't terrifying or menacing. It was introduced too early in the film without any real build up. This severely lessened it's impact. And what about Tom Hiddlestone? he was like an action figure, he seemed completely out-of-place. I don't think a grain of dust, bead of sweat or splash of water so much as graced him till the last 5 minutes. Prior to that, he could have been replaced by a wooden-top, Ken-doll or some other inanimate object and I wouldn't have noticed. The story is pointless and contrived - it's only purpose is to tie together the series of big CGI action sequences. Don't go in with high expectations and you won't be disappointed.

I watched the next sequel out of order. King of the Monsters was worse in nearly every way, but I watched it to the end and was like meh.I finally got around to Kong Skull Island. I guess they decided to show the monster at every opportunity because that's what we got. The opening plot contrivance with the helicopters contributing to fly into Kong was incredibly stupid. Worse than the helicopters in 1998 Godzilla, and that's saying a lot. Unfortunately, here, that is the plot of the film and sets the story in mountain. It never recovers. The characters were so stereotypical and paper-thin they made King of The Monster characters look deep. There was good talent in the film, but if this is all you'd seen them in, you'd never for looking for another of their films. Peter Jackson's Kong, although an hour longer, was better in every other way. This movie didn't know what it was trying to be. I guess Apocalypse Now / Heart of Darkness by some of its imagery. And two of the roles are named Conrad and Marlow...how profound.Seriously, skip this one. They make every mistake. It's not scary but I think they tried to be. Then at other times they act like it's a comedy. Half the roles have no purpose. With the opening, there's was the potential to be something interesting and inspiring. The film never latches onto this.Finally, yes the effects are good. But they're good in so many other better films, as the aforementioned Jackson's King Kong. And did I mention how much I hated the characters and their ridiculous shifts for plot reasons?This should have been at least decent. It was horrible, and it must have taken a lot of work to make it so horrible. Directing, writing, acting in particular are abysmal. Avoid at all costs. I'm now hesitant to watch Godzilla vs. Kong, but at least that has a different director and cast.(This director gave an interview adamantly defending this junk, in which he said people just want to see Kong throw trees into helicopters. Well, yes, maybe, but they also want to see some things called plot and characterization. Ugh.)","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

"5","/10","Mindless entertainment that takes itself too seriously","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3739101/?ref_=tt_urv","ginocox-206-336968","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57751100/?ref_=tt_urv","25 June 2017","""Kong: Skull Island"" can't seem to decide whether it wants to be an action/adventure, an anti-war/anti-establishment political statement, a paean to preceding King Kong films with occasional nods to other movies, or an integral component of a franchise about very large monsters. Unfortunately, the film often fails to find a suitable balance between these competing objectives, to the detriment of the story. For example, the camera used by Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) is prominently shown in quite a few shots. It looks quite sophisticated, with the chrome and glass rangefinder over the lens – unless one knows anything about cameras and photography, in which case you might wonder why she is using a rangefinder with such a slow lens in museum condition that obviously hasn't been knocked around in the jungles of Viet Nam. Turns out, the camera is a Leica M2, a moderately priced consumer model introduced in 1952 – not a camera a war photographer or even an anti-war photographer would have been likely to use twenty years later. The lens is F/3.5, which means it captures less than half as much light (relative to the size of the medium) as an iPhone 5. If you've ever tried to take a picture with your cell phone at night or in a dark restaurant without flash, your pictures were probably as intelligible as her nighttime shots. Why the M2, instead of the then current M5 or a Nikon F2? Probably because it looks cool and unusual and nobody bothered to wonder what type of camera a professional photographer would have chosen. Or maybe they wanted her to look more like a female Everyman than a war correspondent. Similarly, the sidearm used by Preston (Samuel L. Jackson) is a consumer model Colt M1902 which was never adopted by the army. There are dozens of other anachronisms, including Weaver's film. In an early aerial battle scene, Kong snatches and knocks helicopters out of the air. Kong reportedly stands 104 feet tall. Helicopters ordinarily fly at 1,000 feet above whatever is below them. I've never studied aerial combat, but I think that if I were fighting a big ape, that I would fly high enough that it couldn't reach up and grab me out of the sky. Early shots show six helicopters on the deck of the Athena. Two more are in a cargo bay, but their rotors are collapsed and it would probably take quite a while to prepare them for flight. But when they fly to Skull Island, there are an unlucky thirteen helicopters in flight formation. Why so many helicopters? First, so the director can get a shot that's evocative of a similar shot in ""Apocalypse Now."" Second, to have more carnage in the ensuing battle scene. Third, to have enough survivors (red shirts) for ensuing fight scenes. But this creates a number of problems with the script. The obvious lack of continuity shatters the audience's willful suspension of disbelief. The failure of thirteen experienced pilots, who survived countless combat missions in Viet Nam under Preston's no-nonsense command, to figure out that maybe they shouldn't be flying so close to the ground makes them and Preston seem inept. Preston doesn't have a good motive to pursue Kong. His job is to protect the geological team. Kong is a force of nature. Preston's vendetta seems a bit like attacking a tornado because it killed your family. Ultimately, he must decide between mindless pursuit of Kong and fulfilling his mission. He's depicted as possibly demented, possibly as an allegory for America's involvement in Viet Nam, but it weakens the dramatic argument. The opposing viewpoint doesn't seem strong, as it doesn't need to overcome a compelling argument. Later, they stop and say something like: We've got only twelve hours to get from point A to point B, a distance that would ordinarily take twenty hours to travel even without the unfamiliar terrain and fearsome creatures trying to eat us, so we don't have a second to spare, but before we go, let's take time to discuss ethics, ecology and the lessons of the Nuremberg trials. By this time, the characters lack credibility, so their discussion seems sophomoric. The movie makes numerous political statements about warfare, self-determination, xenophobia, private property – a veritable smörgåsbord of liberal political concepts. It's critical of America's efforts to impose its political ideology on other nations. And yet, Kong could be viewed in an analogous role, imposing his rule to repress the skull crawlers and support the indigenous people. At one point, a character states, ""If you take away a species's natural competition, they'll proliferate out of control."" This was probably a reference to ecological diversity, but my first thought was of Syria (Skull Island), where deposing Gaddafi (Kong) resulted in a proliferation of Daesh (skull crawlers) and large casualties among refugees, but also large numbers spilling over borders. The movie has many excellent elements. Exotic locations, a talented cast, awesome cinematography, convincing styling, costumes & props (although numerous anachronisms detract). The shots are refreshingly steady with an absence of those annoying jiggly-cam shots. It would excel as mindless entertainment if it didn't take itself so seriously or if it showed enough respect for the audience to take them seriously when presenting its political messages.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

So in the film, a group of scientists and soldiers go to skull island in the chances of mapping out the uncharted island and this leads them to a grand island of exotic and fantastical wildlife the king of which is Kong, the iconic gargantuan gorilla who we all grew up with. And when the group comes to the island, as you say in the trailer, destruction, Kong throwing down and most of what you'd expect from a monster movie of today. The build up to this film was rather well anticipated with fairly interesting trailers and marketing especially the poster which I must say, I love. I was interested in this movie and the potential to create a fun universe was possible. But I'm rather upset to say that, for me, the film didn't really deliver what I expected. While there are some fun and entertaining scenes in this film, I was ultimately let down with the film. As we all expected, Kong throwing down in the film was going to be great and this film does deliver on those scenes and they are great. Kong is such a badass classic monster and it's so great to see him back on the big screen again.The setting and design of Skull Island is awesome too. Although, the aspects that bring the film down are, to begin with, the characters. The vast majority of the characters in the film are very uninteresting and have next to no shred of backstory or motivation. Tom Hiddleston's, James Conrad is there to be their guide and he only really receives one small scene in which he expresses a moment of his past and it's so brief and aren't impactful. All other scenes, his character is just a guy who's really good at tracking and can occasionally take on winged creatures with a katana, as you saw in the trailer. John Goodmans character also is barely given anything except one short line about his backstory and that's it. Same with Brie Larson who also is given near nothing. The best character in the film is John C Reilly as someone who crash landed on the island many decades before and at least his character had some interest and some okay humour but still isn't a great character. Furthermore, the editing of the film is very choppy and is very conflicting with itself. For example, for many of Kong's fight sequences, the transitions are smooth and also well filmed in large wide shots, but then the action sequences with the human characters adapts to a 300 style fast to slow motion style which felt extremely off putting and not effective at all. The film also, during the first act , to be specific, quickly rushes through to give us the characters without the needed development they needed to get them straight to the island and for kong to get on screen. Also, a lot of the shots where characters are in frame with kong in the background have incredibly noticeable green screen that appeared very dated despite the okay CGI with the creatures. So in conclusion, Kong was a rather disappointing remake for me. There are definitely positive aspects to the movie and the moments with Kong are great but due to the poor characters and conflicted editing, I must say that the film was only slightly above average for me and i'm gonna give Kong: Skull Island a...6/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

And the cinematic universe-supported by Godzilla, King Kong and other legendary monsters-has been opened, and what way to start, my God!The titanic anthropoid made history by climbing the Empire State Building by the hand of Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack in 1933—a period in which the Great Depression, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party braising their ominous horrors—and returned in two opportunities more to steal the show: the first one was in 1976, directed by John Guillermin; and the second one, about seventeen years ago, thanks to Peter Jackson, a filmmaker who did well by bringing back (in part) gigantic mammal's dignity with such super production, which was returning to its roots and resumed the reinvention of Disney fundamental work ""Beauty and The Beast"", it interpreted as ""Beauty and The Monster"". This year, the most acclaimed movie monster (which shares glory with Godzilla) comes back with the financial aid of Warner Bros. and Legendary, in a story must not be weighted as reboot, remake or sequel, quite the contrary, it approaches to area prequels based on 2005 blockbuster, since it's situated in the 1970s, with the Vietam War as a backdrop, and the Skull Island as a unique setting for unwinding sensational action, with no need for reinterpreting for the nth time the melodrama starring by Fay Wray at that time; aspect which is replaced fully by the violent silhouette of an animal embedded in an orange sunset. Tangible entertainment and human beings predilection to think that nature belongs to them, merge into the pleasures of a voracious struggle of man Vs natureCertainly, King Kong is the legitimate star, however, because of the atmosphere in where the film is placed, he'll have to share the limelight with visually terrifying superb beings, which straight out of the pages of ""The Lost World"" by Arthur Conan Doyle: modernized pterodactyls, huge cephalopods, irate arachnids and bipedal reptiles of disproportionate scale compone the majestic venerable natural panorama (Vietnam and Hawaii) and model on the screen at once, offering a strong battle coprotagonized by the unwary human characters. They come as explorers, an expedition upheld by Randa (John Goodman), an insatiable researcher who yearns to validate his theory about mythological creatures. A guide (Tom Hiddleston), a war photographer (Brie Larson), and a squad of ex-combatants from Vietnam, captained by disheartening lieutenant colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) will be compelled to initiate a field fight for survival, another war, only this time the opponent isn't something of their kind.It's a tremendous feat what Warner has forged for all fans of kaiju- eiga and overall mass. ""Skull Island"" is the unreservedly uprising to B movies, which, here, has a case of mega-production. GRANDILOQUENT, this is the exact concept to define fiction adventure-action film; each of its technical aspects is unspeakable, accurate for a tenacious spectator who delights with an irresistible comfit containing low in calories in its script, disproportion replaced by the aesthetic glucose portion that many other pre-summer movies only dream of. It's a fruition and a preeminent advancement for CGI used in films like these ones; undergo trepidation, fun, adrenaline, dismay, the blood, the paradises, live and direct shuddering and hand-to-hand conflagrations by such technological resource, it'll astound audience, where two- hour run-time passes at the speed of light since we spend the time venerating, literally, marvelous photography of Larry Fong.hits compilation of yesteryear by Henry Jackman, formidable production work of Stefan Dechant and laborious activity in the editing room coordinated by Richard Pearson; all technical elements have to be exalted into any film competition, it's undeniable.The film runs with a most peculiar kind of narrative balance, that in essence, is both strong and weak point. From appreciable courtesies to Francis Ford Coppola's classic (""Apocalypse Now"") to remembrances with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" directed by Steven Spielberg due to design molds for Hiddleston's character. Performances, in part, are well made, however, the privations of the story-line are the biggest hindrances faced by the actors and story. Don't expect neither ontological dialogs nor outstanding twists in the varied narrative arches and poorly scanned sub-plots, you must be mentally prepared to enjoy sensational long takes; any script contrariety is vague at the instant a beast warns its arrival. It's an anthological cast, deplorably, of all the ethnic ranges present in the movie, not more than two people are memorable: ironic and tyrannical Samuel L. Jackson, in a role of a lieutenant who defends fiercely, his ideology:""man is king"" and the comical counterpart, John C. Reilly, who'll have a few functional lines. While poor motivations in its development are unambiguous, they reach to peek a critique in defense of nature and animals and a subliminal antiwar revolution, nevertheless, these are only inwardly observable.Jordan Vogt-Roberts has manufactured a collage of luxurious and pompous action-adventure sequences with his second work, it links you with the mammal monster from the very first moment, because of its rare avis technical conceptions. This time, the filmmaker has really carved out his path with such mega-production, and we must keep an eye on him since his film-making fashion coincides with audience's predilections and between ourselves, with considerable fragments of my idealized filming style. In the breathless beginning, the motion picture shows signs of what we are about to witness, a mosaic of sublime frames guided by a fierce timing, which is impaired by the meager development containing the plots of characters. If ""Skull Island"" is the preliminary film that opens MonsterVerse of Warner Bros., I don't even sketch how a Godzilla sequel (""King of Monsters"") or mega-event between King Kong and Godzilla-homologous Marvel's ""Civil War""-will be like. Roberts' King Kong is directly proportional to the visual and aesthetic impressions, however, manifests imbalance with regard to script barriers. High-octane entertainment, where monsters are kings and humans are harmless preys.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

There were segments without any monsters that felt like a bit of a step down, but they didn't last especially long.I understand the characters were flat enough to fit under a door (maybe with the exception of John C.

This is, by far, the best King Kong movie ever. The Island is perpetually surrounded by very fierce storms and when you see the storms from the approaching ship that house the helicopters to ferry everyone to the Island, you won't believe people would actually decide to go thru this kind of vicious storm. Cringing from my couch I couldn't believe it either. (Hey, it's only a movie) It doesn't take long for Kong to make his presence known. And it doesn't take long to discover the real reason Bill Randa wanted to go back to this island. He knows what is there. We get to meet Lt Hank Marlowe (John C. Reilly) who was shot down during WWII. The movie opens with a Japanese and American parachuting from their shot-up planes confronting each other ready to kill but are interrupted by King Kong. We see that Marlowe has lived among the natives there who fear the giant lizards (among other things) who live beneath the Earth. King Kong protects the natives from the Lizards. The military led by Colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) wants to kill Kong for what he (Kong) unleased on Packard's men flying in with their helicopters. Those scenes are simply breathtaking and you will come to believe you are there. Scary? Yes. The CGI is so spectacular there are no words to do it justice. Kudos! Kudos! Kudos! The photography and cinematography are also spectacular. More Kudos. Acting all around is very good too. Brie Larson as Mason Weaver is an ""antiwar"" photographer (her words) and she constantly takes pictures. I was amazed she never ran out of film using something like an Argus C3 or C4 but with an added viewer. (Hey, it's a movie and like a dream anything is possible so there is no running out of film or anything )The group encounters giant spiders, and lizards who look upon the group as food. Once the group knows the real reason Bill Randa wanted to go to this island, the focus now is on getting off the Island. The rest of the movie has the group facing other lizards and trying to get to the North part of the Island where helicopters will ferry them to the ship. The last big dramatic scene has King Kong fighting the very BIG Lizard. Again, these scenes are so good you believe they are truly real. More Kudos. Okay, okay we all remember Fay Wray with King Kong in another Kong movie. Do we think we will see this Kong protect our limitless film photographer Mason Weaver? Stay tuned.And stay tuned after the credits run as there is more movie to see. I couldn't believe all the people involved in making this movie and you won't either. But stay and see the last scenes to the movie and here you will come to believe there will be a Kong 2. Can't wait. (9/10)Violence: Yes, Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Brief soft stuff only. Should small children watch? Only if you think they can handle it. Sometimes frightening and scary as I can attest to it being so. Hey, I cringed and jumped at times.

Kong Skull Island, directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts returns for a new project with one of the writers being a writer and director of my favorite films of 2014, Dan Gilroy. The first impression to deliver is this movie is a pile of mess that keeps on building and lowers the film. As the film begins, we are introduced to two scientists proving ancient species exist on an island, while excusing to map the geography of the island. We meet James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), a formal weapons dealer, and that is only what it has to offer. Additionally, we see Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) as for the most majority an uninteresting and unrelatable antagonist. There is no short description of their biography illustrated and flashed out that might be fascinating at least. Due to, a poorly written script and unprofessionally executed characters with no excess of heart, which just felt like attractive humans who could run in slow motion. The vast majority of the cast are just expendables bodies for large, CGI created monsters to toy with. Positive note, Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), is the best aspect that can elevate this film to a higher position with a rather interesting backstory and an excess of little heart we stood up for. We go into for a purpose, the purpose being able to see gigantic CGI monster crashing up with each other. Like as the anticipation, it does offer exhilarating eye candy visuals, consistently solid acting, a fast paced and intriguing deployment of the story, and the most important exhilarating, fascinating, and huge frenetic monsters that can satisfy some. All cast-ed monsters look promisingly amazing and flawless, adding more 'fun' and thrills for an adventure roller coaster ride. It keeps the audiences intrigued for certain monster battles and clashes processed with CGI. While it may satisfy some for just mindlessly watchable CGI monster film, but the whole affair can't escape a hugely hollow feeling after the ending credits roll. Also, it detracts from other successful films, elevating the film's originality to the bottom as it builds more disappointments. Overall, this film offers cool visuals with big CGI monsters for few moments, but the majority focuses on the human aspect which is a mess and a hollow that will keep most film buffs let down as the end credits begin.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

It features a fair amount of action sequences and unfortunately not so much interesting stuff in it. The story, characters, acting and music are the weakest aspects, that hurts the film and drags the score down for me. The positives can still be found very easily, but of course they can be considered also as negatives at the same time. John C. Reilly is the only one, who gives a good performance and his character (while very stereotypical) is the one, that everybody will very easily connect to and having a closer for him was very nice. The visual effects are very mixed for me - they look good and very unimpressive at the same time; good cinematography, but huge percent of it can be found in other films; the scenes with Kong are good, but very short and he's not in it so much and then the huge positive is the impressive sound. If you want to see a good King Kong film, go and watch the older versions of the legendary monster.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

Pretty dumb popcorn entry into the Kong series, this is an insult to the original. However 21st Century kids will more likely enjoy it for the non stop CGI mash up, as for me give me physical effects any day. Set in 1973 there is an attempt at making it cool by including a pretty impressive soundtrack. Mr cool himself, Samuel L Jackson, doesn't seem quite at home in this one, certainly not one of the better movies on his CV that's for sure. Going back to the effects personally I didn't find the CGI very impressive and the onslaught wore thin rather quickly.
There is a post credits sequence that suggests a sequel, I for one won't be holding my breath!","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

But I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, I loved it. Good thing I didn't read all these negative reviews before watching it or I would have missed out.I loved the Vietnam era vibe the whole movie has along with the artistic feel to it. The camera angles really stood out, and the shots were epic and beautiful. You could tell this movie had a great art team behind it.Sure, if you're the type of person that loves absolute realism I can understand it might not be for you. And it's certainly not the gloomy sort of thing we're used to lately. But I really loved this direction. I can't even count the number of times I laughed out loud or prepared myself with a giddy, youthful anticipation for the result of a sweet build up to some inevitably awesome scene. I felt like I was a 90's kid again, watching a movie only that era could produce, and something that's been lost in recent decades.Sure it didn't have the deepest storyline, and we all knew what we were getting in another Kong movie. But I really enjoyed it. And if you're a 90's kid, trust me ... ignore the reviews, crack open a beer, open your mind, and enjoy!Loved the bit at the end too. I hope they make more like this :D","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

They chase each other through the jungle until they come to a cliff. The Japanese soldier is close to killing the American when suddenly two gigantic ape hands appear: hello Kong! The fate of the two soldiers is unknown when we jump to 1973 where we meet Bill Randa (John Goodman) and his colleague in Washington D.C. They are scientist who want funding for an expedition to a recently discovered location called Skull Island. They get the funding and an military escort, made up of Vietnam veterans who are called the Sky Devils squadron. The leader of the Sky Devils, Colonel Preston Packard (Samual L Jackson) is reluctant to return to civil life after Vietnam so he gladly accepts the job. Also joining the expedition is a former S.A.S. Captain named James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and photographer Mason (Brie Larson). When the team arrives at Skull Island the plan from the scientists is to drop bombs from choppers in order to measure the ground reaction (or something like that). The whole team (about 30-40 people) gets on the choppers and after a rough flight through thick storm clouds they arrive at the island. All goes well but after dropping the first bombs the team is met by something that doesn't like bombs: the giant ape Kong and he is angry. Kong easily takes out the choppers and half the team is killed as a result. The surviving members are divided and have some new goals: get off the island and/or kill the giant ape. While not bad this movie was very mediocre for me. It looks gorgeous, there are some tense moments and when Kong is on screen beating stuff up it's entertaining. The back story is very basic but I wasn't expecting much so that's okay. What was truly bad in this movie is the incredibly blend characters: they could all be replaced with cardboard boards without changing the end product. Nobody was given any background whatsoever, there was no chemistry between anyone and most where just there for Kong or the other monsters to play around with. It's a shame because they had some talented people here, but even the best actors can only do so much with so little. Take Tom Hiddleston who played the SAS captain for instance: we get one very short introduction scene of him and that's it! How can I root for a guy when there is so little shown of who he is and what his motivation is?The only character with proper motivation is Samual L Jackson but that get's to the point of ridiculous very quickly. It's getting a little better when Jonh C. Reilly shows up because his character is at least given more then one line of background and there are some jokes thrown around. But he is just mainly there to explain the background story for the audience, it almost feel like they pause the film and show a power point presentation. (""here is what you need to know, please wait for question at the end!"") They even had cave drawings to explain stuff. The special effects look cool though and the fight scenes between Kong and the other big monsters are awesome. But that is just 10 minutes out of two hours of boring characters. The plot is incredibly predictable, there are zero surprises found here. They also try a little to hard to force a 70's feel with all the classic rock songs played, but I let that slide as they were good songs. If they had used less characters, gave them more material to work with and went more for a serious survival story I think it might have worked a lot better than just putting loads of characters in it and try to copy a Marvel movie. If your bored, don't care about wooden characters and just want to see a big ape beat stuff up then this will probably entertain you. If you like good characters in a monster movie with a plot that has some unexpected twists then look elsewhere, you don't find that here.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

But the movie itself has the most unrealistic story-line and even sillier characters. Samuel L Jackson is particularly bad, in fact I have never seen him act well in any movie he has been in. I wont go into all the stupid mistakes as many others have explained these in other posts, but this movie shows that good special effects do not in themselves make a good movie.","0 out of 4 found this helpful."

Some effects are very obvious CGI and Blue Screen, similar to a 60's movie of this genre. Samuel L Jackson's character completely ruins the movie. It is just not believable that anyone would act the way he does given the circumstances they find themselves in. Even worse is that the party actually obeys! For what reason would scientists obey a government official if they have nothing to gain by doing so? The beautiful 'love' story between a giant ape and human King Kong is known for, has for some reason been excluded from this version. The King Kong magic is gone. Maybe, hopefully, this will materialize in a sequel...I just don't know if I'd be interested in seeing a sequel...","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

However, it had a special something and even invented a kind of film-language for this little universe, which after all this movie is trying to follow for the most part. And it had some inventive visuals which I must say right away top this movie by many miles (no matter how unlikely that may sound). Even many critics found it quite alright and interesting, despite it being a monstrosity in every possible sense.
This movie on the other hand (and despite the caveats about the previous movie) has an ordinary dumb action blockbuster script that automatically makes it fail. One notices the director is genuinely trying to make the whole thing visually appealing and fun to watch, however he still lacks a ""special something"", which by the way I only acknolwedge Peter Jackson has in direct comparison to others, without me really liking his style nor thinking highly of all his choices. (Which I think found some of their worst excesses in the Hobbit-trilogy, almost making me doubt saying anything positive again, if there still weren't this direct comparison of Kong movies).","0 out of 1 found this helpful."
