"3","/10","I regret watching this film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9622872/?ref_=tt_urv","sinscopefilms","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur175500431/?ref_=tt_urv","15 February 2024","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","308 out of 409 found this helpful.

You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","1,255 out of 1,400 found this helpful.

Yes, the movie may not be the best superhero movie, but the low ratings aren't justified either. Overall, the story is sometimes told in a rushed manner and the script doesn't deserve an Oscar, but overall the movie was entertaining. To be honest, I was expecting the worst and I was biased because of the negative ratings. After watching the movie, I couldn't understand all the hate for the movie at all. I'm already reasonably discerning when it comes to movies, but guys, let's be honest, this isn't an art house movie, this is popcorn cinema. The movie is supposed to entertain and it did. Even if it was a bit bumpy in places. Overall, I can recommend the movie to people who just want to be entertained. Not more and not less.","146 out of 213 found this helpful.

Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","847 out of 1,061 found this helpful.

The plot is straight forward, with weaknesses, and the acting is adequate. It's not a great movie by any means, but it made sense and was entertaining.Dakota Johnson is not a good actress in any movie, so she's always miscast. I can think of many actresses that could have played her role. She was a little distracting, as she always is. Had a better actress been hired, it would have made the movie better.The three ""teens"" were not given enough lines, but they all acted as ""typical teens"".I do wish more background on Ezekiel were given. He was definitely fascinating character. This was the biggest weakness of the film.I'm going to watch again.But from a critical analysis of the film, it's terrible.

Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","395 out of 507 found this helpful.

You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","343 out of 467 found this helpful.

To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","152 out of 203 found this helpful.

It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","225 out of 306 found this helpful.

It may not be as great as Iron Man or Captain America, but it was more enjoyable than the painfully unoriginal Morbius. Here, Dakota Johnson gives a credible performance as the main character. The teens were OK, not nearly as annoying as people make them out to be, considering that they were troubled teens (if they weren't, they'd be dead), who didn't know the main character for half a day. I did find the antagonist's performance pretty stilted. The story basically plays like a slasher/Terminator flick where the antagonist is a ""Spider-Man"" instead of a robot. I personally found the idea interesting, and the movie did a pretty good job fleshing it out. Though there is the possibility of a sequel/crossover, I guess the studio isn't hopeful, as there was no post-credits scene. It would've been interesting seeing her reactions meeting up with the MCU Spider-Man, but I won't get my hopes up.","44 out of 65 found this helpful.

Some pundit, reviewer, influencer or other nitwit sounds off about how feeble, terrible, horribly BAD a movie is (or is *going* to be - these opinions often predate any viewing of the actual movie). And then the herd instinct takes over and generates a tsunami of contempt.Case in point, Madame Web - a truly ridiculous number of one-star reviews, completely unjustified by the actual experience of watching the movie.The surprising truth is that this is actually quite a decent little movie. It's no work of genius, but it is a workmanlike, efficient, competent piece of entertainment. Not only is it not ""the worst,"" it is far more entertaining than a whole host of bloated, forgettable superhero flicks of the past few years.Start with the characters. We have an interesting heroine, Cassandra Webb, nicely embodied by Dakota Johnson. She's likeable, believable and suitably challenged by events she doesn't really understand. I can't speak to Johnson's acting range, not having seen her in anything else, but she seems to fit this particular part perfectly.Most of the movie has to do with Cassandra's attempts to protect three teen-age girls. All three of them are presented as distinct personalities, and are elevated beyond mere stereotypes by earnest and appealing performances by the trio of actresses. I not only believed them, I was happy to spend time with them.Then there's the story. It's nothing we haven't seen before, but it's done well. The origin of Cassandra's odd powers is novel, and revealed in stages that keep us guessing. Refreshingly, Cassandra needs to hold a super-villain at bay without actually knowing there's such a thing as a super-hero movie - or that she's in one.Better yet, Cassandra's super-talent is inherently unpredictable, in an interesting way. It reminded me of the excellent Nicolas Cage film Next, in which he has the ability to see the future - two minutes at a time. The storyline of Madame Web is somewhat formulaic, to be sure - but it's a good formula, and well-executed. I never felt my intelligence was being insulted, and I certainly never felt bored.The inevitable computer effects are used sparingly. Action is kept on a human scale - far more engrossing than watching CG heroes destroying planets with their pinky fingers.I tip-toed into Madame Web with dire forebodings of a wasted evening. Two hours later I found myself wishing the movie was longer - and wondering what ghastly childhood traumas must have prompted the vast torrents of vitriol that have been aimed at it.Sure, Madame Web isn't a breakthrough of any kind. But it's a completely professional piece of work - a solid two hours' escape from the troubles of the real world. Maybe it doesn't follow the comics - I don't know, and couldn't possibly care less. Maybe there were some nasty studio conflicts during production - again, not my concern. The end result was good. I had fun. Unless you come in solidly determined to hate, I can't see why you wouldn't have fun too.Rating: 8 out of 10. To me, 7 indicates a movie that succeeds in its aims - that entertains and does nothing conspicuously off-putting, worth seeing for anyone who likes the genre. However, I felt compelled to add an extra mercy star to offset the numerous undeservedly low ratings.","165 out of 280 found this helpful.

I think they abruptly changed the dialog and script so much at the last minute, there was no choice but to dub over the voice instead of just reshooting the scenes - but it was painfully obvious when it was happening and really gave the movie an amateurish feel.This movie was set in the year 2003 and by all accounts, it felt as though it was MADE in 2003. It really did but I want to think that it was intentional and if it was, I appreciated it. It's old school, and the periodic attempts at humor or surprise worked in our opinion. We enjoyed the movie and happy we watched it.I'll be honest, I hope they actually make a sequel - just to see the other characters develop a bit more under Madame Web.","94 out of 152 found this helpful.

It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","260 out of 369 found this helpful.

Despite having a budget of 80 million dollars, the movie feels low budget. Was not to the level of a modern marvel film but more like a marvel tv show.The characters were not as well established or as likable as they could of been. It was cluttered and cliche and suffers form a lack of originality. The cast deserved better, wasted talents of Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney. The villain was generic and uninspiring. Constantly complaining about ""everything he as built' being destroyed, while not showing anything that he has built.Im not fully up on the real origin story but after looking into it more it seems Sony fully molested the comic book version for their own that barely resembles anything of the original. I see why that would make many purist upset. That would help explain a current rating of 3.7, which is crazy considering all the far worse films with higher ratings. I was entertained watching this film but that is with the caveat that this was not a good or very well made movie. The film fell flat on the execution of creating a compelling narrative.The pepsi product placement rivaled the pepsi placement in the ""I will not bow to any sponsor"" scene in Wayne's World.

It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more.

I'm sure there are plot holes aplenty (I noticed a few) and it probably makes zero sense/isn't a good adaptation compared to its source material or whatever but honesty... I don't care, it gave me enough enjoyment that I wasn't questioning anything about what I was watching.The cast are probably the key factors as to why I did enjoy this. I previously knew of Dakota Johnson but hadn't actually seen her in anything properly, I found her performance to be more than noteworthy and she spearheads the film strongly. The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are positives too.Tahar Rahim's antagonist, meanwhile, is poorly written and portrayed, though I personally thought the actor did a good job. I have no complaints with anyone who appears onscreen to be honest. Away from them, the pacing and score are also standouts.In my recollection of viewing this, I truthfully haven't got any issues with it. If it wasn't for the slight bad murmurs that I did hear about pre-watch (though not much of it as I avoid as much as I can with movies) and the reaction on sites like this post-watch, I'd not be questioning my thoughts about this whatsoever.As I always say, to each their own.

This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","96 out of 144 found this helpful.

J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","71 out of 107 found this helpful.

"1","/10","One of the worst Comic Book Films Ever","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9624268/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","16 February 2024","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.","77 out of 131 found this helpful.

Detaching oneself from the expectation of a seamless integration into the broader MCU narrative allows for a more enjoyable viewing experience. While it may not reach the heights of some of its counterparts, the film still manages to deliver an entertaining ride, filled with enough thrills and excitement to keep audiences engaged. At its core, cinema is about escapism, and ""Madame Web"" certainly accomplishes that goal, providing viewers with a welcome respite from reality for its runtime. Criticisms of the film seem misplaced when compared to the mindless entertainment found in other media forms like reality TV. In the end, ""Madame Web"" deserves credit for its efforts to bring a lesser-known character to the forefront and provide audiences with a dose of enjoyable escapism. So, before casting judgment, perhaps it's worth considering the simple pleasure of having fun at the movies, regardless of whether it meets every critic's lofty expectations. So chill out haters. Press pause on love island and get off your high horses.","26 out of 38 found this helpful.

The Villian wasn't so bad could use some work with his homework assignments. Overall experience was decent not the best, but hey at least Marvel tries is best with CGI which they did.

-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0.","75 out of 136 found this helpful.

Not great, but not terrible. I can see why there has been such widespread disdain of the movie, because the overall quality of it is mid (as the kids say today), and it may be even more insulting to the hardcore comic fans, but it had the basic pieces of an entertaining movie.I think what I liked most was how it grounded a mythological story, including a main character who learns she can see the future, while still being able to insert some heart into the center. And except maybe for the opening scene, the writing and acting were fairly decent. I even thought the pacing and direction of the story made sense.Yes, there were dozens of head-scratching moments about why certain characters made certain choices, particularly the villain, but not enough to tank the experience for me. I think this is the director's first major motion picture; I looked up S. J. Clarkson and she mostly has directed TV shows. I'm good with Sony Pictures giving people a chance, but I do sometimes wonder why they do it with origin story movies of beloved comic book characters. Seems risky.This was my first Dakota Johnson movie. I've heard her name a bunch but I hadn't seen anything with her in it prior to this role of Cassandra Webb. She was great the whole way through. Not until I looked her up after the movie did I know she was the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. The fact that I remember when those two got together, and that Dakota is currently 34 years old, means I'm old.The rest of the cast was fine. Again, I honestly don't think this movie was bad. If I had to rate it, then maybe a 5 out of 10? Perfectly average, and there's nothing wrong with that.And a bonus: Dakota Johnson looks great in jeans.","16 out of 24 found this helpful.

I wasn't too sure about what to expect because the average rating isn't great, but reading through some reviews on here after watching (which I didn't do before), I can't really understand all the hate.Everyone seems to be mentioning Pepsi cans and that this movie is supposedly just one big advertisement for it, but I didn't notice it all while watching. Not once did I consciously perceive a can.I also don't think the writing was bad nor did the actors do such an awful job as everyone is saying they did. Maybe I'm not as critical as others, but I didn't notice a difference to most other films I watched. The did some acting, I didn't once think ""wow this is bad acting"", ergo it was fine.The only thing I missed a bit was an explanation of why the villain became a villain. Some more background on that would have helped understand his actions and why he's doing what he's doing.In the beginning of the movie he just says something along the lines of ""Nobody helped my family when they were starving either"". Seemed a little cheap of a reason to go on and become a villain, so I suppose you just have to accept him to be a villain for the sake of there being a villain.All in all I found it to be a good movie.

The Spider-Man multiverse is a complex and richly woven tapestry, full of diverse characters, storylines, and themes. Introducing Madam Web as a character and potential narrative pivot offers a fresh vantage point from which to explore this universe. The character's unique abilities and her position within the Spider-Man lore can serve as a conduit for new stories, characters, and even dimensions within the franchise.Furthermore, the criticism regarding the movie's direction might overshadow the film's accomplishments. For instance, the casting decisions, visual effects, and adherence to the source material are areas where ""Madam Web"" possibly shines. These elements, when combined with the movie's narrative potential, suggest a promising future for the series. It's crucial to recognize that many successful franchises have had humble beginnings, with initial skepticism giving way to widespread acclaim as the series evolved.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

It feels rushed and underwhelming, failing to deliver the punch a superhero film needs. The action sequences throughout are decent but forgettable.However, to dismiss the entire movie based on the ending feels harsh. The concept is interesting, and Johnson's performance is engaging.Is it a groundbreaking superhero movie? No. But as a person who is font for super hero movies, for a casual watch with a moderately intriguing premise, ""Madame Web"" isn't a total waste of time.

Her quest leads her to rescue three girls from the clutches of Ezekiel Sims, a ruthless figure intent on their demise to evade his own fate at their hands in the future.Films in Sony's Spider-Man universe have received criticism, and Madame Web isn't exempt from that. However, contrary to many reviews, Madame Web is a straightforward and enjoyable superhero film. It doesn't aim for grandeur, which aligns well with its storyline. Despite uninspiring dialogue hinted at in trailers, the actual movie doesn't suffer from this. Though not particularly imaginative, the dialogue effectively propels the story forward.The film effectively captures the nostalgia of its 2003 setting. The soundtrack plays a significant role in this, and the homage to Beyoncé's ""Dangerously In Love"" was a delightful touch.Madame Web does indeed encounter several challenges. The unfolding of subplots relies too heavily on convenient occurrences, which can be frustrating for viewers. While the exploration of the titular character's powers is intriguing, it diminishes the suspense that should accompany this genre of film. As obstacles arise, the predictability of their resolution removes any sense of genuine tension or dread.For a superhero movie where the principal characters are battling a villain palpably stronger and possessing no impressive powers of their own, the action scenes manage to be more effective than one would expect.The performances in this film may not be stellar, but they are well-suited to their roles. Dakota Johnson portrays just the right balance of detachment and confusion required for her character. Her reluctance to embrace heroism is palpable and serves as a driving force throughout the movie. The rest of the cast also meet the expectations for their respective roles.Numerous aspects of Madame Web require refinement and clarification but it's notable that the runtime isn't adversely affected. Surprisingly, the two-hour duration passes smoothly without feeling prolonged or dragged out.Madame Web would benefit from better writing but overall it's a simple and decent movie that knows what it is and doesn't try to go beyond that.5.5/10.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

When the trailer for MADAME WEB came out, I thought it looked bad. I admit, my opinion was biased because of Sony's quite abysmal track record of making Spider-Man spinoff movies without Spider-Man in them. Well, I hate being right, this time. This is about Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), a New York City paramedic who gains the unpredictable power of immediate visions of the future after a near death experience. She is then forced to protect 3 girls from being killed by a mysterious adversary. That's the boilerplate description. This movie is unacceptable. Pretty much everything involved with this movie is bad. The villain's motivation is he keeps having the same dream of him being killed by these 3 girls dressed up in Spider-Girl costumes, so he obviously needs to find and murder them before that happens, right? My question is, why did they kill you, huh? Also, it seemed like they filmed his lines later, because his mouth didn't really sync with the dialogue. Oh speaking of the dialogue, the writing is atrocious! These guys are responsible for writing some of the worst movies out there. I don't know how they still have jobs. It was like every actor knew this was crap, so they didn't even try. There are some easter eggs in here tying this to Spider-Man, but I didn't even know about them until doing my research afterwards. I guess I was so bored some details got glazed over. The effects are bad, even the ""action-packed"" third act was unsatisfying. The only reason I'm not giving this a 0 is because of Adam Scott, who plays Webb's partner, Ben Parker. I can't believe they canned the Bat-Girl movie and not this one. Sony needs to stop making these mediocre live-action Spider-verse movies. They keep trying to set up this whole universe, and they're failing every time so far. I'm genuinely curious what VENOM 3 is going to be. I also can't believe this is the same company that made the animated Spider-verse movies, which are some of my favorite movies. MADAME WEB is the stupidest version of TERMINATOR you can think of. I recommend seeing this, only if you're a masochist and want to see how far rock bottom really is.

When you need money to make a trash movie, Pepsi is there for you.","34 out of 70 found this helpful.

Who Wrote this Stuff?And what about the Truck Crashing the Ambulance Scene? 🚑 If you look at where the truck was Heading to, the Truck was Heading Full speed into the water before the Ambulance Crash? 🤔😮🤦🏻Is this Film even Real?On to the Film -The Concept Was Good, but instead of just Replaying them, how about Giving us 3 Scenarios each Time an Event Happens or the Villain Attacks and Failing at 2 of them but Succeeding in the 3rd? You know, like the Diner Scene? It would of been far more entertaining.There's so many Problems with this Film and I See What they were Going For but here's the 5 Main Problems(and there's tons more but here's 5)1. 🙋 The Performances2. 📜 You've already shot yourself in the foot when you constantly make the worst decisions at every Turn within the script. Again, just give us 3 Scenarios with the Concept every time an event happens, not just constantly replaying them, it's too boring.3. 📜 And then we have the dialogue, some of which is horrendous, and you couple that with anywhere from lackluster to ok at best performances and the results are a very lackluster watch (again, Celeste O'Connor at least tried something).4. 🎬 Then we have the Direction of this whole thing, the Director couldn't execute this thing effectively(Mainly because the Script was Just making Terrible Decisions at every Turn), but the Direction was completely Lackluster at Nearly every single Facet.5. 🎬 The Edits, the edits were sometimes horrendous, cutting every millisecond(Particularly the End Fight). When you cut like that, you can't follow what the hell is going on.1 Positive -👍 There were a few Scenes where the 4 Women seemed to be clicking whether they were arguing or cooperating, the synergy seemed to be there.Overall, because of the 5 main problems and the absolute brain dead writing, this was a lackluster and completely missed opportunity for a Very entertaining film(in a good way entertaining, not this embarrassment of entertainment).","41 out of 88 found this helpful.

I can't exactly articulate how Clarkson pulled this off, but all I can do is recommend this film emphatically.Every shot is interesting, there is no commitment to the standard shot-reverse-shot format, instead every scene will make you feel disoriented. The lighting, random zoom ins and zoom outs, the random quick cuts, everything is so janky and bizarre.The acting is so bad that every scene with the main characters transforms into comedy gold, the delivery and timing of some lines are incredible. Sweeney and Rahim are especially terrible, which is shocking because they are both great in their previous work. The only explanation for this (the fact that every single actor gives the worst performance of their careers) has to be the script and direction. It is like when you take an exam (the average should be a 50/100 if you were guessing randomly) but every scene, every line, every delivery, is a solid 0/100. It is like there was a concerted effort to make the worst film possible, and it is amazing.And the CG resembles bad AI generated trash.This movie is like watching a car crash in slow motion. 10/10 will see again and I recommend that you go as well. It is endlessly entertaining, like nothing I have seen before.","64 out of 117 found this helpful.

Also, don't expect a show of powers either, not from the 3 ladies that our main character is helping. They don't even have their powers in this nor do we see them get their powers.. only glimpse we have of their powers is in a future premonition.

Congratulations to the cast and crew for not knowing how to put a movie together. How do you take a fairly uninteresting character and make them even less interesting? Disgraceful. This movie is an example of how not to make a movie. First off there are so many subplots that the writers seem to forget about. Not to mention the poorly delivered dialogue from Johnson and the rest of the cast (Minus Adam Scott he was great.) This movie is a trashy amalgamation of several boring and uninspired ideas. This is not a superhero movie. This is an experimental film trying to relate in some way to superheroes but ultimately fails to. Madame Web is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you go to see it in theaters I recommend going with a friend so you can laugh at the outrageously stupid dialogue and F tier acting.

Actions werent nearly enough and badly choreographed, kind of stiff like students making youtubes. The acting was average, dokota was the only one that carried through but werent so great, I dont blame the supporting girls as they were obviously new and inexperienced. The scenes setups were actually rather nice and convincing, but the cgi wasnt at the quality of big productions. The movie tried to explain the origin of the spider powers and bring new characters to the spider verse, but the ending was quite a let down that wasnt at all satisfying, but certainly I enjoyed this movie a lot more than the boring oscar garbages like oppenheimer and poor things, and this is honestly better than suicide squad and ms marvel and received a lower rating (coz its rigged).","45 out of 75 found this helpful.

No one asked for this. No one wanted this. And they gave this to us anyway and people who aren't even privy to the story tried to have faith in it.I even accepted Morbius, and thought Venom 1 and 2 was okay... But this... I even tried to root for the actresses and I had to acknowledge that their poor acting was not just the writing.The editing is bad, the cinematography is bad, the actresses were bad, the writers are bad. Adam Scott playing a young Ben Parker ( the prolific Uncle Ben who actually is supposed to be ex-military, but we can overlook that for the sake of the MCU and the multiverse) was the only decent aspect of the movie because you believed he was an actual person.This movie could have been so good, like really good. A movie and possibly a sequel based on this really gnarly entity that could bring the entire spider verse and the MCU together, just wasted away.

Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) and Ben Parker (Adam Scott) are NYFD paramedics. She's an orphan when 30 years earlier, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) killed her mother during an Amazon scientific expedition. They had gone to find a mysterious spider with great healing powers and a local legend of a people with outrageous superpowers. Back to 2003, Sims has not aged. He has spider superpowers and premonition of his own death years later. Using stolen tech, he finds the teenage versions of his three spider-powered assassins; Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazón (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor).The popular criticism is that this is the worst movie of the year. Everybody is dunking on this and my expectations are pretty low coming into this. It's not the worst thing in the world. It's not even the worst thing coming from this branch of the spider team. It's passable with some big issues in writing, logic, and overall flow. Most importantly, I like Dakota Johnson. She's playing the reluctant hero. Now, the three girls are rather annoying at first. The movie solves this by showing the villain right away. I thought the girls would spend half the movie thinking that Webb had actually kidnapped them. That would truly be annoying. I get the standard bratty teen characters, but I don't have to like them. I would make a few changes. First, I would skip the 1973 opening. The audience could discover the story along with Cassandra and there could always be flashbacks. Second, the girls should join her on the trip to the Amazon. That would make more logical sense. She would want the girls close to her at all times and the final battle could take place in the jungle. That's also a great way for the girls to get their superpowers. This movie has plenty of writing problems and others, but I've seen much worst.","23 out of 36 found this helpful.

Yet, my disappointment with Madame Web surpassed expectations. The entire film felt devoid of life and intrigue. The performances seemed lackluster, with Dakota Johnson notably disengaged.The movie's villain lacked depth, perhaps the most uninspired Marvel antagonist to date, adorned in a forgettable costume. Costumes overall appeared cheap and uninspired. The editing felt disjointed, with incessant cuts and distracting special effects.The film's saving grace lies in its concept - the exploration of precognition and mentorship, particularly intriguing in the context of caring for three young women. However, the execution falls flat, opting for a mundane approach.In summary, Madame Web is not worth the investment of time or money.

The film turned out to be a quirky mix of mediocrity and hilarity, potentially earning a status as a classic among bad superhero movies, comparable to ""Catwoman"" or ""Batman & Robin."" This unique blend makes it a guilty pleasure for some viewers.The highlight for me was the end, with the captivating song ""Dreams"" by The Cranberries during the closing credits, providing an enjoyable musical moment. However, inevitable criticisms arise regarding the plot, with unnecessary scenes and questionable narrative decisions, such as the ease with which the protagonist travels to Peru while being sought by the police, or abandoning rescued teens in the woods to delve into her mother's past, harming the story's cohesion.The lack of engagement with the storyline was noticeable, suggesting a simpler plot could have avoided forced situations and confusing ideas. The attempt to recreate the atmosphere of 2003 fell short, with modern elements clearly visible in various scenes. The absence of the promoted superheroines was disappointing, as they only briefly appeared as a villain's dream and a vision of Cassandra Web at the end.The performances, including Dakota Johnson's and the young cast's, were horrible, they all look lost. In summary, ""Madame Web"" left me disappointed due to its lack of innovation, failing to let the protagonist shine as a superhero and giving the impression of watching a lengthy trailer for future ""Spiders-Women"" films.","21 out of 43 found this helpful.

Directed by S. J. Clarkson and starring Dakota Johnson in the title role, it continues Sony's complete lack of creativity in carving out their own superhero cinematic universe in another dull, forgettable origin story.In 2003 in New York City, Cassandra ""Cassie"" Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic saving lives and driving patients to the hospital in an ambulance. One day, Cassie finds herself involved in an accident which causes her to develop psychic abilities that allow her to see into the future. With her new clairvoyant powers, Cassie learns that three young women; Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) are now being hunted by the dangerous Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) and vows to protect them from him at all costs. While the quartet are on the run, Cassie soon realises she must confront her own troubled past in order to ensure that the three women don't fall victim to Ezekiel's influence.It's pretty clear at this point that Sony have no clue what direction they are heading in with their superhero IPs. Not only is their shared timeline with Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe a convoluted mess, but it also seems that they are unsure how to handle the characters inhabiting the very universe they created themselves. The public's reception of these films appears to reflect this as next to no one can be bothered investing their time in something they have little interest in watching in the first place. Following suit from the failure of ""Morbius"" two years earlier, ""Madame Web"" attempts to introduce more characters into Sony's pitiful ""Spider-Man"" Universe but like last time it is dead on arrival.From the way this film started, I could already tell it just wasn't going to work. Here, we see a pregnant scientist in 1973 searching the jungles of Peru for a rare spider that is supposed to have mysterious properties in its venom. It should be noted that this information is not conveyed to us here through what the characters are experiencing but rather through awkwardly worded exposition that feels like it was added to the script at the last minute. Immediately after, the scientist announces she has discovered the spider and is soon shot and left for dead by one of her fellow explorers. Flashing forward thirty years, the film then shows our protagonist Cassie rushing to the scene of an accident without any real context of what happened within those three decades, instead choosing to shelve this important plot element for much later on in the story. The jumbled, poorly edited way the film tries to set up its plot within a short time frame makes it hard to care about anything else that happens afterwards because if a solid storytelling foundation cannot be done in just the first 10 minutes then it's clearly going to be all downhill from here on out.To make matter worse, the action scenes, if you can call them that, are never exciting. There were only about two scenes throughout the entire movie that could be considered ""action packed"" in the loosest sense and even then there wasn't any enjoyment to be had from any of them. In one, we see Cassie trying to defend the three girls from the advancing Ezekiel on a subway train, only for the scene to end almost as quickly as it started. I couldn't help but feel cheated after this sequence concluded, as it gave the impression it was going to be an intense demonstration of skills between hero and villain. But instead, the scene simply moves onto the next one as though we are supposed to forget about everything that just happened. Because of this, the film's general lack of excitement makes it quite boring to watch most of the time, especially considering some of the weak dialogue the characters are made to speak.Though not quite as bad as in ""Morbius"", the film's visuals and editing definitely leave a lot to be desired. What is supposed to be the film's way of showing Cassie using her powers is seen through a series of quick-cut shots of something bad taking place clumsily inter-spliced with repetitive seizure-inducing flashes. At first I didn't mind this creative technique, but as the movie continued on it really became irritating to watch each time Cassie showed her signature abilities. This is problematic since it is the backbone for her entire character's superhero gimmick, and when that starts to wear you down, you know your film is not working the way you had intended. What I would have done instead is focus on the very thing Cassie is looking into the future for an indeterminate amount of time before cutting back to the present, as the constant flashes are an unnecessary addition to this visual style.In the role of Cassie, Dakota Johnson looks like she's trying her best with the awful material she has to work with, even if it was probably all for nothing. It can't be easy making such a bland character seem somewhat likeable, but Johnson puts on a brave face and powers through the mediocrity of the film's script. There's not a lot of depth to Cassie as a character, other than that she is socially awkward and has a caring nature. One thing I was relieved to see is that Cassie is not depicted as a man-hating ""girlboss"", as has been the trend in many female-led films released in the past few years. For the most part she appreciates all the male help she receives, especially from her co-worker Ben (Adam Scott), which is one of the reasons her character is a bit more endearing to the audience.On the other hand, I found myself struggling to remember anything remotely substantial about the three other women in the cast beyond what is seen on the surface. Sydney Sweeney's Julia is an introverted nerd who wears thick rimmed glasses and has difficulty interacting with others, Celeste O'Connor's Mattie is a short tempered skeptic who flips people off when they get in her way, and Isabela Merced's Anya does little more than act like a third wheel among this trio. Without doing any extensive internet research on these characters, this was all that came to my mind when thinking carefully about them. Given their supposed importance to the story, this is pretty sad when you think about it.In addition to their poor development, it would seem that these three each aren't very bright either. One scene where this is evident to audience shows the trio hiding out in a diner where they are told by Cassie to keep a low profile. A short time later, the three of them walk over to a group of high school boys where they proceed to climb onto the table and dance to ""Toxic"" by Britney Spears, alerting Ezekiel to their presence. It's hard for me to like characters who do such brazenly stupid things like this for no other reason than for a cheap attempt at comedy.However, where the film really falters in terms of character development is in its villain Ezekiel, and Tahar Rahim does little to add anything noteworthy to his performance. At no point did Ezekiel feel like a genuine threat since there's nothing interesting about him as a character. It is established that Ezekiel has the same powers as Cassie but they only ever seem to work whenever the plot demands it. What could have been an interesting adversary for Cassie is instead a one dimensional bad guy who wants the three girls dead because he had a brief vision they were going to kill him. This leaves many unanswered questions regarding his purpose in the story. Why do these specific girls play a part in him dying? Why is he so easily avoided despite his pursuits taking place in broad daylight? Why doesn't he see some kind personal connection to Cassie as they share the same abilities? Being a rich as he is, why couldn't he just hire someone else to deal with the girls instead of doing it himself? When the movie leaves you in the dark this much about a villain and his motives, you tend to lose interest in wanting to see what happens to him in the end.With such a poor track record so far, Sony doesn't seem to be learning any lessons regarding the state of their own Marvel Cinematic Universe. Like ""Morbius"" before it, ""Madame Web"" is simply a bad product, not bad as in the cheesy fun kind, but rather
a forgettably boring type of bad, which is debatably worse. Previously, I said that the poor reception of ""Morbius"" should serve as a wakeup call for the company, although judging by the quality of this film, it would appear that yearning has fallen on deaf ears. I wish plenty of good luck to all future additions to this cinematic universe, because they are definitely going to need it.I rate it 3/10.","27 out of 58 found this helpful.

I hope at some point that actually do a spider man movie but the rush isn't as urgent as I thought before I saw the movie.

But looking at the bio of the director, writers and pretty much everyone involved in this disaster, then the mess of a film is partly explained - not a single good job among them. The only ones decently holding up are the actors. We know Dakota can act, and some of the others are not horrible either, but no one, not a ton of A-list stars could have even started to make this into something coherent and watchable.The only thing that make sense is if someone deliberately wanted to make the worst superhero movie of all time, hired a lousy director and the worst writers team in living memory to accomplish this feat, and they almost pulled it off.A very generous 3/10 because the acting and idea is good, but this is awful with atrocious dialogue.","19 out of 40 found this helpful.

Despite some reviews inaccurately downplaying its value, I found Madame Web to be refreshing and visually stunning.The movie brings forth a character with complexities and mysteries that kept me on the edge of my seat. The script balances exposition with action, allowing both long-time Marvel fans and newcomers to appreciate the narrative without feeling overwhelmed.From mind-bending sequences that reveal the character's psychic abilities to epic battles that unfold in the mystical realms, the movie is a visual feat. The CGI work is good, creating a world that feels fantastical and grounded in the Marvel aesthetic.One of the highlights for me was the introduction of lesser-known Marvel characters. Madame Web serves as a gateway to a new array of heroes and villains, expanding the Marvel Cinematic Universe in ways that excite me. The movie's ability to integrate these characters into the larger story without overshadowing the central plot is effective.It's unfortunate to see some reviews dismissing Madame Web with lower ratings, as the movie is a fresh perspective. The nuanced performance by the cast, led by an outstanding lead portrayal, adds layers to the characters, making them more than just two-dimensional comic book figures.I'm glad this film was made, and I encourage viewers to give it a chance despite some misleading reviews. With an 8 out of 10 stars, Madame Web swings into the Marvel cinematic world with finesse, leaving me eager for more web-spinning adventures.","16 out of 25 found this helpful.

And it wasn't good, but it wasn't unwatchable either. It made just as much sense as The Flash, but it featured young women and there were no cameos from famous actors or characters. If it were not a ""spider-movie"" and it was just a random studio making a film, I would have said ""meh!"" so this is also my rating.It has a lot of pacing and editing issues and very little actual action, but its greatest sin as far as I am concerned is that it's boring. Honestly, it's got the structure of a video game: the plot is linear, the characters are barely sketched and everything that you see has some direct and immediate impact on the plot. If you need something to happen in another place, the movie instantly goes there, unless there is some interest in heightening the drama, in which case you get a scene that makes no sense like the one with the log truck. And obviously, the ending sucks, because no one in Hollywood seems to be able to write one anymore.I would have rated it lower, but I see it was hatefully rating-bombed already, so there is no point in it. My advice is to relax, grab some food and a drink and enjoy this like any other silly TV movie.","18 out of 28 found this helpful.

Characters fail to evoke empathy, making it hard to invest in their journey. Madame Web fails to deliver a compelling cinematic experience, leaving viewers with a forgettable and unengaging film.","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

My youngest used to get mad and yell at people when they left before the stingers. Then Avengers Endgame came and we had the loud, large, raucous ending we had waited for for 11 years. And oh my it was a truly sad but satisfactory ending. Marvel dialed things back after that, but not enough. They were still trying too hard to reach Endgame levels. You can't top that. Nothing will ever be able to top that, and because they kept trying, almost everything except No Way Home, WandaVision, Loki and GotG3 has been just ""eh"" or in Quantumania and Secret Invasions' case, very extremely sub-par. The Marvels was a decent movie, I didn't hate it, but again, still trying too hard. We're done with it all connecting. I don't have the mental energy for that road again. But here comes Madame Webb. This movie is not a 10, not even an 8, but it's WAY better than some others are saying it is. It was nice to just watch a singular movie. There is a low key nod to the Spider-Man universe, did you catch it? No, this movie won't win any awards, it isn't full of over the top CGI fights and robots and tech, but it was not bad at all. We enjoyed it. I paid full price for tickets and don't regret it. Will I watch it again? Of course, when it hits streaming. It's a perfectly good way to spend a weekend afternoon. All four leading ladies did very nice jobs with what they were given to work with, and if there's a sequel, I'll go see that as well.","75 out of 140 found this helpful.

Every once in a blue moon, take off the austere that permiates the movie industry (especially in places like the MCU) and enjoy something that has just a tiny bit of sparkle.

I like Dakota Johnson. I think shes charming, smart, feminine, but also strong as a heroine/actress in her movies roles. The young people her character was supposed to protect... meh. Theyre the same as all zoomers in movies today... stilted dialogue that is neither hip and tries oh so hard to quip and act tough. Hollywwood does not know how to make zoomers likeable and that's the problem with why their movies aren't selling. They write these zoomer characters as if they are basing them off of social media personalities like X or Ticktock. They seem unrelatable.The reviews completely tanked the movie so when I watched on NF I went in with my expectations set to low. Surprisingly, the reviews claiming this was the worse movie ever were greatly exaggerated and it just goes to show how people are easily influenced by what other people are saying. Was it Shakespearean? No. Was it the worst ever? No. The plot wasn't overly bad. A tad cliché as a comic book action movie but not worse than something like Electra or Wonder Woman 1984. I think this is a case of, the public needs to start thinking for themselves before they decide that something is awful. I did not love it but I did not hate it either. Monkey see monkey do. It's okay to not like it, but always judge something for yourselves first.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

I need to caution the readers that when going to watch the movie, keep an open mind. This movie is about Madame Web and her role as a protector to three young women who will play a much greater role in future...hopefully. If you are expecting Peter Parker / Spider-Man to swing in and catch a crook, you will sadly be disappointed.I firmly welcome the new take on the Spider-Women within Marvel. Since Across the Spider-Verse I have pondered the question on whether we will get a chance to see any of the Spider-Women on the big screen and also the 'How?'. I have always seen Cassandra Webb / Madame Web play a motherlike and protector role. I personally think Dakota Johnson played her part excellently well in that sense.Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor plays the parts of Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazon and Mattie Franklin and delivers a breath of fresh air. They are teased to play big roles in the future, according to the villain in the movie. The new villain of the movie, played by Tahar Rahim, provides a thrilling experience at first but gets taken down too easily at the end.Madame Web provided a good introduction to a new character, which is Madame Web, but sadly doesn't provide any promise of continuity and linkages with any of the existing movies within the current universe. A few easter eggs in the movie point to another beloved Marvel character, but I would have loved to experience more of Cassie's web and the chance of a teaser for the other heroines of the movie since there are still so much stories left to tell. There is unfortunately no post-credits scene, which was a let down, considering Madame Web is part of the Sony Spider-Man Universe and continuity is what many are hopeful for. I'm curious if we get to see continuity later in the form of a sequel or even a cameo of Cassie, Julia, Mattie and / or Anya in any other production.I rate this movie 5 out of 10.The trailer doesn't spoil too much of the storyline. Make sure to catch at a big screen near you.","12 out of 25 found this helpful.

No relationship to the MCU storyline and no reference to it. Absolute trash. I was waiting for a reference or at least something mentioned. 2003 was the timeframe used in the storyline. At least mention Tony Stark and Nick Fury. But these women characters were a disappointment. Cassie's character resembles Professor X. So I'm thinking these women need to train to become superhero's and be a team. My family and I felt the characters were weak ALL OF THEM!!! The bad guy was very weak!!! No real villain characters. The villain was bad, no power, no story or reference to his strength on how he became rich and his powers. Just the stealing of the spider and that's it. No reason to be attached to the character. We lost interest during the movie.The pace of the picture was way to slow!!! The character development was to slow to tell. We weren't impressed.It doesn't deserve the Marvel logo, or anything or attachments. Madame Web more like Madame Fleam.A negative -17 outta 10.

I didn't hate the movie by any means, but there's very little to enjoy that isn't outweighed by either the bad or the boring.None of the cast stands out, and a lot of their lines are delivered in pretty flat ways. It doesn't help that the script is super bloated. They could've easily cut 30% of the dialogue without needing to cut any of the runtime with how many pointless lines there are.The use of dynamic camera movements is super distracting at times, and at others pretty nauseating. A few of the moments worked, but otherwise the only positive is that they made me appreciate the steady scenes more. And while I tend to not notice bad CGI as much as others, I did notice it here (partially because it was pointed out to me, but even if it hadn't been I think I'd have picked up on it in certain moments).Since 2018, Sony has given us both masterpieces and master-misses of Spider-Man content. The Playstation games have been amazing, and Spider-Verse is just one unreleased movie away from a perfect trilogy. On the other hand, their live-action Spider-Man-less movies supposed to be set in that universe just do not work. I'm only taking the word of the public on Morbius and Let There Be Carnage, but Venom was very disappointing, and while I wasn't expecting much from Madame Web, it's another movie I won't return to.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Dont understand why it got so low rating. Really unfair!Since the film is one of the low-budget films, it deserves a better rating than this one. The film would be more successful if it were a series, but as a film it is acceptable and better than many other films i watched. The cast in general is better at the beginning of the film, but the end of the film was a bit strange. Choosing the main roles should have been more wise. Casting reckless and unqualified young girls dropped a number of stars because the film became more of a ""children's film"" than an adult film. In general, the film is acceptable, and I enjoyed watching it, especially at the beginning, and the choice of songs and music was enjoyable.","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

Now, I tread lightly when critiquing superhero flicks with female leads, not because they're sacred cows, but because it's easy to get lost in the ""shitstorm reviews"". However,CGI: Madam Web seems to have raided a high school AV club's closet for its special effects. The visuals are so unconvincing you'll find yourself wondering if the budget was spent on pizza parties rather than production.And the plot? Oh, the plot is a tapestry of absurdity that makes you question if it was written during a game of Mad Libs. We're somehow in 2002, but everyone's rocking 4K CCTV like it's Black Friday at the tech store.The talent of the leads, trapped in this whirlwind of WTF. You keep hoping for a moment of redemption that never comes, unless you count the end credits as a merciful release.My advice? If you're in the mood for a superhero movie that feels like a journey through the uncanny valley with a side of time-traveling tech, 'Madam Web' might just be your ticket. For the rest of us, there are about a thousand other ways to better spend a couple of hours-like alphabetizing your sock drawer or watching paint dry in 4K, which, incidentally, might have a more coherent plot.In the end, 'Madam Web' is a reminder that not all heroes wear capes; some just bravely endure bad movies so others don't have to.

Despite Sony and Marvel having produced significantly inferior movies in the past, I found this one to be more entertaining and engaging compared to many other introductory superhero films. The portrayal of women and young girls is handled better and fits more naturally into the narrative than in other female-centric Marvel films. I couldn't comprehend the exceedingly low ratings it received, which motivated me to write this review. Ratings as low as 3 should be reserved for absurdities like flying sharks. For instance, ""The Marvels"" was a disappointment, and I couldn't get through the first 10 minutes. I refuse to believe that ""Madame Webb"" deserves an average rating of 3.8. Yes, Madame Webb was portrayed as a goddess-like hero in my childhood over 35 years ago, but the casting for both the lead actress and the supporting actors was commendable. Admittedly, the villain lacked depth, and the film is far from perfect. However, it was significantly more entertaining and engaging than ""The Marvels"", compelling me to stay till the end.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Overall, a terrible movie that makes Argylle seem like Citizen Kane as it feels like they tried to make a watchable movie out of terrible footage, but I got more enjoyment from the man snoring next to me because he showed more emotion than the entire cast.Terrible Direction (The direction on a macroscale was terrible because they did such a bad job at building the world and establishing the conflict (they just forced what time period the movie took place); the direction on a microscale was atrocious as the whole movie was incredibly monotonous and all of the interpersonal scenes were just laughable bad (especially towards the end); the direction of actors was terrible because all the performances were incredibly monotonous and there was no chemistry in the entire cast; the storytelling was unfocused as she had no idea where she wanted to take this movie, it felt like they were telling the story while the script was still being made; she forces the tension so much that you don't care what happens to the characters; the cut for this movie was incredibly bad because it felt like they tried to Frankenstein a film on bad footage), Very Bad Acting (Very Bad from Dakota Johnson (Shows that she is nepotism personified as I have never seen someone put as little effort into a lead performance as her; her whole character is incredibly monotonous that it rubs off on all the other actors; she is so useless in the action scenes that it makes me wonder why even make a movie on Madame Web; she has no chemistry with the rest of the cast; her performance wasn't terrible because she does have some moments that were fine, but most of these are in the exposition), Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (Her character is given nothing to work with as it is obvious she is trying to make something with what she has, but in the end, it is clear that the script is just too bad to put in a decent performance), Pretty Bad to Decent from Isabela Merced (She shows as much charisma and timing that the writing can let her), Very Bad to Bad from Celeste O'Connor (Mostly just annoying because her performance just felt so forced), Terrible from Tahar Rahim (Might be one of the worst performances in a big budget movie I have ever seen as his accent and tone were just so off that it made me cringe whenever he was on screen; not menacing at all because his character is just so poorly written; has no chemistry with any of the cast (especially Dakota Johnson)), Pretty Bad from Mike Epps (Comedic relief for like 5 minutes), Pretty Bad from Emma Roberts (Just plays herself for like 5 minutes), Pretty Bad to Decent from Adam Scott (Feels like Robin Williams compared to the rest of the cast as he has decent comedic timing and tries to establish as much chemistry with Dakota Johnson as he can), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (All the extras/side-characters feel like this was their first job)), Terrible Story (The concept is just so stupid because none of what was going on felt interesting, and the conflict makes no sense because it feels forced; the plot structure was pretty formulaic, but the main issue is that the plot elements make no sense and are incredibly forced; there are many plot holes and continuity issues; flow between sequences is terrible because it feels like they forcing are where the plot is going to go; the character writing is some of the worst I have ever seen for a comic book as Madame Web is the most boring/uninteresting superhero I have ever seen, and the villain is so poorly written because his origin makes no sense and his conflict just feels so forced; the movie has this weird relationship with the Spider-man franchise because they tried so hard to show that it's in the universe, but as the same time subvert any reference they try to make), Terrible Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious as none of what was said made sense (it felt like the script was written by an 8th grader whose homework was to write a superhero script), notable lines being 'you did it, you did it' and 'every day that goes by, my appointment with death comes closer'; the humor is so dry and forced that it was funnier when they were trying to be serious (making this a contender to be a fun bad movie); the symbolism is so overt because they try to push this concept of the family so hard, but the movie is just so bad that you don't care; foreshadowing is a key plot element for this movie as the visions help predict what was going to happen, but the issue is this element is saturated throughout the movie and it is sometimes not clear what is a vision and what is actually happening), Bad Score (The score was pretty formulaic and was just so poorly used/mixed in), Bad Cinematography (More polished than Morbious, but is still very bad in the fight scenes as they try to do so much), Terrible Sound (The ADR was atrocious as there were moments where dialogue was said without mouths moving; I genuinely feel that they hated all the footage they shot, but it was so expensive to reshoot that they tried to make the most with what they could), Terrible Editing (The number of fast cuts is nauseating as it made the movie not coherent; the way they only sometimes differentiated what was a vision and what was the present made the movie unnecessarily confusing), Very Bad Visual Effects (Over-saturated and looks incredibly fake), Very Bad Production Design (Everything looks like it's on a blue-screen), Decent Makeup, Decent Costumes (They have costumes for less than a minute just so they could use it in the promos), Pacing is pretty slow as they try so hard to make it feel longer than it needed to be (and the visions/sharp edits disrupted this flow so much that it was a chore to get through this movie); the runtime could have been cut 30 minutes and the movie still would have been a nightmare, Climax is so poorly constructed because it felt like it was directed by Michael Bay from Temu with how they excessively used visual effects (and felt so forced with its character revelations), Tone is a big issue for this movie because they tried to make a fun superhero movie (but everyone's tone is just so monotonous that this never comes into fruition), The old man obnoxiously snoring next to me showed more emotion than the entire cast of this movie.","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

They are desperately clinging to Spider-Man side characters to build a Spider-Man universe without Spider-Man, churning out one stylishly retro, lazily plotted B-movie after another, barely masking their threadbare budgets with A-list stars and half-hearted special effects.Despite the derision piled onto the Venom films and Morbius, the accusations of riding Marvel's coattails, the snark that this whole endeavor just extends their Spider-Man rights, Sony soldiers on undeterred.Madame Web continues the trend of odd casting choices and dated aesthetics, but surprisingly doesn't have a lazy plot. I don't mean to say it's particularly clever, but calling it ""lazy"" would be unfair.Unlike the pure popcorn entertainment of Venom and Morbius reveling in their own shlock value, Madame Web shows real effort to tell a grounded story. In fact, it's the only Sony Marvel entry I genuinely enjoy despite its flaws, because parts of it sincerely worked for me.The core concept is interesting - a superhero movie intentionally subverting expectations by avoiding bombastic set pieces. It ingeniously incorporates slasher film tropes, recasting the superhero origin as a more economical small-scale thriller. This mashup is fresh and full of potential, allowing budget-conscious Sony to trim the fat while pioneering new ground for the genre. With the right execution, Madame Web could have finally been a decent meal from the Sony universe kitchen.From the trailers, Madame Web exudes The Terminator vibes. Dakota Johnson is Sarah Connor meets Kyle Reese protecting the young ""Spider Women"" who are the Johnnys. The Ezekiel is the T-800/Skynet. Madame Web's precognitive powers make her the harbinger of doom in each Terminator chapter, while the Spider Proteges are the ill-fated victims connected by fate.These homages are why I found it hard to dislike, even enjoyed, Madame Web. But what truly resonated was its core theme of motherhood over heroics. It would have been more fitting as a Mother's Day than Valentine's Day release.At its heart, Madame Web is a movie about motherhood (echoing The Terminator), about daughters finding surrogate mothers, about profound love and unconventional family. The emotional emphasis is unlike anything in Venom or Morbius, not just plot devices but the true backbone.Madame Web's mother died in childbirth, leaving her with a lifelong estrangement from others. She won't ignore suffering but rejects connection - her core contradiction. The teen girl John Connors force open her guarded heart.In turn, the Spider Girls lacked parental warmth in their biological homes. Long-motherless Cassandra steps in as guardian, filling the void of parental affection. Children find the mother able to nurture them, the motherless child abandons her isolation.From their first encounter, the film quickly establishes quasi-sibling chemistry between the tough protector and her snarky but endearing wards. Julia projects childlike insecurities, Mattie stirs up mischief, Anya tries to avoid trouble. Their clashing personalities bounce off wonderfully.Cassandra schools them in emergency aid and maternal concern, earning awed admiration. Though unrelated, their interactions feel intimate and familial.Effective parallels reinforce the themes: Cassandra's first aid training ultimately saves her, the mother who sacrificed her health for her child echoes Cassandra's injuries protecting the Spider Girls, her climactic embrace of her ""web"" links those she wants to save, representing the end of isolation and connection to humanity.Peter Parker's birth also resonates, the symbolic renewal of this makeshift family.Regrettably, despite its merits, Madame Web suffers under the burdensome legacy of Sony's past Marvel missteps - disjointed editing, chintzy production design, leaden dialogue, choppy scene flow.I don't understand Sony's insistence on retaining this tawdry aesthetic. Whether deliberate or not, they show no desire to improve.Madame Web could have been so much better were it not for these constraining forces constantly dragging it back from the precipice of greatness into the realm of total garbage.That said, the cinematography does show some evolution from the dreary, detail-deprived camerawork of past installments.The soundtrack choice of Cranberries' ""Dreams"" perfectly captures Cassandra's mindset, precognitive powers and optimism in the next generation. ""My life is changing everyday in every possible way."" Did she foresee the way to Madame Web 2 and Sony's commitment to quality? I doubt it.","20 out of 53 found this helpful.

And what they want. That doesn't mean that you can't feature a strong female lead. What it does mean is that the writing has to be good, and so do the performances. Alien, Aliens, Terminator Judgement Day, Wonder Woman, Edge Of Tomorrow, The Help, The Hurt Locker, Hidden Figures, A Quiet Place, Salt. All well written, and well acted.How many screw ups does it take to learn a lesson? The Marvels? She-Hulk? Charlie's Angels (with Kristen Stewart), the all female Ghostbusters, the 355, Ocean's 8, blah, blah, blah....blah.None of the performances resonate. That's either a casting problem or a director problem. In this movie it might be both. I watched the whole movie and can't for the life of me recall any of the spider girls' names; just Johnson's Cassie, because all the girls, and fellow EMT's, kept screaming her name throughout the movie.There are so many bad parts: stay here I'm going to Peru (which was a nonsensical mess); why are the girls all abandoned in one way or another?; NO character development; Sweeney's character is an apologetic shrinking violet (but she gets up on a table in a restaurant to dance...as people do), the black teen is a toxic, snotty elite; the Hispanic girl is a Dreamer who doesn't want to attract attention. But those are all verbalized exposition. We aren't SHOWN anything. And as a result we aren't made to care about what happens to them.Cassie's scenes where she's experiencing future forecasting or revelations aren't well handled (director), and during the climactic battle scene those out of focus weird montages disappear and we're supposed to see the death of the villain as orchestrated by Cassie because she can see the future. Again, badly done.Then there's the plot and tone of the movie. They are at odds with each other. There are beats that want to call back to Sam Raimi's original Spider-Man. Unfortunately the entire thread centered on the villain is full of problems: his performance, how he escaped the jungle Spider-Man tribe in the first place, how he managed to cull photographic facial sketches from dreams, how he fails at capturing at least ONE of the spider girls. Cassie is somehow revealed to be a world class demolition car driver. Apparently necessary because she spends significant screen time behind the wheel of a vehicle.The dialogue, and jokey delivery in dire circumstances is just plain awful. Witness a bunch of deaths, and crack jokes while riding in a stolen car? Not believable. Drive said car into a forest (because that's what a person does) and demand that the three teenagers (who are not impressed by Johnson) ""stay put, and no dumb stuff"". Excuse me, what? The teens, who have witnessed multiple deaths, decide to leave a secluded area and go to a public diner...and dance on a table in front of a group of boys? Sure, that makes sense. Seriously, this movie staggers along with the most unlikely of events. Think back on the original Spider-Man comparison: Peter is a kid with extraordinary powers, navigating through believable personal challenges, while his superhero alter-ego fights extraordinary problems. Cassie's path is almost completely backward. And her transition to all-knowing Madam Webb at the end? Laugh out loud bad.And Dakota Johnson? Not an actress with the chops to do this right. And apparently her line delivery was so problematic that she had to re-dub much of her dialogue during looping. And it wasn't improved through that process. And, it's shocking to witness an actor on a press tour bad mouth the movie they're supposed to be promoting.It was rumored that Garfield or Maguire might appear. Must have gotten lost in the multiple (rarely a good sign) rewrites.But Hollywood loves money, and the opportunity to siphon some from a successful brand. Tom Holland's terrific Spider-Man trilogy has encouraged Sony to produce more films in the same universe...to mixed results.And lest you think this just about a female driven IP, specifically, there's...ugh...Morbius.What a shame.","11 out of 26 found this helpful.

Oh, it's still bad but in a super-dull and exceedingly pointless fashion. I was hoping for Corman's Fantastic Four-levels of corniness and it was just Dakota Johnson mumble-coring and dead-eying her way through meandering scene after scene that had no tension or sense.The whole movie felt like an unaired pilot for a Saturday morning kids' show called Spider Teens Stupid Force. And sadly, the most interesting part was the flashforward stuff with the kids - which is what should have been the real movie. Not EMT call after EMT call after baby shower with Adam Scott. He was bizarrely effective in a straight guy role - very caring and involving while Dakota Johnson was dreaming of Cabo or finally inheriting grandma's big cat rescue or all those Miami Vice residuals from dad.But she looks that disinterested in everything she has ever done, so I guess she was a paramedic.Anyway, it's just boring. I mean, scenes happen. Over and over. Literally. Because of her arachnid powers to endure bad screenwriting? I guess. And that stuff got really old. Quickly. We got it the first twelve times. Too bad it took her way longer to understand what was going on. Yeah, she's that dim.The villain guy was dumb and smarmy. The ending was dragged out and the denouement was setting up a sequel or show that will thankfully never happen. So yay?But shoot. I was hoping for Birdemic cheesiness.

Instead, the film carves its own path within the larger Spider-Man universe. However, eagle-eyed viewers can catch subtle references and nods to the web-slinging hero, creating a sense of connection for those familiar with the franchise. Madame Web steps away from the high-octane action sequences often associated with superhero films. Instead, it focuses on the unique world and abilities of its protagonist. This focus on character development and world-building could be a breath of fresh air for viewers seeking a superhero story with a different pace. It's important to note that Madame Web prioritizes story and character development over fast-paced action sequences. If you're looking for a contemplative film that delves into the psychic aspects of the superhero world, Madame Web might be a good choice. However, if action is a major draw for you in superhero movies, this film might not fulfill those expectations. Consider what you enjoy most in a superhero movie. If you're looking for something unique with a fresh perspective and a focus on character development, Madame Web could be worth checking out. However, if nonstop action is what you crave, this movie might leave you wanting more.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

Here goes...Am I really going to do this? Madame Web has been brutalized by fans and critics like no film in recent memory. It is down to a 3.7/10 on IMDB, and is described as one of the worst movies ever made. I was discussing this movie with my niece Hunter, and she said she would go watch it just to see how bad it was. Since she put that particular bug into my brain, against all logic I have been searching for a reason to go see Madame Web.I am rarely disappointed by a movie. I usually read tons of user reviews, and have a reasonably good picture of what I am about to walk into. The one recent movie that did disappoint me was Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. The first Aquaman movie was so amazing that I didn't follow my normal procedure and went with nothing but the highest expectations, and zero knowledge of the movie or how it had been accepted by movie goers.Well, I sat there in the theatre looking at my watch during most of the movie (I don't even wear a watch), wondering if it was ever going to end so that I could be put out of my misery. As soon as I got home I ran straight for the computer so that I could read the user reviews, and I was not disappointed. Most user reviews seemed to exactly mirror the tragic experience that I had so recently endured. Why did I not check the reviews? It was all there in black and white.My need to see Madame Web has only grown in the intervening days. I have been reading so many news articles in an attempt to find a reason to see it. I have read every positive IMDB review for this movie, and I have all but convinced myself that I am now armed with the knowledge that will allow me to watch this film, and maybe even appreciate and enjoy it. I think I have worked myself up into a frenzied state so that I can go and do something that my rational mind is screaming at me to not do.What really gets me wondering is that Aquaman and the Lost City rates on IMBD at a 5.7/10 compared to Madame Web's 3.7/10. Aquaman was filled with solid actors and amazing CG images, and yet my high expectations left me counting the seconds until it thankfully ended. Going into Madame Web with low expectations may be what saves it for me.I can't help but think about the 2004 movie Van Helsing. I absolutely adore that movie now, but at the time I saw it I was kind of disappointed. The story seemed thin, but the CGI was truly amazing. I told a friend of mine to go see Van Helsing. I told him that it was a monster flick. It didn't have the most convoluted story in the world, but what it did have was a visual feast for the eyes that would amaze him. He saw it, and he absolutely loved it. I hope this will be like that for me!*****
The fallout.*****OK...I went and saw Madame Web, and I am really glad that I did. I really enjoyed it! And guess what? I never looked at my watch once. Unlike Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, I didn't want this movie to end.Madame Web was an entertaining movie, with quite a few funny moments. Even better though was the fact that it was unpredictable. I really enjoy movies where I can't guess what will happen next.The antagonist wasn't really that great. I don't think it was the fault of the actor. I think it was a writer problem that blew up into a bigger issue, and I will leave it at that.I must say that the cool factor of a superhero who has to use her brain power to outwit a much more physically powerful (downright scary!) opponent really appealed to me. It heightened the tension so much. Now, I am super disappointed that the failure of this movie means we probably won't get to see the developed character of Madame Web work her magic against an even more powerful (and hopefully smarter and better written) opponent.Madame Web has rebounded slightly to a 3.8/10 on IMDB, which shows that more people are giving it some love now. Unfortunately, there are just too many nails in that coffin for me to believe that there will be a second Madame Web movie any time soon. Heck, we were the only people in the theatre, so if you wanted to go see it, your days are limited. I really hope that I am wrong. Perhaps Madame Web will show up in a Venom movie in the future. I would love to see that! Brains and brawn working together would be a super cool thing to see.*****
So...there you have it. I wanted to give this a 10/10 just to boost the ratings, but I couldn't. It was far from a perfect movie, but it was entertaining. When I go to see a movie I want to be run through the whole gamut of emotions. I want to be happy, sad, laugh, cry, feel enraged, and be thankful. I am the type of person who wears their heart on their sleeve. I even managed to tear up at one stage, which proves to me that there is hope for this film and its progeny.My recommendation is to go see Madame Web in the theatre. It's never the same watching a movie at home, and you won't get another chance to see this one in theatres.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

The main character is everything but a hero and the bad guy doesn't even know why he's bad... Even I wore the superhero costumes in the movie more than they did. No one knows what they are doing, just some random people running around in chaos, talking to each other as if they were in a play at a community center in a village of 37 people. The emotion in them is comparable to a person who has been in a coma for five years. If you see this movie somewhere on the net stop your internet connection! If by chance its played on the TV or else, immediately break the device it is running on. If someone forces you to watch them at the cinema, report him for harassment to the authorities.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

It was an amazing cast, who I honestly feel sorry for. I gave it one star because I like the cast... But easily the worst movie I've seen.Zero character building: Every character was one dimensional; therefore-lacks any sign of inner-relationship chemistry and totally unlikable.Awful dialogue: ""the true film's antagonist"" Left nothing to the imagination, endless audience pandering, and almost all lines were awkward. I will say, this could boost their chances of joining the ranks of cult-following b movie watch parties.. but it's technically not a low budget film. 🤷‍♀️Confusing storyline: I'll be kind to the writers and directors on this film.. I hear that Hollywood has uses these committees that oversees a lot of the direction a movie takes, killing the original vision. So much so, I couldn't tell you the point of this movie other than maybe ""girl power""? The movie moved fast and left a lot of things unexplained.Blatant product placement: I mean..maybe there's a conspiracy I can start ""Sony sold the creative rights of Madam Web to Pepsi and regretted it"". The costume choices for the heroes & villains resemble that of the Pepsi & Coca-Cola rivalry.To sum it up: Spring Cleaning Background Noise.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

We definitely need some strong female action figures.However, the laziness of saying ""let's do a female Iron Man, or a female Spiderman or whatnot"" is totally countrerproductive here, particularly in a world where superhero fatigue has taken hold.The MCU has not only raised the bar on the expectations moviegoers have about superhero movies but it has also oversatisfied the demand to the point few (if any) would actively demand more superhero movies.Sure, we're poised to consume some that come out but to leave a mark a movie needs to provide a strong story, at least above average acting and at least on-par VFX. There's really no margin for laziness here because any follow-up act has its work cut out for itself if it wants to make an impact. Doubly so when female leads are front and center (largely due to previous laziness as seen in the latest Ghostbusters installment)
But ""Madame Web"" makes no effort whatsoever. It's formulaic, lazy, beyond silly. The leads definitely have a hard time turning an awful script into an opportunity and there's just no room for them to ... you know ... act. It's a total waste of their talents to the point where I'm baffled that nobody threw the script away and ran screaming.At what point is a paycheck too little for a stain on your career? I can't directly blame them though, but I'm sure there are people in an office somewhere in Hollywood who'll land the blame on people not wanting strong female action leads.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

The creators of this web movie seems to have mastered the art of making every possible wrong decision, leaving viewers with an unbearable viewing experience.To begin with, the plot was an incoherent mess. It felt like the writers threw random ideas into a blender and presented the resulting concoction as a storyline. There was a complete lack of character development, leaving the audience struggling to connect with anyone on screen. The dialogues were cringe-worthy, filled with clichés and uninspired lines that made me question the competence of the writing team.The production quality was abysmal, to say the least. The cinematography was amateurish, with shaky camera work and poorly framed shots that induced headaches rather than conveying any artistic value. The special effects were laughable, resembling something out of a low-budget student film rather than a professional production.The acting was another painful aspect of Madem Web. It seemed like the cast was either sleepwalking through their roles or desperately trying to salvage a sinking ship. The lack of chemistry between characters was palpable, and the performances were so wooden that it made me cringe every time someone delivered a line.The pacing was torturously slow, with seemingly endless scenes that added nothing to the nonexistent plot. I found myself constantly checking the time, hoping for the misery to end. The attempts at creating suspense were laughable, as the predictable plot twists were telegraphed from miles away.In conclusion, Madem Web is a prime example of how not to create a web series. It was a painful and torturous experience that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. Save yourself the agony and avoid this train wreck at all costs. There are countless other quality productions out there deserving of your time and attention.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

Now, it's Madame Web. The plot was *horrible*. The acting was sub par and lacked any depth (I really do mean any depth). The villain was full of C-level comic book cliches and bad tropes. I honestly think of athletes foot as more scary than the antagonist.For even a comic book film, the continuity of the story line and characters was really, really difficult to follow.They appear to have done a significant amount of revising of script in post, as there were several scenes where the actors lips were nowhere in sync with their auditable dialog. This happens in many films, but it was as if I was watching a Japanese anime the sync issues were that apparent.There was not a single redeeming quality to the movie. Marvel should be so embarrassed they're listed as ""in association with"" on this piece of cinema that they invoke the morals clause and ask to be disassociated with the film.

This is not Avengers. This is Madame Web. And it was an enjoyable film of the Marvel Universe.The worst areas of this movie is some of the early CG, but it's made up by Dakota Johnson's portrayal and her onscreen chemistry with Adam Scott, as well as the young teenagers. This is very much an origin story of Cassie Webb confronting her own past to understand what she's destined for and with Madame Web it's filled with mystery and time. Visuals from Madame Web's perspective were twisting and confusing with intention, which I felt was appropriate and engaging.It's a fun movie, and while it may not revolutionize the film industry or call upon the likes of Steve Rogers or Thor for another explosive epic like the Infinity Saga, it does set up for some important arcs in the future. For an origin story that I didn't expect or even think was necessary, I truly had fun watching this one, and I'd recommend it to people that want to just shut off and watch something, and I'd watch it again.Honestly, people calling this the worst Marvel film, or for some the worst film in history are overdramatizing their own, or possibly someone else's criticism that they are shadowing. If you read the bad reviews and believe them, chances are you're already in a negative mindset going in yourself.My recommendation: stop reading these reviews believing the opinions of others who claim to know better and trust your own judgement.

But for the most part, it just means a lot of half assed movies with half assed performances from people who's last names I recognize.If Hollywood keeps this up, they should get used to diminishing returns on their big budget blockbusters.As for movies, especially super hero movies revolving around characters who took up a couple of panels in a couple of obsure comic books. I was never into it. I don't want to watch a bunch of people who did something before Peter Parker was born, I want to watch Peter Parker be Spiderman.

Madame Web was an okay movie, pretty much what I expected from the trailer and knowing Sony was in charge of making it. Was it a blockbuster thrill ride? Nope. But nothing about this movie made it worthy of a sub 5.0 rating, outside of it being part of the same boring nothing new, nothing amazing, and nothing unexpected world that Hollywood has become. It was good enough to keep me watching and not wish I was somewhere else, like The Marvels did. The Marvels was messy, discombobulated, boring crap-fest that was full of tired old tropes and gimmicks that Marvel somehow still thinks are entertaining. The acting was actually as bad in the writing, and that's saying something. The Marvels was not worthy of a 3.6 let alone a 5.6. All this just goes to show how the average person is willing to embrace mediocrity and celebrate the unexceptional as long as enough people on social media tell them how to think one way or the other. It seems Disney had more money to pay influencers than Sony did. If only these ratings could be about the quality of the movie rather than the marketing.

It may not reach the heights of superhero movie greatness, but it's definitely better than Thor: Love and Thunder, Venom 2, Echo, and a few other recent superhero offerings.

We see glimpses of what the powers -can - and - will- be, but we don't see any useful scenes of teamwork battling with said powers to bring the film together. I'm almost certain this was an attempt to create a new spider-verse with four new stars. Dakota Johnson did a really fine job in this role, and quite possibly this might be the best role I've seen her in, comical but serious, without being cliche. The villain constantly cries ""they'll destroy everything I have"" but we never learn what he has that they'll destroy. Did he build a company off the spider's venom? Did he amass his wealth by spider-stealing it? There are without a doubt a few issues with the film but the review bombing seems more of a coordinated attack on the film an actors by purists and misogynists who didn't think this film should have been made at all.

Seriously, you do not have free reign over this and whatever else just because he isn't around anymore. I am ashamed of this movie and any movie to come if this persists! Stan Lee knows that his films were left in good hands! He left it to the public to make sure that we would comment with great disgust and cancel every writer that ever gets close to destroying his work of art! I hope that anyone who ever touches on his work and changes it will never work in Hollywood again to teach them, and anyone who changes his comic books will learn a lifelong lesson! You dont mess with Stan Lee's fans! Seriously we indeed are hardcore fans, and we do not like it when people like this try to change Stan Lee's vision.

The story looked like something contrived by a twelve-year-old. I always feel sorry for actors in poorly thought-out stories; they can only work with what they are given. The bad storytelling is doubly disappointing when I think about the probability that I will not see these lead actors in a better made sequel. The bond that these four young ladies developed by the end of the movie was touching to see.Cassie: ""Yes.

Everything about this movie, like the acting, story progression, character motivations and behaviors in some situations, and photography, is awkward. It really feels like a confused movie that wasn't sure what it wanted to be or didn't know what was wanted to succeed with the story and characters. This movie also proves Dakota Johnson is a really bland actress. She is just listlessly going through motions during the movie, and watching her terrible acting is really agonizing. The other three teenage girls acting is equally terrible, especially Sydney Sweeney. This movie has really become a punch bag and object of derision for people because of its campiness and awkwardness. It's considered one of the worst superhero movies, but overall, it's just a forgettable and corny superhero flick. I think it's ideal for home watching but definitely not worth a cinema matinée.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was very interested to see how bad it could possibly be or were the critics wrong.In short no, the critics and now audiences aren't wrong whatsoever.Genuinely I have no idea what anybody associated with this film was doing. How on earth is a film like this allowed to even be green lit by the studio. Is it laziness or just a lack of care, to be honest I fear it was the potential of a quick cash grab.The only reason I'm not giving it a 1/10 is because the cast are at least trying to salvage this horror show, I don't blame them fully. Although I do wonder why on earth they even said yes to doing on it, on the basis of this script. The money must have been good! Saying that I've never really rated Dakota Johnson, she always seems to pick strange projects to be involved with. I don't dislike her or think she is a bad actress in general however in this she goes full Tommy Wiseau! I was laughing a lot when she was on screen and wasn't meant to be. The rest of the cast are trying at least apart from her.20% out of 100, its about as terrible as everyone said it was. In reality though I am saddened that this quality of film is the standard for some people to be released. I don't really have anything positive to say.You can imagine the shock I had watching this after ""Dune : Part Two"", like they were made in different worlds.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

Any criticism that I have is to educate and to elevate storytelling, not to poke holes or nitpick. With that in mind, there are not a lot of positives about ""Madame Web"".The film boasts a well-known cast with actors like Dakota Johnson (""Fifty Shades of Grey""), Sydney Sweeney (""Euphoria"") and Adam Scott (""Parks and Recreation""). Similarly, there are some characters in this movie who have genuinely interesting backstories, like Ben Parker. The moments which explore those backgrounds are the highlight of the film.I can honestly say that ""Madame Web"" is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. There were multiple times that the audience audibly laughed at moments which were not meant to be funny. The acting is poor, the script doesn't do the actors any favors and the story takes too long to develop. Not only that, but for a movie advertised as an ""action film"", there is little to no action.In filmmaking, there is a common practice called Automated Dialogue Replacement (ADR). Simply put, the actors will record replacement lines in a sound booth after a scene has been shot. Filmmakers use this technique to change dialogue when a line is muffled or when the script is altered in post-production. There is a surprising amount of ADR used in this film, specifically with the villain, Ezekiel Sims. Not only is his replacement dialogue off-putting and unnatural, but often it doesn't match the actor's mouth. This is one of the contributing factors which makes Ezekiel the worst comic book villain that I have ever seen on the big screen, and I have reviewed over 90 comic book films.""With great power comes great responsibility."" That line from the original ""Spider-Man"" film is one of the most well-known and respected pieces of dialogue in comic book history. There is a line in this movie when Madame Web is told ""When you take on the responsibility, power will come."" This insulting change of a beloved quote perfectly explains this film. There is no vision, no heart, and no real purpose. If you are going to see the movie, I would suggest going to see it in theaters, because watching it with a laughing audience makes for an enjoyable theater experience.Best Character: Anya
Best Quote: Not ""I've never said this before, but you're a really good teacher.""
Best Scene: Not the CPR scene.Best Piece of Score: ""Forgiveness""","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

It seems to be harshly criticized by the public, but it wasn't as bad as the criticism suggests. However, it's also true that it wasn't incredibly interesting either. From my perspective, it felt like the plot was too conveniently set up in favor of the villains. I think about half of the critics are just going along with the general trend and criticizing it without much thought, so I hope those who are interested will watch it without too much prejudice. The ending suggested that there could be a sequel, but given the current reception, I'm a bit saddened by the thought that a continuation might be unlikely.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

The editing is so bad it's like they just gave all the clips to a middle school computer class and told them to do whatever they want.

The villain's lip sync voiceover only added to the disconnect. What really dampened the experience was the absence of a post-credit scene-no anticipation, no boom.

She was a regular, relatable person for the duration, and a more realistic take on what someone would go through emotionally and/or mentally if supernatural things were happening to them. It would be confusing, scary, and you'd still be vulnerable. So, she doesn't instantly become a genius at using her abilities, but is still put in a position of protecting others. We got to see the disorienting progression from her perspective. I thought Dakota Johnson portrayed this well!Sure, this isn't the pillar of movie making. There are some inconsistencies, and some cheesiness, but whatever. Everybody's a critic.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

How did they even see the final cut and decided ""Yup, that's it. Good job guys."". To be fair Dakota Johnson is fine. She's working with what she's given. The 3 actresses that did the future spider something characters are okay. Their characters are empty and default anyways. We see basically nothing from them. The villain is comically bad written and portrait. He's like a villain from a 90s Batman movie, but with even less soul in him. Logic of events - don't ask for it.Just No. Don't ever do another movie like that. Better burn the money that you would use for it. It will be a better use of them.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"","","A fresh take on super heroines.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9625106/?ref_=tt_urv","JohnDeSando","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1391596/?ref_=tt_urv","16 February 2024","Just when I thought the Marvel Universe had no where to grow, along comes the endearing Madame Web. Anchored by Dakota Johnson as Cassandra Webb, with her coy smile and I-got-it attitude, this superhero barely shows her powers largely because she's not fully aware about what they are, except for a curious ability to see into the immediate future.Without the usual overdose of bombs and fisticuffs of the formulaic super-hero films, Madame Web accentuates the humanistic sides of its heroes, including three teen-age ""orphans"": Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie (Celeste O'Connor), and Anya (Isabela Merced), who hook up with Cassandra, all four on the lam from a pesty black-costumed spider out of an Amazon arachnid tribe that will eventually bring us the goody-boy Spider Man. But right now, Cassandra is at the forefront of heroic activity as she seeks answers such as the death of mom in the jungle and why her fingers tingle.I like this minimalist adventure because even usually-vacuous teens have interesting personalities and traits that, unbeknownst to them, will serve in the future as they assume their super-hero mandates. Meanwhile, jousting with Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), the man who double-crossed Cassandra's mom in '73 Amazon, means stopping traffic and trains and disorienting the bad boy in the slow revelation of Cassandra's emerging power and leadership and their own ability to survive without parents. Although Ezekiel is one of the most boring villains ever, the emphasis is on the emerging heroines.While the search for parents and roots has been a romantic staple for years, especially in super-hero films, Madame Web gives a touch of reality as our 4 heroines have realistic reasons for being untethered. They act civil, not the usual way for teens in this genre.Although the buzz on Madame Web has been modest and the time of year indicative of the studio's lack of confidence, with Dakota Johnson's Casandra in charge, I can see a bright future for a genre showing its age. Getting bitten by a Peruvian bug has definite life-enhancing advantages.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

The CGI is terrible. I was unaware that the movie took place in 2003, but the CGI is definitely from that era. I couldn't help but laugh every time they used itCassie, the MC, is a paramedic who doesn't want to help anyone or be around other people. The three girls are caricatures of their trope - the smart girl too focused on school, the nerdy girl who would be hot without her glasses, and the neglected rich girl who acts out. The bad guy grew up poor and neglected before he was able to make it on his own. Her friend just... goes along with everything without requiring any answers. Ride or die, I guess.The story is linear with no twists or turns. I typically enjoy fighting in superhero movies, but this was definitely less fighting and using the convenient terrain and super convenient options available. Whatever least surprising thing you can think of is probably what happened.It's bad, but not the same level of bad as a b movie, but not bad enough to end up being funny. Dakota Johnson had to have decided before the movie on what this movie was going to be and just stopped caring. If you like awkward humor then she might give you a few smiles in the movie.

I was interested. The outline provided in the preview was not the intriguing plot line that unfolded over the course of a two hour movie. The script was horrid and provided a very shallow starting point for the heroine. I am not opposed to ""girl power"" movies that are organic in nature but the whole thing felt forced. I am uncertain as to whether the acting was to the caliber of a high school production or if the script and direction was just that poorly done. The film oscillated between campy and drama. The script was just so stiff and provided no dynamic for the actors. The plot was fairly predictable like a teen drama on CW from the early 00's.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Imagine stepping into a world where 'wooden' doesn't just describe the acting but also the set pieces, which, one might argue, deliver more dynamic performances than our leads. The set, a marvel of budgetary constraints, looks like it was borrowed from a B movie's garage sale, adding an unintended layer of comedy to the supposed suspense.The plot, much like the decor, weaves a web of confusion, leaving audiences wondering if the real supernatural power was the ability to make the script disappear into thin air. Madame Web seems to have spun a tale too far from its comic book roots, entangling itself in a cocoon of mediocrity.In a world brimming with superhero spectacles, Madame Web swings and misses, landing in the forgotten realms of movie mishaps. It's a reminder that not all heroes wear capes; some just desperately cling to the hope that their audience will forget to write a review.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Despite her previous works, Johnson's portrayal of the titular character lacked the gravitas and depth required for such a pivotal role. Her performance felt surprisingly one-dimensional in a role that demanded nuance and complexity. It was as if she was merely going through the motions, failing to bring any genuine emotion or conviction to the character. This lack of engagement made it challenging for the audience to connect with or root for Madame Web, a crucial misstep for a film aiming to inspire and empower.Furthermore, the film's attempt to ride the ""girl power"" wave felt shallow and unearned. Characters, including Johnson's Madame Web, were thinly written, with their supposed strength coming off as contrived rather than authentic. The empowerment theme felt like an afterthought, a box checked off without genuine understanding or commitment to what true empowerment entails.The plot itself was a convoluted mess, exacerbated by pacing issues that left little room for character development or meaningful storytelling. This was a film caught in an identity crisis, unsure whether to embrace the seriousness of its potential or settle for generic action-comedy fare. Such indecision resulted in a tone that was inconsistently executed, further detracting from the narrative's impact.Visually, the film failed to impress as well. In an age where audiences are treated to spectacular visual effects, ""Madame Web"" felt outdated, with CGI that often appeared clumsy and unconvincing. Action sequences, which could have been a redeeming feature, were instead forgettable, lacking the excitement and creativity seen in other films of the genre.The dialogue did no favors either, laden with clichés and unsuccessful attempts at wit. It seemed as though the script was trying too hard to be current and edgy, but ended up feeling forced and awkward. This, combined with a predictable plot, rendered the viewing experience more tedious than enjoyable.In its attempt to highlight female strength and resilience, ""Madame Web"" significantly missed the mark. Dakota Johnson's uninspiring performance, coupled with a script that fails to truly empower, resulted in a film that is not only forgettable but also a disappointing contribution to both the superhero genre and the ongoing dialogue about female representation in cinema.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

That's just horrible; nobody acts like that. Additionally, Dakota's acting skills were subpar; her crying scene was absolutely awful, and scenes where she had to show emotion looked more comedic than sad.

I'm also a lot easier entertained than a lot of people I know, so there's that...For the cast, I think Dakota Johnson was badly miscast, but then I've never been much of a fan of her. I can't think of a single thing she's made that I've seen. Wait, am I her mother? Am I Melanie Griffith?? But seriously, terrible casting decision. They should have cast an actual actor...on the other hand, I think Mattie, Julia, and Anya were really well cast, and those girls did really well with what LITTLE they were given. Hopefully any potential sequel leans a lot more on them than Cassie. Hopefully they get someone in to write a much better script for any potential sequels, too, because there's a lot of potential for some great sequels/spin-offs.Ben was also really well cast, but then I'm kinda biased because I just love watching Adam Scott work. He may never be any kind of Hollywood A-Lister, but he's already far more interesting to watch than most of that crowd anyway. On the other side of that, though, I think Emma Roberts was badly miscast as Mary. I also think there was no real need to have Mary in as an actual character, though, because all she achieved was to obviously connect this movie to Spider-Man in a way that wasn't really needed. Just like they only referred to Ben's new love interest in a passing mention, they could easily have done the same with Mary. We KNOW by now who Ben is, we KNOW who his new lady is, we KNOW who his brother and SIL are, we didn't need Mary to appear on screen.Ezekiel was an interesting one, though. I only know him very tangentially from the books, and I have no idea what his actual connection to Cassie is in the books, aside from that a connection exists, but I know he was instrumental in one of the (MANY) major shake-ups in Spider-Man lore, so I can't really say whether I think they could have picked a 'better' villain or not. I do think they cast him really well, though. Tahir Rahim was incredible, especially considering what little HE had to work with as well. That seems to be a bit of a pattern with this movie, though. They gave their miscast characters the bulk of the work (or ANY work, as the case may be), and they give their best casting choices the least to work with.As for the actual story, well, there's not really a lot of it here. We've got Flashback + Event, Jump To 'Present', Event, Bad Guy, Trip Down Memory Lane, Showdown. Pretty light on material there. But the couple of action sequences are decent enough, and have a touch of darkness to them, so it's not all bad.I guess maybe the reason I enjoyed it so much was that I know a decent amount of the lore they're working with, and those few actors I mentioned that were really well cast DID do a lot of the heavy lifting...it's never gonna reach the heights of Spidey at this rate, or the first Venom movie, but I enjoyed it a lot more than Venom 2, Morbius, and even some of the MCU movies.Again, I REALLY hope they get better writers for any future sequels, and leave the bulk of the story to characters that are actually played by actors rather than anyone played by Dakota Johnson.","50 out of 115 found this helpful.

This film presents you mid 30's women acting like immature.teenagers,if anything this just.proves AI can have more human writing than the humans themselves. Film also has logicless scenes which will leave you chuckling as to how stupid someone can actually be and then you will start questioning your own sanity for choosing to watch this film in theatres by wasting your hard earned money on this.

While the acting holds its own (half-decent, at best), it can't save this movie from its narrative woes. Special effects are passable, but forget groundbreaking.The biggest issue? Madame Web herself. An obscure character to begin with, the film struggles to make her relatable or engaging. Her origin story feels rushed and underdeveloped, leaving audiences with more questions than answers. The plot, meanwhile, is a tangled mess, jumping between timelines and dimensions without a clear thread. Plotholes abound, leaving viewers feeling lost and confused.Dakota Johnson delivers a decent performance, but even her charisma can't salvage the script's shortcomings. The supporting cast fares similarly, offering competent performances but lacking the spark to elevate the material.Ultimately, Madame Web is a forgettable experience. If you're looking for a superhero movie with a compelling story and engaging characters, look elsewhere. Save your money and grab a six-pack - you'll be better entertained and end up with a buzz..","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Paper thin plot with terrible characters. The acting itself is more or less ok but it makes me wonder if euphoria was a fluke for Sweeney. You can say almost every actor is great in something else, but leaves you extremely confused on what the talent level here actually is. Easily the worst villain in a long time. Motives are just plain dumb. At least venom was bad but for very different reasons. You don't really blame Tom Hardy for two movies. But you definitely feel like blaming the whole cast for this one. Let's me know Kraven will be absolute trash and Sony isn't really with anyone's time. This is what happens every time when you get people to play in a superhero universe who know absolutely nothing about source material. Madame Web is so important in the comics but feels way too light here, while also feeling like the spider family didn't get the paise they deserve. I've never seen a beginning, middle, and end, of a movie and thought it was a complete waste of time. If your a comic fan, you will only be heartbroken. If you are neutral, see this not sober and judge it from there.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

From its laughable plot to its cringe-inducing dialogue, this movie manages to disappoint at every turn.The storyline, if one can even call it that, is an incomprehensible mess. Characters stumble through poorly constructed scenes with no clear direction or purpose, leaving the audience utterly bewildered and uninvested. It's as if the filmmakers threw darts at a board filled with clichés and attempted to string together whatever they hit.The performances are equally abysmal, with actors delivering lines with all the emotion and conviction of cardboard cutouts. It's hard to blame them entirely, though, when the script they're working with is filled with such stilted and nonsensical dialogue. One can only imagine the embarrassment they must have felt delivering lines that wouldn't even pass muster in a high school play.Even the technical aspects of the film are a disaster. The cinematography is uninspired, the editing is choppy and disjointed, and the soundtrack feels like it was thrown together in a hurry from a collection of stock music.In the end, ""Madame Web"" is a forgettable mess of a film that offers nothing of value to its audience.

And the result is pretty good. My only complaint about it is that they didn't show more of the three girls' future. Cause let's face it, there isn't much to see from Cassie. Oh, and it's also annoying to see the camera moving around so much while the action was on.

As others have said, this makes Morbius (previously by far the absolutely worst Marvel type movie of all time) look like Endgame. This movie is like Babylon 5 without any of the good bits. I could go on, but really there isn't much more to say.The acting itself is so bad that I genuinely believe I could have personally replaced more than one of those actors in terms of performance. The best thing that this has going for it is that the ladies are fairly pretty but again that's it.I fell asleep during La Luna and confess that I fell asleep during this particular movie as well.

Acting has been amazing, Dakota always does a good job acting as a confused person who has a particular power. The other actors and actresses have done a great job also, especially Sydney Sweeny who was also filming another movie where she is completely different character. She is a great talent and that had to be mentonied. Speaking of acting, everyone did a great job.Camera sector now. There was so many confusing shots with a lot of unnecessary zoom-ins, speaking for example about the intense scene in forest in the begging of the movie, or when Cassie her last words to the bad guy. I think the scenes were pretty intense and adding the intensity with a camera zoom was just a bit to much. Also there was too much crooked shots with a bad guy that it lost it's meaning. It would probably have way more power if the shots were normal, and only in the most meaningful shot it was crooked, or maybe it is unnecessary at all because we became aware of how dangerous the was at the beginning of the movie. There were other kinda confusing shots but it doesn't really matter because the character was confused as well so it did justice to a story.Editing and animation was overall amazing, but marvel has set the bar high with the earlier movies. Marvel movies depent of quality of animation witch is always amazing and aways deliveres to a full potential.Sound sector was also a bit off-putting at a times. There were times were it feet like charachers mount and sound weren't synchronized, maybe for two lines. The thing i liked a lot is conecting a vision to a song by Britney Spears- amazing idea! Not only visions through a visual representation, inseas create it trough another sense. Loved that one!Also the sponsors made sure we know who sponsors are haha!Anyways, the ending isn't the end. We see that there is gonna be more movies so this is probably a introduction to them. Besides that, now marvel has many ways that they could develop stories, let's hope they do good!ALSO JUST A WARNING- THERE IS NO POST CREDIS SCENE. EVERYONE WAS EXTREMELY SUPRISED.

How it ever got made is beyond me. The acting is terrible, the writing is worse and the whole direction is atrocious.I left the cinema not really understanding the point of any of it. I didn't care about the main character and she came across as being very unlikable. I didn't care about her backstory. I didn't really understand the point of the three girls in the film and the villain was absolutely terrible. He made absolutely no sense and there was no real explanation given for why he was the way he was. He was just a ""bad man"" with no depth.The whole film was so comically bad that the three people next to me in the cinema were cackling with laughter the whole way through. Scenes that we're supposed to be serious came across as being unbelievably corny. And there's even a terrible reference to with great power comes great responsibility that gets completely butchered!As I also referred in the title of this review the whole film is nothing but a cheesy product placement exercise. The amount of Pepsi in this film is insane and it's not subtle whatsoever. Characters are seen holding Pepsi cans with a Pepsi logo faced towards the camera, there are Pepsi adverts littered throughout the film and the big sequence at the end of the film contains a huge Pepsi neon sign. They're also Calvin Klein adverts and other not so subtle product placements throughout the film. It's done very poorly and is incredibly distracting. Again this got laughs from the other people in the cinema.To conclude I really don't understand why this film was made, I don't understand why you'd want to see it and I'd highly recommend no one paying money to go and watch it at the cinema.

But we all know that this is not correct. The acting is too poor as much as the script. Please don't waste your precious time trying to watch this wrong movie.While Madame Web may initially captivate with its aesthetic appeal, the charm quickly dissipates, leaving viewers stranded amidst a sea of mediocrity. The promise of an engaging narrative is shattered by lackluster performances and a script that fails to inspire. It's disheartening to witness such potential squandered in a whirlwind of superficiality. Despite the allure of its cast, the film ultimately falls flat, devoid of substance or meaning. Save yourself the disappointment and seek out a cinematic experience worthy of your time.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

There were characters including a protagonist, an antagonist and some supporting characters, there were scenes that were recorded with a camera, there was a plot written by the screenwriters and directors, there was acting performed by the actors (my favourite is when Cassie goes ""it's webbin time"" and webbed everybody) and there were sound effects and music edited in by the producers. Overall, I would consider it to be a movie made by Marvel in 2024. One of the movies ever made since Morbius, even.

Dakota Johnson is so tiresome and tedious of her characterization as the main lead in this movie.

It's honestly impressive.Until she has the ambulance crash vison that her friend dies, I will be very honest that I was intrigued and not hating at all the individual story of Cassie Webb. After that the movie started to lose me for good. In particular when the three girls were introduced, they were so poorly introduced and poorly continued in the movie that it's honestly impressive again.I'm not even gonna talk about the CGI (specially, the underwater scenes ) or the dialog quality bc lately this problems have been super frequent in this genre.

Cassandra Webb, a New York City paramedic, embodies the trope of an unwitting hero thrust into the supernatural. Her emerging clairvoyant abilities, rather than adding depth, serve as a convenient plot device that feels both forced and underdeveloped.The film's attempt to weave together the personal journey of self-discovery with the high stakes of protecting three young women from a nebulous ""deadly adversary"" falls flat. The antagonist, lacking both motive and menace, fails to evoke the necessary tension, turning what could have been a gripping conflict into a lackluster chase.Directorial decisions and screenplay choices prompt a recurring question: ""What even is this?"" The narrative, punctuated by predictable plot twists and expository dialogue, seems to underestimate its audience's intelligence. Furthermore, the film's reliance on visual effects over character development and coherent storytelling exacerbates its shortcomings.The true mystery of ""Cassandra's Sight"" is not found within its supernatural elements but in its production. The industry's persistence in churning out formulaic narratives that have historically underperformed is baffling. One wonders how such projects continue to receive the green light, ignoring the clear signals from audiences seeking originality and substance.In conclusion, ""Cassandra's Sight"" serves as a stark reminder of the creative bankruptcy plaguing certain sectors of the film industry. Its failure to engage or innovate begs the question: how can they keep doing this, knowing it always fails? The film, unfortunately, adds to the pile of missed opportunities where potential for innovation is sacrificed for the safety of the familiar, yet unsuccessful, formulas.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Some of the story was a little stupid but I thought it was an overall good movie. The spider people in this movie were so random because they had never even been mentioned in a spider-verse film and these powers hadn't either. I heard that this movie was terrible so I waited to watch it until it was on Netflix but I did enjoy the movie as a whole despite bad acting, random characters, and a story that wasn't that great. I thought Dakota Johnson did a very good job and I like her powers and story but I thought the girls she teamed up with were a little annoying and their stories of why they were by themselves were very obvious and similar which I thought was lazy storytelling. Overall, I would recommend this movie because of it's interesting fight scenes.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It seems like the consensus is that it's awful and will be on most people's worst of the year list. The thing is... I don't care. I've seen thousands of movies and am confident in my opinion. Even if everyone says it's bad, I like what I like. Want proof? The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the one that got the series cancelled and rights sold to Disney, is still my favorite Spider-Man movie (9 stars).Madame Web starts off like a typical, bland superhero flick. But it keeps getting better and more entertaining as it goes on. It has some cool action, a good musical score, and a beastly villain. They do a great job with a lesser-known character, one whose power seems impossible to translate to live-action.There are a couple of scenes later in the movie that gave me goosebumps. And I left the theater in a great mood. This is 10,000 times better than Morbius. It may not be high-quality cinema, but I found it thoroughly enjoyable.(1 viewing, opening Wednesday UltraScreen 2/14/2024)","72 out of 175 found this helpful.

For starter, like I said before, at the very least it had content that I could laugh at how bad it was. The only reason I didn't shut it off immediately was how laughable the movie was.The only actual thing I can think of that wasn't utter garbage was the use of Uncle Ben as a character and the casting of Adam Scott. Something they should've utilized a lot more but were probably worried about their contract with Disney. The concept of her powers aren't horrible but that was taken from the sane writers of the comic books. There was a jump scare that partly made me jump, but then again, why do we need a jump scare in a spiderman movie?Acting/casting: 1/10
The villain in the movie is so horribly casted and acted, it is beyond atrocious. His voice is so campy, I literally could not tell if he was trying. But most of the main characters are not necessarily bad actors but are directed and written in a way that made me think these actors were bad at acting(Dakota Johnson & Sydney Sweeney). I don't know the other two girls but they didn't do very good. Adam Scott was the only one that was tolerable, probably from being the only experienced actor.One part that disturbed me and that goes to show how out of touch with reality the writers of this show are was the point in the movie where 3 OBVIOUS UNDERAGE GIRLS started indecently DANCING above 6 or 7 COLLEGE BOYS on a TABLE. It was not only unbelievably unrealistic but also just disturbing. Keep in mind, these were girls who AUDIBLY stated they were still in high school and heavily implied to be quite young. Who in their right mind would ever allow that scene to go in the movie??Characters: 0/10
The main character is downright unlikable, the three spider-woman are written all as annoying little brats, and the villain is the most unrespectable character in Marvel history, not for what he was going to do but just because he is incredibly idiotic. He's more unrespectable than Thanos, who just straight up murders 50% of planets populations.Dialogue: 0/10Plot: 0/10WIP.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Thats why I won't go in depth and trash each individual scene it's not like there's nothing good at all, there's actually some good chemistry with the main cast. Just pair it with the fact that we have seen how great marvel can be with making movies and it looks like they put this movie together in about 30 minutes and were satisfied with filling 2024 with another flop because they just aren't quite ready to go into the next phase of marvel movies. It sucks that Iron Man and Captain America had to end but surely marvel studios can do better than this. Madame web really didn't even have any potential to begin with. I don't like to be so negative but it's a film where I left the theater not really disappointed... just sad that my pockets felt emptier.

First of all, I am not overly keen on superheroes, but I do watch them for the pure mindless action and entertainment that they prove to be. And secondly, I had no idea who the Madame Web character was, and had never heard about her, I suppose it is because I don't read Marvel superhero comic books.Yet, when I was presented with an opportunity to sit down and watch ""Madame Web"", I did so. And it was fully and wholly without any expectations, so director S. J. Clarkson had every opportunity to entertain and bedazzle me.Writers Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, S. J. Clarkson and Kerem Sanga put together a script and storyline that actually proved to be entertaining enough for what it was. It wasn't anything jaw-dropping or overly impressive, but it proved to be an adequately enough entertaining superhero movie. A popcorn movie, if you will, because the narrative requires no cerebral activity from the audience; just lean back, watch the movie and enjoy the snacks.However, I have to admit that I am a bit surprised that so many writers collectively could not manage to produce a script that proved to be more impressive or entertaining. I'm not saying that it was a bad script, not at all, because it was entertaining enough for sure, but all those creative forces should have been able to put together a more outstanding script.The acting performances in the movie were good. I am not familiar with leading actress Dakota Johnson, but she carried the movie quite well with her performance as Cassandra Webb. The younger actresses Sydney Sweeney (playing Julia Cornwall), Isabela Merced (playing Anya Corazón) and Celeste O'Connor (playing Mattie Franklin) were nicely cast and put on great performances, especially Sydney Sweeney. Of the entire cast in the movie, I was only familiar with Mike Epps and Adam Scott.I wasn't familiar with a single character in the storyline, as I don't read Marvel superhero comic books, so I don't know how true the writers were to the source material.Visually then ""Madame Web"" was good. The special effects and CGI effects were good, and definitely added something to the overall impression of the movie.I was adequately entertained by ""Madame Web"" and my rating lands on a six out of ten stars.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

The promise given to this project suffered because of it. Its central plotline needed some serious tinkering, so that a more engaging one might've been the end result.Such an improvement could have easily strengthened the performances the quartet of female lead actresses delivered.I can only hope Kevin Feige greenlights a MCU adaptation of this comic book character's adventures.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

There is none. The previews showing the spider-women is full regalia is a tease that never manifests in the movie. So the whole movie I'm waiting for a stellar climax to redeem it which never comes. Even Amazing Spider-Man 2 had enough action to cover its flaws. This movie has nothing cover its flaws.

Between the robotic script, the confusing cinematography, the weak rapport among the main characters and the melodramatic pacing, this is a slow-burn dumpster fire. Over a runtime of nearly two hours, we're fed the origin story of a group of characters who never manage to connect to the audience. They're stereotyped to comic extents without ever managing to be relatable or elicit empathy with their carefully -- or carelessly, depending on how you see it -- constructed backstories. ""Madame Web"" spends so much time constructing its narrative around a boring villain who sometimes sounds like he's struggling to be intelligible. The movie then presents the most in-your-face epilogue montage indicating the promise of a sequel, after succeeding at giving none of its main characters any identity beyond a shared trauma. Despite all the curiously bad choices made in the execution of this film, it still manages to be boring in moments. Appallingly written, poorly shot, and generally poorly executed in many aspects. How do you greenlight this? WHAT WAS THE VISION? I can't tell.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Since the release of Endgame, that trend has extended to nearly all superhero movies and shows. So I have lately been expecting every movie and show to be at least a little bit better than critics and audiences say. But in this case, Madame Web was exactly as bad as everyone says it is.I actually liked a lot of the major plot points and concepts, and several of the jokes were good. The 2 big problems were:1. All the minor details were unbelievably inconsistent and/or incorrect. I could barely follow the overarching story because I was constantly flabbergasted at how they could have possibly screwed up some minor detail so badly. The biggest one is that CPR is a huge recurring plot point for the movie, but apparently none of the actors were given even basic training on how to perform CPR (even in the scene where Web is teaching people how to do CPR lol).2. The acting was horrendous. O'Connor was the only one who tried to give a decent performance, but it's a little overacted. Everyone else is completely emotionless. Still, it is passable for everyone except Madame Web, Ben, and Ceiling Guy (the main villain who was so bad that I just watched the movie and already don't remember his actual name). Dakota Johnson didn't seem like a bad actress, but she put zero effort into her performance. It was the 2nd-worst wooden performance I've ever seen in a big budget production. Likewise, Adam Scott did decently well, but I've only ever seen him in comedies, so seeing him play serious Uncle Ben seemed like a major miscast. For Ceiling Guy, they re-recorded several lines without reshooting, so there are multiple scenes where his lip movements don't match his words, which is insane for even a low budget movie, let alone this $80M film. Plus he was a not-so-great actor given a terrible script to work with, which is a recipe for disaster.Morbius, the previous movie in this series that got a ton of hate from critics and audiences, was actually a decent film in my opinion. It was not incredible or even noteworthy, but it was still fun and I didn't regret watching it. I cannot say the same about Madame Web.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Johnson should have left home her smiley face and get into character more. Johnson should have dig the character deeper.Sony had pushed too much for this spiderverse to be on.

Sorry to say this because there is a decent cast, but I think the writers are the ones at fault here. Probably the director as well.

It's almost like the studio intended to make something that was an attack on your belief in movies.It should have been a horror movie.

The actresses and actors here are good in other films just not in this. This Marvel character should have never been given a solo film but instead I feel should have been included a little in maybe the next Spider-Man film. Our lead characters don't even get to wear any of their Superhero costumes here but instead is shown in a quick action sequence at beginning and ending of film. I also hated the fact that they created a little backstory here with Peter Parker's uncle and mom. Sony what are you doing?! Just concentrate on more Spider-Man films and not films like this one.

In trying to break new ground, the movie ends up entangled in its own ambitions, leaving audiences wondering if they've stumbled into a web of disappointment rather than a heroic adventure.The characters, unfortunately, lack the depth one would hope for in a superhero flick. It's as if they got caught in the web of rushed character development, leaving them thinly sketched and devoid of the charisma needed to captivate audiences. Even the visual effects can't save this tangled mess, as they often feel like an afterthought rather than a seamless part of the storytelling.In the end, Madam Web swings for the fences but misses, creating a movie experience that leaves you untangling the threads of disappointment. Perhaps next time, they should focus on spinning a more cohesive narrative rather than getting caught in the intricate but ultimately confusing web they've created.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

I generally appreciate most films, some are better than others but they all have a script which is acted out and hopefully good enough for viewers to follow along. I read reviews beforehand and you can see the ratings which seem to make this one of the worst films ever however I always make up my own mind.I'm not one for pandering too much to the teens, as it can be somewhat annoying and there is some of that here which may be intentional. The characters are decent here and there is some good and relevant action which comes to a climax at the end. The CGI is pretty good although I still think there's work to be done on rapid movement (running, jumping) as it never seems natural. The story played out well and I followed it with interest for the full just short of 2 hours. I wasn't aware of the story beforehand so I can't say if it was obsessively true to the comics or not, but it was a decent story.There has been talk of it being a film to just set up a sequel (that now may not be made for some time) but it worked for me as a standalone. I enjoyed it and recommended it to my daughter. Others may be far more critical but every Marvel themed film can't be Infinity War.There used to be a forum posting facility on here for each film which was great however every film including the likes of The Green Mile had one post 'worst film ever' and 'half the audience walked out' which I have never seen in decades of seeing all types of films. This may be your 'worst film ever' or you may enjoy it but it's your opinion and you'll never know unless you give it a watch.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Cassandra Webb's emotional and psychological journey ; not your typical superhero movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9627377/?ref_=tt_urv","valmont1702","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur41094987/?ref_=tt_urv","17 February 2024","Aside from the final scene and a few moments here and there (which by the way, are very efficient, catchy, and baddass ; and make you want to have more of this ""flavor""), this movie doesn't use much of the usual ingredients you find in superhero or action/adventure movies... It mainly revolves around the psychological and human journey, with an emotional growth for Cassandra & her three protégés (Julia being the most layered, sensible, and invested of the three ; Celeste being the rebel and loud one, while Anya is the smart cookie of the trio)...
The strenght of the movie definitely is the evolving bond between these four women, which obviously peaks and pays off nicely during the grand finale !What I have appreciated in this movie is how Cassandra progressively understands what's going on, her story, and how it all finds its source in the moment when she was born... And it's cool to see her embrace her powers more and more, step by step ; she grows as a person and as a superhero at the same time, because both are linked and reciprocally improve one another...The various déjà vus and callbacks are fairly interesting to look at, and the thing is that there are several scenes (that I liked quite a bit) that focus a lot on ""how it feels"" in this suspended moment... And when it pays off, I think it's always nicely rewarding !But yeah, the main problem of the film is that in different moments it feels underwhelming in comparison with the high majority or superhero movies... It is kind of uneven, the pace is a little on and off ; but at the same time the story keeps moving forward for most of the movie.Most of the actors do a good job ; Dakota Johnson (Cassandra Webb) carries the movie pretty efficiently, Sydney Sweeney (Julia Cornwall) and Adam Scott (Ben Parker) were convincing and relatable in their roles, and Tahar Rahim (Ezekiel Sims) as well as Emma Roberts (Mary Parker) both brought a certain charisma to their part.A nice touch is the reconstitution of the year 2003 (it's often way more complicated to re-create an era that takes place 20 years ago than it is to create an era that takes place 2 centuries ago ; simply because it's closer to us, we have a certain memory of it, but in fact it requires to work in a big quantity of small details in order to make it right) ; the soundtrack pays homage to multiple songs from 2003.I enjoyed the story arc of the main ""good guys"", the few Spider-Man Easter eggs were quite tasty and cool to witness, and I personally really loved the grand finale because it's explosive and intense (visually and emotionally as well) !In the end, this movie is more like a prequel to the bigger Spiderverse than anything else ; therefore you can be curious to see Madame Webb become like an oracle to Peter Parker, and the trio of Spider-Girls being like Spider-Aunts to him !The problem is that this movie doesn't exactly kill it at the box office or in the ratings !I could have gone for a 6 but I personally give it between 5 and 6 out of 10 (I went for a 5 simply because it felt closer to the movies to which I already gave a 5). But I liked it, I found it fine. I think for the most part it did fairly well what it had to do ; there just wasn't that much meat on that bone in order to consider it a very good or great one, in my humble opinion. For example (and I'm pretty sure I'm not alone on that) I really would have liked to see more of the trio of Spider-Girls in action in their suits ! Like I said, it is more like a prequel ; in many ways.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

A hilarious failure.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9647670/?ref_=tt_urv","ryanpersaud-59415","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65683941/?ref_=tt_urv","28 February 2024","I cannot believe how bad this movie is. Madame Web might be the most incompetently made major ""blockbuster"" studio film released in this decade so far. It's an honest-to-God so bad it's good movie in the making that I'm ecstatic exists, because it's so funny and totally worth seeing in theatres if cringe humour is your thing. I'm serious.There is not a single element from this film that's done right. Madame Web, for those who don't know, is an ally of Spider-man who can see into the future and therefore, helps him with crime fighting. She's supposed to be a mutant, so the bizarre origin story as presented in this movie isn't even comic accurate. How she gets her powers and where they come from is barely explained, yet factors heavily into the story as a whole.Really, a lot in this movie is just NEVER explained. It's almost as if they made a film hoping for a sequel, but also not wanting a sequel? Because on and behind the screen, it's apparent no one REALLY cared about this movie. Every single performance is absolutely terrible. Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney might as well have read these lines on the toilet and had a robot version of them on screen. The villain, played by Tahir Rahim, is...legitmately Tommy Wiseau levels of bad here.Not only does he have no screen presence and not only is his motivation absolutely hilarious (he essentially wants to kill three random women he sees in a reccuring vision, and never stops and thinks...could my actions be leading to this outcome?). But his dialog all sounds ADR and the accent he puts on is a mishmash of every ""foreign"" accent you've ever heard, and he's as wooden as a tree.The film is also really poorly shot and edited even worse. It's not just that it looks flat and boring, but it's actively confusing what's going on in many of the action and ""premonition"" scenes (often over done with effects to hide that) and what certain shots and edits are attempting to convey to the audience. Basic film making techniques are fudged here.There are so many little things in this movie, from the costumes to the casting to the sound design/engineering/mixing to the script, that just feel OFF. The dialog is atrocious for most it, often petering out with no point to it (the final line of the movie had my brother and I laughing uncontrollably because of how meaningless it was). The movie sounds terrible, with the music often too low but random sound effects too high. The three girls we follow are supposed to be teenagers, but look closer to Dakota Johnson's age, and even the clothes they wear feel oddly inappropriate.I haven't even really gotten to the plot, which is essentially the Terminator except worse in every regard. There are probably a bunch of plot holes and contrivances I haven't even thought of yet. The plot actually feels like a fever dream and written by kids. I'm not exaggerating.I could go on and on, but you get the point. If you love cringe inducing bad movies that inadvertently teach you about what makes good films good, look no further. This really represents the bottom of the barrel for superhero films this decade. Incredible.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, the writers that Sony hires are terrible. Sony is only concerned at making things look cool and for this film that's funny because not many things looked cool.. Without spoiling the movie, I can say is this movie has the backbone of a final destination film that should've never been made. This movie will make you scratch your head.

These include the way that women have to stick together in a world where certain ego-driven men are out to hurt them, while the cops refuse to help. The way they are treated even by supposed loved ones. It has entirely too many characters; they should probably have stuck with just Cassandra and Julia, and not include Anya and Maddie. Other than the last one, and a scene stealing Emma Roberts, none of the actors seem 100% comfortable with the characters they're playing. It doesn't appear to me that it's a matter of talent on the part of the performers - rather, it's the material they were given.The special effects are severely underwhelming. Action in this movie is just not that engaging. The script has too many different ideas that don't gel together. There is absolutely no way that The Terminator by way of Final Destination should be this boring. It reeks of studio notes. The director did substantially better work on the amazing Jessica Jones and the great The Defenders, so it's not that she doesn't know what she's doing. There are some neat ideas such as the way on multiple occasions we see the protagonist through webs, sometimes actual arachnid ones, frequently it is broken glass that ends up looking like it. 4/10.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

It is a normal movie to watch one day at home or family who wants to try something different.As a fan of Marvel, but especially of Spiderman, you forget that it is a superhero movie because of the plot of the movie. It is true that a man in a black suit dressed as Spiderman begins to chase 3 teenagers throughout the entire movie, but it is more of a plot of murderers than the whole thing.Personally, I didn't like changing the entire plot and removing Spider-Man from the movie, because the plot required having someone powerful to be able to fight Ezequiel Sims. The powers aspect was too distant, and it is impossible for me to believe that someone with super strength, spider sense, regeneration, etc. Was defeated by a normal person who could only see the future.Dakotan Johnson said in an interview that the script was completely changed after they signed the contract for the film, which is seen to be true due to the constant cuts in the film, the forced scenes without deep dialogues, the fillers of the girls for wanting to be teenagers and an Ezekiel plot for not wanting to make a plan to get revenge in the future.One of the things that bothered me was changing Spider-Man's iconic phrase, but not only that, it was removing him from the map completely. I understand that Sony wants to give importance to secondary characters in the universe, but in reality we fans only want to see Spiderman and Spiderman Variants, nothing more. But ask them about all the projects that have the name Spiderman that are well received. So the question is, why make a movie fail by removing the star producer? WE WON'T KNOW.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

And in fact, I walked into the theatre stone cold sober, because I wanted to be coherent and present as I watched this so-called train wreck unfold. But then the movie started. And I'm going to be so honest with you - I don't think this film is as bad as the critics say.When you walk into a movie titled ""Madame Web,"" there's a certain level of quality that you should expect; i.e., you should probably expect the movie to be god awful. And that's exactly what I was expecting. And maybe my rock bottom expectations actually made me enjoy the movie more than I thought I would, because not only didn't I think that the movie was awful, but I also thought that it was a pretty high quality film based solely on entertainment value. Because I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained.After a shaky opening scene that did have me regretting every life decision that I've ever made that lead up to the moment I bought a ticket for this movie, I started to notice something curious: ""Madame Web"" actually had some competence behind the camera. The kinetic editing and camerawork caught my attention immediately, as it wasn't something I was expecting from a movie rated this poorly. And so, I continued to watch with slightly higher expectations at this point; and then Dakota Johnson appeared on screen - and she was actually giving a good performance! At this point I was shocked; reviews criticized Dakota's acting, as well as the script, but I just wasn't getting that overtly horrible feeling that others seemed to be. And so I continued watching - and I started to have... I started to have... fun.Less a superhero film and more of ""Final Destination"" lite, ""Madame Web"" turns into a chaotic adventure film of sorts, following four women who try to avoid death at every turn, complete with premonitions of impending doom and elaborate getaways. I started to really enjoy the loop of the film so to speak, where Dakota would have her visions of a potential future death and then get to work on changing said future - it's nothing innovative, but I haven't seen something like this done since the last ""Final Destination"" movie, and as a big fan of those films, I was having fun with what ""Madame Web"" was doing. And I was also having fun with its characters.The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor had a lot of fun chemistry together, and not to mention, are eye candy to the extreme, and so I enjoyed watching them play off each other. Sure, they aren't believable in the slightest as high school students, but I really didn't care because of how much I was enjoying watching them on screen (and yes, their beauty may have something to do with that). But besides that, I did have fun with their interactions with each other and with Dakota; once again, critics mentioned how horrendous they thought these three actresses were and, once again, I just failed to see that. (I also really enjoyed a sequence with all of them and a certain Britney Spears song playing - it was so much fun!).And I'd be amiss if I didn't mention, once again, the competency behind the camera, because I legitimately really enjoyed the direction and editing here. I found it to be surprisingly kinetic, with a really great sense of urgency and energy. I expected this movie to look and feel like a direct to DVD movie, but it really didn't.Listen, I fully thought I would hate this movie, but I didn't. I liked it. This isn't a great film, this isn't a cinematic classic, and it isn't even high cinema, but it is a good time at the movies. And that's all it needed to be.","20 out of 46 found this helpful.

However, my excitement was quickly shattered as I sat through what can only be described as a colossal disappointment, leaving me yearning for the wasted hours back. Regrettably, Madame Web proves to be an exemplification of everything that can go wrong in the superhero genre.First and foremost, the film suffers from an abysmally weak and poorly crafted narrative. It fails to establish a coherent and engaging storyline, leaving viewers perplexed and detached from the characters' plights. The lackluster script seems more like a feeble attempt to join random dots rather than a thought-through plot, further exacerbating the shallowness of the overall film.One of the most glaring issues in Madame Web lies in its squandered potential for character development. With a fascinating protagonist boasting a unique and intriguing backstory, one would expect depth and complexity. Unfortunately, the filmmakers neglected to explore the depths of the titular character, leaving her largely two-dimensional and devoid of the emotional resonance required for a compelling superhero tale.Moreover, the film's pacing is reminiscent of a slumber-inducing snail. Instead of leveraging action sequences and injecting adrenaline into the story, Madame Web becomes an exercise in patience. The movie drags on with a plodding tempo, causing disinterest and ultimately disengagement from the audience.On the technical front, the special effects are embarrassingly underwhelming. In today's age of advanced CGI and stunning visuals, Madame Web falls egregiously short. The lack of attention to detail is apparent, and the visual effects seem outdated and unimpressive, detracting from any potential for visual spectacle that could have captivated viewers.In addition, the film suffers from incompetent direction and subpar acting performances. The cast appears disengaged and uninspired, failing to evoke any genuine emotion or connection. The characters' dialogue often feels forced and devoid of authenticity, amplifying the overall artificiality of the movie.To add insult to injury, the film's marketing campaign created unrealistic expectations that Madame Web would deliver an enthralling and immersive superhero experience. Sadly, it fails to live up to even the most forgiving of expectations, leaving audiences disheartened and questioning the mainstream superhero genre's diminishing creativity.In conclusion, Madame Web undoubtedly falls into the category of abstaining superhero movies to be avoided. Its abysmal narrative, shallow character development, sluggish pacing, subpar visual effects, and lackluster performances combine to create an overall underwhelming film experience. For devoted superhero enthusiasts and casual viewers alike, I strongly advise staying away from this cinematic travesty and investing your time more wisely elsewhere.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

From its convoluted plot to its uninspired visuals, this film is a frustrating misfire that fails to live up to even the most modest expectations. The narrative is an incoherent mess, jumping between timelines and introducing characters with little to no explanation. The central villain's motivations are muddled, and the supposed ""twist"" ending lands with a thud. By the time the credits roll, you'll be left wondering what you just witnessed more than anything else.Bland Performances, Clumsy Spectacle: The talented cast struggles to elevate the weak material. The dialogue is clunky and expository, delivering forced exposition and lacking any genuine emotional connection. The action sequences are equally forgettable, relying on generic CGI and uninspired choreography.It's particularly disappointing considering the potential Madame Web held as a character. Her unique abilities and connection to the spider-verse could have made for a compelling story. Unfortunately, the film squanders this potential, leaving audiences with a hollow experience.Save your money and your time. There are far better ways to spend your movie-going experience.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The whole movie felt like sitting at a show with a magician who had lost her magic desperately trying to find the card that was picked.

If you can expect more of a thriller which feels like that what this film is trying to be.Plot was okay. Acts like an origin story for Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson). She gets her abilities after nearly dying from a fall. After she can see glimpse of the future and tries to save others from getting killed. She sees three young girls being targeted by Eziekel who is like the bad guy verson of spider man without the webs. His reasoning is those three girls become spider woman in the future and they stop him from being powerful.The cast ensemble did okay. Dakota Johnson. Sydney Sweeney. Isabela Merced. And Celeste O'Connor all did great with there roles.The script has some cheesy dialogue. Or could have been better written. The action sequences are okay. S. J. Clarkson direction on handling the action scenes are decent. Clearly had trouble trying to keep a coherent action scene put together. It could have been a whole lot worse.Will say do not expect a spider man film quality. Expect more of a thriller of Dakota trying to help three girls escape from a strong skilled villain. Also dont expect to see the spider-woman on screen. Which could have been cool to see more of. You only get brief moment of all three girls in a spidey costume which was a glimpse of the future that we may never see again.Overall, the film could have been worse. Acting was okay. The script was iffy. The action was uninspired and passable.","17 out of 38 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, my optimism was quickly dashed as I realized that this film truly lived up to its negative buzz. It's not just bad-it's catastrophically so.Dakota Johnson, bless her heart, seemed to be operating on a completely different wavelength from the rest of the cast. Despite her valiant efforts, she couldn't salvage a script that was so woefully inadequate that it could sink even the most talented of actors. Adam Scott, who usually delivers solid performances, was sadly underutilized, leaving me wondering why they bothered casting him in the first place.The story, such as it was, felt like it was just getting started when the credits began to roll. It's as if the filmmakers forgot to include the actual plot and opted instead for a haphazard collection of scenes loosely strung together.My curiosity led me to investigate the writing team, and what I found was alarming. It took four people to pen this disaster, two of whom were responsible for other cinematic disasters like Morbius, Dracula Untold, and Gods of Egypt. Combine that with a director who seemed to have lost their way, and it's no wonder this movie ended up being such a trainwreck.There were moments where I found myself chuckling at the unintentional humor stemming from the cringe-worthy dialogue. It's as if the writers had never heard a real conversation in their lives.Even the usually reliable Sydney Sweeney couldn't escape unscathed from this mess. It's a shame to see such talent wasted on a project like this.And let's not even get started on the special effects, which looked like they were lifted from a mid-2000s video game.In conclusion, Madame Web is a comic book movie that fails on nearly every level. With a disjointed plot, uninspired performances, and laughable special effects, it's a film that should be avoided at all costs. Here's hoping that the next outing for this iconic character fares far better in the hands of more capable filmmakers.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It definitely was an origin story movie, but there were five main characters, and only one origin story was told. It felt rushed, yet it was a 2hr movie. Honestly, it had the feel of a CW TV show/Netflix movie. Definitely should not have been released in theaters.

It needed a much higher energy actor, and she is so one note that just her personality and delivery made it seem much dryer and slower than the writing actually provided. That's a shame that they didn't cast it better. There are so many truly strong young women who could have gotten an entirely different delivery from this role. This child has zero charisma.Chloë Grace Moretz, or Bella Thorne would have been so much stronger, or a list of 30 other young women.The script was not actually that bad, and in the hands of a better casting agent and perhaps director, this would have been a very different film.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Was it perfect? No. Was it Spider-Man, Capt America or Ironman? No. Why does everyone expect the next movie to be better than the rest? Madame Web was more story than action and when there was action it was decent. However, they should have done something different for the final showdown. I don't think this is a spoiler, but the warehouse and endless fireworks...? What was that? The end with the three girls in Spider-like costumes was a little cheesy and looked more like a network wanna-be superhero show and could have been done a little grittier/darker.This is a very watchable superhero flick that is far better than the three-point-something stars that it has while I write this.

This illustrates not only the flaw of the 0-10 star system, but a generally skewed sense of just how good/bad this movie really is.First of all, is this movie great. No, it isn't. But it sure isn't a 3.8 either. I've given this a 6 because it does some things right and some things wrong. The general story of Madame Web is interesting and its a story worth watching to see where the writers are going with the character.Anyway, I'll break down what I liked and what I didn't in a pro-con list.Pro:I enjoyed the story and development of Madame Web. Its a deviation from the comics but it works here, fairly well.The music is decent throughout. There are some timely pop songs here and there but the score itself is also decent.Madame Web's powers are also quite cool. By the end of the film I think they did a good job illustrating how powerful her precognitive power can be. Aside from some wonky cgi the last action scene is pretty fun.Con:The dub on the villain is not good.The 3 girls are not written well
Dialogue is generally high-school level (though I feel this movie is mostly targeted at a high-school audience, so this is passable)
Some of the actors are weak in their roles
Quite a few unbelievable scene interactions (especially in the first half of the movie. Dakota Johnson seems to struggle carrying lead roles like this.)In any case, it isn't a great movie but it is definitely watchable. I think people need to step away from extremely harsh or extremely positive reviews for any movie. People who gush about how much they hate/love a thing are rarely the ones that fairly describe something's quality.At the end of the day, Madame Web is a middling superhero movie right there with other Sony productions.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Instead of delivering a coherent storyline, it felt like the writers threw together a mishmash of Spider-Man comic book elements without any regard for cohesion. Madame Web, a character ripe with complexity and intrigue, was reduced to a shallow portrayal that failed to engage or resonate with the audience.The pacing was another major letdown. Scenes dragged on endlessly, lacking any sense of urgency or purpose. It seemed as though the filmmakers were padding the runtime with unnecessary filler rather than focusing on meaningful character development or advancing the plot.Visually, the film fell flat. In an era where audiences have come to expect stunning CGI and immersive visual effects from superhero movies, 'Madame Web' failed to deliver. The action sequences lacked excitement and failed to capture the dynamic energy of Spider-Man's world.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of 'Madame Web' was its disregard for continuity within the Spider-Man universe. Characters behaved inconsistently, and key plot points contradicted established canon, leaving fans feeling confused and frustrated.Overall, 'Madame Web' failed to live up to its potential as a compelling addition to the Spider-Man franchise. With its disjointed plot, sluggish pacing, lackluster visuals, and disregard for continuity, it's a film that falls short on every front. Fans of the web-slinger would do well to steer clear and invest their time elsewhere.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Incompetent in its plot, editing and its obsession with Spider-Man whilst still being too scared to even mention him by name. However, as a throwback to the early 2000s era of comic book movies with enough enjoyably bad moments it can at least rise above Morbius.Dakota Johnson gives a fascinating performance that is simultaneously so disinterested in everything and occasionally holding the whole thing together. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are all given very thinly sketched caricatures that they and their chemistry can only do so much with.Tahar Rahim's performance might be a new low for villains in cinema. Undoubtedly done dirty by the ADR that isn't even trying to sync up with what's on screen but even without that every single line is so stilted in his delivery. He's so one note and considering that one note is irredeemably evil it's distracting how little presence he has.S. J. Clarkson is director, co-writer and an executive producer which still wasn't enough for any vision to survive into the final product, which is factory assembled all the way down to the poorly rendered, CG heavy finale. That being said, the majority of it relying on sets and locations means it crosses a bar that depressingly few recent films in this genre have been able to.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie is actually a lot more dark and violent then most marvel movies I have seen recently.If I could pick out 1 thing that maybe could have been better I would say tell a little more history about the spider that gives the powers and how they found them.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

Knowing how she is like, there wasn't much need to make a movie about Madame Web, but they decided to do it anyway. The film presents a version of Madame Web with an origin story somewhat different from that of the comics, but retaining some elements of her character. The film falls short of meeting certain expectations of what many expect from a Marvel film, but this alternate universe produced by Sony shows a different approach.The films of this universe were made according to the focus and nature of the main characters. The Venom movies were made based on the character's personality and humor. Morbius was made as a more updated vampire movie. The thing about Madame Web is that it was made as a supernatural thriller. It is a basic film without much to go into depth that seems to return to those superhero movies made in the 2000s like Daredevil, Catwoman or Elektra. The way Cassandra Web's clairvoyance is handled makes the film partly a thriller almost in the style of Stephen King's The Dead Zone. A notable change in this film is its lore where the Spiderman myth is more oriented toward the supernatural than science fiction. The film does have an interesting story, but wild camera movements and some inexplicable scenes make the film look strange. The script change that was made during filming is not very noticeable, but there are a couple of flaws in the script and in the dialogue. The director of this film had previously participated in Jessica Jones and The Defenders and it should not be a challenge for her to have made this film, but since her entire career was only limited to television productions, it is clear that her first work in a film for cinemas it was not going to be easy.We are introduced to 3 Spider-Women and we have already seen one of them in Across The Spidervese, but it must be clarified that they do not come into action because this is an origin story that focuses mostly on Cassandra and not on the girls she protects. Let's say this movie is a kind of pilot episode for some future Spider-Women saga, so you can't expect much. The trailer and advertising was quite misleading because some expected to see the Spider-Women in action, but obviously that was not going to be the case. You can understand that disappointment.The villain of the story is Ezekiel Sims, who already had a cameo in Across The Spiderverse and here they decided to give him a suit almost similar to that of Miles Morales. Admittedly, Ezekiel is a little clumsy here and isn't very intimidating. Although most of the actresses fit the characters well, the best of the cast is undoubtedly Dakota Johnson, who has gained fame thanks to the Fifty Shades Of Gray saga or the remake of Suspiria. She fits in well as Cassandra Web, but it's a shame she didn't have such a good time on set. One thing that's very fascinating is that we're introduced to a young Uncle Ben as Cassandra's sidekick and Peter Parker's mother, which helps provide a tie-in to The Amazing Spider-Man even though they wanted this movie to stand alone. Cassandra's friendship with Ben Parker is a good indication of how Madame Web relates to Spiderman.In conclusion, Madame Web is not better than Morbius, but she does not deserve so much rejection. It is a simple and easy to digest film that manages to entertain. It should even have a sequel to see more about the Spider-Women, but apparently that will be difficult due to low acceptance. In the end it is not a bad movie, people simply saw it with the wrong perspective and failed to understand that it is something different to introduce a part of the Spider-People that we need to know. In fact, since they introduced us to the Spiderverse, they left open the possibility of knowing the different versions of Spiderman that exist and it is a vast universe that is interesting to know. It is best to watch Madame Web taking into account that it is a supernatural thriller and a pilot that focuses more on the origin of Madame Web and not on the Spider-Woman, that will obviously be reserved for a possible future film. My final rating for this movie is a 7/10, which is certainly more valid than all the bad ratings it has received.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

This turd of a flick swings from baffling scene to baffling scene with all the grace of a drunken elephant on a tightrope. Dakota Johnson does what she can, which isn't much given that the script probably arrived on set scribbled in crayon on the back of a napkin. The characters are about as deep as a puddle in the Sahara, and the story? What story?The CGI looks like it was done by a high schooler on a pirated copy of Photoshop, circa 2001. Every scene that's supposed to be ""epic"" is about as compelling as watching paint dry, if the paint were also insulting your intelligence every minute it fails to dry. The villain, Ezekiel, has the menace of a soggy paper bag, and every line of dialogue he spews is cringe-worthy enough to be considered a war crime. The action sequences are a jumbled mess where it's nearly impossible to tell who is punching whom, but you'll find yourself rooting for them to just knock each other out so the movie can end.In conclusion, ""Madame Web"" is a cinematic abomination that should be flung into the deepest, darkest pit of forgotten films. It's a perfect storm of awful - a catastrophe that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. If this movie were a web, it'd be the kind that you walk into accidentally that sticks to your face and ruins your day. Save yourself the agony and avoid this pile of garbage at all costs.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Based on the Marvel character of the same name, the film is reported to be the fourth installment in Sony's infamous Spider-Man Universe. Unfortunately, this might be the only time we'll see said character on screen as the film is proving to be a critical and commercial failure, with many people deeming it to be one of the worst superhero movies to date. That being said, there's a good chance this film will have a chance of being looked back on for reasons completely different than intended.The film follows the titular Cassie Webb who ends up confronting her origins and past while trying to save three teenage girls from the future sensing villain Ezekiel Sims. Right from the get go, Madame Web's central problem is how poorly the filmmakers tried and failed to not only connect this should be stand alone feature into their own universe, but also bit off way more than they could chew storywise. The main storyline of Cassie rediscovering herself is too straightforward and perplexing for its own good, not helped by a stiltedly flat performance by Dakota Johnson, and having three different heroines come into play just makes things even more convoluted. It feels like Sony had no faith in this feature to stand on its own two feet and chose to squeeze in too many characters without fleshing any of them out at all. In addition, the dialogue is lousily written and does not sound like how anyone on planet Earth would communicate with one another. It's really telling how poorly written this movie is when even the leads don't sound like real humans one can relate to.On top of how poorly constructed the film's storyline is, many plot points that should have been explored either get ignored or get brought up out of nowhere. One could argue that certain plot beats were done as a means to hint at possible sequels, but when little explanation is given to Ezekiel Sims' own motives beyond being cartoonishly power hungry, then that's a sign that a lot more time was wasted than it should have been. Also, for a superhero movie, there's surprisingly a lot more talk than spectacle, as hardly any action comes afloat and any sequences that could be enticing are bafflingly edited and are hard to comprehend. It's to a point where sequences that are supposed to give off the feeling of intensity and suspense feel sloppy and pitiful rather than natural. Not to mention, so many character actions make little to no sense, and certain moments where Cassie and the girls try to protect themselves result in some of the stupidest coincidences you'll ever see in a superhero movie. It's sad how this movie is light on action and somehow lighter in brains.However, with all of those faults said, this movie is a surprisingly hysterical disasterpiece from near start to finish. While it isn't without its utterly boring eye-rolling moments, just watching the admittedly talented cast trying their darnedest to make their lines of dialogue sound convincing is just enough to snicker at profusely. The script is already laughably broken, and the direction from a first time feature film helmer coming into play just adds into the absurd incompetence displayed on screen. The visual effects feel so out of place and come out of left field so much that one would think they're tripping out instead of seeing a widely released movie from a major Hollywood studio. Lastly, the music score is as subtly interwoven into the feature as the constant barrage of product placement throughout the runtime, including one scene in the third act that had the guts to try and make Pepsi seem like a threat. As much as this film is painful to watch and hard to follow along, at least there is some ironic entertainment value from the baffling ineptitude shown in just under two hours.By coming off as more laughable and bizarre than enticing, Madame Web should be analyzed as a perfect example on how not to make a superhero film. The story is heinously convoluted, the characters are vastly underdeveloped, the acting is hopelessly wooden, and the other filmmaking qualities are utterly broken at the seams. Because of all that, this film has the chance of developing a cult following as a delightfully disastrous thrill fest, and there's a good chance people will get more value out of this for different reasons than the studio intended. I'm sure glad I got more out of it than I thought I would.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Here's what it's got going for it: this is a Spider-Man movie in which the spider man character is the villain, it gives us an origin story/mythology for the power-imbuing arachnid, and the precognitive abilities of Cassie Webb allow for some entertaining action sequences.

I'd like to believe, in his backstory, he is rolling up to Texas 2k's with his straight sleeper, when he isn't saving lives of course. I assume since it takes place in the early '00's he probably had a 383ci small block with a healthy cam and maybe some light head work.But the real problem with the story is the thin character development, undeveloped backstory, and offensive costume designs. I think it's easy to blame the writers and director, but in reality they under pay the writers and fire them before they have time to qualify for healthcare. Then they, the executive producers/ creative producers, hand off a half baked script to a director and basically breathe down the director's neck because they love to micromanage. Plus you have studio executives putting in their random 2 cents about what they want to have in the movie whether it makes sense or not.All in all unless you're a fan of Adam Scott and clean G-Bodies you should pass.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

That's one of many examples of how bad the writing is. It felt like a movie by A. I., but they would be an insult to A. I. This movie was soooo boring! I almost fell asleep when watching this. It's laughable how bad this movie is. The one thing it had going for it was Ben Parker (Adam Scott). Scott really did the best with what he could. Don't even get me started on Ezekiel! He felt like such a minor inconvenience, which takes away from our main characters. He came off as such an inconvenience, but was a big threat to the girls. That just made them seem weaker than the movie was making them out to be. In my opinion there was just zero chemistry.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

A good rating for this movie would be around 6.5, so I gave it a 9 to outweigh the overwhelming amount of negative dissertations.Frankly, I think the downvoting is a mix of misogyny, hate against Sony and abysmal disdain for anything that promotes diversity and inclusion.

A. S. H. movie or his biopic.Talking voices the Archetypal villain of this project ""Ezekiel Sims"" (Tatar Rahim) must have had his speech dubbed in post production or it's just annoyingly distracting.The movie is very loosely based on the Marvel comic ""The Book of Ezekiel"".Mike Epps is wasted as Paramedic ""O'Neil"" and used in only 2 scenes.Don't expect to see Spider-Man either.It is the fourth overall film of Sony's Spider-Man Universe movies without Spider-Man following Venom, Venom: Let There Be Carnage and Morbius.BTW Product placement is at an all time high with the Neon Pepsi Sign in the final act.Dumb Stuff:

I was thinking, it can't be as bad as they say. Believe me when I say, it is. The script and screen play are the worse part of the movie. It feels like it was written by film school freshmen. So the actors didn't have much to work with to begin with. I believe Dakota Johnson would have been great for this if given a better material and the appropriate direction. I believe the production lost sight of the kind of movie they were doing and what the audience for this would expect. There's way too much talking and since the script is bad it's really annoying. One hour into the movie and really not much relating to the actual story of madame Web happens. I'm tired of the portrayal of teenagers in movies as annoying brats who are rude and never listen. I raised 2 teenagers who never behaved that way. I met all their friends from school and sports and never experienced the stuff I always see in movies and tv shows. But I digress, back to the movie. The going forth and back of Madame Web seeing the future was very annoying. Of all the movies in that category i cannot think of a worse one. Some people thought Catwoman with Halle Berry was bad. Well, compared to Madame Web, Catwoman should have won an Oscar. Now I even think the current rating of 3.9 here is way too high. I couldn't finish the movie. I quit at around 1 hour and 15 minutes. I'm glad I was able to doze off for 15 minutes during that time and got some much needed rest. Movie theaters are very comfy to sleep in while watching a horrible movie.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's very simple and runs through a 3-act structure. As you can imagine, it plays by the rules and gives a 1st act which establishes characters. In the 2nd act, we get conflict and in the 3rd act you have the cliche final boss ending. Nothing special in the story per-say, but it was serviceable and did its job. Of course, more could have been done but when Spider man 3 did a lot everyone hated it. But, when Madam web keeps it simple we want more action, more character development (i.e, spider women) and that's okay, but did the story we have here not entertain and achieve its albeit limited goals? It gave us an origin story so anyone who says the story is bad is a lier. It's at least serviceable or average.Cinematography: 8
I loved the shots; there was an absolute variety of shot sizes, angles, and movements here. You will appreciate how diverse the camera works and how complicated the shots are (e.g., diner scene). Sure, it zooms in but that's a style and I do respect a cameraman have style with a flair of creativity.Acting: 6
I feel like acting here is average and while the female leads do a great job the villain sounds so funny. It feels like the original actor's voice was bad so they got a guy to ADR over him... it's just weird and a sad thing that's happened here. But all the actors ultimately do their job and, other than the villain, I never got pulled out.Sound: 8
Sound is great here; as you would expect, everything has been functioning properly. Sound effects match and even music is awesome and enhanced the viewing experience.Action: 7
Sure, there isn't a whole lot of action here. We have an opening dream of action happening and that's awesome. But, we do get action scenes sprinkled throughout and I felt that was a smart thing to do. Have some character development, then action, and repeat: every action movie does this.Characterisation: 7
I think people need to be humble on this because it is an origin story for Madam web. Yes, all the characters like the spider women and the villain should've been written better with more character. But, it is about the protagonist over anything else. Imagine if people hate Jay Jon's Jameson because he doesn't have a ""background"" story. My point, side characters can be just that, just like how in Batman movies Rachel never had character development but bounces off other characters who will get it.Criticisms:
A lot of people simply hate this film because either it's female lead or because the trailer promised a really spider woman-packed film and didn't at all deliver in that respect. It's true, you barely see them as spider woman but the villain and Madam web was enough for me to be engaged.Other issues are the writing? Well that reflects things such as story and characterisation and to be honest.. story was better than character yes but character was average because Madam Web is the focus. They could've focused on all the characters, but the movie insists on focusing at Madam Web.Do the spiders look fake? Yes. Does Madam Web's costume look weird? Yes. Why didn't the protectors at the beginning grab the spider? See. Okay, so there are critical issues with the film but it was just a fun watch and that's all I wanted. We all wish this could be like Nolan's works but they're not; they're not Oppenheimer.A 6 seems fair as it brings together the people who like the movie and hate it. We can come together and say it was a good movie, not great.","11 out of 26 found this helpful.

Because this film doesn't really work on any level and the only reason I didn't want to claw my eyes out from boredom was that I was constantly fascinated to see what basic filmmaking and storytelling techniques it was going to fail to execute next. It was like watching a car crash in real time and I couldn't take my eyes of it for all the wrong reasons.Credit where credits due, there is actually some actual ingenuity behind the camera here but almost every scene feels like it's shot by a different director. At its best it's inconsistent but at its worst it's totally incomprehensible both tonally and visually. I liked this central trio quite a bit but the character's outside of them fell totally flat, to put it mildly. Dakota Johnson gives a boring performance for an even more boring character. Her power are poorly executed with some pretty nauseating editing and her connection to other characters from the Spider Man universe feels like a needle drop for no one.I actually feel quite bad for Tahar Rahim here because this has got to be one of the worst villains I've seen in a movie, maybe ever, and that character is essentially the personification of everything that's wrong with this movie. His backstory and motivations make no sense, everything he does is horribly executed because of the atrocious CGI and almost every line of his sounds like it's been overdubbed and it's as distracting as it sounds. Every scene in this movie is either over too quickly or dragged out way too long. I think for the first half I couldn't help but be amazed at the disaster that was unfolding in front of me but by the time the second half came around I was just bored and I wanted it to be over.I don't even know if I can truly blame the actual filmmakers of this movie because this entire thing just reeks of something that was torn apart in the editing room by studio execs. The problem is that I doubt it was a very good movie to begin with. I don't know who Madame Web is for but more importantly I don't know why it exists beyond the most cynical of corporate greed. I actually did kind of enjoy watching this movie to a degree but in the same way I enjoyed watching The Room or Cats. This entire film feels like the embodiment of all the worst aspects of the current superhero movie climate. I'm never happy to see movies fail but I need the incoming flop of Madame Web to be a sign that things have to change for this genre to thrive again.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

The problem is not due to having four leading women. The problem is that the film just isn't good. How dense can you be anyway? Madam Web existed far before 2024 and nobody had a problem with the leading female character. So why are you so fragile that you think that's what is upsetting people here? In fact I'm upgrading the score to 4 stars, one for each leading woman, for a film that should be rated 1. The casting was fine, and the way they shot the clairvoyant sequences was really really cool. Seemed very well thought out and for most of them you'd have no idea she was actually seeing ahead and all the sudden she's back at the start without cheap cuts/jumps. I think it would have made a far better movie as a non-marvel movie, and would have preferred it as an action flick not having Spider(man/woman) ties holding it back.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

I've liked a couple Marvel/ Sony projects that people didn't like... but oh my goodness. This was a trainwreck from beginning to end.Throughout all of the marketing and even in the movie were teased of this team of kick ass characters with powers. But it literally never happens. It seems more like a friendship story than a superhero story. Everyone is sitting waiting for this inevitable event. Doesn't happen.Even worse, major things that happen to MW seem like they were put in just because the writers forgot to add them and just threw it in...The writing was horrible and I'm sure it was a hard script to work. But some of the actors in this movie are already fairly subpar and the results showed.This I imagine will go down as one of the worst Sony movies of all time. I couldnt imagine the MW franchise surviving this one. Unfortunately already Meme fodder.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

The film deserves a strong nine out of ten, but gave it ten as many folks didn't give it the proper rating. There have been many Marvel films that started pretty slow and as the story matured they went to be great series. It would be pretty cool to see the second film with the sheroes yep not a word but you get it. A big Mahalos to the everyone who made this film and all the cast did very well in their roles.

First and foremost, Dakota Johnson is just not a good actress. Let's get real, she's gotten to where she is because of her Nepo baby status. The success of those dreadful Fifty Shades of Grey films had very little to do with with Johnson or her acting, it was because the books were fan favorites (the last film was the lowest grossing in the trilogy). Also, whoever wrote the script for Madame Web should never write another script again. The dialogue was trite, the storyline was boring and it was directed and shot like it was amateur hour on an abandoned studio backlot. The overall feeling of Madame Web felt super-low budget. I've seen student films that were way better than this nonsense. I don't always agree with critics, but on this disaster of a film, they are spot-on. Madame Web has no redeeming qualities at all. If your curiosity gets the better of you, just wait until it's on a streamer, but by no means spend your hard-earned money on it. Technically Madame Web is part of the larger Spider-Man cinematic multiverse, so how on earth did they get this film so wrong with an $80 million budget??","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

That part of the movie was probably better than ""next"" with Cage. But unfortunately the movie had to fill in the other hour plus of content, and that's where it fails. So only madames abilities and Dakota Johnson acting were the only redeeming aspects of the film.That AED scene, better yet any reference to EMS in the movie was LAME.

However, 'Madame Web' is a prime example of how studios consistently butcher beloved characters. Companies like Sony and Warner Brothers should take a step back and reconsider their approach. They ought to delve into the original source material and hire individuals who are passionate about storytelling, rather than churning out senseless films.Where do I begin with this movie? There are no redeeming qualities. The acting is subpar, the pacing is reminiscent of disasters like 'Catwoman,' and the storyline lacks substance.One commendable aspect is their attempt to introduce a fresh perspective to the superhero genre. Instead of the typical world-saving scenario, 'Madame Web' focuses on rescuing potential heroes. However, this concept is executed poorly and is painfully predictable.I sincerely hope Sony reflects on this failure and realizes that their ideas are flawed. Just because they operate a media conglomerate doesn't guarantee they understand audience preferences.Madame Web is a fantastic character, both in comics and in 'Spiderman: The Animated Series.' I eagerly anticipate a future portrayal of the character in films, hopefully by a studio other than Sony.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

How does Cassie save the three girls and also uncover what happened to her mother 30 years ago, while figuring out how to control her powers forms rest of the story.Madame Web definitely is among the worst superhero films and it comes down to how bad the writing is, both screenplay and dialogue wise.

The dialogues are so bad, even the dramatic ones end up sounding funny.

With a poorly executed storyline, it fails to captivate audiences from start to finish.The screenplay feels hastily put together, lacking depth and coherence. Character development is virtually nonexistent, leaving viewers disconnected from the protagonists' struggles and motivations. As a result, it's challenging to invest emotionally in the narrative, leading to a disengaged viewing experience.One of the major drawbacks of ""Madam Web"" is its pacing. The film moves at a sluggish pace, with scenes dragging on without purpose or intrigue. This sluggishness contributes to the overall sense of boredom and apathy that permeates the viewing experience.Despite attempts to inject excitement with action sequences, they feel forced and formulaic, failing to provide any genuine thrills or suspense.

The cast struggles to breathe life into their characters, delivering wooden and unconvincing portrayals that further detract from the film's appeal.Overall, ""Madam Web"" is a forgettable cinematic endeavor that fails to leave a lasting impression.

They are just haters who think that each superhero movie need to be as good as Avengers Endgame...When I saw on the internet that this movie was even less good that Morbius, I was not expecting anything. In fact, I was suprised because Ive prefered Madame Web than Morbius even if some are saying the opposite.It is true that this is not the best superhero movies because you don't have the thrills and the excitement of movie like Endgame or Spiderman Homecoming by example.I passed a good time and me and my friends even laugh hard at some acts. The actresses were good in general and they have done their best.For me, it was more a psycology thriller than a common superhero movie, but it was not that bad. The humor was more for young people than older, but by sometimes, it was funny.At the end, I was down to see what comes next with those characters.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

Predictable and typical all the way down to expression and dialog. The script writing was horrible, some B movies have a better script and execution. The visual effects were terrible even though its a newer movie it matched the visuals of some of the worst marvel movie visuals that are older. Some scenes could have been great but they were ruined with quick cuts, non consistant cinematography and again horrible acting. I wish they did something better with this. Such a missed opportunity, glad I didn't pay to watch it. If they ever go forward with another they need a director that puts heart and soul into , not just a cliché project, cliché everything.

When a 'spider' man tries to stop his prophetic death, she has to use her new found powers to save to change the future AND also solve the long mystery of her mother's death in Peru.I'll just say that this is one of the worst script from a movie I had watched. The Peru scenes are probably one of the dumbest (and funniest) backstory/explanation in history. It expects you to be shocked but the way they presented it is so questionable it hurts. The 'oracle' plot of the film is so on the nose, it really was laughably absurd at times that the only other person from my showing had to leave. AND their is a key plot point THAT never was able to handle airports, really MOVIE.Dakota Johnson cannot carry face acting that this ""superhero"" role requires. She just is so plain and uninspired. I do not think that she can's act (see Lost Daughter or Cha Cha Real Smooth), but the ridiculousness is just too much for her too handle. Her line reading is so dour and straight, it reads so awfully and funnily (regardless of seriousness) on-screen. She tries to act normally that her scene does not translate the 'hero' scenario.I do want to give some love to Celeste O'Connor who did the most for her bratty rich kid role.

Then I read about the extensive rewrites, so no wonder the film is a dud.It opens with the back story of Madame Web's mother who is pregnant in the Amazon, how she dies and was bitten by a rare spider with healing and supernatural powers. Then we move forward to a grown up Cassandra Webb in 2003 who is an EMT in NYC. As the story evolves, we learn about her EMT partner (Ben Parker) whose family will eventually produce the future Spiderman (Peter Parker). The original script had Cassandra involved in saving the unborn Spiderman from the nemesis who killed her mother. These rewrites explain why they built up the cast in the firehouse in the beginning but don't use them throughout the film.Then 3 teens are added who need Cassandra's protection as her clairvoyant powers emerge and the talent of these young actors are wasted. The script is schizophrenic. It morphs from a superhero film to a horror flick during future flashes.Instead of the wit & humor found in beloved superhero films, the writers give us a passenger who keeps asking Cassandra if he's on the right train. So many missed opportunities. While the 3 teens have sassy personalities, they're mostly used as midriff eye candy in the film. And when Dakota Johnson tries to climb her closet wall like a spider, this could have resulted in a good comedic pratfall but was missed.Future flashes are handled clumsily. In the writer's desperate attempt to introduce futuristic tech, they have the nemesis acquire new facial recognition & aging software, access to city wide CCTV, control traffic lights and advance cell and Bluetooth technology.Despite the writers' attempt to cobble together a script, there should have been more smart action and dialogue like in the ambulance scene towards the end where they throw off the nemesis using a charged defibrillator.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's not omg amazing but it's nothing near morbius or the Fantastic Four reboot from the 2010s. It's an origin story and like many origin story movies you kind of want more but it does make you want to see a sequel. There's plenty of action and it is engaging throughout. And Dakota tells the story well.The movie is set in the 2000's and the movie kind of reflects that also? But I like that it's not heavily CGI like Avengers or something. There's plenty of practical sets and effects which I enjoyed.The main issue is the villain. He was dubbed over almost the entire movie? What was up with that? Kind of distracting but not a deal breaker. Also the beginning of the movie had choppy edits and fast camera movements that was annoying but thankfully it stopped after like 10-15 minutes.I hope it makes money and a sequel is made. I'd be excited to see the cast come back in full force.Also people being annoyed she doesn't use her powers a ton is like?? She just got them and is trying to figure out how they work. I hate when movies make it where all of a sudden the hero is an expert with their powers lol.

I have watched Morbius once, tried to watch it a second time and don't remember anything but the Matt Smith dance scene.Madame Web was more engaging as a film. It definitely worked in its favour to have more lead characters as it got to focus on more character dynamics. The shots got a bit fancy if not over the top but at least kept the movie looking interesting. Some of it definitely reminded me of a really ass Raimi film.The movie is definitely crap, but at least it was kinda fun. No regrets watching this one while drunk. I still can't believe people thought this was worse than Morbius.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's got a couple moments but it's woefully trite. I am all for powerful female roles and themes, I only wish that if the action genre is the vehicle that they'd be more along the lines of Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Lucy, Anna, Hanna, Red Sparrow, Salt, Atomic Blonde, etc. Not that everything has to be about spies or ultra violent but at least make the scripts good enough that schleps like me don't think they could have written a better script. The cast had promise but as someone else said they were wasted in this one. The only reason to watch this one is so that it is successful enough for studios to invest in more female led movies.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The character development was nonexistent entirely; I have pretty good comic book knowledge, specifically of the spiderverse; but to include a villain and three additional ""distractions"" that solely rely on name and not at least giving some insight into who they are is mind boggling. Was this film written by five year olds looking to simply create a new superhero team? The three additional female heroes came with zero back story and also lacked a fore story about just who they were. The villain knew these three characters were supposed to kill him in the future; but never said why. Entirely unsure of his motivation.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But the worse failure on the maker's part is that they made it boring.So, a woman is seeking a particular spider while heavily pregnant so she can harness the apparent healing properties to make ""medical miracles."" And their is a legend of ""Spider People"" who live in the jungle around this spider.Now that child is Dakota Johnson, paramedic in NYC (I believe). She starts having ""visions"" of events to occur. She goes about following these to avert damage.I give Dakota Johnson a half round of applause. The first half of the film she actually displaced emotions in her performance, more than I've seen her in any other film. (Maybe in Bad Times of the El Royale she displayed some level of emotion.)The story next incorporated three teen girls for fun (?) as they become integral to the plot. But ""Surprise!"" Do they really matter?I was having fun with the film in the first half. Then all these surprise elements kept coming. And Ms. Johnson would limp to another idea, sigh, ponder, and then limp to another scene. And the teens were perfect stereotypes of the main three tropes, and clash with each other. Doing nothing for the plot.Madame Web feels like they started with something that could have at least been fun. But everyone seemed to become lethargic, and the plot unfolded as if it was an improv game: ""Yes, and..."" This made the second half drag from scene to scene.So a 4 for some of the fun to be had. Ms. Johnson display a glint of depth, and that is more than I typically see from her. A couple cool concepts were on display. But over it was a waste and probably deserved a 2-3.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

You're thinking, hey it's Dakota ""50 shades of"" Johnson, and that chick from Euphoria, plus it's a Marvel and it was in theaters, it can't be that bad? WRONG! (TL;DR: Madame Web = hella doo doo)At first I thought that maybe they had a super small budget, because of how cheap looking it is, but there are sooooo many blatant product placements that it's cringe to the max.Then I thought that maybe the script was written by ai, because the dialogue is soooo horrendous... but honestly a Speak-&-Spell getting punched by a monkey could've written a better script.The acting is awful and they had to have known it, so maybe they made this whole film with one-take scenes. Maybe they're training the younger generations to accept bad writing and bad acting as a way to boost profits. Maybe it's some sort of cinematic shrinkflation, it looks like a regular size movie, it still says Marvel, but the action is smaller and cheaper and more fake. The cgi is better than MS Paint and better than that craptastic Flash movie that just came out, but it's still a total rush job, and so you can visibly see all the corners they cut. Even the villain's voice sounds fake.Also, keep in mind that half the movie is her having visions of the future, so you see much of the dialogue and scenes TWICE! - Meaning that this is basically like 58 cheap minutes of badly acted crap, repeated, stretched, and with a butt-ton of filler, to add up to a runtime of 1 hour and 56 minutes of plops, flops, and when will it stops?!I suppose the one silver lining is that at least we all know that Sydney Sweeney and Dakota Johnson have done alot of nude scenes before, so we can take out our phones and google that instead of watching Madame Web.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Each one's facial expression throughout the movie is like it was carved out of plastic.The plot is so full of holes and lacking common sense that, it makes them look like dumb heroes rather than superheroes.The villian and supporting actors try to make up for the bad acting & poor story to some extent but, by the end of the movie even that falls apart due to the story.It's a CWOT and nothing else comes close to describing it.

Experiencing visions which she initially dismisses as déjà vu, she comes to realize she possesses a clairvoyance that allows her to see the future. Her newfound powers may be linked to her late mother who was researching spiders in the Peruvian Amazon prior to her death, as well as a mysterious indigenous tribe known as Las Arañas, but Cassie has bigger things to worry about when she finds herself becoming the de facto protector of impulsive, entitled teenagers Julia Cornwall, Añya Corazón, and Mattie Franklin. Errant visual effects, crummy lines, along with uninvolving action scenes are all that's peppered throughout a prolonged, paradoxical story that's rarely (if ever) interesting, not to mention replete with characters who lack charisma, including a most forgettable villain. The sappy and sentimental ending doesn't help, but the ship sunk long before the finale. *½","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

With its unique blend of supernatural elements and human drama, this movie manages to resonate with its audience on multiple levels. As a movie critic, I rate it a 7 out of 10.The plot revolves around a mystical psychic, Madame Web, who uses her extraordinary abilities to guide and protect a young girl with extraordinary powers. The themes and tone of the film are intriguing, exploring the complexities of fate, destiny, and the power of choice. These themes are woven seamlessly into the narrative, providing a thought-provoking experience for the viewers.The acting in Madame Web is commendable, particularly the lead actress who brings depth and vulnerability to her character. The supporting cast also delivers strong performances, making the audience feel emotionally invested in their journeys. The characters are well-developed and relatable, allowing the audience to connect with them on a deeper level.One cannot ignore the cinematography and production design, which create a visually stunning world that is both captivating and immersive. The special effects are impressive, particularly those involving the psychic realm, which adds a sense of wonder and magic to the story.In conclusion, Madame Web is a film that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genre, offering a unique and engaging cinematic experience. Despite some minor flaws, it is a movie that will leave you pondering long after the credits roll.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It covers the bases and ticks all the boxes - and gives us nothing we haven't seen done much better a dozen times before.We get an origin story involving a spider (where have I seen that before?), a character growing up not knowing the powers they have (where have I seen that before?), a villain whose sole purpose in the film is to be villainous (where have I seen that before?), and so on and so on. Plus lots of plot conveniences that just suggest lazy writing.As an aside, five different people are credited for writing the story or the screenplay (or both). The result was not an example of committee work at its best.Naturally, it all ends in a flashy bashy crashy sequence - but this one was so tame and so lacking in thrills, excitement, or anything superheroic that they might as well not have bothered.To top it off, we get Sydney Sweeney playing a teen less than a month after we saw her playing a mid-twenties romantic lead in Anyone but You. Has Madame Web spent five years in limbo whilst someone tried to get something watchable out of the mess? If so, it was five years wasted.Madame Web's superpower, of course, is to see into the future. It's a shame she didn't see clearly enough to stop this being made.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The film suffers from a convoluted and uninspired plot, throwing together underdeveloped characters and nonsensical situations. Dakota Johnson struggles to find depth in the titular role, burdened by a script that offers little character development or meaningful motivations. The supporting cast fares no better, with talented actors like Sydney Sweeney and Tahar Rahim wasted on one-dimensional characters.Visually, the film resembles a low-budget video game cutscene, lacking the polish and grandeur expected from a superhero film. The action sequences, when present, are uninspired and poorly choreographed, failing to deliver any thrills or excitement. Even the film's attempts at humor fall flat, landing with a dull thud instead of a laugh.""Madame Web"" is a frustrating misstep, offering nothing new or engaging for either loyal fans or newcomers. It's a film devoid of any spark, leaving viewers with a sense of wasted potential and a lingering question: how could something with such promise unravel so spectacularly?","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

While I can admit the concept of the film was one that I did enjoy but the execution was poorly done. From the opening scene to the end credits, it was just constant bad dialogue, choppy editing, poor acting, and brutal CGI. Felt more like a comedy about someone who can see the future than a superhero film. I think the standout actor in this film goes to Adam Scott as Ben Parker with his character feeling the most authentic with very little screen time. Lastly, I must say that Tahar Rahim (Ezekiel Sims) was one of the worst villains in film history and easily will be one of my most forgettable ones.""Madame Web"" ended up feeling like a rushed project and landing as the worst film of the year. Probably one of the worst comic book films ever made. The only hope is that ""Kraven"", and ""Venom 3"" can provide some redemption back to Sony.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

If you don't like this type of movie don't watch it. Wouldn't surprise me if half the people leaving hateful reviews have not even watched it, probably just seen the trailer, as the reviews do not match the movie I just watched. If you love Marvel and the Spider Man universe, then you should enjoy this movie. The characters were engaging and funny, nothing wrong with the dialogue in my opinion. As an origin story movie, I thought it well scripted. The action sequences were well choreographed and thought out. Special effects were excellent. It was generally a fun and entertaining movie.

Madame Web was such a unique concept to todays overly persistant sequal after sequal releases. I also loved the idea of all these Spider-women who've spent years and decades the comics finally being able to grace the Hollywood spotlight.Yet when I was in that cinema I couldn't help but get mixed reactions. There was so much inconsistently, so much telling and explaining more than any showing or action. Pacing was off and situations the characters go through are treated really unrealistically. Don't get me started on the corny dialogue.Although I'm not a ranter who'll join the hate train without acknowledging the things I did find nice. Not phenomenal or spectacular, but nice.The animation isn't that horrible. Sure there were one or two scenes that definetly looked iffy but the rest was pretty good! Good to know that $80 million wasn't entirely wasted.Costuming is very debated but me personally I loved the spider-suits! Bit hesitant when I watched the trailer, however in the movie it sort of grows on you. Not only spider-suits but the overall costuming was pretty good in representing the characters.Camera work had it's cool moments, not all the time, but enough that it kinda snaps your attention back to the screen for a few seconds. However, I never liked how fast it all was, with some scenes it makes sense, but in some scenes it's not nessassary at all.Those three are honestly the only things I can point out. I felt like there was so much potentional for this movie to be greater, and I'm disapointed that this is the first movie to introduce such wonderful comic characters! Sony, you can do so much better if you pay attention to what the public wants!","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

No wonder indian movies are gaining popularity in recent times as they do not have a budget for computer generated scripts (CGS) and heavily rely on human intelligence for script and screenplay.

If the movie actually was written and directed by kids, they would've probably enjoyed the process. But eligibly only adults - who's just horrible at what they do - were involved in the writing and directing and they should all have their movie making licenses revoked.

Johnson even said that the movie didn't turn out like she thought it would and that she never would return to the superhero world again.Oh well.

It's a voyage of discovery about hidden powers and also clearly has a sequel in mind. It skips about, such as bits in Peru, but that does follow the narrative. I agree with some that the villain isn't the baddest but he's passable. They clearly play with a mixed trio of teenage girls and gives it some of the humour, although there's not much laugh out loud humour. This is long from being the best Marvel movie but although way down the list it's not the worst. There aren't a huge number of fight scenes but overall the film is adequate.

Hopefully disney didn't fire all its script writers and subscribed to chatgpt to produce this lackluster robotic script. We need human brains at work to produce valuable content. The movie felt like random acts of CGI mixed with noise and incredible sound. No wonder indian movies are gaining popularity in recent times as they do not have a budget for computer generated scripts (CGS) and heavily rely on human intelligence for script and screenplay. I think this is a phase where hollywood is trying to make the shift from human generated movies to a computer generated movie (CGM).","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Then multiply it by infinity. That will come closely to this movie. Even then, this movie is worse...
From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on..","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

From the outset, it's evident that the film struggles to find its footing, relying too heavily on flashy visuals to compensate for its hollow narrative and sucky characters.The action sequences, meant to inject excitement into the film, fall flat, lacking both creativity and coherence. Instead of drawing viewers into the heart of the conflict, they serve only to highlight the film's reliance on tired tropes and uninspired choreography.Furthermore, the CGI, touted as cutting-edge, fails to impress, with poorly-rendered effects detracting from rather than enhancing the viewing experience. From laughably fake explosions to painfully obvious green screen work, the film's visual effects only serve to underscore its overall lack of quality.The pacing exacerbates these issues, with action set pieces shoehorned in at the expense of character development and plot coherence. Rather than serving as climactic moments, these scenes feel forced and contrived, leaving audiences disengaged and uninvested in the outcome.Additionally, the film's heavy-handed symbolism only serves to highlight its narrative shortcomings, with clumsy metaphors doing little to elevate the shallow characterizations and lackluster dialogue.By the time the credits roll, Madam Web leaves viewers feeling more frustrated than fulfilled, a prime example of style over substance in modern cinema. In the end, it's a forgettable entry into the genre, offering little in the way of entertainment or insight.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The simplicity with which a lot of it is approached, and the lack of real stakes really made this a very comfortable watch. It is still a bad film but I really didn't think it was one of the worst superhero movies. The last superhero movie I saw at the theater, Aquaman 2 was definitely worse than this in my opinion.And I think the casting was done a long time ago because watching Syndey Sweeny as a meek-mannered teenager supporting character feels very weird when she's basically established as the new hot star in Hollywood.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Sony is only making this garbage movies to keep the rights to spider-man.

It would be awful.The movie is badly edited, with bad dialogues, bad story, bad villain, who despite having spider-man powers cannot even do anything significant against simple fragile female teenagers who don't have any powers for 99% of the movie.

It was a messy ride though.To be fair, I was never a fan of the Madame Web character, if in the graphic novels/comics.

Were a bit hesitant about accurately adapting the source material, B. Copied the tone of a more successful superhero film, but only at face value, or C. Had the stench of an out of touch corporate executive all over it.The reason I bring this up is because 2024's ""Madame Web"" neatly fits into all three aforementioned categories.Don't let the promotional marketing fool you, at no point do any of the Spider-Women slip into their superhero costumes not even in the final scene where a now blind Madame Web taps into the live action Spider-Verse to see what's been and what will be.The film likewise copies the ""gritty"" tone of more grounded superhero films that have come before, but ultimately comes off as cheesy more than it does serious since the Spider-Man franchise is usually about as light-hearted as a superhero property gets.Finally, now more than ever, it's become evident that films like these are made, for the sake of BEING made, not because there was a passionate director behind the camera or even because the film has the luxury of falling back on a pre-established well received cinematic universe which Sony's Spider-Man Universe is most certainly not.And what's more, I used to think we were past the era of terrible superhero films. Of terrible female led superhero films specifically speaking, but so long as the likes of ""Madame Web"" which is very much this decade's ""Catwoman"" continue to do the fairer gender dirty in the realm of live action superheroes and more importantly, so long as the powers that be in Hollywood continue to intentionally put out absolute dreck that, no, isn't made any better by having an arbitrary amount of women, PoC, LGBT, in the script, we may very well be in for a resurgence of cringe 2000's era superhero schlock.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's just so fascinating to see how they get things so completely wrong. The entire tone of the film is simply bizarre - it really does feel machine-generated. No humanity whatsoever. Watching actors struggle under the weight of such blandness and mediocrity is actually a lot of fun.There's a near-perfect scene where someone gives Dakota Johnson a thank you card, and she stares at it like it's an alien artifact, then states in monotone, ""This is made of... paper?"" and the scene quickly cuts away. Genuis!In many ways it felt like a throwback to the pre-Dark Knight/Zack Snyder era of lighter, sillier superhero films of the '00s. No serious attempt at realistic setting or dialogue, just continuous contrivances and deus ex machina set to a loop of girlpower pop hits. For instance, it is never revealed what the baddie actually wants, or what he does for a living, or even his name - it's enough that he wears a dark coloured suit and lives in a big tower.For the record, I found this less offensive than your average Hollywood 'blockbuster'.

Some of the best movies ever made have scenes of people in cars that are obviously in front of a projection screen, but we don't fault that because it's not the point. The point of any effect, special or visual, is to tell us what is happening in the story.Some of the editing in the ""time"" scenes could have used more care, but even then the point came across.Perhaps the biggest flaw is trying to tell too much story in a two hour movie. I think it could have benefited from focusing on Ezekiel discovering Cassandra and seeing her as a threat. Then you introduce the girls in the second movie, or do something entirely different.Even so, it was enjoyable enough and doesn't deserve the hate it's receiving.

There's too much talking and not enough story or character development. However, the story is entertaining enough. Dakota Johnson is just a terrible actress, I repeat terrible. She shows zero emotion throughout the whole movie. I wish they would've chosen a different lead actress. She seems bored which made it hard to get into. The other actors were great. The three younger actresses would've made a better solo movie. They carried this movie. There is also not enough action for an action film. They could've done so much with this film. Only watch it if there's nothing left to watch.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Another annoying aspect is the incessant background music track that eas obviously not scored to match the on screen action. It is good to have space in the audio. It is not necessary to have constant musack in the background. And where were Ben and Aunt may? Where and why were thrir characters necessary? There have not been many films that after 25 minutes.

It's too long and it tells no story. Some little things are good, some sidestories, but overall it's just pointless.I saw this just for Sydney Sweeeney, and I can say she's the only one who at least made some effort in acting, who believe a bit in this movie, and I'm glad she recoverde so quickly after it (SNL). The other actors are just wandering and mumbling in a story that could have been told better, it had some possibilities and one or two interesting characters (at least in the future). And please, the next time you're gonna cast Syd in a superhero movie, don't make her ugly: not only they tried to do so in this movie, but they even failed at it. Let her be herself, thank Mother Nature for her incredible shape and act accordingly!I believe, all things considered, this is not the worst flop compared to other superhero movies recently released (betweeen 2023 and 2024), but surely one of the most painfully and foolishly missed opportunities. They had some potential, but still lost: such a shame!This movie deserved a 3.5/10, but recently I saw something even worse that made me kind of want to see Madame Web so I improved the rating for it. The (average) performance from Syd made me adjust it a little higher, so this is why the final vote 6/10 came from.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In fact, Madame Web was ""born"" from Spider-Man comics. That is why Madame Web is part of Spider-Man's intellectual property (IP). So, the film Madame Web is clearly the answer for those of you who want to know more about this character.As Madame Web's first live action film, this film clearly shows the origin story of how Cassie Webb was able to transform into Madame Web. Most superhero origin story films usually only focus on showing one main superhero character and a villain. However, for this film, you are immediately introduced to three female superhero characters apart from Madame Web, who are still affiliated with the Spider-Man IP.Apart from Cassie, you are also introduced to Julia Cornwall who has the potential to become Spider-Woman, Mattie Franklin who also has the potential to become another Spider-Man, and Anya Corazon who has the potential to become Arana. Even though there are many characters at once, this film still focuses on Madame Web's origin story. The presence of Julia, Mattie, and Anya in this film played a role in shaping Cassie into Madame Web. So, these three characters do not get an origin story in this film.The presence of Julia, Mattie, and Anya also gives Cassie quite interesting character development, from someone who hates family things to discovering the meaning of family. The interactions between them add dynamics to the film. Apart from the four of them, you will also find other non-superhero characters who are guaranteed to make you enthusiastic.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Characters were bland too.The movie was very confusing the way it was shot. Some scenes went by way too fast, I could barely comprehend what was happening.

Given I LIKE the precognition concept (and even the casting of Dakota Johnson), this was quite a let-down. I feel like a sucker for watching this. None of the characters felt like real people.Despite official Marvel approval, this film seems full of missed opportunities. I didn't buy the concept of fighting a dark Spiderman with advanced parlor tricks -- it's cute enough for sidekick action, but there needs to be a physically capable hero in the mix. If not, well, you end up with a film like this. Did no one at Sony realize this?The trio-of-girls-with-powers thing has already been done, and it's made worse by the shameless marketing of a sequel at the end. Apparently Cassandra Webb is the female Nick Fury in this universe (face-palm). To be clear, I LIKE strong female characters (see many of James Cameron's films), but this cartoonish politically-correct stuff is quite tiresome.I give this 5.5 stars for superficial entertainment, with half-star penalties for the weak story, poor pacing, and lame ending. That's four (4) stars total.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The interesting idea it started with turns into a confusing mess, disappointing the audience.Dakota Johnson does her best as Madame Web, bringing energy to the film, but the poorly written script undermines her efforts. The script's trashy and absurd decisions make it hard to enjoy the movie even with good performances.Despite the hints at Spider-Man Easter eggs, the execution falls short, leaving viewers wanting more substance and connection. The performances overall are mediocre, not doing much to improve the disjointed nature of the film.One big problem with the movie is the many choices that just don't make sense. These decisions add to the confusion and frustration, making viewers question the coherence of the story and characters. It's clear that Madame Web is more about making money than delivering a good movie experience. The studio is to blame for the film's issues, as its focus on financial success hampers the potential for a cohesive and engaging story.In conclusion, Madame Web disappoints with weak plots, average performances, and a sense of confusion that ruins its potential. Dakota Johnson's energetic performance is a highlight, but it's not enough to save the film from its poorly executed and unsatisfying nature.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, looks like this backfired. The movie had opportunity to have so much more than just the characters escaping from a bad guy for the entire movie. The movie's plot was just the characters pretty much going place to place, and the villain just somehow finds them. However so far, the background score, the locations, the designs were pretty good. The cliché storyline was the only thing that could've changed.So overall, I would recommend this film as a one-time watch, and hope that Sony can try making a better sequel.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This approach ensures that my perspectives aren't skewed by prevalent points of criticisms, that the collective gaze would not have noticed on their own:I'm eagerly anticipating the return of these characters and am thrilled at the prospect of crossover moments among Sony's Marvel lineup. Picture a dynamic alliance involving Venom, Madame Web's ensemble, Kraven and Andrew Garfield's Amazing Spider-Man, all joining forces to take on the multiverse hopping Inheritors. Additionally, the vampiric nature of the Inheritors paves the way for connections to Morbius. This matchup is intriguing, especially with the potential multiverse interactions originating from the Sony Spider-Man Universe.","11 out of 28 found this helpful.

I never understood why Dakota Johnson got so much hate for her acting abilities. But, I understood that after watching ""Madame Web"". Also, I realised that Sydney Sweeney is not just a beautiful face but a good actor too. Other actors were okayish. I had seen Isabela Merced in ""Instant Family"", so I know what she is capable of although her skills were underutilised I felt.Story -
The prologue story was beautiful. The plot was good, they could build an amazing thriller out of it. But, it was an obvious plot. Strong villain (who is not strong enough to keep us on our toes like Thanos), and a weak heroine (who is a little too strong and easily defeats the villain).The beauty of the story lies in the fact that hero is weaker than the villain in all aspects whether it was Spider-Man Movie series (Tobey Maguire) or the Avengers Series. Every time there was a villain who was so strong that the heroes had to push themselves beyond the edge to defeat the villain.Honestly, throughout the movie, I did not feel a thing because I could not built a connection with any of the characters due to their limited screentime and quite flat characters. The only character that shows growth is Sydney Sweeney's. A scared and timid girl who dances on the table to impress some boys, and then jumps in the water to save a life. Dakota's character grow better but it's shown so easily that it doesn't make you feel a thing. The movie seems to be in a hurry and it was not that kind of a movie that needs to be hurried.They could have taken extra 30 mins to build a better connection with characters and a few more efforts to make it a better thriller might have brought some appreciation to it.Cinematography -
The budget is good so there's not much problem in that case. But, they could have spent a little more time in making us believe that we are talking of a time that was 2 decades ago. Although, I liked Britney's song.I am glad that it is not a part of MCU universe because if it would have been... it would have spoiled Spider-Man (Tom Holland) for me forever.My Final Words about this movie -
It's below par. The story and the plot had the potential to be a superhit (honestly, an obvious plot but still with write direction and good writing you never know).","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is just not the way to set up an extended universe. Hopefully it is a study by film students and current writers / directors alike.They tried an Iron Man story with his origin to go in chronological order. Difference was, Iron Many had a very charismatic hero and some dangerous villains along with a lot more, she we say, firepower. Even with the firepower in the final battle, this did not deliver on that. There were some entertaining chase sequences but, I don't believe I'm going to say this, too little of the character development. We learned more about Cassie and her partner's life than the three sidekicks.It can't be the run time either. Another five or ten minutes added to some character development all around, except for more time on Cassie's partner and her cat, and this could have been much better and tighter. Obviously have to blame the director but also the writer and editor. Too bad we'll never see more of these actors in these roles.

Should've been done by Disney Marvel production.I do hope that there is a sequel, and that the folks at Disney Marvel are very much connected to it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But the worst part by far is the shocking ADR job on the villain's voice. I was convinced at first that his voice was completely replaced by another actor but after watching a few interviews it's definitely him, it's just soo poorly done that it's jarring.All that being said there's absolutely no reason to blame the actors for any of this. They did their best with what they were given, and I'm fairly certain when filming wrapped they all sat around laughing about it and saying ""Doesn't matter, got paid!""Overall I actually think it's sorta good that this film exists, if only as a cautionary tale to Sony, and all production companies, as an example of how NOT to approach filmmaking.Now, does that mean you should watch it?

But sit back and think about it. Put to one side the direction was appalling, dialogue very poor, and the camera work amateurish.OK now you've done that, think of h9ow many other great films have suffered from some level of the same ailments? Die Hard 4 springs to mind for me. It was an incredibly poor end to the franchise, but on the coat tails of the previous 3 it was still enjoyable. Now, if some really clever director was to come back and do a Die Hard 5, we'd be all over it right?The 'idea' of Madame Web is a solid idea. Dakota Johnson was more than up for the task, I'd happily watch her washing her dishes and still be happy. But the 3 girls also played decent enough parts if you consider the poor dialogue they had to work with and the amateur hour direction. So I think of Madame Web as an introduction to that universe.What I'd like to see now is maybe a remake of this one but much better done, by a proper director, with a thought out plot, and a fast follow up film showing the 3 girls coming into their own in some great adventures. I've been bitten by the spider bug and I want more.So OK, this wasn't a great film, but there's an awful lot of shine to polish up and I think there could be much more to come.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's not even that once I decided to just keep skipping forward looking for action scenes (because everything was just so boring) I realized that like half this movie is a bunch of teen girls bonding or something, it's not that the movie doesn't seem to have an ending, just a setup for a sequel that will never take place.I think mainly it's the sense that no one involved was interested in making a movie. No one was trying to come up with a story, or characters, or interesting events. The movie is the equivalent of a quarterly financial report written at the last minute by someone who just got fired and its their last day at work. It's just ... no one seems to have wanted to make this.It's weird, because there are movies that get pulled by studios where the makers are really upset, but you can't imagine anyone complaining if this had been scrapped.

The scenes where her gift allows her to anticipate upcoming events are, without a doubt, the best part of the film. Especially the scene in the cafeteria with the song 'Toxic' by Britney Spears in the background, generating a wonderful audiovisual counterpoint.The film fails to include bland and forced humorous dialogues in climatic scenes. A humor that, if it worked before, now feels lacking in freshness and out of place.It is not the superhero film that will revitalize the genre but it is not the garbage that some malicious people would have you believe.Despite its shortcomings, it succeeds and lays sufficient foundations for future sequels in which there will be an opportunity to refine details.","11 out of 32 found this helpful.

This will absolutely make a great drinking game or one of your favorite get drunk and trash a movie night. This film has good quality actors, like some VERY good actors. How these people managed to act with no emotion, no facial expression except at the most inappropriate times, and without a hint of evidence that they have any skill, is amazing. The script is so poorly written, I could have done better when I was 4 years old and writing in crayon. The entire delivery is FLAT and BORING. The only way I can imagine as to why this movie is SO BAD, is that the director did this on purpose to show how lousy all of the marvel offerings have become. This film had such potential, with a strong cast - but HOLY TOLEDO does it just stoke its own dumpster fire. I would love to prattle on about all the ways this film should be studied in film school about how NEVER to make a film.... UGH.... it's just bad.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I had low expectations going in from a couple of coworkers who had already seen the film. However, my low expectations weren't low enough to keep me from being disappointed.There are so many eye-rolling moments in this film, whether from dialog seemingly written by a 10yr old, or from the sheer idiocy thrust upon us in order to make the story somewhat sensible.I don't think I've ever found myself dozing during an action movie until now. Parts of this movie are so slow, and so uninteresting and boring that I literally woke myself up with a sleep startle. Luckily, there was hardly anyone in the theater to notice.Save your theater-going money and if you must have this in your personal Marvel media collection, wait until it shows up in the bargain bin. It shouldn't take long.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The lack of character development leaves viewers disconnected and uninterested. The plot is random, poorly explained, and utterly nonsensical, making it impossible to follow or care about. I couldn't recommend this to anyone, not even out of morbid curiosity. It's baffling how this film was even approved for release. The numerous plot holes are so glaring that they become a source of frustration, making it painful to watch. The thought of a sequel is unbearable. Had I been in a theater, I would have walked out after just 20 minutes. This film is an insult to audiences intelligence and a waste of time.

It was definitely a 6.There's enough critics to tell you why it's bad. However, for someone who grew up in the early 2000s and was obsessed with Raimi's Spider-Man this movie felt almost nostalgic. It had potential, but where it lacked in most places was made up for by seeing characters in cool spidey outfits and Johnson's comedic timing. The cinematography is weird, but not bad or difficult to understand. 7 year old me would have loved this movie because it has everything I would have wanted, right down to the song choices.If you're someone who appreciated bad female-lead superhero movies like Halle Berry's Catwoman or Jennifer Garner's Electra then this is for you.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

I remember watching Morbius and not seeing cause for all the hate it had received. With Madame Web, I get it, but I still think people are being too harsh on it.Perhaps it's because they are frustrated that it's not the movie it was presented as. It can hardly be considered a superhero movie. Or maybe it's that people can't look past the bad within the movie to enjoy what's actually pretty entertaining if one has the right mindset. The beginning is rough. I started worrying that the whole movie might be this pitiful. But it gets better. I would describe the movie has having good moments, bad moments, and a lot of okay moments.The four leading ladies are the highlight. Watching them interact is fun and they even got some laughs out of me. Each of the girls has a unique personality that makes them interesting. Oddly enough, the best acting in the movie comes from an unexpected small role for Emma Roberts. It felt like she was on another level compared to everyone else, though Adam Scott is also a great addition.The glaring fault of this film is its villain. What a major misstep. I'm not sure what was going on with his voice. It didn't sound like it was coming from him. It sounded like he had been dubbed. He would move about but his voice wouldn't move with him. He was not an intimidating presence, nor was he an interesting character.I feel like if they had gotten the villain right, it would have fixed 70% of what was wrong with this movie. The other 30% consists of some bad dialogue and the fact that this is a superhero origin film that fails to be a superhero origin film. I could get mad about the deception and direction of this movie, but I never felt like getting up and walking out of the theater. But the level of quality we see from this movie isn't setting up Sony for a successful future for their Spider-Man universe. There's some sloppy, cheap, and made-for-streaming filmmaking on display here.Now that we've been introduced to the characters, a sequel could be a lot of fun, if (mild spoiler alert) they give these girls their spider superpowers. I would go see that.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Although I am more of a DC fan I also like the Marvels movies and TV series (well most of them anyway). If you rated this poorly then you would have to rate Ms. Marvel as a 1, instead of the 6.3 that it currently sits at. Sometimes, I think some of these reviewers wouldn't know a good movie it it jumped and bit them on the ass. Just look at Oppenheimer, that was crap movie. The documentary was far more entertaining.So please watch this movie with an open mind and don't compare it to other Marvel movies as this is a stand alone movie. Thor or Spiderman won't be dropping in anytime soon.Sit back and enjoy Madame Web.","13 out of 36 found this helpful.

It's rare to come across a movie so devoid of redeeming qualities, but this one managed to excel in all the wrong ways. Allow me to walk you through the myriad reasons why you should steer clear of this cinematic disaster.First and foremost, the plot-or lack thereof. The storyline, if one can even call it that, is an incoherent mess. From the very beginning, it becomes painfully clear that the writers had no clear direction or purpose. The movie meanders aimlessly, with scenes strung together haphazardly, making it nearly impossible to follow any semblance of a narrative. Characters are introduced without any background or development, leaving the audience completely detached from their plights and struggles. By the time the credits rolled, I was left wondering what, if anything, the film was trying to convey.The acting, too, is abysmal. It's almost as if the cast were competing to see who could deliver the most wooden, lifeless performance. The lead actor, in particular, seemed to have one facial expression for every possible emotion, making it difficult to invest in their journey or care about their fate. The supporting cast was no better, with each performance more forgettable than the last. It's a shame, as there were a few recognizable faces in the mix, but they were clearly given nothing to work with in terms of script or direction.Speaking of direction, this film is a masterclass in how not to direct a movie. Scenes are poorly framed, with awkward angles and jarring cuts that disrupt any potential flow or continuity. The pacing is erratic, dragging unbearably.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I know that isn't saying much. The direction is poor and the writing not much better, resulting in a movie that is rather dull. And like all the other Sony Spider-verse films so far, too much takes place at night or in the dark, adding to the dullness and making it sometimes difficult to follow. Presumably Sony does this to save money on special effects, but it makes for difficult viewing. As a poorly written and directed Marvel Comics based movie led by a multi-racial female cast, I couldn't help thinking about the recent release of the Marvels. And between the two I have or say this one was better. While obviously not realistic, it at least made sense within its own world. And it does share the Marvels' one virtue of staying under 2 hours.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

There are scenes where the actors speak and the sound doesn't match the movement of their mouths. There was horrible post-production work. It's not understood how Sony continues to produce such bad Spider-Man universe movies.To look for good things in this film is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

Tahar Rahim is a good actor and does menace, with what he is given with. Nice that Adam Scott is used well, for a change.Plenty of set ups for the ongoing Spiderman universe, clever in places, but the problem is the film is not directed well enough, for a TV show, it would work, but not on this.

It was clunky at times but it progressed well enough. It wasn't a normal superhero movie as the heroes didn't have big showy fighting abilities. It was more about character, heroes before they find out who they really are.Ultimately it left me wanting more, but not like ""it's missing too much"" or ""more please, I love it.""

I've seen a lot of disappointing movies and this one maybe isn't the worst but it definitely feels like it's competing to be.

I'm a person that doesn't like to write reviews because I figure who cares but after watching this film I felt the need to say something.

With their wooden performances and unsympathetic characters, I started voting for the bad guy early on.

Yes, it's not Citizen Kane but it's a ton of fun, clever and an incredibly uplifting film. I especially loved the ""retro"" 2003 setting without it being over-saturated in Y2K imagery.

No. Is Madame Webb, as some of the reaction would have you believe, an ungodly affront to cinema that plums new depths in the comic book genre? No. Is it a bland and completely forgettable film that seems to have no purpose in existing aside from rights retention? Yes.After a brief prologue in the Amazon the plot focuses on Cassandra Webb, a paramedic who develops the power to see into the future. The ability seems to be the result of a near death experience but are also related to a ritualistic spider bite received by her pregnant mother. I guess when you're Madam Webb a spider has to be involved somewhere. There's even an attempt spin her powers as spider related but its tenuous to say the least (she sees ""the web that connects us all""??). Whatever the cause she powers up just in time as there are a trio of teenage girls about to be killed by an evil Spiderman because he too can see the future and knows they will one day off him after getting their own powers.There is the kernel of a fun movie in here. An unstoppable killer pursuing the main characters Terminator style while Cassandra use her future vision to get them out of tight spots has the potential for some cool set pieces but the film wastes so much time doing nothing. There is a large part of proceedings dedicated to making sure the audience know this is Spiderman adjacent. Cassandra works with ""uncle' Ben Parker, who just met a women he's really into and his sister in law is about to have a baby, there's even a scene where they tease the babies name. Its all very boring and, given we know it isn't going anywhere, completely pointless. Even once the we are up and running there are only a couple of underwhelming encounters with the baddie and the bonding between Cassie and the girls is perfunctory.None of the cast do anything wrong but they aren't given much to work with. The three future spiderwomen are likeable enough but are stuck with generic teen personas, there's a science nerd, a rebel and one who is worried about being deported. Tahar Rahim is a top drawer actor but as villain Ezekiel Sims he's a walking cardboard cut out, his only characterisation being that he is motivated to kill the girls before they ""destroy everything he has built"". Aside from a swanky apartment and nice car it is never made clear exactly what it is he has built. Lead actress Dakota Johnson can, as anyone who has seen Fifty Shades of Grey will attest, sell some pretty limp dialogue but even she struggles at times here. Its a pity she's let down by the script as you get the feeling she could have been a natural blockbuster lead with some decent support.For some reason this is also the longest film in Sony's No Spiderman Spiderman Universe at nearly two hours. A strange decision given there's so little plot. A little trimming of the fat and better set pieces and they would have had a passable superhero film, by current standards anyway, rather than the cultural punching bag Madam Webb has become. With all mention of their other properties removed from this movie it seems Sony really want everyone to forget about it as soon as possible. Shouldn't be too difficult to oblige them.4 mothers researching spiders in the Amazon just before they died out of 10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"","","Visually good, wholesome with a tint for youth, also lacks substance, as many other movies from this genre, nowadays. Almost compensates with a fascinating settup, to follow","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9625034/?ref_=tt_urv","chirilescemanuel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur159375088/?ref_=tt_urv","16 February 2024","Movies nowadays should be seen under two perspectives:The first one is what does the youngers, need and how does the movie provide with a future where they keep learning the right things, from movies?It's essential, which is why, besides some gaps in the storrytelling - even my little cousin told me that, the end of Madame Web where they would defeat the bad guy, felt weird here and there; it is essential for movies nowadays, that, it may be a better choice to create a more balanced setting, more fun little moments, more morales than the violent settup and risky view of making movies, that we were part of, in the 2000s and early 2010s (us, 90s kids).Which brings us to the second perspective: taking what's better from our age and adapting it to the youth, now!For that..I need to focus on the substance matter.Aestethically and regarding +13 age rating, movie, made it clear it is a self-sufficient movie, for these motives, and it is also cool for teenagers to watch it - heard, out loud laugher in the cinema area, to tell this.So, regarding the later problem with nowadays superhero movies, I will give the perfect two examples of late 2000s and early 2010s movies, which are: Iron Man and the Dark Night.If you did watch the movies or any of them, remember the thrill, the movie did put you through? It's a key word, thrill. It means, every moment of the movie (almost) is felt as if your next 6 weeks of well-being will depend on the outcome of the whole plot. Not only this, but every time a main character succeeds in standing out, giving the right choice of words to the interlocutor or action, it felt as if you can take the example and go out there to try your best in impressing someone or do the same as he/ she did.It felt, much more real.Later productions don't have this kind of setup for a stimulating storytelling. Also, the provocative factor is missing and was exclusively replaced by a more harmless arrangement - it's more like, the flower-power mentality took over the industry and we are collateral damage and can't watch a great movie, again..Plus, in these two cases presented, you can summarise that Tony Stark was as badass as you could have imagined, before even knewing that an Iron Man would take place in 2008 - or Bruce Wayne from The Dark Knight was the most potent and serious out of all the others, played by Christian Bale. They've made an impact on your state of being a teen, watching movies etc.And not only these two examples, because there were plenty good productions in late 2010s, where you did put an interest in characters and you felt more connected to them, then in these early 2020s movies..These movies, mentioned (up, above) - and many others that I won't mention, now, these are seen, from our point of view, as quality.Take from what is, there and bring something familiar into the present way of making films..On the other hand, these movies - Madame Web, The Marvels, Ant Man and the Wasp - Quantumania, Guardians ofthe Galaxy, The Flash, Shazam: Fury of the Gods (going beyond) - may be seen as mediocre, because they lack something important..Which is... old standard for quality!So.. they did start well, with superhero movies.. now, they need to learn how to mantain quality over time and people....nontheless, movie felt pleasant to watch with youngsters!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Sony is the same studio that holds the rights to biggest marvel character of all time and as of 2024 THERE ARE 3 DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF SPIDER MAN ARE RUNNING IN MULTIVERSE...read that again ; but they still fail to establish a shared universe...what is the point oof SSU when there is no spider man in this universe.... there are wasting money on these crap projects like venom 2' Morbius and now this disaster instead they can make TASM 3 or SM 4 ..the best thing about this movie is thank god it is not connected to any of those 3 versions of spider man otherwise it would have destroyed that universe by establishing the forced connections that were never meant to be present first place at all.... A BIG DISASTER......SHAME ON YOU SONY FOR TORTURING US.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The acting, writing, pacing, plot and characters were all horribly nonsensical. I suppose this is one comic book character and storyline that is difficult to translate into a movie, but it's like they didn't even try to do it well.I guess there's a chance they've introduced this character for the Beyonder storyline in upcoming Marvel movies, but they could have done so much better. If that is the case, no matter how well they do the Beyonder films, the audience is guaranteed to loudly groan when the Madame Web character appears.Worse than Mobius and that's saying something.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

A lot of the questions which were highlighted by the critics as ridiculous plot lines did seem to have a reasonable explanation by the end of the movie and it genuinely kept my interest until the end. Yes there were the potentially unnecessary Ben/Peter Parker member berries, the bad guy was as wooden as a tree and the lack of any real superhero action in a superhero flick was a bit weird but I have seen far worse movies than this which haven't got half the panning this has. I'm guessing there won't be a sequel if the box office tanks but I would have liked to have seen these characters progress.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The writing and acting is so bad, truly mind blowing. It feels like a group of high schoolers got together and just improvised. The lines, the delivery, everything is bad, and from everyone even the actually successful actors. It feels like this was the practice take of every scene, but then they never filmed an actual full scale take. Even Adam Scott's delivery and lines are horrible. If this was the first movie of any of these actresses careers they'd never work again.Also on Netflix for some reason the bad guys dialogue is not mixed properly to his voice, but everyone else's is fine. Like maybe he had to reshoot his lines in a studio and couldn't get the timing the same. I feel like the premise of the movie had potential, but if this was the vision all along, whoever funded this definitely died of embarrassment.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Based on the reviews I saw ""Madame Web"" expecting a hilariously awful, unwatchable, catastrophic joke of a movie. That's it's then just, a four out ten, disappointing effort was actually a pleasant surprise.With her mother killed whilst hunting in the Amazon for a rare spider, Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) grows up to become a paramedic. Following a near death experience she starts to see visions she comes to realise are of the future. In one vision, she sees a man with Spider like abilities kill three seemingly unrelated young women on the subway. She saves the girls and discovers a link between them and herself, and with the work her mother was undertaking.Don't get me wrong here... this is not good. It seems, from the reading, that it's exactly the sort of bland, tedious affair that is generated by endless studio interference, which seems to have created an entirely different movie than the one that Dakota Johnson signed on to make. I suspect that it stems from a desire not to make a good movie, necessarily, but to make the one that has the least risk of losing money. It's hard to shake that feeling that the actors in this had their enthusiasm taken from them by the rewrites and changes, and so the flat delivery that most of them offer stems from that.There are elements that don't make sense. Personally, I didn't struggle with the time elements, or even the slightly daft ""you can be in two places at once"" element to her power. No, I struggled with a firework being able to knock a wall down. Or how, whilst a wanted criminal, Cassie takes a flight to Peru and back. I reviewed ""Anyone But You"" earlier this year and talked there about how odd it is that we're simultaneously having Sydney Sweeney as a credible romantic partner for a man whose nearly forty, and here as a teenage girl.Let me say again, I think this is a bad film, not quite as bad as ""Morbius"" for me, but as bland a superhero movies as has ever been made. I just don't think it's quite as disastrous as it's been made out to be.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The film's narrative is convoluted and disjointed, making it difficult for viewers to engage with the story or its characters. Despite the talent of the cast, including A-list actors, the performances feel uninspired and fail to elevate the material. Visually, the film falls short, with subpar special effects and unimpressive action sequences. The pacing drags, making the already tedious plot feel even longer. Overall, ""Madam Web"" is a disappointment, lacking the depth and excitement fans expect from a superhero movie. It adds little to the character's mythos and will likely fade into obscurity among the plethora of forgettable adaptations. Fans of the character would be better off revisiting the comics or animated series for a more satisfying experience.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I prefer to watch movies at home. I usually go only to avoid heavy spoiler movies or if its really a huge CGI/VFX spectacle like the Godzilla/Kong movies, Pacific Rim or the recently released Dune Part 2. Its just better watching movies at home for me not having to deal with annoying peoples eating, slurping soda, coughing and at times hitting the seats etc...So that said i was still very curious and ""exited"" to see this one, as i wanted to see what was so bad about it for peoples to trash it so hard. Turn out its nowhere near as bad as i expected...Yes this is not a great movie by any means and it has a fair share of issues. But for one watch i taught it was alright.I would say the biggest issue is probably how little action there is in the movie. The problem being that Cassandra's power is predicting the futur and the other girls are just normal humans at that point while the vilain is a Spider-Man kinda guy beside shooting webs. So its a bit harder to have any big battles.Peoples lately been complaining about ""CGI messes"" in superhero flicks but at least it gives us action and its more entertaining. Here despite a few explosions and such you kinda feel its very toned down and more reminiscent of the 2000s.Speaking wich... The movie takes place in the 2000s. I guess its because they originally planned to include these characters in some ""crossovers"" or ensemble cast or such so it had to be set in the past but it really do not bring much to the movie.If anything it pull out a few things that were a bit hard to swallow. For instance being able to travel right after 9/11 while being wanted by the police. Or the vilain needing some ""advance tech"" (for the time period) to locate the girls. There is a few situations like these where you need to really not think too long about it otherwise it does look completely impossible.But when it comes to me, i can usually just enjoy a silly movie for 2h of entertainement and not focuss too much on these details. I think this is how these movies are supposed to be watched.In other words when i finished Madame Web i taught ""bah... that was ok, i had some fun with it"". Then i watched a bunch of reviews and spoiler talks on Youtube where they dissects the movie apart and yes then i can see all these ""plot holes"" and issues. But on the spot... i didn't really because i didn't focuss on this.Even tough i ""review"" every movies i see these days, i consider myself a movie fan, not a film critic. You can see that i enjoy about 90%+ of movies i watch to various degrees going usually from 6 to 10 out of 10. Im rather easily pleased with movies, i look for fun and entertainement, not art in them, and i usually watch what i think ill enjoy. And even when its a movie i didn't enjoyed that much, often i recognize its qualities and that it was just not in the style i like. For instance when its very slow paced.So for me to dump on a movie, it need to be awfull. Madame Web was not the case for me. It wasn't anything special but i felt it was overall a coherent movie, it told its story.I do have a question tough. You cast Sydney Sweeney in your movie. Why give her the role of the ""unatractive dork"" when you have one of the sexiest woman alive today? They gave her baggy cloathes, glasses, average haircut, but its still Sydney Sweeney ... and her big ...assets. She was really misscast in my opinion.Well that was a long one. So overall no its not ""so bad its good"" like Batman & Robin. But its neither so bad and boring as Catwoman. I think i may had liked this one more than Morbius personally. I was fine seeing it once, but not really interested to rewatch it ocasionally like Phase 1-3 of Marvel movies.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

If you wonder why I even bothered watching Madame Web, then I would like to let you know that I had to attend this film because of my job. The reviews for this film were particularly negative and even adamant fans of the Marvel franchise were harshly critical of this movie. For the very first time regarding a cinematic release of the Marvel franchise, I must honestly admit that this movie isn't as bad as most people claim. I'm not going to tell you that it's a great or even a good movie because it isn't but it ultimately qualifies as average flick.The story revolves around antisocial paramedic Cassandra Webb who experiences signs of clairvoyance. She thus saves the lives of three teenagers who are targeted by a mysterious enemy. Cassandra Webb soon learns that the brutal antagonist is also related to her own past. The paramedic thus supports the three teenagers in defeating their powerful enemy.On the positive side, this movie manages to entertain through most of its running time and features only a few unnecessary scenes. The settings of the jungles of Peru in the seventies and a busy New York City in the early years of the millennium complement each other particularly well. The film's special effects have been created with care and especially the final fighting scene at a firework factory should be enjoyed on the big screen.On the negative side, the actresses and actors lack emotions, empathy and energy to appeal to the audience. Lead actress Dakota Johnson is particularly pale and incarnates one of the least sympathetic protagonists I have come across in quite some time. The story is insultingly predictable to appeal to a wide audience and particularly to young teenagers and children. The ridiculous references to the Marvel universe in the film's conclusion feel pulled out of thin air.At the end of the day, Madame Web is a decent movie for anyone who is looking for an entertaining fantasy film with beautiful locations, thorough pace and impressive special effects. Anyone who is hoping for great acting skills, a clever story or any elements breaking new ground can skip this film entirely. Madame Web isn't as bad as some harsh critics claim but it remains an average movie that will only appeal to adamant fans of Marvel Comics. Here's hope that at least some viewers will finally understand how shallow these superhero movies are, stop promoting them by watching them and thus inspire brave, creative and fresh change in cinema.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Going to save you some time.Truly, truly I say, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Hands down.2 hours of my life I'll never get backIf you don't believe me, catch the first 20 minutes, and it never ever gets any better.The superheroes in costume at the beginning of the movie exist in a total of about 4 minutes of screen time in nothing but 2 dream sequences.What you saw in the trailer is about all you get.Horrible acting
Horrible plot

I get that it is a superhero marvel film so the bar is high, but I feel like others will enjoy this. I also went to the theatres with very low expectations because of the reviews this film had going into opening day, but I gave it a chance anyways and I enjoyed it.

So go see it, don't listen to all the reviews, some people really just expect too much.","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

It is full of action, mystery, suspense, sisterhood and girl power. There are some heartfelt moments and the chemistry between the four leading ladies is outstanding. The film definitely kept me entertained from beginning to end.Madame Web tells the standalone origin story of one of Marvel's most enigmatic heroines. The suspense-driven thriller stars Dakota Johnson as Cassandra Webb, a paramedic in Manhattan who develops the power to see the future and realizes she can use that insight to change it. Forced to confront revelations about her past, she forges a relationship with three young women bound for powerful destinies if they can all survive a deadly present.I really loved learning who Madame Web is and how she became a heroine. I loved all the action scenes and watching the girls come together to fight against the villain Ezekiel. I loved seeing the girls in their costumes and the action was entertaining. The girls include Sydney Sweeney as Julia Cornwall, Celeste O'Connor as Mattie Franklin and Isabela Merced as Anya Corazon. The movie left me wanting more and hoping for a sequel so we can find out how the girls got their powers and what happens next! The chemistry between the four leading ladies is truly amazing. They work so well together and look like they are having so much fun together. Their friendship seems genuine on the screen. The battle scenes are epic, especially the last one when the girls work together and fight the villain Ezekiel.Madame Web is about teamwork, girl power, friendship, family, heart and action. It shows how friends will always be there for you, no matter what, and reminds you to always stay true to who you are. It is perfect for date night or a family movie night. Everyone will love it. The best part is that if you are a fan of Marvel movies, you don't have to see any previous movies to understand Madame Web. This movie stands alone with a phenomenal cast and great story line. It is rated PG-13 and it is 1 hour and 54 minutes.I give Madame Web 4 out 5 stars and I recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. Madame Web is in theaters now.

While you could argue about all the plot points you didn't like all day, from a production standpoint it's a well made film. The cinematography/ color grade was fantastic. The set design actually blended in so well, I couldn't tell where the blue screen normally is. Also I loved the editing surrounding her premonitions.

The cast was the one thing it had going for it as it had names to the film. I enjoyed parts where they incorporated comic book elements from the Madame Web story and put them into this such as the jungle and how her abilities worked. That's it. For a superhero movie the lack of actual superheros in the film is ridiculous, the girls who are spider women aren't in costume for very long, I appreciate the attention to detail with real suits and not CGI to make it look as close to characters as possible but it was barely a minute of content of that. It was a very messy movie and the action wasn't even that good. It consisted of her being confused by her abilities for half the movie and the villain chasing the girls round a lot back and fourth. The villain was really bad too, his motivation was essentially nothing and why he was defending himself and what he built so bad wasn't really explained at all. The suit for the villain was lazy too and was most likely a painted over Spider-Man suit as it looked exactly like Spider-Man but black and red. The plot for Ben Parker and others was just a whole messy thing that felt pointless and pretty sure was cut out of the film, if they kept that it probably would've been more interesting. The script really let this movie down the most, very bland and uninterested in itself with things being thrown everywhere. Overall not a good movie.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

After many visions, she has to save three girls that on some way or other is connected to her. Everything is connected somehow in the film, and the poster tagline ""Her Web Connects them All"" gives a lot of sense for me now. For the story, I can safely say that this was a very ok spin-off to a great universe, it doesn't show that big connection to the spider-verse here, but if this film gets a sequel, then I can call it a fair start. Nothing that's amazing, just ok, good enough story, Madame Web introduced as a character performed by Dakota Johnson was nice, she was carrying her role good, and her performance? Well, it had good parts, but she was very decent, I can't really say much about her. The three girls she meets afterwards, Julie, Mattie and Anya had a very important meaning for the story, and that was very cool, yet as characters I think they were very goofy and weird and I'm not sure if I liked them or not. Something about the trio was strange, I felt like they missed the coolness, something missed you know. But them co-operating with Madame Web was showed greatly, the friendship and so. The main villain dressed up in a Spider-Man like costume was ok. He isn't that rememberable, but I liked how they showed the figure of Spider-Man as something evil, I think it was needed for the film. The ending of the film felt to moralising, too much talk like: ""Fight for what you love"" or ""Never give up your dreams"" and all this damn moral that felt too pushed in wasn't that good. If they didn't have that and could have a better structured ending after the epic final fight, then I think a star higher could be added to my rating. The action went very fine, the final fight did hit really great, as well as the previous fights that came along on the way. I watched it in 4Dx and personally it was a bit overwhelming, not all of the features and effects did hit the spots on the film, but that is not the film's fault. The editing and dynamic camera angles was very good and carried a big part of the film. The motage was very fast-paced and cool, as well as all of the cuts and transitions. The music score was ok, introducing on the way Britney Spears song ""Toxic"" that fit one of the action scenes. After all, Madame Web was an ok film, it entertained, some things could be better, but this should probably be a fun way to spend your time.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

The way is to put yourself back in the mindset of roughly 25 years ago (which coincidentally is the time period the film is set in). Back then, superhero films were new -- think the first two Spiderman movies -- the superpowers were more specific and limited, the stakes were smaller, the stories were personal and kind of low-key compared with the present time. It was all fresh and new and started at a level you could believe. When you see it through that lens, there are things to enjoy. Dakota Johnson in the lead role is fine and she's on screen for almost every scene. The occasional 'Web vision' sequences are well done too, and the references to spiderweb patterns everywhere she looks are kind of clever.In other words: superhero movies don't have to be all Avengers-infinity-War level all the time with their universe-saving stakes, characters with godlike powers, and endless screen-melting battle scenes. The sequence starting with Iron Man (2008) and ending with Endgame (2019) was pretty amazing, but we might not see anything like it again. ""Ordinary superhero"" films can work too and we're in a different era.All that being said, Madame Web does have serious problems. The script and dialog are pretty uninspired -- like it passed through too many hands. The villain Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) is cringeworthy, about as good as if he were doing a second rehearsal. The main plotline is that Cassie Webb (Johnson) is trying to save three young women who are going to become Spiderwomen (played by Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor) from being brutally killed, a fate that she's seen with her precognitive power. But the action wanders and jumps around here and there and never feels like it settles on a coherent approach. Unfortunately, I would guess that these three young actresses are never going to get the chance to play their nascent Spiderwomen roles again. That's a shame, because there are some good storylines in that direction to work with.It's great that IMDb shows the viewer votes and not just thumbs-up or thumbs-down. But you really have to go beyond the average rating and look at the full bar graph of the actual votes (which you can see by clicking on the average rating at upper right on the screen). From the graph, you can see for yourself what the trollvote factor is (the bin at 1/10), discard it, and look at the REAL average from the rest. It's always obvious where the real center of the distribution is, and I usually find that I agree with it. I don't know if I've ever seen a movie that truly deserved a 1/10 and I don't think this one does either -- but despite some good elements, I can't rate it higher than about 4 or 5. And of course, there are way too many 'fans' out there who can't seem to stand superhero movies led by F rather than M protagonists and will not take these movie on their merits.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

From its muddled plot to its lackluster performances, there's little to redeem this cinematic misfire.The story, if one can call it that, is a tangled web of confusion. It's as if the filmmakers threw every cliché and trope into a blender and hit ""puree."" There's no coherence, no logic, just a series of nonsensical events strung together in the hopes that the audience won't notice the lack of substance.The characters fare no better. Madame Web herself, supposedly the central figure of the film, is little more than a cardboard cutout with a few lines of dialogue thrown in for good measure. The supporting cast is equally forgettable, with performances ranging from wooden to downright cringeworthy.Visually, ""Madame Web"" is a snooze-fest. The special effects are laughably bad, with CGI that looks like it was lifted straight from a mid-90s video game. Action sequences are poorly choreographed, and even the most basic of stunts are executed with all the grace of a drunken elephant.In the end, ""Madame Web"" is a film that fails on every level. It's not entertaining, it's not thought-provoking, it's not even so bad it's good. It's just bad. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this cinematic disaster.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

This film is the most radical demonstration of this precept. Those of us who grew up reading comics know that we must honor our characters (gender, race, ability). No one would dream of representing Napoleon as if he were Chinese or Jefferson as if he were Indian; They wouldn't show them as women either.... But with comic book characters the freedom is absolute and then Madame Webb is no longer an old invalid but a young woman with a story as uninteresting as that of my breakfast this morning. What happens next is one nonsense after another; It is a film without redemption, where even the villain competes with Dakota Johnson to see who is more disastrous. It is an incompetent film, without soul, without appeal or talent. Everything that happens is predictable, everything that happens lacks incentive to continue falling in love with this genre (superhero movies) that increasingly looks more exhausted thanks to the lack of ideas and the absolute absence of fidelity to the original material.

For that reason, I'll always give each of them a chance. Upon hearing such awful things about Madame Web, I was worried but still open-minded. Well, I do believe certain critics are being a little too harsh on just how bad it is, but yes, it's not a good film at all. There are some nice ideas and a few positive things going for it, but as a whole, it all came down to the screenplay for me, which is easily the worst aspect here.The film follows Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) as she begins to gain the ability to see into the near future. This ability enables her to try and prevent people from dying, which comes in handy because a man by the name of Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) is after her and three other women, simply because he has had visions that they will murder him in the future. Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Anya (Isabela Merced), and Mattie (Celeste O'Connor) round out the main cast, but never did I sense the chemistry between these three. Cassandra is the main character, but the film doesn't work if these other three characters aren't given anything to work with, which is exactly the case here.Instead of letting you experience the film and figure things out for yourself, this is a screenplay that spoon-feeds everything to you. After Cassandra discovers her abilities, the audience should easily understand how they work. Still, for some reason, lines of dialogue are said that literally express what she just did, even if she's the only one in the room. There are also far too many plot conveniences that make the story easier to tell and that just hurt my head. Each of the side characters has a similar backstory, which makes it easier for them all to be there and not have families worried about where they are. On top of that, either there was a lot cut out of this film, or there were a lot of bizarre editing choices. Either way, Madame Web felt slow, rushed, messy, and disjointed all at once.I enjoyed the dead-pan performance from Dakota Johnson though. Her line delivery, even with the poor dialogue, was enjoyable to me. The villain storyline could have been interesting as well, it's just that the performance by Rahim feels very wooden and it was obvious that they changed his dialogue in post-production. The ADR work here is very much visible. Look, I'm a huge Spider-Man fan, so I'll be watching anything that's related, but I just can't recommend this one at all. There are a few moments that got a chuckle out of me and I liked the central performance, but other than that, Madame Web is a failure.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's still a watchable film if you're a fan of the genre. However, don't expect a groundbreaking addition to the Spider-Verse; Madame Web ultimately settles for a predictable formula. Dakota Johnson delivers a solid performance as Cassandra Webb, but the supporting cast feels underdeveloped. The film's visuals are occasionally striking, but lack the distinct style that could have elevated the material.

Okay, that movie is the literal GODFATHER compared to this heap of immeasurable trash. It is entirely UNWATCHABLE. It is purely inconceivable that a movie can physically be this bad, it just breaks all human understanding and comprehension. There isn't a single redeeming quality in this in any way at all. Never ever, EVER watch even a single second of this complete and total disaster.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think the main problem lies within the casting Directors as I feel they did not make the right decisions - especially with Dakota Johnson. I think she's great But she doesn't have a wide range of characteristics she can play and at best she should stick to rom-coms. This movie needed a bad a*s (Charlize Theron, Angela Bassett , Mila jovich, Michelle Rodriguez) , and Dakota gave stoner girl next door. The performance ultimately felt lazy and careless. The antagonist was nothing more than forgettable. I don't even remember his name. This movie needed a diabolical man (Christopher Waltz, John Malkovich, Samuel Jackson) and what he gave was pissed off drama queen. The three other girls in the movie also needed a little more pizzazz , all 3 of them combined failed to bring girl power this movie needed to be great. All and all the movie feels like a rough draft. If they hadn't screwed this up there could have be 1 or 2 more solid movies to bank on.. I yearn for the day Hollywood can get a Woman led action movie right.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

At first glance, the movie delivers a solid performance, weaving a complex narrative that challenges the viewer's perception with its clever use of deja vu scenes and intricate plot developments. This bold attempt at depicting the elusive phenomenon of deja vu might leave some audiences feeling bewildered and, at times, frustrated, as if caught in a web of confusion. One can't help but empathize with the filmmakers' daunting task of translating such an abstract concept onto the screen-envisioning themselves in the director's chair, grappling with the question, ""How do we visually articulate this experience?""Marvel movies are no strangers to experimenting with narrative techniques aimed at bending the viewer's mind, often culminating in blockbuster hits. However, ""Madame Web"" treads a fine line, occasionally stumbling into repetition and monotony that might not sit well with everyone. This has led to a mixed reception, with some critics quick to point out its flaws.Yet, upon reflecting on the movie as a whole, a realization dawns-the seemingly disjointed pieces fit together in a way that makes perfect sense, offering a satisfying resolution to the initially puzzling journey. While ""Madame Web"" may not ascend to the heights of Marvel's most iconic films, it holds its ground with a commendable effort. It's a movie that merits a 7/10, worth watching once with a bucket of popcorn in hand, and appreciating it as an origin story that adds another layer to the Marvel tapestry. Here's hoping the characters introduced find their way back into the Marvel storyline in future projects, further unraveling the mysteries they've begun to explore.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Yes, of course there were some outliers among them who were really good, but the large part after Avengers: Endgame seemed to be far undersized. The low point was reached in my opinion with The Eternals and The Marvels. The advantage that Madame Web has is that it was once again made by Sony Pictures, so that already offers a little bit of hope. That hope turned out to be unjustified, because immediately after the film was released, Madame Web was razed to the ground by critics, so much so that I really started to have my doubts a bit about whether that was justified. With a dramatically low audience score on both Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, Madame Web has been put to dead and I definitely want to judge that myself. It wasn't as bad as these sites wanted to come across and The Eternals and The Marvels still remain the worst out of Marvel's stable, but Madame Web knows how to hold a solid third place very simply as far as I'm concerned.With a budget of about $80 million in your pocket, names like Dakota Johnson and rising star Sydney Sweeney, you'll still expect to get something decent to see. But that lags far behind. The opening is not yet so terrible, but it lacks some form of logic in the film at every point. Constance, Cassandra Webb's mother, is looking for a special spider in the Jungle along with Ezekiel. With her pregnant belly she finds the spider that should be able to cure diseases, but Ezekiel has other plans with that, why? No idea. Eventually he steals the spider and leaves Contance for death, who is found again by a mysterious tribe that Constance is pricked by the spider and finally get baby Cassandra. You, after the incident she likes spontaneously, but okay. We see that more often in movies. Then the whole thing moves to Manhattan where Cassandra works on the ambulance. No form of explanation or anything is given and suddenly Cassandra has all the powers. It doesn't really hit side or shore, but good.Then the three ladies Julia, Anya and Mattie come up completely without explanation and out of nowhere and suddenly Ezekiel is after them for no reason in a kind of Spider-Man suit, something Madame Web is a spin off of. All you know is that Ezekiel has visions of the ladies wanting to kill him, the why still remains and mystery. What Ezekiel's big plan actually is, that also remains a mystery and I can really make sure that Ezekiel is really one of the most lousy bad guys I saw in a superhero movie, it doesn't make sense at all and even worse, it really doesn't go anywhere. You are thrown into the action from time to time, the story literally goes in all directions and in the end you can do nothing with it and most people will be left in amazement at what they have actually been looking at. There could have been so much more in this, but in my opinion Madame Web was really rightly burned down and if this is the yardstick that the future Marvel- films are going to come with, then I really give up completely.Madame Web may not be as bad as many want to make it happen, but the reactions are easy to understand. The story goes in all directions and sometimes really makes no sense at all. In terms of bad guys, with Ezekiel we really get to see the most lousy villain from all Marvel- movies combined. What his final goal was remains a very big mystery even after the film. With a budget of 80 million dollars and such a casting, you would expect to be able to make something much better than this bad product. He always remains even better than The Eternals and The Marvels, but a solid third place definitely takes this film.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Plenty of other reviews have hounded the direction, story, and weak characters. But, just for starters, this was shot on the most technically advanced, industry-favored camera set up (the Arri Alexa Mini LF, Panavision lenses) and they SOMEHOW managed to bake an image that looked like a high school film club's midterm project. I mean, it's just astounding. The color choices are so bizarre, some shots were under exposed and then were ""recovered"" in post, producing a really sophomoric, noisy image. Everything that could have been bad about this was. That's the tip of the iceberg - I have never, in all my years working in the industry, seen ADR this bad. The main villain's voice was re-done in post production, they went with the most bizarre mixed accent, and almost none of his lines matched his mouth movements. His accent changes throughout the film, his delivery sounds like an anime character's. There is no way it wasn't on purpose. This has to be a failed promotional stunt, or a social experiment or something.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Previous Marvel installments in the last decade, such as Dark Phoenix, Morbius, and even Fantastic Four (2015) were better than this. I dare say, this may even be the worst Marvel movie since ""Captain America"" from way back in 1990.Apparently, this is meant to be a prequel to Spider-Man, but it completely lacks the enjoyable aspects of that franchise. It doesn't even feel like a Spider-Man movie at all. It's more like a bad mixture of Marvel, Terminator, and Final Destination.Admittingly, the premonition and time travel-based story had some potential, but it was handled so haphazardly, it's difficult to even keep track of what's happening and there's little enjoyment factor involved. The redundancy in which Dakota uses her clairvoyance ability only dulls the film even more.With the exception of Ben Parker (Adam Scott), none of the cast members fit their roles and fail to deliver even an average performance and few of the characters are likeable. Dakota constantly speaks in a monotone while delivering her lines. In fact, all of the actors appear as bored as the audience undoubtedly was. The three girls aren't fully fleshed out and barely differ in personality, making them forgettable. Ezekial is a whiny and ineffective villain who couldn't intimidate a kindergardener. To be fair, I can't personally fault them due to the terrible script.There's nothing very new or cool shown during the action scenes. In fact, the awkward camera angles, fast-paced editing, and blurriness make them as confusing as the story. It even reminded me only too painfully of the aforementioned ""Catwoman"" from 2004, which suffered from similar flaws.Overall, this movie was a hot mess with a sloppy story, bad acting, horrible writing, and boring action scenes that isn't worth wasting your time on, even if you are a hardcore Marvel fan.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The concept in the writing of this movie could have been a lot better, because the thought of having a Madame Web movie could have been quite suitable for Sony, but I don't know what group of elementary students are junior high students they got together to write this movie it was completely garbage. One thing I don't understand is that there were a lot of great actors in this movie but they were completely used the wrong way as of contributing to it a Marvel/ Sony movie. I can honestly say I think this is one of the worst Marvel movies that I've ever seen, and I am pretty good with giving Marvel movies their props, as well as Sony but this movie was completely a waste of time. I'm kind of frustrated that I actually waste time to sit here and watch it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Silver Age of the 1960s was the high point of the industry, with Marvel and DC both selling a fistful of characters that got 500K units per month.2. Those stories were aimed at young boys who liked Superheroes.When the comics moved into the 1970s...sales declined.I understand that Sony needs to produce a Marvel product so many years to hang to character rights it purchased when Marvel was down and busted in the 1990s. So that company has more or less pushed out product without the care for detail and story and consistency that we've seen from the MCU.So...here's a concept, let's take a 1980 Marvel character that was never overly popular and then hand it to SJ Clarkson, who never read a comic book in her life. She could care less about the underlying concepts or psychology driving Comic Book movies. This is about a lady who comes to term with her mom and then helps 3 girls because this some girl power story or something.I saw this with Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins. Women are being given the opportunity to helm 'major pictures' ...go girls....but when you don't understand the Genre...you get Madame Web and durn mediocre Movie that seems like a Lifetime Movie of the week.This story lacks any real humor. It lacks any real emotional commitment between any of the characters. You got a great bunch of talent here and nobody says a damn thing worth remembering. Our heroine is just there. You've got a bunch of gorgeous women and you totally strip them of any sex appeal or charm and make them as generic as you can.SJ Clarkson has probably never seen any of the important movies in this genre in the last twenty years, which is why the action scenes come across like they are from a 1990s movie.When I consider the love, detail, care and obvious thrill of Favreau, Waititi the Russo Brothers, Gunn directing movies in a Genre that they loved and grew up with, and then you compare it to these female directors who are clueless about what Comic Books are about....the problem becomes obvious.These are big budget movies, and obviously equity and social justice in choosing who gets the helm them is a bad idea.I thought most of the actors in this movie are capable of giving you a great experience. This story, and this director just were Kryptonite for a Comic book movie.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's watchable. I guess the hate here is more for Dakota Johnson, who after being cast in the Fifty shades films, some people don't take her seriously enough to have a major role as a superhero. She doesn't seem to have a strong chemistry with the other actresses for most of this film, but the end shows a different picture. The story is not bad, but definitely needs more work.Half of the film is chaotic, not giving enough background and there isn't a natural flow between moments. It looks a lot like a compilation of highly edited scenes put together as a movie. The replay of some moments in the film might put some people off. I just found it funny and as a way to lead to more significant scenes.The pluses on this film seem to be the soundtrack, having some important names in the cast and portraying feminist ideas like women can be badass superheroes as well. Guess people don't want to see that ?! Or are not ready !There's no after credits scenes so don't stay in the cinema after credits start !I think this is a 6/10 film and hope there will be more instalments of Madame Web, in which the producers, directors and the cast can do a better job and get better reviews and recognition!","4 out of 16 found this helpful.

It seems Sony is a thorn with ambition to milk the spider-verse. Madame Web is the next venture and what a disaster that has been delivered to Marvel fans, Spidey fans and the impressionable younger newer generation coming through. The movie is bad without the toxicity of upset fandoms. No doubt this movie will be remembered for its bad reviews as did DC's 2004 Catwoman.The movie felt like the script been dusted and cobwebs brush aside from the 1980s vaults. The script was so 1980's A-B storytelling it was straight-forward ""insert here"" character situation. In addition, the script only update was nicking bits from other movies.There is sexualisation of three younger heroines for perverted pleasures for teen boys instead of using a brilliant opportunity to deliver admirable strong female role models. Thus, remain cardboard cutouts throughout the whole film. A similar problem was also with associates with both Madame and the villain Sims, they just go nowhere (or simply vanished) when they could have easily had stronger dialogue in the plot and been there right through to the end.In conclusion, I felt like I was watching a possible tv series but instead I had to endure basic A-B plot jammed into two hours. I tried to enjoy the movie, but it was just a massive disaster.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"1","/10","Disappointingly Derivative: A Review of ""Madaem""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9691721/?ref_=tt_urv","mdmominulislam-68549","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur179067558/?ref_=tt_urv","21 March 2024","As a cinephile always on the lookout for innovative storytelling and fresh narratives, I eagerly anticipated ""Madem."" However, my excitement quickly dissipated within the first few minutes of the film.""Madem"" fails to deliver anything remotely engaging or original. Instead, it feels like a mishmash of tired tropes and clichés stitched together with subpar acting and uninspired direction.One of the most glaring issues with ""Madem"" is its lack of character development. The protagonist is a cookie-cutter rendition of every revenge-seeking vigilante we've seen countless times before. There's nothing compelling or nuanced about her journey; she simply moves from one revenge set-piece to another without any real depth or motivation.Moreover, the supporting cast adds little to the narrative. Their performances are wooden at best, with dialogue so stilted it's almost painful to endure. It's as if the actors themselves couldn't muster any enthusiasm for the project, and it shows in every scene.Visually, ""Madem"" is equally unimpressive. The cinematography lacks imagination, opting for generic shots that do nothing to enhance the story or atmosphere. Even the action sequences, which should be the film's saving grace, feel choreographed and uninspired.Perhaps most disappointing is the wasted potential of the premise. A story centered around a female protagonist seeking revenge in a male-dominated underworld could have been a captivating exploration of power dynamics and gender politics. Instead, ""Madem"" reduces itself to mindless violence and gratuitous scenes that add nothing of substance to the narrative.In conclusion, ""Madem"" is a forgettable addition to the genre that offers nothing new or noteworthy. Its lack of originality, poor character development, and uninspired execution make it a film that's best avoided. Save yourself the disappointment and invest your time elsewhere.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I appreciated the ambition that was Eternals. I saw the inklings of a good story hidden inside The Marvels. I thoroughly appreciate Sharknado.Also, I don't read comics so I don't give a damn about canon and I don't know what happened in them.Watching this, I could only wonder at what was there before all the edits, as I believe those edits are responsible for much of the film's woes.The acting, overall, was fine. Some of the talent really tried - perhaps those not in the loop regarding the overall script. I can't comment on the big bad guy, because I can't tell if that's really his voice or not. If it is, he needs to look into a different career.The action was passable, but lacklustre due to poor cinematography and logic failures.Yet again we have a studio trying to force-kickstart a franchise without bothering to do the hard work - DC tried it, Universal tried it. But, hey, Sony can't go wrong, right? Welp.The shame is, this movie isn't just bad on its own. It dilutes and taints anything associated with it. Now Uncle Ben has prior knowledge of 'spider powers'. Now Spider-Man isn't so special. Now those spiders are effectively slot-machines, dishing out random powers to their victims. Peter getting his particular powers was just a random dice roll.So, I guess that's on-brand for Marvel and Disney these days. Release some poorly thought-out crap that wrecks everything before and after because what possible tension can there be if characters like Captain Marvel or Rey exist?I didn't write this to jump on the bandwagon. I wrote this because I'm just sad. I miss the good old days.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Both the actor playing the villain and the one playing the heroine seemed to have no feel for how to portray their characters and were clearly miscast into the rolls.

This is not a bad film. It's not a Marvel hit, and it certainly has plenty of plotholes. But it's not that bad. Certainly not as bad as Morbius.It's very common these days for the bandwagon to get set on fire. It such a shame. This was obiviously the start of a saga, maybe a triology, but i doubt with the critics reviews and the following backlash we will ever see that now. Sure it doesn't fit 100% with the timeline but.. duh.. Spiderman Far From Home? Jees, we all ignored that one. But the momentum of these bad reviews has already sealed the fate of Madame Web.This is not a bad movie. And make no mistake I'm a huge Marvel fan. Its just I'm able to watch a movie for what it is. I saw the ratings of 1 star everywhere and gave it a chance. It's a solid 6, less if you have strong feelings about the timeline. Its an origin story, with dodgy connections. But it's not a bad movie. It's almost not even a proper superhero movie as the lead 3 girls don't even develop their powers yet. But jees, it's not a 1 star movie. Lead villain... great casting but questionable dialogue and direction. Lead Woman... Wish she had studied more haha. Lead 3, beautiful, talented, great actresses, trying to get a foothold on a superhero franchise ina crowded market. They did great, they were meant to be virgin superheroes in this film. But I guess we will never get to see them bloom because of this stupid backlash.This movie world these days is so fickle. We didn't even get chance to let the public/viewer scores settle before the Usurper/critics led the charge and decreed a new religion. This is rubbish. Since when does the bank of critics have this power? Its rubbish and embarassing.Watch this film as it is, and have no expectations, and i bet you will find it a 6 or 7 and never a 1.This all doesn't mean anything anymore unless people give it a chance. It's not perfect, but it has a good story.(Oh and yeah she travels to and from Peru in too little time, i get it. Suspension of disbelief, come on. Who the hell knows how far Dagobah was for Luke anyhow? It's like ineed to take a tape measure to the cinema, why would i do that?

The character of Madam Web needs to end with this film and remain a scant mention in the future, IF there is going to be a future. I'm doubtful.

It is just a normal origin story. I didn't think this movie was near as bad as people claim. The only thing I could think of is all these people hating on women leads in these superhero movies.

Madame Web had so much potential: the plot and the ideas were all there, if only it was executed so, so much better. I watched this with my family one night and we were all so shocked by this film.The acting is lacking, the performances given were flat and boring, no hate to the actors and actresses whatsoever. The dialogue was just so horrible-it was choppy, boring, predictable, and extremely unrealistic. The CGI is bad and the action...don't even get me started. There was little to none in this movie and those action scenes were just so boring...there were no stakes, no risks, no excitement for us viewers to watch.The characters were so flat and there was no character development whatsoever. They felt so stereotypical and not original in any way. The villain had no personality whatsoever. His motives were boring and generic. The main character, Madame Web, had little to no personality and it was hard to resonate or relate to her, or any of the characters, really. The three girls were all flat in character, although the movie tried to make them seem more deep with their sob backstories. The way they portray the teenagers is so stupidly unrealistic, it's infuriating. No one would actually do or say any of those things in real life, and I feel like this applies to the whole movie.There were some plot holes and other storylines that were just so unnecessary. They also throw almost every single trope or overused scene ideas in this movie, which was annoying. The excitement, mystery, and thrill of this movie was completely gone and spoiled because you would see everything beforehand in her visions, which is ridiculous. And it gets a bit tedious, because sometimes, you can't tell what is visions or what isn't, so you see it, you're just starting to get excited, when it goes back to the present and we have to rewatch that entire scene over again, but changed by Madame Web.To wrap this up, Madame Web had a lot of potential, but fell extremely short in acting, dialogue, storytelling, script, and action sequences. I did not enjoy this movie, and neither did my family, and I would not watch it again. I do not recommend.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, they could have used these powers in a more creative way or implement a unique visual style when these powers appear on screen. It is a shame, because Sony manages to do this with the 'Spider-Verse' films but not with the live-action ones. Some of the superhero costumes were quite good, but barely feature in the film.The main villain's motivation was quite silly and did not make a lot of sense if you dissect the plot a bit. I don't know if there was an issue with the main villain's accent or possibly with dubbing, but there was something off about it. Every time he speaks in the film you can tell there is an issue with his audio. The dialogue was definitely one of the worst aspects as a whole.I would not recommend this personally, but you may enjoy it in a 'so bad it is good' way.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That itself makes the film take a big hit.As for the movie itself, I think it's bagged on more than it deserves to be, but it won't be the best film you see in any given point in time. The story is a little lackluster, but I was still entertained. People complain about Madame Web not being old, but don't realize this is a coming of age story on how she got her powers (in a Hollywood take). It sets up a sequel, or at least spin off movies with the other characters who appear in costume in a future setting. Sadly, the lack of success makes me believe that'll never come to light.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I also hope Sony continues exploring down the spider hole. Just hope along the way we get a Venom-Spider-Man movie. No this movie won't win any Oscar's and probably won't even end up being the best superhero movie this year (sorry but Deadpool).

I lived how their was interaction and some refences to the spiderman marvel universe, whilst also maintain its own story in this movie. Their was great action animation work also which helped explain the story.Some timeline moments in the movie was confusing at times, but I think the director done well in this movie to set up for a sequal I feel.

Is it a 10? Absolutely not. This film misses on a lot but not everything. The film needs a recast bad, the antagonist is just a miss, and lacks any type of chemistry with the other actors. The ADR work is horrific, often not syncing with mouths. Dakota probably wasn't the best pick but she worked hard with a bad script... ""Now you're showing off"". You get a feeling just from watching that the cast knew this script was poorly written. In many scenes it just felt like they were reading off a page and not having a conversation.The film tried its best to build a backstory but came up a little short. If this movie had 30ish more minutes for story telling that would have went a long way.TLDR: Madame web could have been a 8/10 movie with a recast, 30 extra minutes of story telling and a pretty serious rewrite of some lines. As always Adam Scott was a rock in this film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The animation (or lack of it), the superbad rubbery costume of the tribes (looked much like coming from some 80s low-budget TV movie), and that well-groomed Spanish looking tribal chief - all of them are total spoilsports.Secondly, Dakota should do something about her lifeless casual acting or actually the lack of energy which is evident across every single frame. Despite being such a famed actress, she maintained the same facial expressions and monotonous voice throughout the various events in the movie. It might have served other movies but this one is a Marvel movie and she is somehow the titular character!Thirdly, Tahar Rahim is not at all a good match for the Sims character that he had played. If you have ever gone through the Amazing Spider-Man books, you must have noticed the character looked completely different. It had a super-wrinkled face, crooked mien, grey hair etc. But Tahar looked fresh out of Salon every time he was presented. Plus, he looked so weird in the black spider suit, which seemed to me like a suit made by cutting truck tyres.I (and I am sure you too) can go on like this but, in actual, there are so many annoying, meaningless scenes which keeps pointing to only one direction - this is a stupid, lackluster movie, not even worth my neighbor's dog's time.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The media destroyed this movie. Vilified it. And, in my opinion, all that was (mostly) the power of the Disney lobby. In my opinion, the story was well told, Dakota was quite engaging as a lead, and I really enjoyed the movie.All the way from the top. It's a superhero movie. So nothing is really required to make sense.However, the origin story of MW made sense within the realm of fantasy and comics. Actually, it made a lot of sense.The villain was not as developed, but at least you could understand how he became a villain, and why was he doing what he was doing.The support characters are just part of the plot, and not really that important at this moment for this story. In any case, a nice link up for a second movie.I think the movie was directed, produced and managed quite nicely. Even a bit more than nice, when compared to The Flash (or anything DC but Nolan's Bat or The Joker, though I confess to be a fan of the Peacemaker)I also think it was a better movie than some of the marvel swirl we've tasted. E.g., the eternals, Iron Man 3 (love Kingsley, hate the movie) Thor the Dark World (C'mon) and (please forgive me, all (ALL) of the TV shows. Ms. Marvel sucked so hard. Loki... . Ok. Is entertaining. Secret War made want to kill myself.ON an unrelated note, Marvel seems to prefer quantity over quality. And that's the Disney approach. But WB and DC give you very little quality, and very little quality.To sum up. Long live Sony. Loved all (ALL) of Raimi's Spidey movies. Just because of style.Enjoyed Garfield's SM. Hated it when Gwen died, but I thought a 3rd film would give us MJ.Morbius... OK. Not as great as it could have been. Venom... Oh Lord! More! 2nd Ghost rider was hell. 1st I still like.Remember, that Your favorite spidey, Holland, is part Sony and part (aaaarrrgggg) Disney.Disney has been destroying everything we loved (if you're aprox 50 or less) by turning all the fantasy worlds we loved into something lacking originality or inspiration. In the same way, everybody is doing exactly the same.Darn. This started as an opinion, and is turning into a rant; So let me get back to my main idea.MW is not a bad movie. I enjoyed it. Seen worse. No matter what the media tells you, watch it, and then decide. Regarding movies, that's never a bad idea.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

What was the point of this film? Nothing.Deplorably awful is a good term for this movie.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Everything was just an utter mess, from the writing, to the dialogue to the delivery of those woeful lines. There were so many clear times when they messed their lines and the timing, seeing camera reflections in glasses. That's the sort of thing I expect in the soaps (I'm from the UK, soap operas to my American friends)The camera work was all over the place, had some nice cinematography at times and some of the sound design was not bad. But that mixed in with a bunch of people with the personality of a book of stamps.This is a morbid curiosity film. Watch it if you have a spare couple of hours and a stiff drink.2/10 nothing redeeming about this.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Shows such as Spooks, Hustle and Heroes.She becomes unstuck with Madame Web, the fault lies mostly with a lousy script.Sony celebrating its 100th year stubbornly continues with the Spiderverse. They just keep on hiring rubbish screenwriters.It starts in 1973 when pregnant Constance Webb searches for a rare species of spider with special healing powers in Peru. Only to be betrayed by her guide Ezekiel Sims who steals the spider and leaves Constance for dead.Her baby is saved by the people of the forest and their amazing powers but Constance dies.In 2003, Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is a paramedic in New York. A near death experience gives Cassie and ability to see future events and change it.She uses these powers to save three young women on a subway train. Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazon and Mattie Franklin. They are being pursued by Ezekiel Sims who now possesses spider like powers and regards these women as dangerous to him.Madame Web wants to be a female led superhero movie under the Sony/Marvel banner. It totally lost it when the three women walk out of the forest, straight into a nearby diner and start dancing on a table. Thereby attracting attention when Cassie has warned them to stay hidden.If the writers want to insult the intelligence of their audience that is a matter for them. They should not expect respect or a box office ticket in return.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Super duper week, do not care and if you want to complain about writing, this is where all the bad writing went. ""Those girls cannot exist! They will try to destroy me!"" Etc.Mediocre:
Too much handholding, as with almost all movies in the last 20 years or so. We get exposition, flashbacks, cuts to the bad guys doing their thing when The Character Doesn't Know That. This would have been stronger if it had skipped the entire 1970s exposition and done it all in that halfway thru the movie time when they show half of it anyway.Everything else:
Good!I liked the fight scenes, I liked how the confusing precognition matches how the character perceives it, I like how a bunch of what is happening is not explained right away for a change.I... guess, that a lot of the hate is weird Spiderman fanbois and anyone who hates girls (esp three teen girls, some POC) in their comfortably cheeto-dust covered Comic Book Guy world.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Declaring bankruptcy and floundering to survive the decade, they resorted to selling off the film rights of their beloved superheroes. While nearly all of those rights have now reverted to Marvel Comics under its parent company Disney, the final remaining lost asset is Spider-Man, purchased by Sony. Though the two companies have reached an agreement to allow the Web-Slinger to appear in the incredibly successful Marvel Cinematic Universe, Sony retains the film rights to Spidey's supporting cast. Although less popular than the Wall Crawler, Sony repetitively attempts to force them onto the big screen. Understanding that bit of history, audiences can now watch Madame Web.As an EMT in New York, Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) and Ben Parker (Adam Scott) routinely address emergencies throughout the city. After a car accident puts her in a near-death experience, Webb finds herself left with a mysterious gift of clairvoyance. Suffering from similar futuristic visions, Ezekial Sims (Tahir Rahim) embarks on a journey to hunt down 3 teenage girls. Acting as their protector, Cassandra Webb finds that great responsibility comes with her newfound great power.Spinning a disastrous tale, Madame Web suffers from doing too much and also, not enough. There is a very interesting and attractive film deep down under the mess, but focusing on its most boring elements, the film loses any semblance of redemption. While its best moments get mere seconds of screen time, the superhero/thriller spends most of its time teasing future adventures or referencing the larger Spider-Man mythos. Though it attempts to weave a decent origin story, it constantly dangles a more fascinating adventure that is never explored.Featuring recognizable names, performances ranged from decent to downright abysmal. Most of the line deliveries felt as if they were being read for the first time, lacking any sense of urgency or emotion. With a messy script and unexpressive dialogue to blame, there was not much the cast could do to improve upon it. Worst of all, the majority of Rahim's lines fail to fit the scenes that they're in, sounding as though they had been added in to replace the original dialogue. Though the cast is made up of enjoyable and promising actors, Madame Web will most likely be the lowest point in their careers.Viewer beware, looks can be very deceiving in Sony's newest attempt at a cash grab. While there are very few redeeming moments throughout the film, one of the biggest issues comes before viewers even get to the theaters. The trailers and marketing for the film tease an entirely different story than delivered. Focusing on aspects that are fleeting moments at best, the entire marketing of the film is built on selling a story that doesn't exist. Continuing Sony's trend of declining quality superhero films, Madame Web promises way more than it delivers.Madame Web is reminiscent of a long passed era of comic book films. Relying on its brand and putting minimal effort into the actual film, it fails to create what could have been an enjoyable movie. Prioritizing tongue-in-cheek references over a quality story, Madame Web tangles itself into a forgettable web of lies.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

She grew up in the foster care system due to her mother dying in childbirth. Cassie's mother was doing research on spiders in the jungle at the time of Cassie's birth. This research could've led to hundreds of cures for diseases.Cassie is somewhat awkward, and doesn't really respond to others in a normal, friendly way. While she cares for those she works with, she is closed off emotionally. All of this changes when Cassie has a near-death experience after drowning (well, she drowned after falling off a bridge during her shift as an EMT). She begins to have clairvoyant visions of the future. All of which involve three teenage girls named Julia, Anya, and Mattie. Along with a man named Ezekiel, who knew Cassie's mother.So,, this film is not good. It's not bad either, but it's definitely not good. I saw one review that said this movie made Morbius look like the Dark Knight. Lol, well I wouldn't say that exactly, but it's certainly not too far off. Imo, Morbius was REALLY GOOD by comparison (I actually liked Morbius, just didn't think it was near as good as it should've been).This movie suffered from bad writing, bad direction, no investment in characters or development of them either, and a lot of bad acting. Don't get me wrong, their are some ""ok"" moments. I just don't get how Johnson is still working. Yeah, she's not hard on the eyes, and not a terrible actress, but that in no way equals good either. Sweeney did a good job of making herself seem like a teenager (I continue to like her more the more I see her in things). The other two actresses were perfectly fine, and of course Roberts & Scott were great. The Ezekiel actor was aslo fine, but not a great bad guy either.Overall, there just wasn't enough here to make this movie good. I'd give it a 4.9 rating if that were an option.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But this one didn't interest us in going to the movies to see. So I told him I wanted to wait to see it when it comes out because I was still curious about it. When it was released on Netflix I decided to watch it and my boyfriend wasn't too interested so he started watching it probably 20-30 minutes in.Needless to say he was not amused. I on the other hand am usually pretty laid back with movies and can find enjoyment in most movies, even bad ones. But this one was tough.Dakota Johnson lacked emotion and energy in my opinion. Made the movie feel a bit bland and dull. The three other girls were ok, I didn't love them nor hate them. Tahar Rahim was awful and bland as well. I have never seen him act before so I don't know if he's normally like that or if it was just a fluke with this movie. The only person I actually liked and cared about was Adam Scott's character, Ben Parker.Because of the fact that I am a big Marvel fan and I look forward to Marvel movies (good or bad) I was going to watch this eventually. I was actually somewhat looking forward to this new character being introduced and I felt like there was a lot of potential in it. But sadly I think the director and producers dropped the ball on it.I can also safely say that if you're not like super into Marvel or hero movies in general, you might not be very interested in this one. My parents tried watching it because I had mentioned that I was going to watch it on Netflix but they couldn't even get halfway through it and stopped watching it.Oh and when I had seen the trailers for it before I was under the impression that we would see the three girls in their suits and fighting and whatnot. For the record, that never happens. It was just a quick clip during the villains dreams/visions. Let me just say I was very disappointed.Hopefully our next new hero that gets introduced gets a better movie!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I waited it and I thought that It will be very nice and stunning movie to be honest. From the first seconds of this I was already so confused about what happens in the movie. It looked like if two different scenes tied into one. Also, the actions in the movie was quite unexpected. It was impossible to understand what would happen next.. the events that happened and will happen are very incomprehensible and different. But the special effects are a separate issue.. they look like they were from 2005 or smth? They are not really bad.. the acting wasn't great either. The movie was very long, they could make it much shorter and you wouldn't lose anything from the plot. The scenes are very long, for example, when Cassie was driving, this scene alone took all of 5 minutes. We learned almost nothing except the names of the main characters. Another scene in the forest also takes up a lot of screen time. The events in the movie dont coincide with what will happen. I think that even fans could make such a movie. I think if Cassie had stayed that paramedic, the movie would have been even more interesting than when she became a spider-woman. I dont recommend watching.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Directed by S. J. Clarkson, known for her work in television, the movie ventures into visually overwhelming territory towards its climax, peppered with dialogue that often feels a bit heavy-handed. Yet, there's a charm in how Johnson's character, Cassie Webb, navigates through the peculiar events unfolding around her, her frustration visibly mounting as she tries to make sense of it all.In a particularly gripping moment, Cassie finds herself with literal blood on her hands, foreseeing a death but at a loss on how to stop it. This concept of revisiting events to alter outcomes isn't new-we've seen it in films from ""Groundhog Day"" to ""Happy Death Day."" However, ""Madame Web"" explores these familiar grounds in engaging new ways.Johnson's mastery in delivering dry, witty remarks breathes life into the film, making you long for more scenes of her character dealing with troublesome teenagers with a steadily growing impatience. Her portrayal adds a down-to-earth flair to the superhero genre.Although Sweeney, Merced, and O'Connor are somewhat pigeonholed into simplistic roles, and believably playing high school students stretches the imagination, the group dynamic they share with Johnson adds a layer of enjoyable camaraderie to the mix.A 5/10 movie in my books.

As a reader of the books, I unfortunately had a small bias going into the theater. Of course, characters have been revamped to make a more interesting story, and they introduced some more recent characters in the comics, the three girls.The year is 2003. A 30 something paramedic named Cassie Webb suddenly starts seeing events in the future, but she has no control over what she sees. This leads her down the rabbit hole of finding out her past including her mother's obsession with spiders, and a seemingly immortal man, Ezekiel, obsessed with visions of his own death at the hands of the girls.An amazing set of coincidences brings the 4 women together that has plausibility but is a bit forced, but I can go with that. The film felt very much like a comic book with some of the action having to be moved along a bit quicker than reality just to get on with the story.What follows is a little bit of a slow, clunky middle section of the movie as Cassie tries to understand what's going on, while the three girls act like unruly teenagers calling the attention of Ezekiel.The subplot involving Cassie's paramedic partner, Ben and his pregnant sister-in-law Mary, was inserted with amazing subtlety and it has a huge connection to the MCU, though not specifically named.I liked the movie for the dive into Cassie's evolving mental state, a fresh take on her origin instead of the comic book's version of constant paralysis, and what could be the beginning of Spider-Man spinoffs in the form of recent comic book adaptations of female versions of the character. Cassie's character development was very impressive going from grouchy selfish loner to someone who takes the great power which comes with great responsibility. The Spider-Man references were so well written into the script, I can forgive some of the awkward acting.Oh and a shout out to Sydney Sweeney who is in literally everything right now. I think I've seen her in 5 or 6 films and tv series. Girl, you do you, I'm here for it.Unfortunately, I don't think the movie is going to do well in theaters due to the obscurity of the story, and the fact not much really happens with the teenagers. The preview implied much more action with them than you see. Go see it knowing that it truly is about Madame Web herself, and you'll enjoy it.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Too much poor writing and too many poor creative decisions sap away its potential","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9807146/?ref_=tt_urv","I_Ailurophile","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1964495/?ref_=tt_urv","25 May 2024","Ever the age-old question when a new release quickly flounders and earns a poor reputation: how bad could it be? After a certain point it's not enough to read about such works, and we have to see them for ourselves. While this was the first full-length feature for director S. J. Clarkson, she has enjoyed a full career in television. Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless' screenplay for 2016's 'Gods of Egypt' notably had its issues, though it wasn't the biggest problem in that film, and anyway I remember enjoying their work on 'The last witch hunter.' Whatever one thinks of other movies they've been in, there are some fairly respected actors here. And on the one hand, while Sony's live-action superhero fare has been met with mixed reception, it's not like they're totally incompetent - after all, they've churned out two of the best superhero flicks ever made in 'Into the Spider-Verse' and 'Across the Spider-Verse.' All this is to say that at least based on its building blocks, 'Madame Web' probably had chances that were just about even. Unfortunately, once we sit to watch, in no time the viewing experience becomes rather laborious, and with a runtime of nearly two hours, one thing we have to be thankful for is that this isn't longer like too many of its kin.I suppose it's possible that if someone is an especial fan of comic book movies then this might meet with more favor in their eyes. By the same token, I pretty well tired of action blockbusters a few years ago, and just completely gave up on the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" in 2018, so maybe I'm more prone to harsh judgment of a like-minded title. In absolute fairness, I see the potential that this had. While it's flush with superhero flavors, the core narrative is a thriller about precognitive visions and the protection of three young people who will important in the future; other pieces have played in this space to swell success. Some intended humor actually does earn a laugh. Clarkson's direction is technically competent, I find no fault with the actors in and of themselves, and this is well made from the standpoint of all those contributions from behind the scenes: stunts, effects, computer-generated imagery, costume design, hair, makeup, cinematography, editing, sound, Johan Söderqvist's original score, and so on and so on. All this is well and good, so what is it that troubles 'Madame Web?' However skilled the participants may be in and of themselves, their efforts here were guided by questionable creative choices, and above all, this film is woefully heavy-handed, and in no time becomes all too exhausting.I am someone who loves watching pictures. I'll watch almost anything, and it's how I spend the majority of my free time. Too often this picture feels like a personal attack on me as a cinephile; I intermittently had to pause for several minutes to collect myself just because I felt overwhelmed by the presentation. From the opening scene onward, far more than not the writing is gawkily forthright and unsubtle, and oppressively emphatic - in its exposition, dialogue, scene writing, characterizations, the plot and its development, contemporary references and allusions to the early 2000s setting, nods to broader comic book lore, and too much of the humor (that is, those bits that don't land). I don't know where the culpability lies between Sazama, Sharpless, Clarkson, and co-writer Claire Parker, but the incidence is all too notable. That same gawky, forthright, unsubtle, oppressive, emphatic tack is subsequently applied to or infects a great deal of other facets throughout the runtime: the soundtrack, the acting, Clarkson's orchestration of scenes as director, Mauro Fiore's cinematography, Leigh Folsom Boyd's editing, the CGI, action sequences, the manner in which Cassie's visions are employed, the more fantastical costume designs, and more. Even in some quieter moments, like a ""confrontation"" early in the latter half between Cassie and Ezekiel, 'Madame Web' is a lot to take in and try to process, and not in a good way.It's not wholly rotten. More than not I think the root story is fine and interesting. There are some nice touches here and there, kernels of welcome earnestness, and some admirable themes and bigger ideas. While the entirety does force the actors into some small corners, in the best moments where their abilities shine through I think the cast go a long way in making the feature palatable. The more judicious and mindful instances of editing and CGI are excellent, even where Cassie's visions are concerned, and likewise the other odds and ends; the filming locations and sets are generally splendid. Reading about the production I find myself pleased with the consideration and hard work that accordingly went into it in various ways, and I appreciate the sentiment, indicated in early press releases from Sony, that the endeavor would be a slightly different type of superhero flick, more of a ""suspense-driven thriller."" Even with loads of action that tenor truly is brought to bear in my opinion, a refreshing change of pace from the overbearing popcorn flicks of Marvel and DC, and I'd even go so far as to say that 'Madame Web' is surely stronger in its second half; it seems apparent that there comes a point where more care was taken, and my favor is restored to some degree. I see what the title genuinely does well.I don't think this is absolutely awful. I think the harder it tries, and the more grandiose it tries to be, especially at the climax, the more it stumbles. The more it steps away from the ""suspense-driven thriller"" and toward ""superhero action blockbuster,"" the more it struggles; the more it layers on the sentimentality (not least in the denouement), the more it raises a skeptical eyebrow. There is, in fact, a decent amount of value here, yet through to the end it remains true that wide swaths of the viewing experience are sadly gawky, forthright, unsubtle, oppressive, and emphatic. Listen, I love The Cranberries, but the use of their song over the end credits literally made me cringe. 'Madame Web' is a rickety roller coaster from desperately heavy-handed for a preponderance of the first hour, to more reserved and thoughtful in a fair stretch of the second half, and regrettably, back to desperately heavy-handed in its last few scenes. Had all gone well with this production, and had it been uniformly approached in the same measured fashion, I think I would have very much liked this, and maybe even looked forward to future stories with these characters. As it stands, I want to like the result more than I do, but I'm having difficulty mustering further kind feelings. I'm glad for those who get more out of it than I do; for those who engage honestly with it, and step away disliking it even more, I understand. When all is said and done I can't bring myself to hate 'Madame Web' - I'm just sorry that everyone involved took a swing, made some miscalculations, and missed, with disastrous consequences. My best wishes for all who had a hand in this, and may they bounce back and/or redeem themselves in due course.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie Madame Web (2024) was disappointing because it had potential to make a cool and interesting movie on an interesting Marvel character, but instead it felt like a missed opportunity, especially since the main premise is just the Terminator story put into a Spider-Man movie; the movie is between having decent and bad acting, it has poor script, it tends to not make sense, its characters are not that developed, and mediocre CGI.I know there are people who do not like Dakota Johnson because of past movies she has been in, but she was not bad in the role of Cassandra Webb/Madame Web, she just did not have that good a script to work off to make the character likable or interesting, along with her working as a paramedic having little interest for saving these three girls throughout the film; she has an occasional line that could be funny because of her dry humor, but overall she is just trying her best to make it work. The three girls Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazón, and Mattie Franklin, played ok by Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor, all got annoying from time to time with them not listening to Cassandra Webb and just doing dumb things that get them in trouble; they each have a little bit of backstory, but it is rushed by, and we just go off of the fact that they become heroes like Spider-Man in the future. The last thing I will say about Cassandra Webb/Madame Web and the three girls is that they had little to no chemistry with one another, so I could not connect with them as much as I wanted to while they are trying to protect themselves from the main villain.The main villain named Ezekiel Sims was not played that great by Tahar Rahim, with this villain having a connection to Cassandra Webb's mother back in the day, there is not much backstory about why he is trying to kill the three main girls, except because they become spider people in the future and kill him while also not giving a reason why they would kill him; almost all of his lines of dialogue were obviously bad ADR and did not match up with his lip movements, and he has this Spider-Man looking suit that looks a bit silly and comes out of nowhere in random sequences. Ben and Mary Parker played by Adam Scott and Emma Roberts are not bad in the movie, but they are not in the movie that much and they do very little, except give us references to Spider-Man and how his life might go in the future; this can be annoying by how in your face it can be, especially since there are moments that were supposed to have a Spider-Man reference in it but was cut/edited out, either have no references to the character or have references that are not awkward.The script was poorly put together with a lot of bad lines of dialogue making scenes awkward, especially since you are not attached to the characters that much, and there are lots of scenes in the movie that do not make sense; there are moments that are awkward and slow because these moments did not need to happen, along with there being moments where the main characters make dumb decisions leading to trouble with the villain finding them in some way, along with there being lots of scenes in the movie that does not match the previous scenes it showed with a different vibe. There are a few sequences in the movie I thought was not bad, and occasionally an action scene can be good enough with its occasional ok CGI effects; the way Cassandra Webb uses her abilities was not bad, though it could have had better ways to show how she sees the future, and Cassandra's backstory involving a jungle in Peru, a spider that gives you powers, and a weird clan of spider people was interesting but made no sense at certain parts of the movie when you really think about it.If you did not care for any of Sony's other Spider-Man spinoffs, then this movie will not win you over, and I can understand why this movie was hated by lots of people; the movie Madame Web (2024) has decent performances from the lead stars, a bad performance from the villain, ok CGI and action, dumb scenes and scenes that make no sense, and mostly nothing that we saw was explained that well, along with it having a badly put together script with bad lines of dialogue. All I will say is that the movie was not good, but it was not completely awful, it has an occasional good action sequence and some interesting ideas that should have been explored more; not an awful movie, but I did think it was an extremely disappointing movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It joins the growing niche of ""Spider-man movies without Spider-man"" produced by Columbia Pictures, which includes 2018's 'Venom', 2023's 'Morbius' and the as-yet unreleased 'Kraven'.'Madame Web' is a watchable bad movie. Dakota Johnson plays Cassie Webb, an NYC paramedic who is ambivalent and coldly detached from her profession of saving lives. She hasn't yet learned that with great power comes great responsibility. An accident knocks her into the East River, which somehow triggers a penchant for clairvoyance. Clearly this isn't the most logical origin story in the annals of comic book movies.The story picks up with Cassie on a commuter train and envisioning an assassin killing three young ladies. The non-descript Baddie is in the next train car and heading Cassie's way. Ruh-roh.Much of the film is Cassie playing reluctant Mother Hen to the trio, played by Sidney Sweeney, Isabel Merced and Celeste O'Connor. We glean that the three are budding heroes in waiting if this franchise can get off the ground.But that doesn't seem likely as this film never takes off. The burning question is: who thought it was a good idea to produce a stand-alone film based on Madame Web?I did appreciate some on-location scenes shot in New York City, including some face time for two of my favorite neighborhoods in Queens: Astoria and Long Island City.During the press junket for 'Web', Dakota Johnson freely admitted that she hasn't watched the film and has no plans to. So even Madame Web isn't a fan of 'Madame Web'.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's NOT crass, profane, or ugly. If you want a good Bro-Movie, go see The Beekeeper.I address the deluge of negative reviews further below.I liked The Marvels (2024). It's a celebration of healthy girl power, the power of female friendship. Mr. Google says most pages for these search terms are overwhelmingly pre-Covid, pre Ukraine, pre-Gaza. Marvel celebrating girl power in a big way was rare and delightful to me.Madame Web is an ever rarer animal, a celebration of healthy WOMAN POWER, healthy feminine intuition; and, nurturant-protective parenting.Madame Web goes all the way to celebrating healthy psychotherapy, how it can lead to dissolving abandonment issues you thought you had with parents. I dare you to name even one other movie portraying this in a positive light.I hope and pray children growing up in 2024, have role models for these positive qualities.Not incidentally, the script is EXCELLENT, a writerly concoction which drew me in (even better if you avoid trailers for this film). The script is clearly the work of many talented hands on the difficult theme of seeing the future; and, then having the balls to change the future if you dislike what you see. The future-seeing power is introduced with both subtlety and conviction.Contrary to a negative professional review I heard before going, there is no deus ex machina contrivances. Character choices and outcomes all made sense to me (and I'm a writer).ABOUT THOSE NEGATIVE REVIEWS
Based on the negativity of professional reviews towards The Marvels, my guess was Madama Web would get the same treatment. I was not disappointed.How can we understand an outpouring of hostility towards a film dedicated to positive themes and archetypes? If you ask me, here's what I say. It's easy to give lip-service to a positive future for the 99% of people and especially to children. It's easy to say, ""We want nice things; and, we deserve nice things.""However in addition to our wishes for a positive future, there is another force who has authority to test our intentions and good wishes. We can call it the Tester. Some readers of this may now the fledgling discussion among film goes and critics about how the most positive and uplifting movies often attract the most negative reviews--especially from male reviewers. It's like a tug-of-war on the level of the collective choice we are making whether the physical-material future is a dystopia or Nature and child-friendly. Given this tug-of-war I invite you to think for yourself and support those films which even in small ways describe the kind of future you want for yourself and your kids.","14 out of 46 found this helpful.

The actor for Ezekiel Sims wasn't too great unless he was part of the action scenes. The action, and the way it was filmed was pretty fun. The parts that were strong were pretty strong. I think that the primary issue is that it wasn't too ambitious and didn't expand as much as it should've in certain areas. I think, overall, that it was a rather fun watch. I've certainly seen worse films before (*cough* most mass-produced horror films *cough*).To echo other reviews: Saying it is the worst film ever is a gross overstatement, especially when the previous film in this cinematic universe was FAR worse. This film is receiving a lot of hate mostly because there is no Spider-Man in it. This has been the case with the last several films in the franchise: Venom, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, and Morbius.

And of course she was great in ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" and it's sequels.Now she stars in the new superhero movie ""Madame Webb"" and I liked it a lot. Also starring Sidney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor as the three young women she meets and protects from danger. Also with Adam Scott and Emma Roberts.The story is about how Dakota Johnson's character, Cassie Webb, discovers her ability to see into the future.I found the movie to be very entertaining and enjoyable.

I genuinely can't fathom what made people hate this film so much, there isn't anything in the film to be majorly offended by. I think there is an expectation for films to be world changing, perspective altering pieces of cinema and I really don't think that is necessary of every film. This was a fairly enjoyable film that I didn't have to figure out or take a deeper meaning from while watching and I was honestly thankful about that. In my opinion this film had the right amount of action while maintaining a story and honestly harked back to the original sony spider films that weren't trying to squeeze in ten million characters from the wider cinematic universe in. This film is genuinely not as bad as people are saying and I'm actually hoping that they make a second film as I would love to see where these characters go next. A part of me also wonders whether this film ""is the worst comic adaptation yet"" because it has a female centred cast, but that's just a thought. I at least enjoyed this film more the Quantumania.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

The female protagonists make you like them and care, and the origin story and superhero ability of Cassie is refreshingly different, with endless possibilities for the future. It seems that critics and audience alike are unable to see beyond their pre-conditioned prejudices of what a good superhero movie should be, and said prejudice limits their mental capacity and artistic imagination to perceive the power of the mind's potential over stupid's jet-lagged physicality. This is, ironically, the actual point of the plot and the downfall of the villain, whom reviewers so adamantly criticize as bland, not realizing they are one in the same. Open your mind. See the web.

I am not sold on the timeline and how it fits with Sony's spiderverse, but overall. It's not as bad as these people suggest.Cons:
I do have a problem with Dakota Johnson's flat range, but that's on brand for her. Nothing new. As high as the stakes were, she should have been more demanding on screen with added dimensions.Pros:
The villains motivations were rooted in fear and immorality. Simple. Nothing crazy or unobtainable.Very plausible.Adam Scott's portrayal of Uncle Ben Parker is cool. He's funny and young whippersnapper. I've never seen a younger version of the character.All-In-All:
Don't be that ""guy"" who's just hating because it's a women driven movie. It's solid. I recommend it for anyone who's willing to enter with a clear mind with no expectations.","1 out of 11 found this helpful.

Is it just because there is some kind of malaise with Comic Book Hero / Marvel content at the moment? Sure, it is not the best of its type but it is certainly nowhere near as bad as many have suggested. In my book it is no worse than Morbius and not as banal as The Marvels. According to IMDb box office info, the movie grossed close on $100M (2024) and turned in a small profit - so enough people went to see it. This says to me that it is not as much a ""lemon"" as many would have us believe. While The Marvels was bigger budget, at time of writing, it has still not returned a profit. On the other hand, there is no doubt super hero films seem to be going through a lacklustre period. Having read many of the poor reviews before I saw it, I was expecting to hate it - but I didn't. The 2 hours passed quite painlessly for me and I was sufficiently engrossed to see it through to the conclusion. Dakota Johnson turned in a good performance with the material she had and the supporting cast were quite plausible. It is by no means the best super hero movie I have ever seen and I probably won't ever watch it again but it is not atrocious.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But there were redeeming qualities: The soundtrack matched the early 2000s time period. The sound effects were loud and crisp. The visuals were impressive and didn't rely on milky CGI green-screen backgrounds that other movies in this genre cling to. As a movie-goer, will you leave the theater deeply moved by Madame Web, thirsting to watch it again tomorrow? Probably not. But I don't think you'll remember it as the ""worst movie ever made"" as some reviews have done. It reminded me of superhero movies like the Toby Maguire Spiderman films, before the idea of a branded cinematic universe.

It's fun, the characters have good chemistry, Emma robberts it's on it, the only thing I'm a bit sad over was the fact that I wanted to see the three girls in their full powers era. I guess if people actually give it a try we might get to see it.In truth tired of all these bias reviews, in the 2000s we would kill for a movie this good. I really want to ask those 1* reviewers if they really haven't seen worse than this? Because clearly they are lying, I could give the eternals a low score but even 1* is low.

The cgi was pretty generic. The story was cool.""Well in my honest opinion the movie was pretty neat. It is an Origin Story for MADAME WEB only. The story shows where she came from, who she was, how she became who she will be and why. The other girls are just along for the ride but damn it you WANT to know more about them too!! Why do I wanna know more!? Because I collected and own all those comic books too! 😁 They were all fun interesting spider person series!! And the actors/characters were likeable!So I will give this movie a solid 7.0 on the comic book movie scale. I put 10 because the people who put 1 are not properly rating it and probably didn't even watch it. I wanted more! I hope we get more! There is a lot of hints to different tie ins from another spider character but dang it only true believers will see. 😁 form your own opinion and check it out for yourself If you are an avid movie theatre person.Dont trust online reviews.

Everyone was laughing hysterically and making audible jokes and jabs at various points of the movie. There may have even been some very ironic cheering during the movie but there was undoubtedly a lot of uncontrollable fits of manic, desperate laughter due to how horrifically made it was. I saw it with my family on my birthday and our heads hurt badly from the horrible editing and the lack of oxygen we were receiving since we were laughing so hard. My dad was cringing at the entire movie as if he was watching a very awkward person trying to flirt for 2 hours. Madame Web is unironically one of the funniest movies I have ever seen in my life.","9 out of 28 found this helpful.

Went to watch this with no expectations, i saw the bad reviews but still wanted to see it. I gotta say this new trend of hating films about women superheroes is becoming very evident. Saw it with the Marvels.The plot is pretty solid, the first part makes you think it's not a supper hero movie. It reminded me of final destination a bit. I think it was a good introduction story, people are complaining that she was a paramedic before. She had to have a life before becoming madame web. It remind me of the 2000s supper hero movies where there wasent that much crazy CG and it had a good story.I felt for the characters, i liked the characters. The teather that i went to had tons of families and they all seem to be enjoying it. The chemistry of the four girls was good. The acting of Dakota is a bit off, she isn't the best actress but she was fine. The other girls were fine, typical teenagers, i had no issue with their acting.Compared to what we have been getting from Marvel this one is pretty good, i wasn't bored, perhaps a bigger climax for the end but it was great not seeing crazy CG with flying humans not getting hurt, i thought the final sequence was pretty believable. If you want to have fun and see an okay film that won't drain the life out of you go watch this one.The kids at the theater loved it, my kids loved it. Not everything needs to be a Nolan depressing movie. These type of reviews is the reason why we don't get anything fun anymore. Also all these reviews seem to be very men based . Also how did it get so many bad reviews before actually being in theaters?","39 out of 165 found this helpful.

Well that and seeing Pepsi so blatantly being advertised.Back to the movie: action-packed without overdoing it, lots of one liners to make you smile, and if your boyfriend is there just to see Sydney Sweeney he will be disappointed to say the least - she's almost unrecognisable!Everybody, go see Madame Webb a second time, but in IMAX or 4DX, you might just enjoy it like I did!","7 out of 22 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Howard Hawks would be proud; a perfect satire; a future cult-classic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9652112/?ref_=tt_urv","vgamerdc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25898836/?ref_=tt_urv","1 March 2024","This has been the greatest cinematic experience I have ever witnessed. I've seen 2001 A Space Odyssey in 70mm at the Aero, Lawrence of Arabia Roadshow Edition in 70mm, Hateful Eight, Oppenheimer, all of these cinematic masterpieces in 70mm, but none of them impacted me on an emotional level like Madame Web has. Everything in this movie is 100% intentional and the fact that people don't realize that astounds me. In this review I hope to share my experience for those to understand why this is a 10/10 satirical reflection on the state of superhero movies today, and how/why this made it an actual masterpiece better than Barbie.Firstly, I saw it at the AMC, and I was thrilled the complete, full version of Nicole Kidman's introduction played. I always clap out loud. And as I made up 1/3 of the entire audience, I was able to clap and hoot as loud as I wanted. Second, I'm 99% positive the protectionist receive a note from Sony to mess up the projector, giving it a Grindhouse feel. The whites were ever so slightly red (you can see this during the MPAA green screen whim the trailers play) AND the projector was a little shaky! This added to the effect that I was watching something on film and added a B movie effect Tarantino fans will love. There is no way this is accidental given everything in this film.I think Sony's greatest takeaway from Morbius was how popular the movie became because it was bad. So their idea: make something so bad it's good. This is 100% intentional and they succeeded in parodying themselves.1. It takes itself seriously but is aware that it is taking itself seriously. All of these superhero movies today are too darn serious. These are spider women! This satire is set up immediately with the dialogue being on the nose, the acting purposefully being both bland and over the top but ""subtle,"" and the insane TikTok-ification of the camera. There is no consistency anywhere. The fake zooms in the beginning of the movie are clear evidence that it was on purpose because that's what is silly. The director is completely aware of this and does a fantastic job.2. It takes place in 2003! Daredevil was released that year, Catwoman was being filmed, and Spider-Man 2 hadn't even been released yet. Putting it in this year with this style is meant to evoke the atmosphere of those movies. They have a level of cheese to them that we can enjoy today.3. The antagonist: he is literally just a dude who is afraid women are going to kill him. They don't pose any actual threat. He gets up and starts fighting them because he is afraid. This is a reflection of the current socio-political climate today, especially in regards to resistance to female superheroes. YES, WE ALL KNOW ""it's not the women, it's bad writing."" To prove that point, there are no derogatory comments toward men in this entire movie. It follows the same formula as so many other superhero movies where they don't become the Titular Hero until the very end of the movie. While many people wanted to see a movie about Madam Web, this is a template origin story. It's not trying to be better than male superhero movies. It's doing the exact same thing, and that's the point. The conversation can now shift to the matter of: quality of writing. But the producers know what is selling and intend to milk it as long as possible. This film died a hero, like Dakota Johnson for 50 Shades, so her future can live a better life. Or, to quote Barbie, ""We mothers stand still so our daughters can look back and see how far they've come.""4. The cast: Dakota Johnson, leading lady of 50 Shades of Grey, is THE WOMAN FOR THE JOB. She's done a notoriously bad movie before and she can do it again. She is a symbol of hope for the up and coming starlets of the movie: both in her character and IRL. Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor, and Isabela Merced are all young starlets that are ""in"" with modern audiences. But how long will this last? Historically, and still today, the Hollywood system brings in young women-sorry, Celeste, I know your pronouns are they/them-exploiting their youth and good looks, only to not care about them after, oh, 25 (which is the cutoff age for Leonardo Dicpario's girlfriends). Yes, Sydney Sweeney is 26, but she plays a high schooler in Euphoria. Celeste O'Connor looks very young, and Isabela Merced was Dora! I'm glad the antagonist wasn't a woman trying to find the spider equivalent of the fountain of youth, because then the message is more on the nose and less enjoyable than the subtlety of this villain. The point I'm trying to make is: Dakota Johnson is a role model via character and as an actress for these young women. Their characters are completely empty and archetypes because that is what the industry has done to them in the past and present. The film ends with the quote, which is a VOICEOVER btw, ""The best part about the future? It hasn't happened yet.""
......^ this is driven further with the fact that Madame Web has the power of foresight. The original draft was some terminator thing. Yeah, stopping the future from happening?! Exactly! This movie perpetuates everything the previous superhero movies have done in order to end with you saying: I hope they stop making these bad movies. It is genius because it doesn't state this directly like Deadpool!5. Characters are wardrobe: in addition to the diverse group of assigned-at-birth-females, the film further reflects society by having the up and coming starlets not be developed at all. They are literally just themselves. All of them are, in the future, spider women. By not developing them now, the positive point is: there is a Madame Web in all of us. But it's also an intentional reflection on how women are not developed in these movies: they are there for plot and appearance. Everyone accept for Johnson shows some sort of skin that is meant to please the (young) male viewers. They are quite aware of the power their exposed epidermis has on the male mind, as well as the 2003 representation of women. Celeste and Isabel bare mid-drift and Sydney is in an obvious Britney Spears school outfit, with stockings, baring her thighs. This is literal male gaze but it is done intentionally by a female director and her female/non-binary leading cast because it's a reflection. The theme of the movie is changing the future, so we have to acknowledge the past and present that will be changed. The male antagonist is afraid of this. And the corporate sponsorship product placement shows that democracy is indeed still alive and thriving because follow the money. If you want better movies, prove it with your wallets. I do want a Madame Web 2, but it's gotta be the movie we deserve, not the one we needed right now. Which, actually, this movie was BOTH. But you know what I mean. I don't think there will be a Madame Web 2, and I'm okay with that because it's the idea enough that builds the web of the future.Also, Johnson's character being dismissive of a drawing of a kid despite her being a literal medical agent who protects and serves. It's bad and on purpose. So many of these characters have to ""overcome their internal flaw"" which is usually being a dick of some sort. It's the Christmas movie cliches of a parent working too much and not spending time with what matters: Family (as demonstrated in fast and furious 3-7). And Sydney Sweeney's character is randomly introduced by literally stating, ""Oh, and I'm his step sister by the way,"" then walks off. This is not an accident!Oh, and let's not forget Emma freaking Roberts as the sister of Ben Parker! I can't say the mom of P**** Parker because ooooooo wHo CoUlD iT bE?!?! It's perfect. And her name being Mary, which is one letter shy of May, which made me incredibly confused of the timeline.6. All of the little nuances in the film. The Optimus Prime 18 wheeler randomly in the background outside of the diner. ""What's Up"" by Four Non Blondes-which everyone in my generations knows as the He-Man ""HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA"" song is in the background, not the forefront. DREAMS BY THE CRANBERRIES AS THE END CREDITS! As any film student and lover of A24 films knows, that song was in the Wong Kar-Wai film Chungking Express. This is 100% intentional and not an accident. This is an 80 million dollar production. Everything on screen is intentional. Such as that CPR scene, which not only is an obvious foreshadowing added in hindsight, but... kinda a piece of fan service? It's a random scene for these women to put their hands and elbows close together in front of their chest while bending over. Yet they're all covered, thus indicating the stupidity of the camera's gaze and the scene as a whole. AND the whole twist on ""with great power comes great responsibility."" Genius. Again, another example that they are self aware and making fun of the entire genre as a whole. It's amazing.7. The story: Howard Hawks would be proud. His philosophy is that the audience does not care about the plot so long as they are entertained; this movie, in doing all of the tropes which has come before it, and by not taking itself seriously through the direction taking itself seriously but only just so, proves his point. These movies are dumb and they know it. Theh have the classic Spider-Man voiceover! Completely unnecessary to the story and is there only to talk to the audience. You have not been tricked; you have been enlightened!Madame Web is a cinematic masterpiece. It is a perfect image reflection on society today and the state of superhero movies. The fact that everyone is taking this movie seriously proves its own point. I will be buying this on 4K UHD when it comes out. I will also use whatever remaining AMC A List tickets I have left each week to go toward this masterpiece. Thank you SJ Clarkson, Dakota Johnson, Celeste, Isabela, Sydney, and the executives at Sony for your daring and bold contribution to cinema.","8 out of 27 found this helpful.

The fight scenes were believable, and the bad guy was also good in another way that tied the movie together as a whole. So why such a low review rating?

Go into this movie expecting more of a thriller and less of a superhero movie and you will be pleasantly surprised in my opinion. The movie speaks on sisterhood and the power of persistence.

This movies is not that bad. The film kept me entertained from start to finish and that's what movies are supposed to do.

People are way to picky and critiquing about the special effects.The acting might not be Oscar worthy but its decent. People complaining about films that are predictable, it's not always about know what the end result but how a character faces the challenges along the way and achieves the goal. It's about the journey along the way.What people don't seem to want to understand is that Comic Book characters and its stories are one thing in a book and another thing in a film, they are short stories illustrated in a book and not a literature book. Therefore are very limited content to work with in terms of translating them to the big screen.Comic Book films have to be like the Comic Book. I've seen worst movies.

After all, most of the mainstream movie critics are not industry insiders, but our love for movies led us to spend two hours in this way. If your aesthetic for superhero movies still revolves around fights, scenes, cinematography, whether the female lead is attractive, whether the male lead is muscular, and whether the storyline is highly stimulating, I really hope you give this movie a chance, because the aforementioned comments can be made by anyone with a mouth and hands. However, how many people really pay attention to the strong female power and emotional growth in this movie, as well as the issue of repairing the protagonist's original family? Spiders have always been very symbolic creatures, and at the end when the female protagonist's web spreads out, I'm reminded of the work of the French artist Louise Bourgeois.

I hope you will to :))","39 out of 193 found this helpful.

I've seen all of the Spider-Man movies and enjoy both Marvel & DC and thought this was fun adventure too!Backstory shows are always fun and this was no different. None of the superhero movies have Oscar level acting yet I though this was good and definitely up to parDakotah pulls us through the odd discovery of her powers and explains how everything fits together.I thought all of the special effects were appropriate, didn't look too plastic. I enjoyed the one liners along the way to get a grin as well.Ignore the nay-sayers, this was a fun ride into a new/original story!

Lately, Marvel has been releasing some pretty terrible stuff.. but honestly, Madame Web is such a fun and entertaining film!! I love a good movie, and this definitely satisfied me. Dekota is hilarious and I related to her character so much! She's incredible and watching her just makes the film better. Don't listen to these airhead critics, watch the movie and decide for yourself! I hope she comes back because she's **muah** chefs kiss. The other girls were good too and I hope to see all of them come back. My favorite movie is the 2002 spider man.. and I'll say this movie was awesome!!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

While I would give it a respectable 6.5 out of 10, it seems to be overlooked by many Marvel enthusiasts and critics alike.The film delivers a good, watchable experience with an interesting story that keeps you engaged throughout. The plot, while not groundbreaking, is well-constructed and offers a fresh perspective within the Marvel franchise. The character of Madame Web is intriguing and adds a unique element to the superhero genre.The performances are commendable, with the cast bringing their characters to life in a believable and compelling manner. The special effects and action sequences are up to Marvel's usual high standards, providing plenty of visual excitement.However, what sets ""Madame Web"" apart is its ability to weave a narrative that feels both familiar and new. It may not reach the heights of some of the more acclaimed Marvel movies, but it certainly holds its own and is worth a watch for any fan of the genre.In conclusion, ""Madame Web"" is an underrated film that deserves more attention. It's a good film with a lot to offer, and I would recommend giving it a chance despite its lukewarm reception among some Marvel universe fans.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

What I can proudly say is that IT IS A MOVIE OF ALL TIME!For anyone and no one, a classic that will remain deep in people's cherished memories for all their lives, possibly being the very last thing on many minds before death. This is what important art is, deathless, forever, immortal, such paragon piece of contemporary history of everyone, of humans, and spiders, and human-spiders, as well as spider-humans. This will always have a place in what true cinema truly stands for. A tale for all ages and webs.

The lines (of cocaine) were clearly snorted too, let us not forget this does not come as easy as it may sound, but this may have just managed to bring down an whole industry , no easy feat, and change cinema forever.BRAVO!I cannot wait for what the future of the MWCU (Madame Web Cinematic Universe) will bring.

Despite receiving its fair share of criticism online from manchildren and bandwagon jumpers, this film stands as a testament to embracing the unconventional and reveling in its own absurdity. Do people forget what these films are supposed to be? While some may dismiss it as one of the worst films of all time, to do so is to miss the point entirely.First and foremost, Madame Web is a film that knows exactly what it is. It's not striving to be a serious, Oscar-worthy masterpiece; instead, it unapologetically embraces its own campiness and eccentricity. From its over-the-top characters to its delightfully absurd motivation for the villain, every aspect of the film exudes a sense of self-awareness and playfulness (really brought home by Dakota Johnson's bored yet sultry delivery). And in a cinematic landscape often dominated by formulaic blockbusters, this willingness to break the mold and take risks within the limited IP should be celebrated, not ridiculed.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its casting, particularly Dakota Johnson's portrayal of the titular character. Johnson fully commits to the film's offbeat tone, delivering a performance that perfectly matches its quirky sensibility. As Madame Web, she exudes a captivating blend of wit, charm, and eccentricity, commanding every scene she's in with her magnetic presence. It's a testament to Johnson's versatility as an actress that she's able to effortlessly transition from more mainstream fare to the delightfully off-kilter world of Madame Web. The baby shower scene got one of the biggest belly laughs of any film I've seen in theatres in a long time.Furthermore, the film's visual style and aesthetic are nothing short of mesmerizing. From its vibrant color palette to its imaginative set design, every frame of Madame Web is a visual feast for the eyes. I'm not familiar with the directors other work, and sad that based on the reaction to this there won't be much more to come.But perhaps the most important thing to remember about Madame Web is that it's a film meant to be enjoyed on its own terms. Yes, it may not adhere to the traditional conventions of the modern superhero genre that the MCU has dictated and made into a disgusting formula, but that's precisely what makes it so special. In a world oversaturated with cookie-cutter superhero films, Madame Web dares to be different, offering audiences a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stagnant landscape.Of course, no film is without its flaws, and Madame Web certainly has its fair share. Some may argue that its plot is convoluted or that its humor falls flat at times. For me the worst part is the ADR of the villain - makes for some nasty unintended comedy. However, these perceived shortcomings pale in comparison to the sheer joy and entertainment value that the film provides. At its core, Madame Web is a celebration of the power of imagination and the joy of storytelling, and in that regard, it more than succeeds.Madame Web may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those willing to embrace its idiosyncrasies, it offers a wildly entertaining and endlessly enjoyable cinematic experience. It's a film that knows exactly what it is and isn't afraid to own it, and in an age of conformity and mediocrity, that's something to be celebrated. So let the internet scoff and deride all they want; true fans of cinema know that Madame Web is a cult classic in the making, destined to be cherished for years to come.","16 out of 82 found this helpful.

Directed by S. J. Clarkson, making her feature film directorial debut, this film dares to weave a more complex, character-driven story, focusing on Cassie Webb's (Dakota Johnson) journey from an awkward paramedic to a psychic powerhouse. Johnson delivers a nuanced performance, balancing wit and compassion as she navigates her newfound abilities and the heavy burden of saving the future.The film ambitiously tackles themes of destiny, sacrifice, and the search for meaning amidst chaos, setting it apart from its more action-centric counterparts. The inclusion of Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor, and Isabela Merced as the next generation of Spider-Women introduces a fresh dynamic, hinting at a richer, more diverse universe to come. Tahar Rahim's portrayal of Ezekiel Sims offers a complex villain driven by a mix of obsession and tragedy, a testament to the film's attempt at layered storytelling.While ""Madame Web"" may not have hit the mark for all, its effort to explore the psychological and emotional landscapes of its characters is commendable. The film's visual aesthetic, combined with a dedicated cast, hints at the potential for deeper, more introspective storytelling within the superhero genre. As a first step into uncharted territory, ""Madame Web"" suggests a promising direction for future installments, one that prioritizes character development and thematic richness over spectacle alone.In conclusion, ""Madame Web"" is a film that, despite its flaws, should be recognized for its ambition and the bold new path it carves for the Sony's Spider-Man Universe.

It's setting up more movies to come.What it could have done better: it could have spent more time developing its villain and the young women. I know this is Madame Web's movie, but most of the characters felt flat.What it does well: there are plenty of Easter eggs that make this movie fun. At the end of the day, my wife and I enjoyed the movie. It was also does ""girl power"" the best by not having it forced down your throat; it's just a movie with some women doing their thing...which they set up to be much more in the future.I say, give it a chance.

But I decided to watch it and afterwards I just don't understand how people say it was bad or the worst movie because in all honesty it wasn't. Now Was it the best superhero movie, no but it definitely wasn't the worst. But Just like with Morbius people just like to hate for no reason and I don't think that movie was as bad as people say either. I do recommend watching with an open mind and not listen to all the negativity around the film. I'm personally not too familiar with the spiderverse so I'm coming from an unbiased and unfamiliarity perspective. It did make me excited to see what else is in store and I hope they continue with the spiderverse and seeing how the characters and more all Come together in the future.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

People gotta give Dakota Johnson more credit, she's so funny in this. I love her awkwardness and comedic timing. Isabella Merced is CRIMINALLY underrated. She was fantastic in Instant Family (with Rose Byrne and Marky Mark, another great movie). I love to see Sydney Sweeney in anything, she was amazing in Anyone but You, (a cool gay movie). She's really good in here as well, fun to see her as a nerdy girl. 10/10 loved this movie👍👍","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Some of the moments gets somewhat confusing but in my opinion it adds to it to help you feel the confusion the character was feeling.It had a lot of quips that feel like the type of joke you remember in the shower after the conversation passed gripping over how perfect it'd be. A lot of the scenes focused on conversation felt a lot more realistic than a lot of movies do recently. There were little pauses of awkwardness you'd see in a real world conversation. This made the movie feel more attainable instead of everything having to be perfect all the time.The characters have their own flaws and show their own growth through the movie as well making me really cheer for them as a unit by the end of the film.Now for my salty rant on the bad reviews this movie has been getting:I'd understand if someone rated this movie as low as a 4 due to opposing tastes but the amount of hate this movie gets is very excessive. It seems to me most people are watching it only to search for things to hate. This movie is not a bad movie, the only thing it is guilty of is being different. It's not trying to live up to the bar marvel set and is trying to do it's own thing. If you watch it with an open mind without expecting the negatives I believe you'd enjoy it.Also. To everyone who keeps talking bad about Dakota Johnson being in 50 shades of grey: You're gross and need a life. Nothing about this movie is about or relating to Dakota Johnsons acting past and your opinions on it have no place in a review for an entirely different movie which was released a decade later.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

Not only were there some star studded actors in the mix, but the special effects and comic book essentials were there. If there is one movie to see this season it definitely should be on your list.

I mean no it wasn't like the typical Marvel movie, but it was still enjoyable to watch. I can't say this though there are certain things that I would have done differently if I had been the director because the way they did it just made it too far fetched, ya know? Like the part where the ambulance is driven off the top level of a parking garage and it crashes onto the ground and she still driving it?!?! There's a couple other instances where it just seems too far fetch to be even true but I know nothing is at it seems. Some people are going to like this movie and some people are going to hate it.

A nice story, but it needs attention. Dakota Johnson excelled in the lead role. All three girls were distinct characters, but Sydney Sweeney stole the show. The villain was conventional and selfish, and his only goal was to survive. The visual plots were well done and the direction was excellent But the scenario should have been better, because it contains many loopholes, incomprehensible things, and quick decisions. Some of the dialogues were plotted and some of them were clunky. In the end, it is an enjoyable movie, but you can watch it once or twice. It is a nice movie, but it could have been better. I am looking forward to the appearance of Madame Web and the three Spider-Women in the upcoming movies.","43 out of 317 found this helpful.

Yet already it's been review-bombed by people who, quite often, said they knew it was going to be poor based on the cast, the trailers, the fact it was made by Sony.. Yet we're still some of the first people to rush to see it? I don't get it. It's very different to the mainstream superhero movies in tone and style. Action is more of the thriller, jump-scare type than the choreographed fight sequences we are used to. Dakota Johnson's character is surprisingly relatable in the way she handles the situation she is thrust into. The team the movie is setting up looks pretty cool too and hopefully that goes somewhere. Go on. Watch it yourself, if you hate it, fine. But don't review bomb something you likely haven't seen.","4 out of 16 found this helpful.

Every scene contributes to the movie and is utmost important.For the rest the movie is completely realsitic, the producers really researched into the medical truth. Like that CPR helps when you get poisonned. Also that teenagers can perform CPR after a 5 min practice is totally accurate.The ending makes completely sense and is totally understandable and ends the movie with respect.Lets go girl power, this movie is an complete comeback for marvelJk total garbage.","5 out of 22 found this helpful.

The characters are approachable and funny, and they make a connection with the audience that makes you really worry about them throughout the movie. I think this film is getting bad reviews because it stars women and was directed by a woman. At worst, this film is a fun romp, at best, your new favorite standalone superhero movie! This is what the MCU should be looking to for its future!","6 out of 29 found this helpful.

So please, please, DO NOT watch the TRAILER!The story is good enough for a good movie, with new effects and details that I was not expected. The actors did their best. Although, the end can be better...I don't understand why the movie is until now so low rated. Overall I would give it an 7+, maybe 8 stars. Giving 10 just to counteract the unrealistic rating.Hope they will stop with this first story thus.

However, if you keep watching it does become very, good.

I am afraid of the end of this trend, probably in a few years, the Queen of England in a few centuries ago will be played by an Asian or an African, like in the movie Napoleon, this situation should be corrected and the roles should be distributed fairly and in accordance with reality, and of course, in such a way that everyone's rights are respected.

But other than that I think it was definitely a movie I could watch again. It definitely has something to add to the spiderverse as a whole. I think people have gotten so spoiled with every superhero movie being a crossover or something extremely loud and in your face. This takes it back to simple storyline with no prerequisites. I will say if your looking for a superhero movie its not it. But I don't think it is successful with telling the story about a character in the marvel universe that not many people are familiar with. I can see where some people may be disappointed if you're a comic book thumper. However, superhero genre movies are judged anymore as if they are going for Oscars. If you want to be entertained this movie does the job, despite overly critical reviews, It's definitely not the worst superhero movie I've seen.......... that would be Steel with Shaq.","3 out of 17 found this helpful.

I have enjoyed the Marvel films that Sony has put out, even while acknowledging that in their totality, they are not on par with most of the MCU films. That being said, this film had a story, action, good acting, music, and special effects. If all I had in a video collection were the first 5 spider man films, both Venom ones, Morbius, Madame Web, and the upcoming Kraven film, I am sure that I would have many months of entertainment and would rewatch most if not all of them. Collectively they are better than the Eternals, many parts of Iron Man 2 and 3, and a few other MCU films. I am happy to be the voice of reason here, in a sea of bro's who find ways to rationalize hating films starring women! See it for yourself and make your own decisions!","4 out of 26 found this helpful.

The premise of the movie is truly different from a regular Marvel movie that's what makes do good and interesting. So give it a try because you will like it the other people who viewed this movie might have had a bad day yo give it a bad review. My wife and I found it truly fun and interesting.

Please, who saw ""Elektra"" from 2005 and ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", knows what I mean ;))) it wasn't the best, but it also wasn't the worst:) The best part of the film was probably Dakota Johnson. In addition to the comedic aspect, her amazing acting added some drama to the film.

Here's a thought. How about adding Henry Cavill to this ""Spidey"" universe? 🤔

I think most of the bad reviews are from people who were expecting an Avengers type of movie. This wasn't that, and that should be okay.This was a female driven movie with good actors and a decent story. Yeah, some things could have been better, but it was still a good movie. As an adult woman, I really enjoyed it.I hate seeing the bad review because I feel it's likely we won't get another movie, but I really would appreciate a sequel. Female friendly movies need better support. I imagine there are a lot of young girls out there who liked this very much, but unfortunately due to not being the target audience, that doesn't matter. I think a lot of guys went to this movie and just trashed it because it wasn't aimed getting them aroused like the majority of movies out there. Maybe a lot of bad reviews are also from people who don't like to see diversity in addition to female leads in movies, especially action movies. IDK I just don't get the bad reviews otherwise.This isn't like the other Marvel movies, and that should be a good thing. They're getting boring. This was a refreshing change.The story itself could have been a little fuller with more detail on the supernatural, but it progressed well enough and didn't drag. Actors were decent. Better than a lot of other movies out there. There was a good amount of action and suspense. There could have been more back story for the character development, especially on the villain, but there was enough and it kept the movie going and not getting too dragged down.","4 out of 28 found this helpful.

A young (around 13) blonde white girl and young black girl were purchasing tickets and their debit card got declined. I saw one look at her friend in embarassment. I sensed a high level of empathy and conscientiousness in the way I saw them hold doors for everyone and kindly smile before I went into the building.I said hold on do it again and repurchase the tickets (to imply the machine was broken I skewed perception cause I knew they wouldn't accept handouts), and then when the tap option came I quickly tapped my card to pay for it, and then their faces looked guilty, so I walked away real fast to spare them shame/preserve dignity. They were shy and shrinking and overly accommodating.I wanted to see argyle, but the movie was a half hour in and Madame web was rated 2/10 at the time, so I didn't want to see it but there was nothing left so I did. I went in, and there was a theatre filled with young girls with their besties, and the atmosphere felt .. like something I didn't understand was calling them to it. The movie played, a bunch of girls skeptical but then looking up to a grounded logical female paramedic that didn't have grandiose desires but was called to help these girls. A beautiful nurturing bonding occurred in the friendship between the girls and Dakota who plays Madame web. I heard a beautiful like, ""when you step into your responsibility power follows."" I noticed the energy and girls around me laughing smiling empowered. I saw the way trust and community was restored in the movie.I saw the way everyone walked out healed and their face warm hearted, confident, smiling, more in their authenticity .. this is a very important movie.Dakotas acting was phenomenal as always, beautiful dialogue well thought out logic and powers, great synergy and important message.Send all your kids to it, and let the older men and women know that love and trust is gonna be okay.. this generation needs this..","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

The storyline was good. Flowed well. There was a few meh bits but really good overall. I love spideyverse content this is definitely up there in top 5 for spiderverse films. The biggest down downside is the filming of it maybe I'm overly sensitive to fast moving scenes but they seemed out of focus a lot. I loved parts that joined it into the rest of the spiderverse. It was mainly the end scene that I found was really really cheesy. I think Sony does struggle with making a convincing bad guy. His storyline is blah and bland. But I seriously hope they do continue on from this with something. Strong female roles without pushing it in your face.","3 out of 22 found this helpful.

There is not one aspect of this that is even mediocre, it is bad through and through. So bad it's good.Every person working on this film feels like they're only here for the paycheck. Pure contractual obligation. Check the interview footage, it's hilarious how much people just don't care about this movie, well besides the director.Like the director actually is just very bad at their job, but they pretend like they are really good... The movie and director come off as like... oddly pretentious, especially with the ending and the directors interviews.The camera movement is horrendous and visually unintelligible.The writing is very very very very childish, trivial, and stupid. The acting alongside the writing makes it seem almost like a parody satire, it's so funny. There is also bad audio dubbing, sound effects, transitions, bad musical layering, mixing, and overpresent original basic music that is incredibly insistent of an epic tone.This movie is basically disectable because it's so bad on every single account. You can look into every scene and get so much out of it because it's so... full of garbage. Every. Single. Scene.Overall, if you like so bad it's good movies, this might be a classic for you. Otherwise this is a genuinely terrible film with very little even slightly okay about it.Mid 1/10PS. A very hilarious 1/10.Edit, watched this again. Changing it to a 10 because it is absolutely hilarious the entire movie. So yeah, for me it's a10/10. It's hilarious.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The script was cogent. It never set out to challenge Shakespeare. The cinematography was visually entertaining. Again, it never imagined itself to challenge Avatar. The character development and plot were both sufficient and relevant, clearly inclining your perspective.

Contrary to the many less than favorable reviews, I found the storyline interesting, plenty of action, and the characters engaging. In addition, there would seem to be plenty of opportunities to see these four heroines grow in future installments in what could be a promising franchise for the Marvel Universe. Dakota Johnson brings her character to life in her origin story and there are clear opportunities to see Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor grow into their characters as their origin story develops. It is unfortunate, however, that the reception of Madame Web hasn't been more favorable, which may limit the chance of future installments in this potentially promising franchise. However, with the potential for a crossover with the very successful Spiderman franchise, there might be storylines for a sequel that could be spun; I'll keep my eyes on the web to see if this sticks.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The action sequences and the set pieces are well done with a few bits that had me laughing out loud in their absurdity but still going ""ok, that was good"".

Knowing that she's a clairvoyant seeing visions of the future.The director should've extended a bit longer because this movie was approximately an hour and something minutes. It's not as big as all the Marvel films that we've watched over the years but I'm not saying that this one is purely bad. The special effects were cool and interesting so that makes it count. This film is still ok and good for entertainment. I still give this film a thumbs up.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Yet, beneath its unassuming surface, a narrative as convoluted and enigmatic as the darkest cinematic mysteries began to unfold. In Pelican Town, every planted seed and nurtured relationship spiraled into a narrative labyrinth, challenging my perceptions of reality, much like the complex webs of deception and illusion one might expect from Madame Web. However, where Madame Web tangled itself in its own ambitious plot, Stardew Valley masterfully wove a tale of profound depth and intrigue.The daily rituals of this virtual Eden masked a deeper exploration of existence, where the ordinary transformed into the extraordinary. The townspeople, with their myriad secrets and desires, mirrored the complex characters of a psychological thriller, drawing me deeper into a story where truth flickered like a shadow, elusive and ever-changing. This journey through Stardew Valley, with its shifting realities and hidden depths, paralleled the twisted narratives found in tales of intrigue and mystery, where nothing is as it seems, and every revelation leads only to more questions.Stardew Valley's serene façade belied a complex exploration of the human psyche, turning each in-game day into a step deeper into both the valley's and my own subconscious. Here, the boundaries between game and reality blurred, each discovery a piece of a puzzle that, when pieced together, revealed a picture far different from what I had initially perceived. This game became a reflection of the intricate dance between perception and reality, where Madame Web's attempt at a multifaceted narrative paled in comparison to the genuine depth and complexity Stardew Valley offered.As I delved deeper into the heart of Pelican Town, I found a community of players whose shared experiences echoed the collective journey through our own psychological mazes. This communal narrative, rich with individual stories of discovery and revelation, underscored the profound impact of Stardew Valley. It became clear that this was not just a game, but a journey into the unknown, challenging us to question our understanding of reality, much like the protagonists of the most bewildering psychological thrillers.In this digital idyll, Stardew Valley emerged not merely as a game but as an enigmatic masterpiece, ensnaring players in a narrative web as intricate and unpredictable as the plot twists of Madame Web, yet with the depth and coherence the film aspired to but ultimately failed to achieve. In the end, Stardew Valley revealed itself to be a mirror, reflecting the complexities of the mind and the elusive nature of truth, far outshining the tangled narrative of Madame Web with its serene yet profoundly deceptive storytelling.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

No. Was it enjoyable? Actually yes. Was it what I expected based on the trailer? God no. This was waaaaay less a superhero movie than I expected. It wasn't presented to us as an origin story, but that's what it is. You get far more origin than superhero. In an era where all of our superhero movies are go go go action, it was kind of nice. Was/is Dakota Johnson a little flat? I mean, it's her. You've seen her movies, I'm sure. That's like asking was Sydney Sweeny big boobed. But overall? It was kind of sweet, what was pleasant. It was nice to see ""teenagers"" (or women playing teenagers) a acting impulsive, like teenagers. If you enjoy good-bad movies from the 90s that had less action and more heart, you might enjoy this. If you're a dude looking for a bad af movie, maybe skip it and try Dolph Lungren's Punisher.","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

Definitely sense that the general public and critics in particular have had enough of superhero movies. This movie is pretty good. I liked it better than MorbiusIt's a time movie so there's a bit of going back in forth in time which could be confusing for some but I thought it was entertaining and the time jumps were done well in my view.If anything it ended too quick. The actor that played the villain lacked substance and his backstory wasn't told well. I couldn't really workout why he was doing what he was doing.The rest of the cast was good. I think they were trying to make a connection to Spider-Man but could have tried harder. Felt like a commercial reason they didn't make a connection which was annoying. Even if they told us which universe it was part of and after credit scene, it would hand made the movie better.","1 out of 15 found this helpful.

I saw it with my friend who always watches marvel movies with me and we have never been more confused from a marvel movie. First off, we never even got to learn the bad guys name. His name was said one time and I couldn't even tell you it now. Second, I found it very confusing how the main characters knew who the bad guy was just by looking at one picture of him without his suit on. They just saw the guy and were like ""oh that's him."" I personally loved the way they showed off madame webs powers and the potential she has. I also thought it was neat how we got to see Ben Parker at the time he found out he was going to be an uncle. It all brings the spider verse lore together when we get to see the beginning of it all with the spider people. It was definitely an entertaining film and the CGI was breathtaking in most scenes, and still good everywhere else.","1 out of 16 found this helpful.

This movie is better than all the marvel movies put together. I believe that everyone will come around and will star dancing while replaying the movie over and over and over again. I think that Stan Lee should of stopped with madam web and not even invented Spider-Man he is too cheesy then they have to just have a hard time to finding cheesy people to play a cheesy character. Sometimes I just don't think that this movie should win all the awards even awards for best chase seens best out in the woods seen and definitely best 3 girls dancing on top of the table seem. Thanks for making this awesome movie enjoy everyone!!!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The only thing that I see bad about it was the movie ended. In my opinion we didn't really get to see how the other girls become they're super character. I like to get more movies of these characters. And see where they go from here. I think this is very interesting in my opinion. Please bring some more like this. Another thing it would be neat if they would bring Spider-Man and the other spider characters among this.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Let them stick to r rated films and not destroy our childhood characters. Script is another disaster from the writers of morbius and for that matter yes morbius was still better. Mid cinematography but good point is that managed to create 2000s era that's only good thing but nothing out of the box. Watching at your own risk it's not even good for timepass. Once again I would say Sony needs to stop it's not even funny anymore they better merge out or do something.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm also pretty well versed in this universe, but all I can say (before I continue saying more because there's a character limit on IMDB) is ICK. There is nothing exciting or remotely endearing about this mess. Just another super hero movie because that's been a cash cow in other situations but this particular film is just a soulless placeholder trying to get people in seats. Congrats, you got my money. I hope nobody else is as dumb as I was. Complete waste of time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
