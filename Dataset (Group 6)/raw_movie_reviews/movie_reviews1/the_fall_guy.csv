Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays an action star who's stuntman is played by Ryan Gosling... who has a real stuntman doing his stunts. The Fall Guy is filled with this type of third-degree meta-ness. I found it amusing.The intro to the early screening called it a love letter to stuntmen. This is an accurate statement. Everyone who loves movies, action fans specifically, owe so much of their enjoyment to stuntmen. The movie showcases so many beautiful stunts. It truly is a celebration of that profession.This is also heavily a love story. I normally don't go for that, but this one hit me in all the right ways. I felt all of the emotions they wanted me to feel.I think most people will enjoy The Fall Guy. But the ones who will love it the most are people who are fascinated by the artistry of in-camera action, or fans of romantic comedies. Also, we need an Oscar for stunt work asap.(1 viewing, early screening EMX 5/1/2024)","95 out of 128 found this helpful."
"7","/10","A Movie That Appreciates Hollywood Oldies.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9677555/?ref_=tt_urv","eziukwuuprightness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur158016051/?ref_=tt_urv","14 March 2024","In an era where blockbusters often demand homework, with their intricate universes and complex lore, ""Barbie"" emerges as a delightful outlier. Movies today, from the sprawling epics of ""Dune"" to the interconnected sagas of the MCU, seem to require a viewer's full dedication-and maybe even a notepad to keep up. This isn't to diminish their artistry, but it's clear that the pure joy of cinema, the sort of effortless fun Hollywood once peddled so well, has become a rare find. A film that welcomes you without prerequisites, ""The Fall Guy,"" seeks to reignite that spark of unadulterated entertainment. It aims to dazzle with the sheer magnetism of its leads, thrust into a whirlwind of romance and adventure, harking back to the days when stunts were real and filmmaking was a team sport, offering a joyride that's as heartwarming as it is thrilling.Hollywood's narrative-rich turn hasn't dulled the magic of star power, a fact ""The Fall Guy"" embraces wholeheartedly, reminiscent of a time when the charm of icons like Burt Reynolds was all the spectacle one needed. Ryan Gosling proves his mettle as a jack-of-all-trades, winning hearts even in the most casual settings, his performance in this film further cementing his versatile appeal.""The Fall Guy"" also champions the unsung heroes of cinema: the stunt performers. Through breathtaking feats and daredevil escapades, it pays homage to the risk-takers who've silently shaped cinematic history, although it's not without its critiques, especially in how it sidelines some of its stellar cast in the latter half.Yet, beyond the adrenaline, there's a poignant commentary on the digital age's challenges to authenticity, making ""The Fall Guy"" a vibrant counterpoint to the prevailing trends of faceless, CGI-dominated blockbusters. It's a film that doesn't just want to entertain; it wants to remind us of the value of genuine connection, both on the screen and in the stunts that make us hold our breath. In doing so, it doesn't just invite audiences to have fun; it demands it, championing the kind of cinema that's been overshadowed by the gravitas of today's tentpoles.","171 out of 248 found this helpful."
"6","/10","Thin plot strung over some excellent stunt work","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9755111/?ref_=tt_urv","timothywalton-31924","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur153983000/?ref_=tt_urv","25 April 2024","The Fall Guy acts best as a glorious ode to the art of stunt work. Perhaps never before have a film been focused so much on the unseen heroes behind many great films - the stunt doubles delivering shockingly realistic portrayals of the action. And in that respect The Fall Guys succeeds- it's action sequences are delivered flawlessly, and are breathtaking to behold. They climax to a crescendo at the ending, where a several vehicles crash, flip and explode, all in sync with action involving a helicopter in the sky with our main character. Praise should also be given to the films two charismatic leads. Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling share palpable chemistry and are simply endearing to behold. They are affable, amiable, and funny. But ultimately my problem with this film is that it is unevenly paced, lacks enough humour, and has too thin a plot to retain an audiences full attention. The films firstly takes too long to get its plot started, resulting in a laborious introduction, a sped through mid section, and a bombastic but slightly rushed ending. The film also does not exert its full potential of comedy. The film does not make use of action comedy(as best exemplified by the Jackie Chan films) or a particularly witty script. Indeed the script is rather dull, sometimes trite, and altogether not very sharp or exciting. Then there is the films plot. I can comment not much other than that it is the recyclable convoluted B-grade plots which are common in movies. It is predictable, ludicrous, and quite inexcusable. So at the end of the day, The Fall Guys is a good comedy that acts as a wonderful tribute to the art of stunt work, bolstered by strong, effervescent performances between its two leads. But for movie watchers who do not care much for the films impressive stunts, The Fall Guys will prove to be a rather empty watch. Serviceable, but unexceptional.","134 out of 201 found this helpful."

It's entertaining, but surely not as much as I expected. Ryan and Emily are excellent, what really can't be said about any among the rest of the cast. There is a bit of action, but surely not as much as one expects according to the title and the fact of the movie being based on the old series of the same name. There is also some comical romance, but nothing really too convincing. The last 15 minutes plus the credits showing the ""making of"" scenes to one side of the screen, are the most enjoyable, especially as there are some (somewhat expected) cameos for movie lovers. 6/10 points.","42 out of 61 found this helpful."

Some scenes are just too cheesy. The pacing was somewhat weird but i guess it is very likely to happen when you try to blend chunks of romcom, action, and crime scenes altogether into a 2-hour movie.Was kinda surprised by Aaron Taylor-Johnson though. Have always thought of him as a great actor but never realized he can be good at playing a silly cartoonish and very stereotypical character also. He was hilarious! !Overall it's not to my personal taste at all but this is an okay movie. If you're looking for a no-brainer fun movie you can go for it but don't expect too much.","129 out of 213 found this helpful."

This genre of movie has been really lacking lately. Silly, cheesy, action packed movies that are just fun.I'm a fan of the original television show and while this is it's own thing it definitely gives a nod here and there to the 80's. The casting is great, the stunts are brilliant, the plot is fairly thin but hey, it's a popcorn movie. Not everything has to be Oscar worthy.I'd really love to see more movies like this released. Very little CGI, good stunts and just fun. The homage to the stuntmen at the end of the movie was a really nice touch too. Job well done.","257 out of 332 found this helpful."
"","","4/10 Frustratingly Underdeveloped","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9772250/?ref_=tt_urv","wheeelertron","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur51764184/?ref_=tt_urv","4 May 2024","I'd love to get behind this as a thrilling stunt showcase and worthy campaign for stunt-performance film-awards recognition, all tied together with a witty and self-aware central rom-com performance from two top quality actors with top on-screen chemistry, I did love the trailer, I did find the concept appealing. However for a project like this to work satisfactorily, regardless of the talent involved, it must be written well, it must be directed well. This is written badly and it doesn't hold together, and the direction is poor, it's a stupid story that doesn't work.That accepted I enjoyed many elements, the stunts, some of the jokes, the sometimes ridiculous neon hair-shimmering slow-motion cinematography, the ultimate man-cave sequence, Ryan's jackets, Emily's catsuit-belt-combo (with invisible holster), the on-set movie-making exposition-demonstration-magic similar to HBO's Irma Vep...the behind-the-scenes stunt-reel over the end credits...until that last bit.Look, I'm glad everyone is enjoying themselves, I just think it is also possible to make a good story out of a fun concept, so we can all enjoy it, and somehow that's not what happened here.","94 out of 163 found this helpful."
"7","/10","Stuntmen injured so that Tom Cruise could shine","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9744291/?ref_=tt_urv","iamianiman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur58447224/?ref_=tt_urv","19 April 2024","The Fall Guy acts as a homage to all the stuntmen and stuntwomen out there. This is a love letter to the stunt team, a film dedicated to showing the grittiness and the roughness of the industry and how the movie industry will fall apart without them. Not only that, this is also a film for anyone who loves films or filmmaking in general.Just like how Barbie was meta for the toy industry, The Fall Guy is meta for the filmmaking industry. Plenty of subtle and hidden messages that were incorporated in the script. Ex: There was one scene that spontaneously mentioned on how the stunt team didn't get any recognition at the Oscars. There was even distinct mentions or references of Taylor Swift, Dune, Kill Bill and Miami Vice amongst many others. Plenty were about the movie industry that if you spotted those things, you would truly have a good time in the cinemas.Marketed as an action rom-com, this film didn't fill its promise with the comedy. It's an element that's just lacking from beginning 'til the end. Of course, it wasn't empty, it had its moments but for a comedy film, it didn't achieve the bar it was supposed to. You might be smiling or left out a few chuckles, but they weren't anything that were just worth bursting out loud. Again, comedy is extremely subjective.The Fall Guy did very well the first 30 minutes of the film. Everything you wanted it to be was conveyed really well. David Leitch opened the film about a film who's working for that film. It fully maximizes everything exciting regarding this subject. The main focus was about filmmaking and the stunt community. It shed light on these unsung heroes, showcasing their dedication and talent in bringing action-packed scenes to life. And damn, it is very good and entertaining.When the second act came in, we started to lose a bit of interest in this movie. Mainly due to its shift of focus that it somehow turned into a murder mystery genre. First act was very good that it talked a lot on filmmaking, and almost every scene was located in a production set. The dialogues were also heavy on that. But the middle part focused more on the murder mystery and romance. While they still included a lot of the meta elements here but they turned its way into a more generic film when it could have been so much more.Even most of the dialogues during the romance scenes were just not as good as the rest of the script. They just didn't maximize the stuff they were talking about. Some dialogues felt meaningless. Some were just flat out boring. Some have meanings but if only they could polish them, this movie would have been so much better.Luckily, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt sparked a good chemistry on set. Even with a moment of no dialogues, just when they're looking at each other, you'll know well enough their chemistry is just electrifyingly good. There were moments they weren't physically together, but the film showed them on a split screen and etc. But the palpable connection between them remained strong.The movie redeems itself at the third act. It's a very epic ending and you rarely see this kind of ending in an action rom-com movie. The action and the scope were big and the messages were all very on-point with the whole theme of the film. It's bombastic but it's lovely at the same time. It's less on fighting or punching, but more on the performing of stunts. 2-3 scenes felt and looked like they came straight out from old classic films. There's just a certain way that the ending was shot that it gave a homage to old action movies. It's indeed a sight to behold.Verdict: A love letter to the unsung heroes, The Fall Guy pays homage to the stunt community, exploring their hardships behind the scenes through the lens of both a director and a stuntman. While it falls short on delivering promised comedy, its first act shines with interesting filmmaking commentary. Despite a weak second act, strong chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt along with an epic finale elevate the film, delivering a visually stunning tribute to classic cinema.P. S: There's a mid-credit scene! Stay tuned!","93 out of 163 found this helpful."

It's a loving tribute to the never ending selflessness of stunt people wrapped inside of an endearing romantic comedy and meta action film. If David Leitch and 87 North did all the action in cinema the world would be a better place.Ryan Gosling achieves new levels of perfection by merging the reserved stunt man character of Drive with his natural Kenergy. His version of Colt is just so lovable, especially because he's completely unafraid to be open in his vulnerability which makes him more relatable whilst being really funny. His comedic timing continues to be faultless, proving he can make any joke land.Emily Blunt thankfully also gets a lot to do. Any scene she shares with Gosling is effortlessly charming and she has her own brand of bona-fide movie star charisma. Winston Duke is a great movie referencing support to Gosling, Aaron Taylor-Johnson does a hilarious McConaughey impression and Hannah Waddingham's cartoonishly over the top producer really works.David Leitch's direction plays squarely to his strengths and after the disappointment of The Gray Man, it's extra satisfying to see Gosling be given some actually good fight scenes. Stunt designer Chris O'Hara and the whole stunt team really accomplished some breathtaking feats that are only made more impressive by seeing how they shot them during the credits.","148 out of 214 found this helpful."

And they continue on, the 'stars' producer wanted Gosling in the film . (Why?)The 'star' dissappears' on a drug related issue.All vague and jumping about as a plot, mixed in with lots of good action scenes (stunts for the film in the story) that don't have much to do with anything.Dissappointing 6/10.","5 out of 6 found this helpful."

Some of the stunts were truly impressive, but I guess that was a core requirement for a movie about a stuntman.The chemistry between Gosling and Blunt was lifeless. There was no spark even in the most romantic scenes. Emily Blunt is one of the overrated actors getting a lot of attention in Hollywood nowadays, in my opinion.The pace was rather uneven, and it did not feel like it was planned - but rather lack of. At times, it felt such a drag that I could not connect to what these characters were doing on the screen.Not worth spending your hard earned money at the theatres.","129 out of 198 found this helpful."

Emily Blunt is under utlised in this film and her character is quite weak. Meanwhile Ryan Gosling also looks like he's trying to figure out what this film is about.

"7","/10","Gosling Elevates 'The Fall Guy' (2024) Amidst Plot Weaknesses","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9777543/?ref_=tt_urv","barvo_k","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur164430909/?ref_=tt_urv","7 May 2024","""The Fall Guy (2024) is a film that owes much of its watchability to the presence of Ryan Gosling, whose performance elevates an otherwise weak storyline. While Gosling's portrayal adds depth and charisma, the movie suffers from a disjointed plot that leaves viewers with unanswered questions and moments that feel unnecessary.One of the film's shortcomings lies in its lack of clarity and connection to the central plot, leading to confusing scenes that detract from the overall narrative coherence. Emily Blunt, despite her talent, is constrained by underdeveloped scripting for her character, Jody, resulting in a relationship dynamic with Gosling's character, Colt, that lacks believability and depth. The imbalance in character development creates a sense of manipulation and blame within their relationship, which undermines the emotional connection the film tries to establish.Nevertheless, The Fall Guy does have its bright spots, with humorous scenes, witty lines, and commendable performances from supporting actors Aaron Tyler-Johnson as Tom and Hannah Waddingham as Gail, who bring life to their villainous roles.Ultimately, while Ryan Gosling's performance shines, The Fall Guy struggles to fully engage me as an audience due to its weak storyline and character dynamics.","22 out of 44 found this helpful."

I think in any case that today Ryan has been typecast in these roles, as happens in Barbie and that although he is useful today, perhaps in the future not so much.Emily Blunt in a totally secondary role and with a romance with Gosling's character that borders on the cloying and not very credible at times.The point is that this movie is an action nonsense that lasts more than 2 hours and that is appreciated as long as we close our minds to any other analysis.The action scenes and how it is filmed are the best of this film, at times it rivals the best of John Wick in that sense.The humor works no matter how crude and physical comedy it is.It's basically an action movie from the 90's, it reminds us a lot of Arnold's ""Last Action Hero"" and that's appreciated.In short, a good movie for a Saturday afternoon, it is not strictly necessary to go to the cinema to see it but it is very entertaining.","23 out of 47 found this helpful."

A stuntman making ends meet as a bounty hunter.So the trailers made no link to the television show at all. Ryan Gosling was expecting another gigantic hit after the success of Barbie. It soon became clear why this movie failed to set the box office alight. A weak screenplay.Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) is the stuntman who got badly injured while doubling for big screen star Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson.) He always claims to do his own stunts.Colt got out of the movie industry. Some time later he gets a call from producer Gail (Hannah Waddingham) to go out to Australia as Ryder has gone missing.It would allow Colt to reunite with Jody (Emily Blunt), a camera operator he had the hots for. She is directing the movie in Australia and if Ryde cannot be found, the studio will pull the plug.Maybe Universal Studio should had pulled the plugged for this until they had a better story. It takes a while to get going. It is a hackneyed plot.It is left for the stunts to do the heavy lifting. They are good but not amazing. The plot is the drag.At least there is a reference to the television show at the end. Maybe this should had been about stuntman turned bounty hunter. Instead you have to take the title of the film literally.There were a few nice touches. When Colt saves a person with force, there was the Six Million Dollar Man sound effects used. During a boat chase, there is the Miami Vice theme.","13 out of 24 found this helpful."

They fight and fight but who cares? We all know how it will end. And it ends exactly how you would expect. Completely predictable. Therefore: boring.Plot is as usual as you can imagine.

It's a funfest of a film The Fall Guy is, one whole theater just out laughing joy at the film as it is the funniest film i've seen in a long time, and i haven't open up my laughter personally for a new comedy in a long time too, Ryan Gosling has just killing it lately since Barbie, his performance in The Fall Guy was definitely the most entertaining performance of the year so far, his chemistry with Emily Blunt was enjoyable and good, David Leitch excellent direction especially the action sequences was great, the cinematography was great, the soundtrack was good, the special effects was great, the story was entertaining enough while it's not completely original but still fun, i just wish it wasn't this long of a movie, i do felt it's a bit too long, but overall i still enjoy the hell out of The Fall Guy for the most part, it's fun, and it's enjoyable, it's one of the most entertaining films of the year.","78 out of 139 found this helpful."

"8","/10","A fun ode to the often overlooked stunt workers of the film industry","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9754786/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","25 April 2024","""The Fall Guy"" is an action comedy film loosely based on the 1980s TV series of the same name. Directed by David Leitch (""Atomic Blonde"", ""Deadpool 2"", ""Bullet Train"") and starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, it is a fun ode to the often overlooked stunt workers of the film industry.Eighteen months after a near fatal accident on set, stuntman Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) returns to work as the stunt double for famous film star Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) on an action movie being filmed in Sydney, Australia. One day during filming, Tom suddenly goes missing, which causes major problems for the film's first-time director Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt) who just so happens to be Colt's ex-girlfriend. With production shutting down indefinitely, Colt decides to seek out for Tom himself to save both Jody's film and her reputation as an up-and-coming filmmaker. While searching the unfamiliar city, Colt soon finds himself framed for a crime he didn't commit, leading to a series of events that put his life in far more danger than any stunt he has ever performed.When watching an action movie, it can be easy for us to neglect just how much effort goes into some of the intense stunt work taking place onscreen. Most of the brave men and women responsible for this are frequently risking their lives for the sake of our entertainment and often end up forgotten in favour of the more well-known actors they are doubling for. If you're like me, I think it's about time major accolades are handed out to these performers at mainstream award ceremonies as a formal way of acknowledging all of their hard work. ""The Fall Guy"" pays an affectionate tribute to these stunt performers in a film that manages to both entertain and serve as a reminder of some of the lengths these people will go to ensure audiences always keep coming back for more.As a demonstration of the intricacies in this line of work, the film opens on Colt performing a stunt that almost costs him his life. We see him being strapped into a harness intended to drop him from the top floor of the inside of an office building, with the real actor Tom watching on from a safe distance. Of course, things go horribly wrong for poor Colt, as the straps suddenly fail and cause him to plummet several storeys without any means of saving himself. His serious injuries force him to sit out working for over a year, and during his period of recovery he starts to notice the consequences of working in the shadows of somebody famous for too long.Later, as Colt wanders the streets at night, he passes by various billboards and ads adorned with pictures of Tom plastered all over them. This causes a man at a nightclub to mistake Colt for Tom due to a passing physical resemblance, though the stunt performer quickly proves that he has more gumption than the famous actor ever did. Colt is then tasked with being the valet driver for the man at the club, in a scene where he lets loose and drives the car as quickly as possible, much to the owner's surprise. This is intended to establish that while someone like Tom is recognised the world over as an action star, there are still those who question if it is really him doing all of his own stunts. Colt is naturally the one doing all the hard work, and it is here we see the parallels drawn between an actor with a ""tough guy"" image versus a real tough guy who did long term damage to his body only for someone else to take the credit.Being a film about stunt performers, you'd be correct in assuming that there will be scenes of car chases, explosions, shoot-outs, and inside references to other movies that contain all of the above. Director David Leitch, himself a former stuntman, makes good use of this film's premise to poke fun at the world of stunt work in a respectful, tongue-in-cheek manner. In particular, the film humorously calls out the similarity of its plot to that of 1993's ""The Fugitive"", with Colt realising he has been relegated to a role mirroring Harrison Ford on the run despite his innocence. This leads to some exciting chase scenes taking place throughout the streets of Sydney, with the action even finding its way onto the iconic Harbour Bridge. Not since ""Mission: Impossible 2"" has the city of Sydney been featured so prominently in a Hollywood action movie, and the film uses this uncommon location to its advantage.We also see during the filming of the ""movie-within-a-movie"" how tedious it must be for Colt being forced to perform the same stunts over and over. Many of these stunts usually involve subjecting himself to painful situations, like being set on fire or thrown out of a car window. On top of that, it is shown that many of those working on the film don't even bother to acknowledge him by name, dismissing him as merely ""The Stuntman"". Seeing this side to stunt work told from the perspective of an actual performer like Leitch certainly gives the film a sense of authenticity in his storytelling, especially when done in a way that helps the viewer understand the difficult process undergone by these hardworking crew members.Though not the first time he's played a movie stuntman (see 2011's ""Drive""), Ryan Gosling fits into the role of Colt perfectly, approaching the character with considerably more humour and less stoicism. Gosling does a great job balancing out Colt's tough, resilient image of a stunt performer with that of someone who genuinely cares about those who are likely to eclipse his success. It is Colt's familiarity with the combative nature of his career choice that allows him to handle himself during any kind of physical altercation, usually resulting in him gaining the upper hand against adversity. In spite of everything he goes through, you've got to admire Colt for his work ethic, as well as his personal obligation to help complete this movie at all costs.Emily Blunt is a great addition to the cast as well, with her character Jody taking on the role of a rookie filmmaker finally getting her big break in the industry. Her chemistry with Gosling works quite well in the film's favour, showcasing her secret longing to rekindle an old romance while still maintaining a level of professionalism. I also found it interesting to see how the film touched upon Jody's insistence on having her story told exactly to her specifications, even if it caused her to lock horns with the film's producers and cast members. This was likely done as a commentary on the way a director's vision can often end up compromised in favour of what the studio higher ups want to see instead, which is still an ongoing problem in Hollywood today.As an appreciation of stunt workers everywhere, ""The Fall Guy"" is an appropriately fun ride that virtually all audiences are bound to enjoy, with no prior knowledge of the film industry required. It is comforting to know that behind every great action sequence in the movies we watch, there will always be those brave people willing to risk everything in the name of entertainment. Though we may be waiting a long time before stunt performers receive the mainstream recognition they deserve, we at least have this film to remind us of their significance until that day arrives. If anything, thanks to this film, that day might come sooner rather than later.I rate it 8/10.","36 out of 70 found this helpful."

The film's central focus lies in its brilliantly executed stunts, but what truly enhances visual storytelling are the personal interactions between the characters, notably Emily Blunt's, her film team's and Ryan Gosling's. It provides a steady stream of humor and romantic chemistry. Emily Blunt's performance is effortless, perfectly suiting her character's charisma. I also loved Ryan's interactions with a dog.The cinematography may appear basic, but it's deliberately styled to emphasize long, medium, and handheld shots, creating a dynamic visual experience. These choices make the scenes feel alive and experimental-ish, especially with sequences that almost play out in one shot, circling the actors and enhancing engagement. The editing is commendable, particularly the use of split screens and mounted camera shots, which add to the film's innovative presentation.The film is imbued with wit, humor, and thrilling stunt work, making it unforgettable. The practical and special effects shine, particularly in the action and fight scenes. The choreography of the chase and fight scenes is impressive, although I do think there could be a bit more (or less) glass particles in the film. The script is well-written, and it sets a strong foundation right from the beginning, which adds a lot to the overall entertainment value of the film, covering themes of trust, and deceiving one another.Overall, The Fall Guy is a brilliantly entertaining film that balances wit, drama, and action with a fresh cinematic style, making it not just memorable but a commendable piece in modern Hollywood cinema.","14 out of 33 found this helpful."

This remake was made by David Leitch, director of Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2 and Bullet Train.Stuntman Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) does a lot of dangerous things as a stuntman on the film sets. After a serious accident, he has to take it easy for a while, but loses contact with the camerawoman Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt).When he hears that Jody is now going to register his own film and use him as a stuntman, he decides to return to his profession as a stuntman. On the film set he learns that everything is different and Jody would rather not work with him. When star actor Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) disappears, Colt is asked to find him, so that Jody gets too red in her first directorial job.Before he started directing, director David Leitch was also a stuntman himself and has done stunts in many films himself or helped to convey the stunts well and appreciated. It seems that with this film he wants to make some kind of ode to stuntmen from the film world. This group helps convey tense, dangerous moments in films, where people are shot, blown up, or thrown through windows, for example. Stuntmen take so many risks just to make movies impact movie audiences.Because they are also trying to make a film themselves in this film, you get to see many behind-the-scenes moments and what this can look like in films. This way you get to see how and when they use explosions in the film, for example, and how they use props and make-up to transfer the damage from these explosions to the film set and at the castles. They manage to reliably convey many action moments in this film.This remake is now also about the more modern aspects of the stuntman profession, because nowadays they can do more with the help of computers in films and also at times when they use stuntmen. For example, with deep fake they can stick the actors over the bodies of the stuntmen, so that it really looks as if the actors are actually doing their stunts themselves. This makes action scenes seem more and more frequent, but the presence of the stuntmen is also somewhat lost. They continue to take more and more risks, but they can see themselves less and less in films in which they performed the stunts.In addition to the action, they also manage to add comedy to this film. The comedy in the film itself works, but the meta comedy that the film adapts to other films and stunts works best, especially for film fans, who can recognize some of these moments.Ryan Gosling comes across well as a stuntman who tries to prove himself again after even being out of the business. Justin Eaton deserves and this film also has a lot of respect, because he is the stunt double for Ryan Gosling. Emily Blunt also comes across well as a novice director trying to film her own passion film. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt also have good chemistry together and come across convincingly as two people who were in a relationship together, but are now more like exes. Even though one of them tries to bring more passion into their relationship, so that they can perhaps try the relationship again.","14 out of 34 found this helpful."

I love Emily Blunt. I love David Leitch action movies. I love movies about the making of movies. So as you can imagine I was very, very excited for The Fall Guy and it basically gave me everything I wanted but also a lot that I wasn't expecting to get out of it also.This film, from top to bottom, is a love letter to films and the people who make them. As someone who has an active interest in filmmaking I really appreciated that this took the time to reference all the below-the-line jobs in the production process that don't gain as much mainstream attention. Obviously the stunt doubles but also the camera operators and the sound technicians, just to name a couple. Basically the positions that aren't as sexy as all the roles in front of the camera and I really loved how Leitch made the effort to pay tribute to these positions but also how he incorporated them into the plot seamlessly. This whole thing is a massive love letter to filmmaking and as a result I just had the stupidest grin on my face from beginning to end.But even putting all that aside, this has also got to be one of the most purely entertaining films I've seen in a long while. It's David Leitch so all the action set pieces are phenomenally well realised with a minimal amount of CGI but the story's also a lot stronger than I expected it to be. It's nothing revolutionary but it did keep the whole thing moving at a good pace and these central character are really what kept me as interested as I did. I truly believe Ryan Gosling can do no wrong and he's basically perfect in this. He's totally believable in all the action scenes and if you loved him in Barbie and The Nice Guys this performance is very much in the same league. Emily Blunt and him make a perfect pair and all the biggest laughs come from their interactions. I do think the script overplayed the humour a bit too often though. It's almost like Leitch and the writer didn't trust us and the audience to get the jokes so they kept dragging out the humour out to the point where it felt like they were saying; ""do you get it?, you get it right?"" and it did become frustrating for me after a while.As I said, I love the fact that this whole movie pays tribute to the filmmakers at every level and that's no more apparent than in the third act. Rather than end the film on a generic set piece they made the filming process a part of the plot and I got a massive kick out of seeing pure filmmaking as a means of thwarting the bad guys plan. But I do think the road to that third act is a bit clunky. It felt like the film was ramping up to its climax only to stop and set up what ended up being the real ending. I ultimately loved where it went but it but I wish the road to that third act was a bit smoother.Look, if you just want to watch The Fall Guy as a purely entertaining action movie this will tick all the boxes and then some. But if this opens even one casual moviegoer's eye to all the work that goes into the filmmaking process this entire film will have been worth it. I loved how this film paid tribute to the stunt performers and crews behind movies and all the while delivering a kick-ass action experience.

""Colt"" (Ryan Gosling) is the stunt double for the all action hero ""Tom Ryder"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) whilst sort of dating aspiring director ""Jody"" (Emily Blunt). An accident on set drives ""Colt"" away from the business altogether until a random call from producer ""Gail"" (Hannah Waddingham) informs him that ""Jody"" is to direct her first film in Australia and he has been especially requested! Of course he hadn't, and when he turns up - much to the surprise of the production, they sort of settle for a truce as he gets back into the swing of rolling cars and jumping from burning wreckage. Where's the star though? Well it transpires that's what ""Gail"" has really brought him to establish. He's gone AWOL. Not for the first time, ""Ryder"" is a bit flaky - but all ""Colt"" need do is track down their wayward pretty boy and then he can escape this embarrassing scenario and go back home. Needless to say, his investigations soon immerse him in a dangerous world of drugs, unicorns and even more car chasing and pyrotechnics. Can he find his charge and maybe even restore his romance? There's precisely no jeopardy with any of that, even if there is quite a daft twist in the tale at the end, but that doesn't matter. This is an excuse for some good looking people to have fun celebrating the life of the movie stuntman. It's good fun to watch with Gosling oozing charisma as we go along on a trip that reveals just a little of the smoke and mirrors that is routinely used to convince us that what we see on screen is real - and that nobody usually dies! Sydney harbour is used to good effect, though I maybe wouldn't have wanted to be the general manager of the opera house when their film crew turned up, and the dialogue is quite a witty mix of hackneyed metaphor, old lines from famous movies and plenty of corn and cheese. ATJ doesn't really feature so much, but when he does he's clearly taking a pop at all things vain and superficial about the cult of image, and Blunt looks like she is enjoying herself as she tries to get her film in the can despite her missing frontman, the wrong kind of sand on the beach and her clearly having the hots for her ex. A good soundtrack helps it all along and though I doubt I'll recall much about this in three months, it's a lively poke at the characters that make movies and I quite enjoyed it.","10 out of 25 found this helpful."

It was well presented from what i managed to watch, but was far too slapstick to what i prefer. Like i say, some will love it and clearly they do from the 7.1 rating (at time of writing).

I liked the chemistry. I liked the BGM, the cinematography and the slo-mo shots. But, this movie had a relationship problem. Gosling and Blunt play ex-lovers with a forest fire in the hearts. They clearly are longing for each other - you can tell that right from the first time Emily sees Ryan onscreen (about ten minutes into the movie). But, this leads you through cringe-inducing scenes, one after another. The first half is the movie version of phrase ""airing out your dirty laundry.""Look, the stunts were cool, but the story (including the overlong romantic arc) was underdeveloped. Their seems to have been a quick decision to cast actors from Barbie and Oppenheimer (then, unreleased) and capitalise on the market.It's too silly. It's too outdated. It's too lame.I loved Nobody and Bullet Train was a decent ride. Both were silly and unbelievable but the craft was better. Fall Guy just did not work for me. The pay-off and the denouement don't really deliver. The second and third acts could have used better writing. Casting could have been better. Hannah Waddingham was great in Ted Lasso but giving her a brunette wig and a god-awful American accent just did not work.","11 out of 22 found this helpful."

I am sorry to say, but I am unsure if this is a movie that I would have seen at the theater had I known what I now know about it.It's important to know that this film is made to showcase and celebrate Hollywood stuntmen and their jobs. So, yes, it is a movie about Hollywood. I really wish I had known that before going into the theater because I dislike those types of movies - the self-congratulatory types.The movie plot moves slowly and confusingly in the beginning and middle acts, to the point that I was struggling to identify the plot or the purpose of this film until the very last act. In the final act, everything is explained, the story flows better, and you finally ""get it"". However, before the last act, I was so ready to walk out of the theater and that shouldn't happen.Ryan Gosling is, of course, great and eye candy, and Emily is also nice in this. My problem was not with the acting, which was good enough; it was the fact that, damn it, this was boring for the most part. As I mentioned, this movie is pretty much a love letter to stuntmen, so expect many stunts, Easter eggs of action movies, and action movie stars, while the plot takes a backseat.If you're into meta-ish type of movies, you'll appreciate this film for its technical specifications and action scenes. Additionally, Gosling's dry humor basically carries the film. Besides that, don't expect much more from the plot.Just understand that this is not your typical action-comedy movie but a more self-aware film highlighting Hollywood stuntmen with convoluted premises (romance-missing movie star) to keep you entertained until the end. I did laugh at some scenes, and as I said, the last bit of the film is very good.","7 out of 16 found this helpful."

Can somebody write a plot in 5 minutes?"" - whoever came up with this movie.Technically speaking, this is a nice movie by 2024's standards: visuals and stunts are well done, everything else is mediocre. We do get good laughs and some funny jokes but nothing mind blowing.The plot is super cliche. In the beginning it seemed like this was on purpose and they tried to make fun of the generic nature of action movies. They should have chosen that path, that would made this an amazing comedy movie, but they wanted to make a generic action movie instead. While some clips are indeed intentionally ironic and we do get some winks about the movie industry, in general they aren't deep, satiric or at least frequent enough to say that this is a reflection of how this genre works. Most of the scenes were intended to be serious and because of this the movie is more of a showcase of stunts then a real movie. The movie does initiate a thought regarding the importance and treatment of stuntmen but despite trying to be a serious movie, it immediately abandons this attempt and doesn't dare to talk about the topic beside some exaggerated jokes. The BTSs are actually pretty interesting, the technical implementation is really good but they missed out on actually giving weight to this spectacle driven film. The love story is super generic, the evil plot is forcefully unnecessary and nonsensical, the characters are predictable. There is no mystery, plot twist or a big reveal. The audience is treated like it was a cartoon for kids: this simple plot was explained(!) 3 times for us!Acting was okay.Music was selected from stock libraries. I can't count how many times I heard ""I Was Made For Lovin' You"" during the scenes which supposed to be epic. There was no attempt to marry the visuals with the music, they just coexist. You could change the soundtrack to any similar music.All in all it is a feel good movie, with a happy ending and nice visuals that worth a singular watch if you desire something simple.","4 out of 8 found this helpful."

But it's been a while - so I do not remember how this fares comedy and humor wise.That said, Ryan and Emily have bombastic chemistry (sorry?) - the dialog is tight, the action/stunts are amazing .... and the story really works. Add to that a soundtrack that you should absolutely love (even more so if you like 80s music), references to the 80s and another show (including a musical cue ... added to the visuals that is) ... and a lot of fourth wall breaking ... you may even argue: the fourth wall is being evaporated! I reckon that about sums it up.This is a love song - not just to love (again no pun intended), but to stunt men ... and women of course. A travesty that they have yet to get a section at the Academy Awards. I still can see the unicorn ... it was that good (you'll get it once you watch - also I am of course kidding - no I did not do that - again you'll get it after you've seen the movie).Important note at the end ... when the credits start rolling, there are some behind the scenes footage you will see. I thought it would go the Jackie Chan route, but it is just showing what happened behind the cameras - and how they did the stunts and the action. Which come to think about it, was the better choice. But that is not all - so if you may not be too interested in that ... there is a bonus scene coming after that ... and it is quite the nice one! The movie itself has some ... interesting actors, I am sure you will find someone to your liking! And almost everyone is fighting ... (maybe not Kung Fu but still ... passionate and well enough) ...

When he breaks his back during a stunt fall, he takes 18 months off to recuperate and hide. Returning to stunt work on director Jody Moreno's big sci-fi epic, Ryder's agent / producer Gail (Hannah Waddingham) tells him that Ryder is missing and if he doesn't find him, Moreno's film will be shut down. He starts investigating, but clearly his attentions are not welcome.This begins with a messy and rather dull first 45 minutes where like so many Hollywood comedies the leads talk utter drivel at break neck speed but actually say very little. This mostly explores ad nauseum the will they, won't they get back together again story, but eventually the film settles down, bringing together a fun and even exciting comedy thriller. The stunt work is, as it should be under the circumstances, pretty breathtaking and the leads and the supporting cast are good and amusing company.

Interesting action scenes, with great choreography and cool visual effects (you can notice the green screen in some moments, but nothing that distracts us). Ryan Gosling is great, very charismatic as always, and with a humor vibe that I really enjoy.It's a great film to spend some time casually, despite being a bit bland in the development of the main plot. There's even a plot twist to try to breathe life into the narrative, but I felt it lacked complexity, you know? There's a lot of shallow development here that could have been much better executed.For example, the complexity of Emily Blunt's character boils down to a director who spent years waiting for a boy and now wants to make a film translating this love story. Man, I could only think about her wasted potential, as I love Emily's performances, and despite giving me good laughs, the character was practically used as comic relief in the story, as if it were needed, considering the film is full of jokes all the time.The antagonists of the story are also a bit too silly. I understand that, to try to match the film's atmosphere, they chose to go easy on some aspects, but for my taste, they went too far with this lightness, almost leaning towards slapstick comedy.But as I said, it's a light and fun movie. I had good laughs and enjoyed the fights and explosions. It's a tribute to the stunt profession, and throughout the film, they are portrayed almost as special agents to solve dangerous situations on a grand scale. Go in with low expectations and you'll have much more fun, that's the tip.","10 out of 28 found this helpful."

The worst part is that the film could have been better with just 2 things: if their love story was written better, and on few places they could have made more original plot. Few of us just yelled ideas while whatching and some of them were quite good😊

Although I found the action scenes entertaining and most of the plot well thought-out, and loved the cinematic references throughout, I'd eventually qualify this film as dull. While the film begins with the hero's fall (both literally and figuratively), it doesn't dwell too much on his highway to hell or his fears to get back. And, even if I like Ryan Gosling's acting performance, what a shame this film did not offer the main role to a real stuntman who would be able to do his own stunts and would have been a voice for this atypical and little-known profession.However, I did appreciate some characters such as Dan and Gail, which I'd have loved seeing more on screen. On the other hand, I felt sorry for Emily Blunt, whose character has no interest whatsoever and could even have been dropped from the final version, which would have allowed more time to develop Colt's character.In short, an enjoyable film to watch in the cinema (not sure if I'd have watched it all the way to the end on streaming) but one I won't be looking to see again.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

If you're not going to read any more of this review then the top line is that I liked the film, but I didn't love it.Stuntman Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) is called back to work by producer Gail Mayer (Hannah Waddingham) a year after a serious accident injured him during a stunt. The accident also prematurely ended a relationship he was having with Camerawoman Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt) who is now directing this film, her first feature. Gail had an ulterior motive for calling Colt though, as the films star Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has fallen in with a bad crowd and disappeared. Desperate to save Jody's film, Colt begins to track Tom across Sydney and finds his stuntman skills are soon put to use.The problem with ""The Fall Guy"" that's just for me is that the trailer includes a lot of the film's key moments, including elements of all the stunts and the banter between Gosling and Blunt. That trailer has been running for a long time and I go to the cinema a lot, so I have seen that trailer dozens of times. Although it does keep some of the plot hidden, so doesn't give the game away in that sense, I did feel like I'd seen the film almost before it started. There are some regular issues with the film too, it does keep us, the audience, in the dark about it's actual plot for too long. Some aspects of the resolution, spoiler free but related to the veracity of visual and audio recordings, don't ring true.There are plenty of positives though, the leads and the supporting cast are good. Aaron Taylor-Johnson has a lot of fun with the McConaughey-esque drawl. The stunts, which are all done practically as, if nothing else, the film is a love letter to the stuntmen and women of Hollywood are all really good.It's not that it doesn't add up to very much, as much as it doesn't add up to as much as I wanted it too.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

This movie has a few very good action scenes perfectly choreographed with good upbeat songs and then goes off the rails because someone decided they would have Ryan Gosling crying listening to Taylor Swift? The director's attempt at humor through emasculation is cringe worthy and ruins the pacing.The larger problem with the film though was this inane banter that is not remotely realistic dialogue and it never stops. No one talks like this, ever. Disappointingly this remake of course called for more ""diverse"" casting. The producer, director, ""computer wiz"" and prop designer are all of course ""strong women"" and almost every white male except for Ryan Gosling is again ""evil"". Yawn.Interestingly the iconic truck from the original TV show actually looks much better than the newer model and this is coming from someone who hates the look of most '70s and '80s vehicles. Gosling, however; does his best with what he is given to work with and some of the action scenes at the beginning and middle I would watch again but there is just not enough here for what the trailer sold me on and for that this is a missed opportunity.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

Eventually it limped towards a demonstration of stunts with a flimsy plot that absolutely no-one could have cared less about. There was never any genuine sense of danger, no character arcs and no even half decent humour to excuse this.

It helps that the action scenes are excellent! The movie does suffer from a weak script that has jokes that don't land. It feels like everyone is doing improv leading to weak dialogue scenes.Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable movie and it succeeds in making me appreciate stunt performers even more!","4 out of 10 found this helpful."

While the reflection isn't particularly deep or novel, it adds just enough to keep the movie entertaining while paying homage to stuntmen and stuntwomen.The film is well-cast and well-paced, with plenty of moments that will make everyone chuckle. Ryan Reynolds and Emily Blunt essentially play themselves, but it works perfectly for this movie. This approach allows the film to focus on the fun elements rather than character development.Despite a couple of major plot holes, this is a fun family entertainer that can be enjoyed on both the big screen and at home. Just remember to turn up the volume.The soundtrack is reminiscent of many classics. The studio clearly invested a lot in securing top-notch music, which greatly elevates the film and constantly reminds the audience to just have fun.On a side note, Australia has become a go-to location for many big-budget Hollywood movies these days. However, it feels underutilized as most films only shoot around the Sydney Opera House. There's so much more to the continent, and I eagerly await a movie that captures its beauty more comprehensively.","4 out of 10 found this helpful."

Starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, the two create an enjoyable on-screen couple full of witty banter. The story centers around a stunt man (Gosling) and new film director (Blunt) who mingle on the set of a new film. Outside the film set, trouble arises when the lead actor (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) goes missing. It's fallen upon the stunt man to find the lead actor, save the film, and maybe impress the director. I remember seeing the movie trailer one time and didn't think too much about it afterwards. However, after the first five minutes in the theater, I was into the story and having fun. That's what this movie is, a lot of fun.The ""movie within movie"" has been done before, such as Tropic Thunder, and elements from those films can be seen here. It can, also, be easy to nitpick some points in this film that are tacked-on or just plain silly. Moments during the climax got carried away but it was able to refocus to make for a solid ending. I'll admit, I enjoyed all the stunt scenes more than the second storyline about the missing lead actor. Nevertheless, you can probably nit-pick everything while in the theater and still have a great time watching this film.Ryan Gosling will always be his adorable self on screen and Emily Blunt, as always, shines in every role. Together, they make this film work in both the more serious and funny moments. You can tell both actors enjoyed working on this film together, one scene in particular stands out. Between the ""will-they-won't-they"" storyline, is the action scenes. This film showcases how action scenes come to life and respects the profession of the stunt man. Cars get flipped, big explosions happen, actors get pulled everywhere, etc. This film delivers everything promised in the movie trailer, which I appreciate.Overall, this is a fun with worth the price of admission plus extra large popcorn. The runtime of two hours will go by quickly with good laughs and explosions.","10 out of 23 found this helpful."

It's not trying to win an Academy Award or garner praise from the big reviewers. It's purely a movie to have fun with and take a little time away from negative news cycles, and the mundanity of daily life.It's fun. It does have unbelievable moments and contrived plot twists, but even when you can see the inevitable from a mile away, it's still nice to see that result.The best parts for me are Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt's chemistry, and they're both such likable people. I mean, who doesn't like them?I never wished something different had happened in the plot, because it's not a deep murder mystery or plot-heavy thriller. T's all about spending a couple of hours rooting for the good guy.I'm of the belief that not every movie has to be a 10 to be entertaining. Most aren't 10s anyway, And usually they're the one's that try a lot harder than this one does.I don't feel like it's a time-waster, and you may not either.","4 out of 10 found this helpful."

Today's CGI and special effects can be stunning and awe-inspiring, and clearly movie audiences have come to embrace this approach as evidenced by the success of Star Wars and superhero franchises, as well as plenty of other blockbusters over the past couple of decades. In contrast, stuntman-turned-director David Leitch (BULLET TRAIN, 2022, ATOMIC BLONDE, 2017, JOHN WICK, 2015) and screenwriter Drew Pearce (MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION, 2015) have delivered a throwback by adapting the TV series from creator Glen A Larson, which ran for 112 episodes in the 1980's.Two key players from last year's ""Barbenheimer"" box office rivalry, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, are the featured players here as Colt Seavers and Jody Moreno. Colt is a renowned stuntman and Jody is a camera operator and aspiring film director. When we first see them on set, Colt is preparing for a dangerous stunt as a double for mega-action film star Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, BULLET TRAIN). Between shots, Colt and Jody are expounding on their previous flirtations and making plans for the future. The stunt goes wrong. Colt is rushed to the hospital and the film flashes forward 18 months to find Colt working a menial non-stuntman job, and Jody directing her first film, METALSTORM, a sci-fi action thriller.Jody's directorial debut also stars Tom Ryder and is produced by fast-talking producer Gail Meyer (Hannah Waddingham, ""Ted Lasso""). Gail draws Colt out of retirement and back to the set under false pretenses. Of course, sparks fly again between Colt and Jody, but Gail's ulterior motive is for Colt to track down the missing Tom Ryder. So, let's stop here and chat about this movie for a moment. First of all, it's rare action-comedy-romance-mystery film. It also offers a peek at the structured chaos of a movie set, as well as the diverse personalities of actors, crew, and producers. Possibly what it does best is shine a spotlight on the stunt crew, noted here as the unsung heroes. There is even a crack about there not being an Oscar for stunt work (a topic that's been debated and discussed at the Academy).The film certainly benefits from the charisma and talent of Gosling and Blunt, both of whom were nominated for Oscars last year. And Leitch's film also deserves credit for being an ode to action movies and a love letter to stunt performers. But let's face it ... the story here is pretty thin and seems to exist only to provide a reason for the stream of ideas designed to take advantage of Gosling and Blunt and a few other gags. Drugs that cause unicorn sightings, a running joke about a cup of coffee, a ""Miami Vice"" jacket, a dog that responds only to French commands, and some 'on the nose' music - and familiar sound effects from ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" all add to the nostalgic feel (along with a Wilhelm scream). And while I join many movie-goers in sharing Colt's desire to ""beat the ____ out of Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character"", I'll admit to finding some joy in Tom Ryder riffing on Matthew McConaughey.The extended version I saw featured an additional 20 minutes to the theatrical version, and it appears most of it was for one particular fight scene being filmed in Jody's movie. Supporting work seemed a bit sparse for the talented Stephanis Hsu (EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE, 2022), Winston Duke (BLACK PANTHER, 2018), and Teresa Palmer (BERLIN SYNDROME, 2017). What wasn't sparse was the number of adrenaline-pumping stunts and explosions. Those segments were big fun and a welcome answer to the recent barrage of CGI/Special Effects blockbusters. This one has a throwback feel that bathes us in nostalgia at times, recalling the wild films of Burt Reynolds and Indiana Jones. There is even a late scene featuring the two lead actors (Lee Majors, Heather Thomas) of the old TV series. Whatever you do, stick around for the closing credits to get a look at the actual process behind the stunts included in the film ... educational and full of wow factor.Now showing in theaters and available on Digital.","3 out of 7 found this helpful."

If he gets the actor back, her career will be saved and he will win her heart. The only problem is, the case takes several unexpected turns and our hero is framed for murder. Now, he has to clear his name, catch the bad guys, and save the day.Gosling is pretty terrific as the main character, but we never really get to know or understand him. How did he get so good at being a secret agent-type person? And the film has some funny moments, especially early on...but they become few and far between and it's less comedy and more kind of light hearted fun where you don't laugh but you smile. (Sort of).Our main hero and his love interest have zero spark. It's hard to care if he ever saves the day or gets the girl. Plus, the case he goes on has a twist that changes the plot of the film halfway through and while I saw the plot twist coming - I can't say that it helped the movie.The action scenes in this film are fun, but they aren't so good that you haven't seen better elsewhere and in the end they don't make up for all of the missing elements in the parts of the film. Overall, The Fall Guy is a movie that has some action that is decent, a hero who is likable but hard to relate to, a love story that feels empty, and a mystery which never really amounts to much.I see why it flopped.","3 out of 7 found this helpful."

With something for lovers of every movie genre, The Fall Guy is a great film to go watch.The story follows Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling), a retired stuntman who has come out of hiding to work on a movie in hopes of rekindling a year-old love story with the director Jody (Emily Blunt). After discovering Jody has left their relationship in the past, Colt is told that the lead actor Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has been involved with bad people and is sent on a mission by Tom's producer, Gail (Hannah Waddingham), to find him and, although it won't be easy, he can hopefully save Jody's movie, while getting her to fall back in love with him.All aspects of this movie are fantastic - something that really stands out to me is the music. Part of the reason it's noticeable is because of the iconic tracks on this film. Viewers of all ages will recognize some of their favorite tunes while watching The Fall Guy. Not only is the music popular, but the use of these songs is unexpected while being perfect at the same time. An example of this is Kiss' ""I Was Made For Lovin' You,"" which can be heard throughout the movie. It's used in many different situations and you can tell the people behind the film knew what they were doing, choosing this as the main track for the film, because it goes so smoothly with the love story behind the mystery and comedy parts of The Fall Guy. The multi-genre part of this movie is also fantastic. Every type of movie lover can find something to enjoy while watching. Ryan Gosling's laidback comedic personality really shines in his performance of Colt Seavers. Throughout the movie the audience will watch moments that are especially hysterical due to Gosling's acting. Gosling and Blunt's quirky, but loving chemistry is so entertaining. Every scene they are in together left me viewers laughing, crying, and swooning. My favorite scene includes a cameo with some Taylor Swift music when Colt replays his relationship with Jody in his head in a little highlight reel to ""All Too Well."" Jody sees him crying in his car and goes to check on him. Obviously, Colt denies the accusations.The message of this film is that there's always more than meets the eye. This message can be applied to many different situations, both in life and in the film. Colt talks about how stunt people are the ones who take the falls for the actors and the actors are the ones who win awards and get to be in advertisements. Somebody watching the film would never notice a stuntman because that's his job, to go unnoticed. One reason that Gosling made this film is to appeal to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to establish an award for stunt people.I give The Fall Guy 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 plus adults. It releases in theaters May 3, 2024. By Kendall B., KIDS FIRST!","15 out of 38 found this helpful."

One last note: the connections to the 80s TV show (starring Lee Majors, Heather Thomas, and Douglas Barr) are minimal, so don't expect a reboot of that cult show.

It creates and maintains throughout a sort of hyper-reality utilized with very fun effects as Ryan Gosling winks at the camera through various stunts and action sequences. Fall Guy is designed to be an ode to stuntmen and, while I can't speak for them about whether it delivered on its promise of being a massive love letter to what they go through, it sure felt like it!Through all the amazing action sequences, Fall Guy wasn't content to be a one-dimensional beat-'em-up extravaganza. At the core, all the fun was wrapped in a believable story arc with good acting that saw Blunt with her massive range of emotions she's so wonderful at seamlessly working through, and on at least two occasions, Gosling's character was emotionally devastated, delivering big tears to complete the sale.If I had to change anything, it would be the over two-hour runtime. Studios are so concerned with making some huge epic that moviegoers get to experience on the big screen, they forget the joy audiences subconsciously reference when choosing to commit time in the future. The value of editing with the intent to deliver something in a tight, elegant package cannot be understated. My last complaint is that while the cast of co-stars' characters were well-acted and mostly well-written, the lead villain couldn't have been more generic and predictably short-sighted.","3 out of 8 found this helpful."

The film delves into the world of stunt actors, an aspect of filmmaking that's criminally underappreciated. It also doubles as a murder mystery. I was excited for this film, as I'm a fan of the director's previous work. I like Atomic Blonde. Bullet Train is my favorite film of his. I'm also a Ryan Gosling fan of films such as Blade Runner 2049 and The Nice Guys. This movie feels like a combination of The Nice Guys and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.The film looks great, and the action scenes are well-executed and exhilarating, as one would expect from this director. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are both likable as the leads. Most of the humor was pretty funny, at least to me. Although, the constant pop culture references got slightly grading after a while.Many critics complain that the film is too long, and that it could have been cut in places. I do agree with this. The film did not need to be over two hours. You do feel its length in the last half-hour. By the end I felt exhausted. That's the main issue I had after recently seeing it. Though, that view can change over time, for better or worse.I would say this is my least favorite David Leich movie.

Enter the stunt guys!Although there are some actors who do all or most of their own stunts, the majority leave it up to the professional stunt people to do the hard yards. We as audiences rarely stop to think that (e.g.) the guy falling off the bridge is not really the actor, but a stand-inThe story is well written to intertwine with the sequences of stunts and makes for a believable plot, but it could have had a bit less of ""forced"" dialogue here and thereThe scenes were expertly coordinated (by a stunt manager) and the title is cleverly disguised as a double edged sword.... The ""fall guy"" as a stunt man and also as a revelation laterEmily Blunt is always superb. Give her a box of sand and she will sell it to millions. She is just that good. As far a Ryan Gosling goes, you have to feel for him. He has starred on par opposite commanding Oscar winners and yet he himself does not get the nod. Sure - his ""label"" in Hollywood puts him in a category that very few can act out in character, which he does with ease. After Blade Runner 2049 and The Gray Man it was a trajectory change to Barbie for him, and in The Fall Guy he is the hopeless romantic, hiding behind his pan-faced movie persona. But it works in this movie. Hopefully someone will soon recognise his massive talents and award him with a deserved OscarThe GCI was befitting for this movie, the cinematography just as good, the editing on par with the expected and the director's input could have been a bit more precise in some parts. The humor is well-timed and sufficient to relax your attention span between scenes.

I liked it because it is about movies and about what makes movies (action movies mostly) memorable or stand-out, stunts. It's all about stuns, and when it's not about stunts we get a little love story which makes you want more stunts. That's what the end-credits were all about. And it broke some records too, as I hear.Should they have an Oscar category though? The ever present discussion. I dunno, it's all diluted by CGI, too much editing. Should we just give Tom Cruise one for stunts and call it a day?I would gladly watch this movie again but not in the near future.","6 out of 12 found this helpful."

And an ode to all the incredible things these actors and supporting cast do.With enough levity to make the world building feel like you are watching a skit or a cartoon.Sadly, the story itself is just serviceable.. with a basic criminal plot, but plenty of fun moments. And while the silliness doesn't detract from how energetic and fast paced it feels, it still feels simple, short and compact. Lovely credits, though! From the behind the cameras, to the script-like credits. The other high point is definitely the varied cast (Winston Duke continues to be a treat) and the well-written characters. Oh! There's a bit of a Romance and ""moving on"" theme, as well as achieving that ""happy ending"".. barely.I mean, we are all here for Ryan Gosling.. go watch it if you can.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

There are some really terrific films out there that don't have a rating as high as 7.2. This movie gave me some clarity on why a movie like 'Barbie' was so popular. People don't actually like the films - they just like Ryan Gosling. It's the only explanation. And chances are they don't even realise it. It's only those of us who aren't overly fond of Gosling that can see how average these films are.This is exactly the kind of film I hate the most. Safe, boring and predictable down to the last detail. You know exactly how a film like this is going to turn out from the moment it begins. There is zero chance it is going to take daring and unexpected turn. The studio themselves may as well have made the movie.I could go on endlessly about everything I hated about this movie, but it's not the type of film that is worth putting the effort into. I would rather watch a film that tried something original and daring, and perhaps failed in its attempt, than watch a film like 'The Fall Guy' every single time. 4/10.","13 out of 16 found this helpful."

Also the quality difference between the acts is so evident that reviewing the movie as a whole wouldn't do justice, to the last act that is.First act, we are introduced to the characters. And you better believe me when I say that the movie takes its sweet time with the first act. It takes too long and provides too little in the great scheme of things. I can't see the general audience enjoying this at all however this act is likely to prove to be more bearable if you're into production side of movies.Second act, the movie's entire tone suddenly changes with one phone call and it becomes a murder mystery. Now, the problem here is apparent. We have a case at hand but why should the audience care about it? There are better movies out there with more intriguing mysteries. No one's going to buy a ticket to the Fall Guy for the murder mystery element. The movie itself didn't advertise itself a murder mystery either. It was advertised as a RomCom and an Action movie. However, the movie barely delivers its promises up until the last act.Romance is surely there but there are times it feels too forced. You know how the saying goes, ""Show, don't tell."". Well, while the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt is clearly there, there are times in the movie where they try too hard to sell it and it comes off as superficial. Regarding other elements, comedy and humor is barely there. It is rather dry in that regard and action, well, let's cover that in our review of the third act.Third act is clearly the saving grace of this movie. You can sort of see it coming halfway through the second act and it really is ""bombastic"". But does it really make up for the two lacking acts of the movie? Well, see the movie for yourself and be the judge of that.","5 out of 21 found this helpful."

Quite a waste of the talents of the two leads, as the script is weak and flabby, and the plot disjointed. It looks as if they thought that all the stunts will be enough to carry the film, but if the action had been backed up by a lean and relevant plot it would have been so much better. It is one of those movies that seems to portray that the cast are having a lot more fun and enjoyment than the audience watching it? The director created a mess of a film, and didn't seem to stitch together all the parts into a coherent storyline.For a movie depending primarily on it's action, stunts and wit, it did not fully deliver, and while i appreciate that kid's will love it, adults, will i am sure, see the numerous flaws and weaknesses that are so apparent/
Maybe, unlike me, people will be satisfied with the constant stunts and action, but it left me unsatisfied, and wondering how much better this could have been with a decent director and scriptwriter......the premise was good, but the outcome was empty and very much a missed opportunity. I would much rather watch something like Tropic Thunder, which has a similar approach, but delivers so much more with regard to humour, action and wit.

Even if not all the jokes work. But its the action that really pushes the movie up. There is some CGI in there but there are also alot of real stunts and the movie overall feels like a genuine love letter to stuntmen. When in this day and age, it could have just did everything with greenscreen.So it feels like an original movie in the end.

Colt has a crush on camera operator Jody (Emily Blunt). When Colt is seriously injured when a stunt goes wrong, he leaves the industry.18 Months later his producer Gail (Hannah Waddingham) convinces him to return. Jody - now a director - is directing her movie 'Metalstorm', for which Colt will be doing the stunts. Tom Ryder stars in the movie. However, things get complicated when Tom suddenly disappears, and Gail asks Colt to find him. What seems simple at first turns into a life-threatening ordeal for Colt as he gets involved in murder, with thugs on his trail.'The Fall Guy' is a lighthearted movie and the potential life-threatening moments are presented as comedy, so the film is never to be taken too seriously. For most parts, I think it worked well and there were many funny moments (although never really hilarious). I enjoyed the film's presentation in general with the film boasting some fantastic visuals, action sequences, and off course stunts. This film is laden with incredible stunts from beginning to end. What I loved most, was the return to practical effects instead of CGI. Hats off to director David Leitch!!It was also exciting watching the characters making a movie. It gave a good insight into the making of a movie, and being on a movie set. (Yes, fortunately I have been and could relate). The film has an awesome soundtrack and I loved the way 'I was made for loving you' by Kiss was transformed into an exciting film score.There's more than enough action and adventure to keep the viewer engaged and I also thoroughly enjoyed the film's climax.

Well I'm happy to say this film has nothing to do with the Fall Guys video game and thank F for that, we don't need another pixels!The effortlessly cool Ryan Gosling stars as a film stuntman coming back from a serious injury in order to work on a project that's being directed by Jodi Moreno (Emily Blunt) who he happens to be in love with.Seems straight forward that is until the star of the film James Bond... I mean Tom Ryder played by Aaron Taylor Johnson goes missing putting the entire project in jeopardy. Goslings Colt Savers takes it upon himself to find Tom (he can find me any day) in order to save the woman he loves film.David Leitch is in the directors chair for this one, his work includes films such as Hobbs and Shaw and Bullet Train. I feel like with the later of those films Bullet Train Leitch has been trying to establish a style for himself and I'm on the fence about whether I'm a fan of that style. I found Bullet Train to be outlandish and over the top and a lot of the humour didn't work for me. There's something about the focus of The Fall Guy being on stunt crews however that really works when combined with Leitchs style.The films a 12 certificate so don't expect gritty action in fact at times it's almost comic book esc along the lines of Scott Pilgrim, I was half expecting big speech bubbles to come up with words like POW written on them. The cartoon nature of the action was a problem for me in his earlier work but for this film it just seemed to work really well. It also probably helped that up until the end where the action goes crazy there's overall less action and instead we get some heartfelt moments of dialogue as well as humour that for me landed a lot more than it did it Bullet Train.It doesn't take itself too seriously and is very referential, referencing a number of films and other actors some of which with hilarious results. It does all this while also managing to be a heartfelt salute to the unsung hero's of big screen action films the stunt department.I guess you could says it's Alright, Alright, Alright.","2 out of 6 found this helpful."

Everything in this film is done with practical effect and stunts and in the end credit, they show the documentary of making these scenes. And yes, they were spectacular, especially when you know they were not CGI.I thought the romance part was exceptionally well, which is odd for Hollywood. I'm not a fan of Hollywood romances and many films the problem was either too corny or no chemistry. But in this case, for some reason, Gosling and Blunt have an amazing chemistry that naturally worked. The Karaoke scene with Against All Odds, I admit it drew tears.So the one problem with this film is in the long run time which is due to a lot of rambling dialog that can be trimmed to move the story along. In short, a lot of the beginning was a bit slow and boring. Things start to pick up about half way, when the real bad guys showed up.Overall I give it a 6/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

Cast is filled with people I really enjoy movies from and revere. First thing that was quickly explained was this movie is joke/exaggeration I wouldn't call this a comedy. Not what I expected going into the movie but alrighty jokes it is (think Monty Python or SNL)! The storyline/acting/plot was so exaggerated that by the time they explain what's unfolding I was burned out by the repeat attacks of comedic lines and puns and just want to see how the f it all ends.Unfortunately the over the top storytelling shaved this down from a 8 to a 6. I couldn't take any of it seriously because it was sooo ridiculous. Ryan gosling and Emily blunt can and have played very serious and lighthearted roles and still can make the movie but when the whole thing is a giggle and joke in every scene I really don't know if the message is for hollywood, me, or Ryan.Not an awful movie but the trailers made me think some serious stuff was happening and the story was showing the tough life of a stuntman making movies in this modern age. No I still wonder what the hell this movie is trying to say or communicate... other than poorly executed, tryhard, force fed humor. To compare Bullet Train was also a long joke movie but at least there were some serious and unique aspects that helped make it fulfilling to watch, I just didn't even get that here. Would not re-watch, even in the background.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

As the mystery surrounding the missing actor deepens, Colt soon finds himself ensnared in a sinister plot that pushes him to the edge of a fall more dangerous than any stunt.Every movie fan, and action fans specifically, know how important stuntmen are to cinema. So, just as they promised, this movie really pays tribute to the guys who do the dangerous stunts in all of the action movies we love. The story had so much potential delving into the life of stunt doubles but they decided to solve a mystery that's not really related to the main story. Also, the mystery is so predictable and can easily be figured out by anyone. However, all that asside, the movie was so much fun. There were so many new and creative action sequences, hilarious for the most part , and some pretty good performances. Now the dialogue was a bit hit and miss which affected the on screen relationship between the 2 leads (Emily Blunt and Ryan Reynolds) however you could still sense the chemistry between them.Overall, a very entertaining action comedy that you can just shut down your brain and watch.Score:7.5/10.","2 out of 7 found this helpful."

The premise of the film sees a failed stuntman sent to find the big movie star of his ex lovers film.Main Character
Ryan Gosling has been on quite a role lately and he plays Colt Seavers and he is just great here. He basically plays himself and is clearly having a great time with it, Colt is a fun character and Gosling oozes charisma and charm throughout the film. His character does have a story arc and it kind of works but Gosling takes everything he has and just makes it work.Supporting Characters
Emily Blunt plays Jody Moreno and is the main love interest and she is great too. The chemistry between herself and Gosling is amazing and it makes every scene they have together really entertaining and Blunt adds a lot to it.Winston Duke plays Dan Tucker and is basically Gosling's Stunt Boss and he was really funny here. He is constantly quoting films and it just gave me a chuckle with how many he chucked in here and Duke has the natural charisma that just makes it work.Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays Tom Ryder who is the film star that goes missing and he is entertaining when on screen though he doesn't really have too much to do but he feels like a natural part of the film.The one performance that annoyed me was Hannah Waddingham as Gail Meyer, she is a talented actress but she as really annoying here and not for the right reasons. It seemed like she saw everyone else having a great time and thought she would raise it even higher and become even more of a parody then this film actually is.Story
The story is fun, it is a good love story between Gosling & Blunts character and their chemistry together makes it easy to care about them and really believe in their dynamic. But the rest of the film kind of falls flat, there is no meat to the story and it becomes a bit too convoluted and like they were writing the film as they were shooting it as the film's last act just doesn't quite work.Script
The dialogue in the script is quick and sharp, it makes these characters seem more interesting and helps build the relationship between the two main characters and fun references to other works. But the film again lacks the drama and has quite a few different twists which doesn't really make sense and kind of over complicates this film.Style
The film looks great, it really puts the spotlight on the role of the Stunt performer and it does prove that these guys deserve way more credit for the work they do. The action scenes are absurd and over the top but there is no denying that they were very fun. But this films pacing is all over the place, it takes too long to get going and then goes on way too long. The 2nd act is strong but the 1st and 3rd don't live up to those levels.Overall
Overall, The Fall Guy is a good film. It is just an exciting film that showcases the unsung heroes of film and even though it isn't overly memorable it was a fun time at the cinema and I think if you get the chance and enjoy fun action films then maybe give it a chance.Rating - 7/10.","2 out of 7 found this helpful."

He focuses a lot on details given in the beginning to the middle of the movie and at the end we are reminded of those details again , but only those who watched the entire picture with full focus (without missing anything) gets what they are about( a foreshadowing of the end, a quote, a backstory, etc.).During the first half, the story continues with a slow flow. However, this does not cause the inattention or distraction of the audience. Because, the unpredictable environment of the movie supported by mysterious incidents in the past allows us to find it gripping and try to solve the mystery along with the main character.Finally, the fighting sequences are creatively and artistically made and fun to watch. Besides, it is very uncommon to reflect on screen a picture about the hardships, financial and emotional struggles of a stuntman and also a love story plenty of regret.An unusual action film that must be seen in theatres.","9 out of 21 found this helpful."

There are so many great stunts ranging from hand to hand combat, driving set pieces, parkour etc, and they are just such a treat to watch. Stick around for the end credits to watch some behind the scenes footage of the stunts being performed which is a nice touch.The plot is really fun, although it maybe takes a touch too long to really get into gear. The fact that the plot focuses on a movie production creates opportunities for lots of meta moments which are all executed pretty well. It is jam packed full of action, good humour, a pretty engaging love story. It has everything you could want from a big blockbuster.Maybe one of the best things about the film though is the lead performance from Ryan Gosling. Easily the most charismatic actor in Hollywood, he just lights up the screen with impeccable comedic timing, line delivery, and physical performance. His chemistry with Emily Blunt is superb and she is brilliant in her role as a movie director trying to forgive Gosling's Colt for past mistakes.Not only are the stunts, performances, and story line really solid, but the film also has a killer soundtrack. The music choices compliment every story beat perfectly.So aside from maybe a slight pacing issue at the start this film is an absolute hoot. Gosling is magnetic, Blunt is charming, the stunts are electric, the soundtrack is on fire. It is a real love letter to stunt performers and old school Hollywood blockbusters. An absolute treat best experienced in the theatre!","5 out of 10 found this helpful."

It's a summer movie that knows exactly what it wants to be","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9770622/?ref_=tt_urv","nERDbOX_Dave","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur180109328/?ref_=tt_urv","3 May 2024","""The Fall Guy"" isn't here to reinvent the action movie wheel. Instead, it delivers a potent dose of summer blockbuster fun, fueled by impressive stunts (one breaking a world record), charismatic leads, and a healthy dose of self-aware humor.Ryan Gosling absolutely owns the role of Colt Seavers, a washed-up stuntman with a knack for trouble and a smile that could charm the rigging off a high-wire act. His chemistry with Emily Blunt, who plays the demanding director trying to wrangle him back into action, crackles on screen. Their banter is sharp and witty, adding a layer of humor that keeps the popcorn-munching audience engaged.But let's not forget the real stars of the show: the stunts. Director David Leitch, known for his work on John Wick, brings his expertise to the table, delivering a series of jaw-dropping action sequences that are refreshingly practical.The plot itself is a classic action-comedy concoction, with a missing movie star, a conspiracy to unravel, and enough explosions to light up a small city. While it won't win awards for narrative complexity, it serves its purpose perfectly, providing a framework for the film's true strengths: the action and the charismatic cast.Ultimately, ""The Fall Guy"" is a crowd-pleaser. It's a summer movie that knows exactly what it wants to be - a fun, fast-paced escape with a touch of heart.","2 out of 9 found this helpful."

"7","/10","A Solid Blend of Romance, Comedy and Awesome Stunts","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9786347/?ref_=tt_urv","jaredkjacoby","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur111679790/?ref_=tt_urv","12 May 2024","Based off the 1980s show with the same name, The Fall Guy follows stuntman Colt Seavers who gets injured in a stunt gone wrong. Eighteen months later, producer Gail Meyer calls Colt to return for a movie directed by the woman he is in love with: Jody Moreno. However, the main star for the film, Tom Ryder has gone missing and Gail assigns Colt the task of searching for his whereabouts. Balancing his work with helping Jody with her film and tracking down Tom proves to be quite a challenge.The Fall Guy is a movie that combines romance, comedy and action to make a film set in Hollywood to shed light on stuntmen and women, the guys who take the hits for the actors. It is directed by former stunt performer and coordinator David Leitch who also directed Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, Hobbs and Shaw and Bullet Train. I do not think there could be a better choice of director for this movie than Leitch. This movie is meant to be a love letter to stunt performers who don't get the recognition they deserve. Does this movie succeed at that?The Fall Guy has a lot going for it. First of all, as far as a movie for stunt performers go, this movie definitely highlights the hardships they go through and the hits they take. The movie is about how unappreciated they are and how overworked they are. Colt's producer not only calls him to help Jody with her film, but to also search for Tom Ryder which puts a lot of stress on him. The story is more action-oriented than other blockbusters, but there some really good themes here like honesty building the best relationship, when things go wrong you can get back up and to trust your instincts. The movie has positive messages for not only relationships and stuntmen, but also people who might be down on their luck.The movie has a lot of humor and most of it lands. There are a lot of references to movies, funny situations that Gosling and Blunt are put in, great comedic timing and fun dialogue to demonstrate the chemistry between the two leads. Not every joke landed and there is one that I cringed at, but most of the humor is really good and surprisingly sweet-natured. Everyone I was with in the theater laughed throughout so I think there is a good chance that this movie offers a lot of different types of jokes to make anyone who watches this movie laugh.Directed by a former stuntman, the action scenes in this movie are absolutely spectacular. Not only are they beautifully shot and edited, but they are creative and showcase awesome stunt work. One of my favorite sequences is the scene where Colt is chasing bad guys who captured Alma in a truck. The fight on the back of the truck reminds me of Raiders of the Lost Ark in how many dangerous stunts are performed. It is genuinely intense, it looks awesome and the stunt work is impressive. The climax is another one of my favorite set pieces. A movie set blowing up while chasing the bad guys and using props to defeat them? The climax is one of my favorites in a while for its creativity and visuals because how often do we get to watch a set piece of a film set? The rest of the action scenes are great and creative as well with some beautiful cinematography and lighting. There is even a scene involving the blank gun that has creativity. There is not a single bad action scene here and there is plenty of them. David Leitch did a fantastic job because I can tell that this is a movie made by a person who is an expert on stunts.Even before the action takes the stage, the cinematography looks amazing. The opening tracking shot is really cool. The action scenes look even better thanks to the slick camerawork and lively colors. The boat chase scene comes to mind because it is beautifully lit and visually striking. I really like the set designs as they fit the tone of the movie very well and they look really cool. The set for Metalstorm looks fun and imaginative even as a fake movie set. I would be kind of curious to see how that movie would play out if it were real.The soundtrack is also quite good, with Kiss' I Was Made for Lovin' You making a good theme for this song. They even have a newer version of this song by YUNGBLUD made for the movie that is a fantastic cover for Kiss' original song. Also, Emily Blunt has a beautiful singing voice in the karaoke scene. I forgot that Blunt starred in a few musicals before this film and I may have to check them out. It is also the perfect song for that scene for her to sing.However, we cannot have a great romance story without two great leads. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt makes for a match made in heaven. Their chemistry is dynamic and they play off each other perfectly. I love how Jody is this seemingly tough director who stutters when she is talking with Colt when she starts to like him. Emily Blunt is great in this role because she has great comedic timing and a surprising amount of range here. She handles comedy and drama equally well, while showing the hidden depths of her character just by her expressions and speech. She even gets a couple of action scenes which is always a plus. Gosling is goofy as ever trying to win her over, but is equally sincere when he needs to be. His line delivery in the climax to Blunt is touching. Colt Seavers is a great role because it allows Gosling to showcase his comedic, romantic and dramatic talents while showcasing that he is a capable action star. Gosling and Blunt are the perfect leads for this movie.The supporting cast is not too shabby either. Aaron-Taylor Johnson is great as Tom Ryder. I did not recognize him at all and he pulled off that role as an egotistical actor perfectly. Stephanie Hsu does not get a whole lot to do, but the one scene she gets is really cool and it reminded me why I want to see her in more stuff. Winston Duke is really fun as Colt's best friend and stunt coordinator. He is a loyal friend who joins in on the action to help Colt. Teresa Palmer is wasted as Tom's girlfriend though. They could have given her so much more to do. Hannah Waddingham character Gail Meyer irritated me though. She is definitely supposed to be unlikable and sleazy despite putting on a friendly act in front of Colt and Jody. However, you can see her dark side from a mile away. I kind of get the angle the writers were going for with Gail as she is supposed to be that person is just flat out unpleasant to be around acting fake towards everyone around her. Still, Gail the only character I did not get a laugh from. Other than that, the supporting cast is really good.As far as other issues go, the movie is a bit bloated. This movie has a lot going on in the script. The romantic love story, a mysterious disappearance, plenty of action scenes and stunts and several characters getting thrown in. The movie has a lot of cooks thrown in and not everything works. At first, it is tonally jarring because it cycles through several different genres, but this movie does find its footing and when it does, it becomes much more fun to watch.The Fall Guy is a great time at the movies. This is the definition of a crowd-pleasing blockbuster. It has romance, comedy and a ton of action to keep anyone who sees it entertained. It also pays a lot of respect to stunt performers and coordinators who work hard to make action scenes in movies possible. This movie was a relief to watch because I saw this movie after a rough morning of work and for a while I was crankier than usual, but this movie definitely brightened up my day. I also took my mom to see it as an early Mother's Day present and she really enjoyed it. The Fall Guy definitely made a turned a bit of a rough day to a fun one and to me, that is the best thing a movie can do for me.Definitely stay through the credits especially if you are a fan of the original show or just someone who wants to see how people perform the stunts.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

It has Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt with their charm maxed out, and the chemistry between the two works really well.

Without knowing anything about the plot, it was jumping into the cold water and get wet with high speed movie. The plot doesn't matter - it is pretty generic, with one big detail, that does matter - it is a tribute to stunt people, wherever they are.The plot is like a training close, that reveals something shinier below. This movie has a magnificent rhythm and humor in it. It's a movie inside a movie about a stuntman that directs movie on a stuntman with an actor that made most of the stunts in the movie by himself.There is a lot of love and jokes about and to the movie industry, for those that are part of it and those who wish to be a part of it. It has memorizing action sequences and light-headed texts, that shouldn't be an obstacle for you to enjoy this particular ride. It's silly and sometimes sticky, but it catches you just about right from the beginning.Ryan Gosling is cool and funny-cool, as he is almost his whole carrier and Emily Blunt just mashes great with him. She's like Teflon, from the way that I see it; doesn't do anything to remember, but glides well on Gosling's character and doesn't ruing a single thins or any scene she's in.A lot of fun time, really. Can't say a single bad thing on this movie, that is like a lot of others that just ask to turn of the brain while entering the movie theatre. You don't need to overthink it, but you are going to enjoy each and every bit of the movie, including Aaron Taylor-Johnson good performance and Hannah Waddingham's peak performance (when I was sure, all along, that she is Toni Collette, for some reason).Several last praises for David Leitch, that getting his career on the right track. No crashes, so far for the Ex-Stuntman, that is singing praise songs to his former comrades. His directing is precise and so good. Just damn good work from a man that smelled those parts from the inside of the burned and crushed suite. Give us more of those and we will be grateful.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

The Fall Guy is, by and large, a tribute to the stunt department in modern-day cinema, but it also tries hard to be a romance and occasionally, a thriller. The romance is very superficial, depending entirely on Gosling and Blunt to make it all work somehow, and to their credit, even without seeing them together for a good part of the film, it was enjoyable. There are some decently written bits here and there, like how they reconnect during a set-piece shoot after one of them ghosts the other.The film also goes into another direction in order to justify its title, and these parts offer varying degrees of satisfaction. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Hannah Waddingham get the short end of the stick, with both their characterizations particularly found wanting. The saving grace(s) in these stretches arrive in the form of Jean Claude the dog, a spontaneously fun set-piece featuring Teresa Palmer, the action-pairing of Winston Duke with Gosling, and the music choices. And yes, since it's an actioner, Blunt gets a short action scene (or two) as well. All things considered, it's an okay x not-bad watch; just like Bullet Train, it ain't all that memorable.P. S. Is it just me or did Metalstorm really look like ""a stupid movie"" (as remarked by Blunt's character)?P. P. S. I really wish there were more action hero references and Easter eggs.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

If you know the basic premise of the film & his backstory, it isn't that difficult to guess the fall guy being a tribute & love letter to the stunt people. This is clearly a passion project for leitch. People that don't often get the recognition they deserve despite their hard work, often life-threatening. But the actual film is that and much more - an inspiring ode for the directors as well. Being proud of one's work, feeling responsible and powerful over it, and potentially inspiring more people like you via your work. Despite the hurdles in the way such as dipshit entitled actors or sinister/anti-art producers, in the end love triumphs, both love for your man and for your work. Happy ending is possible.The fall guy didn't quite work for me in the first act, with the relationship/sorta-romantic subplot and conversations feeling like they're getting in the way of much more interesting mystery/main plot. The meta-ish narrative and some creative directing choices, while being bold, wasn't enough to fully grab my attention and pull me into the story. I was ready to slap a two-and-a-half star into this thing, maybe even lower, but as the 2nd act hits - the story finally gains its momentum and is a pretty much non-stop great ride til the end credits. I'd say this is quite the opposite of leitch's previous film - bullet train (a film i had a blast with) was a film that quickly invested me and was consistently fun.. until it kinda lost its steam in the cgi-filled third act. The fall guy on the other hand, slowly works its way through the first act until it fully takes off in the second act and onward. What i also appreciated is the minimized/almost non existing usage of cgi - almost every david leitch movie since deadpool 2 had a similar problem of mostly having great cinematography then ultimately delves into grey cgi sludge later, in the climax or sometimes little earlier. The fall guy does have some flat looking scenes or cgi, and sadly leitch may not reach again the visual heights of the first john wick or atomic blonde but overall this is visually strong. Considering the subject matter/theme, i appreciated the third act looking great and real, you can very much feel that those were made with talented stunt people and crew both in front of & behind the camera, putting their hard work in. I guess there were some cgi elements put into them but they weren't that distracting.In the end, david leitch may not reach the greatness that his fellow john wick director chad stahelski achieved with JW sequels, especially in terms of action, but i'd say his movies get job done greatly for being a fun action films. And i'm very careful in saying this but leitch's movies may have been better in thematic elements.... i'll come back to this statement later. Anyways, good movie!+) very heartfelt and feels like it was made by human. Which may sound weird, but considering the recent hollywood climate & some themes of the movie, it should come off as a compliment.","2 out of 10 found this helpful."

If you don't, you'll wish you had. This movie isn't going to win any Oscars or try to impress you with a serious story that makes you think about anything. It's purely to entertain you and make you laugh. It manages to do that while having heart. I'm not sure it could have had the same heart without Ryan and Emily. It felt like kismet timing for them to be paired together for this. Ryan doing some of his own stunts was impressive and if there is one thing this movie really does do well, it's give more respect to stunt people and encourage others to join the field. It has some really neat looking action scenes you won't see anywhere else, even a record breaking one. That said, I'm really not into blockbusters or action movies in general and so it was a bit long for what it was with quite a thin, unbelievable plot. That's the only reason I gave it a 7. If it weren't for the narration over the movie, it would be rated higher, but it was a little too meta to be considered timeless.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are an all-star pair and I enjoyed them both, they worked well together. Hannah Waddingham and Aaron Taylor-Johnson add good showings too. Stephanie Hsu and Winston Duke are involved as well.The story produces entertainment, even if it could've had more flavour added to it. I felt watching that in a few parts it does overstay its welcome ever so slightly, not for a negative impact but enough that I couldn't rate it any higher. All the stunt stuff is fantastic though, as it ought to be given the subject matter. It's solid humour-wise, my favourite bits were actually the background actor interactions; s/o wife's sister guy.Overall, I liked this one. Improvements were possible, though what's there is good enough - an easy watch, to be honest.","6 out of 13 found this helpful."

It has mostly done what it set out to do. Always love it when movies reference other movies and this had a ton of it but some of it felt weird because in terms of fitting into the movie it felt forced but at the same time, that's how I'd reference a movie with friends in real life. But there was a lot of it that worked really well too. Mixing up Notting Hill and Pretty Woman feels like something I've already seen somewhere before but it was still fun. The whole movie was mostly like that where the whole thing is cliche af but it's still fun to watch even though it's nothing to boast about. It does have some incredible stunt work and in old-school fashion the end credits with the BTS were fun. The movie could've been some 20 minutes less and would've worked way better, nonetheless, on the whole a very entertaining movie.The theatre was filled with what seemed like college kids and they were not getting a lot of the references to which I was laughing, and I wanted to explain the references, now how can I say the movie forced the references when I'm like this 😌","1 out of 4 found this helpful."
"8","/10","A Great Celebration of Stunts and Movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9770208/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","3 May 2024","Many film fans and industry professionals have been calling for stunt people to be given the credit and acknowledgement they deserve. Well, there may not be any big awards for them yet, but this film certainly celebrates the craft in a great way. The Fall Guy is a big popcorn action flick that I've been waiting to see for a while now, and I have to say, it was very entertaining. You could just tell the filmmakers involved were making this a love letter to stunts, while also trying to tell a very fun story at the same time. If you're looking to have a good time at the movies, here's why I recommend The Fall Guy.After an injury, stuntman Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) saddles back up and returns to a new film set, where his crush happens to be the director (Emily Blunt) of the film and the main star (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has secretly gone missing. You very soon realize though that he was hired onto this film by the producer so that she can send him on a hunt to find the movie star. With a nice relationship between Blunt and Gosling, this film sings with charisma and humour, while the rest is about celebrating Hollywood and the stunts that go into a movie. I thought the overall story was ridiculous and fun, while the romance was adorable. The movie could've been a little funnier at times, but that's a nitpick.In terms of where the story goes, I predicted most of it throughout, but the cast is so good that I was able to ignore the formula. Winston Duke as Colt's friend/boss is terrific and their scenes together were some of my favourites in the movie and Hannah Waddingham as the film's producer stole a few moments as well. I will say what perplexed me was that the main credits at the start of the film listed Teresa Palmer when I believe she briefly appears twice and maybe has one or two lines. I was shocked to see her in the top billing without even really being in the movie. Aside from that, this cast was incredible together. Now, let's wrap this up by diving into why a lot of people will likely enjoy it.The Fall Guy, as I said, is a film that celebrates stunts, and throughout almost every single frame, it all looked like it was shot on location and without many visual effects. That is rare for a big-budget movie these days and that just put a smile on my face. The explosions looked real, the car stunts looked real, and most importantly, it didn't seem like a lot of green screens were used for certain settings. It felt like this film was 90% in-camera and that's never going to be a bad thing in my book. Director David Leitch began his career as a stuntman himself, and after now directing five feature films, I can confidently say that I think The Fall Guy is his best work so far. For action, romance, or comedy fans, I recommend this one. It's not amazing by any means, but the story is good enough to service a big, fun, entertaining popcorn flick. Oh, and stay for the credits, a nice behind-the-scenes look plays throughout them. Check out The Fall Guy, now playing in theatres.","6 out of 13 found this helpful."

Yes, the Stunts are good, but we've seen them all before. What time isn't spent with people beating each other up is spent with the dumbest dialogue ever. It's supposed to be funny but it just isn't. Don't waste your time and money. Why would Blunt and Gosling, both tremendous talents make such a stupid movie? The payday must have been ginormous. If you want to see great stunts with both good, and sometimes funny dialogue, revisit any of the 007 movies with Sean Connery. I did watch the entire movie but only because I wasted $20 to watch it on Netflix.

It's hard to make a movie about movie making itself. I enjoyed the soundtrack to the film which was another strong point for me. Overall, enjoy the movie for what it is and it is not an Oscar Worthy film with a killer plot line and script.

Their electric chemistry lights up the film, sparking constant laughs and keeping things lively and fun.Really, ""The Fall Guy"" is like that friend who insists you shouldn't overthink the fun-you just jump in and enjoy the ride. Forget about dissecting the plot; this movie is here to offer a break with a killer soundtrack that'll have you nodding along. It's unapologetically fun and refreshingly straightforward in its mission to entertain. If you're in the mood to just chill out and soak up some good vibes, this film is the perfect pick-me-up.

Start to finish, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The director, David Leitch started his career as a stunt man, so in many ways this movie feels like a love letter to stunt people and movies. There are so many nods to other movies, like Ryan Gosling quoting Last of the Mohicans and re-enacting stunts from Miami Vice. That aspect of the film I really loved, it was fun to see the inner workings of a movie set on screen, even though it was fictionalized. It really shows audiences how much work goes into a movie and how many people are valuable on set and vital to making a production work.My only complaints are that the movie felt a little drawn out. It took about 30 minutes for the plot to develop. I honestly forgot what the plot was going to be because they took so long to reveal it. There was a lot of good set up and character development in that time, but it should have been cut a bit. There was another very small mishap but they were in Australia and their cars were all American.. that just bothered me.Other than that, this was so great. It was very unrealistic and silly, but really captured the audience. Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling had great chemistry that was hard to look away from and not believe their love story. They just were bouncing off each other and really made the movie have a fun, upbeat and silly tone. They both played their parts perfectly. It felt different enough from Ken and The Grey Man that Ryan Gosling was doing something new, which I was happy about.The music is fun, the post credit scenes are fun, every cast member nailed their parts and the plot is insane. Don't take it too seriously. Enjoy the silliness, nods to other movies and get carried away in the action, as we are meant to.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

Director, money, two of the biggest actors from last summer, an amazing press tour and of course the unsung hero's that are the stunt crew.This kind of action comedy is supposedly what audiences around the world have been asking and having now watched it I can safely say it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.Was it perfect....no.But as the title of this review suggests, it was Good Fun!Which is why I can't seem to understand how this movie has been labelled a flop. Despite it being what people apparently want, very few people are going to see it and that's a shame because it is an excellent movie for the big screen.Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt command the screen with stand out performances from Winston Duke, Aaron Taylor Johnson and of course Hannah Wadingham (nice to see her in a big movie after the success of Ted Lasso). The stunts and action are amazing with breaks of comedy and romance thrown in for good measure. The odd bit doesn't work but the movie quickly redeems itself.So if you are on the fence about going to see it, please do. You will have fun watching it!Side note.... Stunt team did an amazing job and they should definitely make it an Oscar category!","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

It works better as a satirical take on action heavy Hollywood flicks than it does as a romantic comedy. In fact I would say the film fails in the romance department, any romance (or emotion for that matter) is grossly overshadowed by its own 'epicness'.

It's also his best film since his uncredited work on 'John Wick (2014)' for the simple reason that it's a ton of fun. Although its plot has some notable inconsistencies and contrivances, it keeps you engaged throughout and provides ample opportunity for the mixture of action and comedy that acts as the core of the affair. Ryan Gosling's infinite charisma, alongside his palpable chemistry with the great but arguably underused Emily Blunt, allows the feature to float high above its issues; you don't even notice most of its problems until you get home. The crime caper aspects of the narrative often feel like they're getting in the way of the more interesting on-set stunt stuff, and there's definitely a superior version of this that focuses entirely on Gosling and Blunt's rekindling romance amidst the latter's frantic efforts to shoot her sci-fi epic as practically as possible. Still, both sides of the coin are enjoyable. This is the sort of movie that, in a way, shouldn't be as good as it is. It's the sort of thing we've all seen before and probably not liked very much, but here it's been done with so much passion and is generally so well achieved that it just soars above expectation. It's really, really entertaining. It may be predictable, feel-good blockbuster fluff, but sometimes that's just what the doctor ordered.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) plays an Hollywood stuntman working as a stunt double to the star Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). Colt also is in love with Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt) who works as a camera operator. After a failed stunt, injured Colt disappears cutting off ties with the film industry as well as Jody. Year later, he is offered the stuntman job by producer Gail for her film Metalstorm which is also debut directorial of Jody Moreno. As he tries to rekindle his old flame, Gail puts him on a task to find Tom Ryder who is missing and to secretly find him to save the film from getting shelved. Unknown to Colt, it's a bigger conspiracy he is getting into and what secret he uncovers? Will he be able to save himself from this mess, forms rest of the story.Let me be honest, the film was a winner the moment Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt were cast, as they single handedly carry the film through with superb chemistry and an impeccable comic timing. It's indeed supremely fun to watch them have fun on screen, playing these characters. David Leitch has a perfect story to direct as a homage to stunt performers and he grabs this opportunity to deliver a solid entertainer. It is not a complicated story neither the screenplay wants to be complex, as it entirely let's the actors charisma to do the trick. It is only in the third act where the film kind of feels dragged but makes up for it with commendable action sequence. Kudos on the cannon rolls which got them the Guinness world record. With Ryan Gosling leading from the front, despite the slight drag, the film barely has a dull moment and one cannot ask more from an action comedy.","1 out of 7 found this helpful."

It follows stuntman Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling), who, at the film's beginning, is seriously injured after a fall gone wrong in an action movie starring Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). Colt had been romancing Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt), a camera operator in the film in which he was injured. The film then picks up 18 months later. Colt's ghosted Jody during his recovery and is working as a valet at a restaurant when Gail Meyer (Hannah Waddingham), a movie producer, tells him that Jody, now a first-time film director, wants him on the set of an action movie she is making in Australia, again starring Tom Ryder.Colt shows up and tentatively interacts with Jody, but the storyline shifts to a missing Tom Ryder and Gail's request that Colt find him. The film then launches into a series of spectacular chases, battles, and stunts as Colt finds himself in the midst of a murder mystery even while he tries to rekindle his relationship with Jody. The stunt coordinator, Dan Tucker (Winston Duke), helps Colt at critical times.""The Fall Guy"" is an OK comedy, even though action movies that rely on a lot of CGI aren't my cup of tea. The chemistry between Gosling and Blunt is good, although all the characters are quite superficial. Gosling fits this kind of role like a glove.

As someone who watched the original TV version of The Fall Guy, I loved the way they put this movie together and brought little bits of the TV show into the movie. There are tons of action, laughs and even some touching moments. The camera work was phenomenal, too bad the academy won't recognize this type of movie. Ryan and Emily have great chemistry together.

Adding fuel to his particular fire is Gosling's reunion w/his currently off again gal, Blunt, who is directing this feature (at the film's onset she was a production coordinator) Down Under where Gosling upon discovering a corpse in a hotel room rightfully finds himself in over his head as the case plays out. An unabashed tribute to stuntmen & directed by one time stunter David Leitch who has parlayed his former career to become a premiere action director (Atomic Blonde/Deadpool 2/Bullet Train) rightfully delivers the goods but does himself no favors by having a gag reel at the film's end showing the audience everything you just watched is fake which other than the very funny rebuilding of a fractious love affair which plays front & center, the explosive ballet on display falls by the wayside.

The ingredients include the requisite love story between the two leads, a fairly obvious murder mystery, a few dollops of comedy here and there, a dash of Hollywood self-appreciation, and huge chunks of full-on action sequences showcasing the talents of stunt persons.All this swirls around in a broth of mostly kitsch C-grade dialogue and equally kitsch directing. At times you think it's deliberate parody, and maybe it is.Ryan Gosling is the lead actor as the irrepressible stuntman, and he plays it in such a laconic fashion that suggests it really isn't meant to be taken seriously. Emily Blunt as always gives her best in fleshing out her character's emotions, yet she does have chemistry with Gosling. Hannah Waddingham hams it up beautifully as the film producer in a role that is diametrically opposite to the good-hearted Rebecca from Ted Lasso.Nevertheless it's an entertaining film which can be forgiven for its failings, mainly because the innumerable action sequences showcasing the role and importance of the stunt performers are visually staggering.

If they do their jobs well you never realize it's them, but they are imperative to making what excites us happen. Nice nod to the original theme song at the end as well. If you're expecting a version of the TV show - it's not going to make you happy.

Can't be this atrocious flick. I used to watch the series back in the 80's. It was a standard action show where cars would be destroyed every episode and rarely anyone got hurt or killed. I knew this would be different because Colt is not a Bounty Hunter like he was in the show but the previews made it look action packed and fun. Yeah well hoodwinked again. After the horrendous experience of stubbornly staying to watch the entire Civil War movie we decided to throw in the towel and leave after 45 excruciating minutes. Speaking of boring Gosling and Blunt are stale and boring alone and with each other. The action scenes ( at least the first half ) are equally boring and unexciting. What a huge letdown. Gosling just meanders around muttering to himself. There is one agonizingly long scene where Blunt is letting Ryan know why she wants nothing to do with him; using the bullhorn in front of everybody. Like every scene before and after it just wasn't funny. Maybe the second half was better though I doubt it. We just saw Hooper again the other day ( which is also about stuntmen doing a movie ) and even though it's dated it's so much better.

The Fall Guy is a movie that plays so well with the themes of Hollywood movie crafting and the tribulations that come with it in a sincere (yet ridiculous) way. Production-wise, the movie accomplishes the task of making a comedy, romance, drama, mystery, and action come together in an amalgamation of unlikely aspects. This Frankenstein-like plot works though, keeping each piece engaging enough and seldom breaking out of the entertaining presentation it's working with. Musical selections were on point, many amazing tracks that sum up the mood and bring those momentous moments to life blared on the speakers alongside the hyperbolic sound effects theaters thrive on. Action scenes are campy and fun, but yet hold the same choreography and feel as the movies they are parodying, helping to tone down the comedic overtones and keep the movie exciting to watch. The comedy itself is a diverse deck of styles for all to enjoy, slapstick moments of ludicrous moves and injuries, catchphrases and running gags that are spaced out and utilized in the plot decently well, and even the dog's utilization had my theater hollering with laugher. What's the secret? It's the fact that they encompass so many tropes, stereotypes, and gimmicks of Hollywood, integrate them into the story, and balance their utilization to help bring all the moments and give an extra kick to the normal styles. Plus, a bonus comes in the form of all the references to movies, shows, and Hollywood dramas they incorporate that will serve as a little game for viewers.All of these aspects are done well with a talented cast of extras and the leading actors/actresses that take much of the center stage. My shout-outs to actors Hannah Waddingham and Winston Duke, who stole the show with their performances and gave eccentric secondary characters that played well with the leads. Taylor-Johnson is solid in this film, and his idiocy plays a staple in this movie that he continues to pull off well, reminding me of his Kick-Ass roles in how he presented the material. Blunt's performance is as stunning as ever with the range of characters she can play. Playing a lovestruck director with a chip on her shoulder, she pulls the pettiness to a favorable role, but then brings that strength and confidence when she is shouting directions and taking charge of the scene. Gosling is the star of the show though, the center of the web to which all branches spring from. His chemistry with Blunt alone is amazing, but the star interacts with everyone and hits that exaggerated emotion to the point of being entertaining, but not straying too far to the annoying level. I loved all his roles sort of emerging in this part, some elements of Ken that then transfer to his Notebook days, but then goes to the intensity of his Drive days. He's like a Swiss army knife, equipped with lots of tools to bring to this hodge-podge film and I liked it.DISLIKES:More Emily Blunt Like At The EndPredictablePerhaps Needed A Few More InterludesA Tad Too Crazy And Long At The Final Action SequenceIt's Focus May Be RestrictiveSummary:
My dislikes will be very nitpicky, but I'm trying to give objective elements that might limit the enjoyment of the audience as a whole. For one thing, Emily Blunt does have adequate screen time, but I felt at parts she needed more use and integration for being one of the top-billed names. The ending makes up for it, and it does work for the story, but I just felt something was missing in her inclusion in the middle section of the movie. The story as well didn't need to be as predictable as it was. Perhaps this was another comedy element that the director was shooting for, but for the mystery element, I'd have liked a little more depth to the mystery as we tried to figure out the secret of the scenario.In terms of presentation, the movie may have needed a few interludes to help calm things down and give a bit more of the romantic teasing we saw earlier in the film. Perhaps more filming of the movie, or maybe another addressing of the past, something to help add a little more to the romantic element in the middle of the movie and strengthen it (giving Blunt more time). In addition, the ending action moments match the insanity of this film, but perhaps veered a tad too off the path. Sure, I was laughing and enjoying the cute little plan to tie everything together, but this was where the action, comedy, and romance moments cracked a bit and became overdone to the point of adding unnecessary bloat. Finally, the very thing I enjoy, the cinematic history, references, and Hollywood elements, may also be restrictive to others who don't know all the referenced material. While this may inspire people to research the references, it may also be an annoying distraction to see such devices executed and detract from the stereotypical action/love formula. Two of my friends made this very comment, so this movie may not be as wide-reaching as you might think.The VERDICT:
The Fall Guy turned out to be much more fun than I was expecting it to be. To combine so many elements into a cohesive movie, I certainly enjoyed the presentation for much of the film, with so many references to a world I've invested much time in and how much fun they had with the material. This movie also gives enough of each element to satisfy most fans, and to do so much in about two hours is a feat that I find impressive given the current state of affairs. Many should enjoy the acting granted by the performances, with the chemistry and cast being a tad inconsistent, but certainly optimizing their time when on screen. Is this film perfect? Not by any means. The story is predictable, the antics get farfetched and there are still some balance issues that need more time to hammer out. Yet, these aside, The Fall Guy is another fun time that is maximized by being at the theater and enjoying the effects in full glory. I suggest this one for many audiences to have a night out to see.My scores:Action/Comedy/Drama/Romance/Mystery: 8.0-8.5
Movie Overall: 8.0.","5 out of 11 found this helpful."

That's fine, but the story is practically nonexistent and even the comedy is pretty hit or miss.One of the highlights of the movie is the interactions Gosling and Blunt, showcasing their fun and witty chemistry. Some of their interactions were the only scenes that managed to get a chuckle out of me, and it always managed to grab back my attention when I started to get bored from the incredibly simple yet ""all over the place"" plot.If you're an action junkie who doesn't care much for story and character, I absolutely recommend the Fall Guy. The visuals and stunts are phenomenal and are obviously a major highlight of the film. It's a fun movie that gives you insight into the underappreciated Hollywood stuntmen. Beyond that, for most casual movie goers this is a movie you maybe watch once and probably won't ever watch again.

The funny moments of the film was a highlight for me, there's some running jokes which even after repetition made me laughVisually the movie also succeeds, audio design is good, acting was good, generally an all-around decent flick with lots of entertainment value. I can also appreciate the fact they showed that Ryan Gosling actually performed some of the stunts himself, kind of reinforcing the idea that he appreciates the stunt-men in the industry, and that was a nice touch.7/10.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

While it is an enjoyable action flick, it didn't do very well at the box office thanks to its obvious flaws and Universal dooming its success by immediately adding to streaming services. And while I am going to recommend this film, I can understand why people weren't interested in watching it.Colt Seavers, played by Ryan Gosling, is an expert stuntman who had left the silver screen after suffering a life threatening accident, and vows to never participate in anything dangerous ever again. It isn't until months later, where he's contacted by Producer Gail Meyer to replace the stuntman of his old friend Jody's movie, return to the spotlight, and return to what made him feel so alive in the past.This leads up to a lot of action, a mystery concerning the missing movie star, some comedy, and a lot of typical tropes you see in action hero films. And while most of them are done well, particularly the fight scenes, the pacing is really sluggish. This film is over two hours long, about the same run time as Die Hard, meaning that if you can't keep your audience consecutively invested, they're going to start to get bored.Die Hard was able to keep its friction going using engaging characters, a tense story, and plenty of fun action scenes. So I never felt the length of the film take a toll on me. The Fall Guy on the other hand, while it has fun moments, it also has a handful of scenes that drag on for way too long.I'm also not a huge fan of Emily Blunt's character Jody as the deuteragonist. Director characters are supposed to carry some kind of weird quirk or mannerism that leads them to making unique directions, both positive and negative. But not only is she a boring character, the movie she's making feels like every science fiction film I've seen in the past. I think I cared more for the fake movie in Home Alone than I did for her flick.Whenever she has a conversation scene with Colt, it usually falls flat because she isn't interesting enough to match up with Ryan's acting. There's a scene about halfway through the film, where he's discussing with Jody about whether or not to add a split screen effect, while throwing in some meta humor, and it almost works.Colt refers to himself as the cowboy, while Jody refers to herself as the alien, while also discussing the romance in the film. And if Jody had a more goofy or energetic personality I would be able to believe their chemistry more. But instead we get a flashback sequence of scenes that didn't actually happen in the main story in order shoehorn it in to the last third. It's not awful, but it's like their topping a sundae with bruised bananas. It's not working the way you want it to go.With that said, the action scenes are still really fun. I like how the writers tackle the cliche of being to easily kidnap strong heroes by drugging them up during drinking scenes, by having Colt instead persevere right as he's about to be carried away. And because he's drugged up he starts seeing explosions and stars all over the place as he tries to get information from the henchmen.I also really like how he uses his connections with the film industry to team up with co stars he's worked with in the past. I love how he catches up with this French dog he's worked in the past in comedy films which then leads up to a fun car chase scene where they instantly team to save a kidnapped coworker. I feel like if there were more scenes like this throughout the movie it would have performed better. Overall I recommend you check this film out, its got some obvious problems, but enough redeeming qualities to make up for the weak points.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

The movie focuses more on a relationship that went sour and an attempt to rekindle the relationship - and it's not cute and sweet or memorable. It doesn't do the romance well - felt awkward.

I don't even care - instant 5 stars as this is easily the most fun I've had at a movie in the longest time. Everyone I saw it with loved it and it just ended up being such a great movie watching experience. Yeah sure, by critical standards this is no masterpiece - but I just don't care because I flat-out enjoyed myself. This movie is insanely fun and I loved, loved, loved it!The Fall Guy is Hollywood action spectacle at its best! It's charming, it's funny, it's romantic, it's atmospheric, it's got dazzling stunts, it's got movie stars being movie stars. This is why god invented Hollywood. To me, the film was firing on all cylinders and delivered everything I could have wanted from it - it really seems like a great crowd-pleaser and has something for everyone - it's so much fun to see with a crowd! The film proudly wears its heart on its sleeve as a tribute to old-school stunt action filmmaking and the men and women who put their bodies and lives on the line for our entertainment. Needless to say, the stunt work is phenomenal and inventive. It's so much fun to watch them play in this playground - and must've been so fun to be a stunt person on this movie! The film has so much respect for stuntpeople and what they do for cinema, and delivers one of the biggest arguments outside of John Wick and Mission: Impossible of why there should be an Oscar category for stunts.The Fall Guy is an excellent example of flawless execution allowing us to let go of small inconsistencies. I love this movie despite its flaws. Sure, it has a predictable, cheesy, somewhat conventional script - but they manage to pull it off so well and in such an entertaining way during the movie that I never found it to be an issue at any point. The film has so much charm, heart, and energy that you just don't care about any minor issues - I found every aspect of the movie to just work perfectly for what it was. It's goofy. It's absurd. It doesn't take itself too seriously and almost has a sort of Tropic Thunder energy to it - it just really feels like they caught lightning in a bottle for this one! I think part of why I love this movie so much is it feels like it came from an earlier time in Hollywood when original stories were embraced - it's a refreshing, low-stakes story that makes it easy to forget about the world for two hours or so. It feels like a throwback to the best of 80s/90s action comedies, frankly, it might be the best action-packed love story since 1994's True Lies!Now, those of you who know me know that my favourite actor is easily Ryan Gosling. And my god has he ever delivered again! Fresh off their Barbenheimer success last summer, Gosling and Emily Blunt have endless chemistry (genuinely... its MAGIC) as former lovers working together on a movie that goes wrong in every way imaginable. They are so damn great together, both have PERFECT comedic timing, and it is their chemistry that truly anchors the movie. Not to mention that Gosling (or, the Gos, as we like to call him) exudes charisma and charm throughout the entire runtime. I'm not sure I've ever seen an actor more likable than Ryan Gosling, and if Barbie wasn't proof enough, you have to see him in The Fall Guy.A rousing, funny, action-packed throwback to the 80s action craze, with all the hallmarks of the best rom-coms. Impeccably paced, super thrilling, and loaded with the best kind of wildly charming star power, The Fall Guy works on every single level. I'm just totally floored by the utter delight I felt watching an extremely well-executed movie designed to celebrate stunt performers - and ALL the unsung heroes in the film industry. It's pure movie magic and the perfect example of why people love going to the movies - to be entertained! Oh, and the use of Taylor Swift's ""All Too Well"" was absolutely brilliant!","8 out of 22 found this helpful."

The characters are written haphazardly, and portrayed even more so - as if they were asked to make it look natural, but it just made it awkward. All the jokes and supposedly comedic situations fall flat because they look and sound awkward, so do the dialogs, so does the plot - so while it looks pretty, it feels just odd.

But he is recalled into action by a producer, who flies him to Australia to fill in in a sci-fi / action / romance movie. It turns out that the star and his stuntman have both disappeared, and the jet-lagged replacement is also tasked with finding them. So besides the on-stage stunts, there are multiple fights, shootings, car and boat chases, etc. There are Knives Out moments where the weapons may have been movie props. There is one irrelevant meta moment, where the director (Emily Blunt) inexplicably discuss with the stuntman the use of split-screen between the human and alien leaders, who are also the romantic leads, which then has the director and stuntman shown in split screen.There is romantic heat between the Gosling and Blunt characters. Apparently they were in love, but after his accident he withdrew from the movie world, and she was hurt that she, too, was excluded. But this takes up a minority of screen time, and I don't think those who come for the romance would welcome that much action, while those who want action could tolerate it. Somehow, it does not balance as well as the Top Gun movies.Gosling earns his place as an action star, but action stars don't win Oscars. Indeed, this movie is a tribute to the stunt men who do the dangerous work in movies, but there is no Oscar category for them.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

But this one is way more than a simple action comedy. Let's start with the fact that our protagonist is a stunt man, the least recognizable person you might see on a movie screen. A point the movie makes repeatedly. A stunt man is a nobody, none knows him he can be replaced in an instant, but still - in this movie he's our protagonist. He tells us the story. So, we've got here a role reversal, but this role reversal is doubled, just as the term ""fall guy"" get's a double meaning here. This double role reversal is repeated a few times during the movie, in case we'll think it was accidental. It's not - that's what the movie is all about.Think about the split screen scene - when the idea of a split screen is being discussed - is it a mere gimmick? Well, see what's happening on this split screen and you'll have your answer. Think about how unreal it all looks, and then think about one of the first sentences said by Jody Moreno - Emily Blunt's character - explaining that she doesn't want it to look real. It's a witty game the movie is playing with us - a game I love playing - it just calls for some extra attention. I could demonstrate this with many more examples, but it will require spoilers - I don't do these.Just a few words about the acting - they're all super. I won't start singling out anybody. Editing, cinematography, pacing, all technical aspects of the movie - I just loved it.","5 out of 12 found this helpful."

His portrayal seamlessly combines the charm of a romantic hero with the intensity of an action star. The film's title, ""The Fall Guy,"" takes on both literal and figurative meanings, cleverly reflecting the protagonist's journey.Emily Blunt, in her role as a director trying to make a comic con movie is actually an ode to hollywood there are lot of easter eggs , there are lot of hollywood references, ranging from Nottingham hill to cowboy and aliens, She shines alongside Gosling. Their chemistry on screen serves as the perfect foil, propelling the movie forward. As the plot unfolds, ""The Fall Guy"" takes an unexpected turn from romance to thriller in its second act. While some moments may feel exaggerated, overall, the film remains palatable and sweet.And let's be honest-who wouldn't want more of Ryan Gosling?","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

It's basically just a romcom... without the com. Not through lack of trying mind you. It tries so hard to be fun and funny, but outside of a couple of sporadic smiles and the occasional light-hearted 'hmph', it just fell completely flat for me.The characters are so sickly sweet and the romance aspect just isn't engaging at all... and that's all you get for the first half of the film. It's well over an hour before the first taste of intrigue enters the picture, and even that sub-story feels predictable and undercooked.This is likely due to the clichéd and contrived screenplay. Writer Drew Pierce (from whom I've enjoyed Mission Impossible Rogue Nation and Hotel Artemis) clearly loves movies and really wants you to know it, trying to take a meta approach and I do like the fact he shines a light on the stunt profession and BTS crew... but it all just feels superficial and shallow. He also loves to name-drop other (better) movies which came across a bit pretentious, and there's even an ongoing gag where one character tests Ryan Gosling's character by working in famous lines from other movies. This could have been fun if they weren't so obvious and overall seemed like a wasted gimmick. This is indicative of how the film plays out as a whole. There also a gimmick using the movie they're making as allegory for their relationship that is excruciating to endure, and the movie itself looks so incredibly trashy that it makes you want to root for its demise. I think it was trying to be satirical, but if so it wasn't carried through to the rest of the picture and just felt out of place.I think it's wildly misdirected by David Leitch, who I typically enjoy, but here he just doesn't succeed in balancing the romance, comedy and action, and the resultant movie has a very weird tone throughout. There are some brief flashes of ok action, but usually felt sluggish and oftentimes a bit cartoony.Overall, there I have very little praise for this movie and consider it a huge misfire, blurring the line between bad and just downright awful.Note: the above review is my personal opinion and is not intended to be reflective or better than your own. For what its worth, I certainly seem to be in the minority on this one.","84 out of 142 found this helpful."

The film can take you back a few decades, has a congruent storyline and stays modern all at the same time. Short delays between action and comedy sequences hold one's interest. The punchlines and comedy are delivered with precision including subtleties that not everyone catches. Cut scenes at the end really help drive the point of the movie home. Took the whole family. Grandma, Grandpa, mom, dad and four boys ages 13-21. No one complained or made a negative comment post credits. Good fun for a couple of hours.

A series I enjoyed a lot when I was young. So when I saw this movie was based on the adventures of Colt Seavers I was curious about it. This time no Lee Majors (just a little appearance in the end credits) but Ryan Gosling as Colt Seavers. Emily Blunt plays the woman Colt has a crush on. Not really a comedy if you ask me, more an action movie with a lot of stunts, go figure, it's an easy watch. I prefer Emily Blunt in more serious roles than as a comedian. The story is sometimes a bit cheesy, not really the best parts of this movie, but the stunts and the fast pace make up for it.

Stuntman turned director David Leitch captures it well and of course this is based on a vintage tv series. The romantic angle anyone can see coming from a mile away, but I'm disappointed the story didn't have more depth, substance beyond a one note mystery, villains.Mega action star Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is filming a movie and his highly skilled personal stuntman Colt Seavers (Gosling) has a thing going with Jody Moreno (Blunt) a camera operator before a stunt goes wrong on set. 18 months later, Colt has left the biz. Depressed, disillusioned he ghosted Jody due to his fall from grace. Big producer Gail (Hannah Waddingham) pulls him out of retirement to be Ryder's stuntman once again except it's really a cover to find the star who's gone missing. Colt only does the movie as he's told Jody - who's now doing her big budget directing debut - wants him involved.I enjoyed quite a few pieces of dialog, some zingers and the music soundtrack utilizing licensed tracks at the right moments (thank you Dolby ATMOS). Gosling has no issue headlining as his easy going charisma, physique chops make it believable. Blunt easily sells someone who's been hurt. Johnson gets kudo for nailing an egotistical movie star with suspect acting credentials, aloof personality but also the charming, good looks package that makes a star.'Fall Guy' is really a love letter to the unsung heroes of the stunt world that directors, producers, stars & audiences alike take for granted. A lot of money has been thrown into the project and you can see it, sense it at all times on the screen alongside the likable big actors. Pity there isn't a lot of heart in the story though. Kinda just going thru the 1-2-3 setup delivering fights, explosions, chase scenes galore in between little character moments, rekindled romance on route to a formula finale. I enjoyed 'Fall Guy' but it's first and foremost action that saves the day.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

Gosling character love the Emily Blunt Character , she is possibly one of the most repulsive smarmy & shallow poseurs given a lead role in any story ever. Why should the audience care?I love action films, and was expecting a lot of brilliant stunts, irrespective if the story was any good or not.Sadly the story isn't just bad it is REPULSIVLEY BAD and the characters aren't just poorly conceived & written , they are REPULSIVEL as well . This film was a painful experience to endure.The stunts are good, but they are are all sort of 'throw away' moments, instead this is foremost an irksome, cloying LOVE STORY between horrible & shallow people who have no 'genuine' friends' , and a lot of emotional psychological ISSUES !''Hey.... they work in the film biz, and everyone is like that don't 'cha know! '' Well, even so, they would certainly have a more tangible social life than anyone here seems to have, and probably not have the same OCD disposition these poor creatures of fantasy have been crippled with.I note a lot of 1 star reviews here (almost all I agree with) couldn't watch past 45 minutes. I lasted 30 minutes. The rest I fast forwarded and stopped here & there, nothing made me want to waste any more time on this.... like several others I had also just watched the non-event CIVIL WAR with similar misgivings.The two stars I gave here are for the stunts and excellent 'lighting' work.Whoever did the lighting did an incredible job, as it is a work of art compared to many 'dim & grubby, chroma tinted' efforts of modern times. Unfortunatley , who and what they were lighting wasn't worth most peoples attention.This film & Civil War were so bad that I didn't even feel inspired to write reviews at first, it just felt like even more time spent on this big distraction & time waste machine called the Media, and Hollywood in particular. Some films are bad and INSPIRING in that their failings are worth considering and discussing. This film just made me want to forget about it as soon as possible.There seems to be a massive crisis in talent at the moment, with almost no notable writers making films, and Directors stuck in a rut of mediocracy, formulaic cliches & desperately lacking ideas.It is obvious that film makers now-a-days don't have anything to say. They are typically born & raised in the industry and have little outside perspective, passion or experience to share... just 'fashions' and the latest virtue signalling issues conveyed as crass propaganda.If relatively new to films, younger than myself etc, then that may be un-noticeable at first, but anyone who's watched many films over many years will certainly have noticed the rapid decline in the medium since around the turn of this century.There are still plenty of great works of older fiction that could be plundered for ideas- yet when they are the arrogant modern writers usually transmogrify them, until they are unrecognisable; or just more of the same tiresome fodder and check-list-tick boxing for modern 'issues'.","10 out of 13 found this helpful."

Oh, Hannah Waddingham did great in her role, but I hope never to see her as a brunette again!Ryan plays comedy so well, The Nice Guys proved this to us but if you have followed him since Crazy, Stupid Love ... you know he can really hold his own as a comedic actor.I can't wait to see this movie on streaming so I can pause and catch all the parts in a few scenes. I honestly just can't wait to watch it again ... absolutely the most fun I've had in a movie for a long, long time. Also, if you're Gen X ... this movie's soundtrack will hit all your pleasure centers.","4 out of 10 found this helpful."

It was incredibly fun! The opening sequence was insane and pulled me right into the middle of it. Ryan and Emily are at their best, honestly. Have you seen their Oscar 2024 presentation or their SNL performance? It's that and more, but with action, love, a touch of torture and ridiculousness all the way through in a good way, with a cherry on top at the end. The whole theater was giggling from beginning to end. I don't remember laughing that much at a movie theater ever.No spoilers: One of my favorite scenes, actually my favorite scene, was when Jody was giving Colt context for his character in her movie. Can I just say that the aliens' acting was superb 😅 The whole thing and everyone in it were great!I think people who didn't like this movie are dead inside, seriously.

Case in point: one of the best films of 2024 is loosely based on a largely forgotten 1980's TV show.Even if you were around in the '80s, there's a solid chance that you never watched an episode of 'The Fall Guy'.No matter. On its own, the film 'The Fall Guy' is an exhilarating joyride - a high-octane action movie for smart people.It succeeds effortlessly as pure entertainment and as a heartfelt homage to the stunt professionals whose work in film goes largely unappreciated.Ryan Gosling, fresh off the global success of 'Barbie', may have launched a new franchise here. He plays Colt Seavers, once the best stuntman in the business but now recovering from a devastating back injury. He's left the business and is now valet parking cars at a Mexican restaurant in LA.Seavers is lured back into stunt work by producer Gail Meyer (Hannah Waddingham in full Dragon Lady mode), who wants to hire him for a big budget shoot in Australia. The job would re-connect Seavers with the girl he let get away (Emily Blunt), who happens to be directing the film.Things on the movie set go awry when the star goes missing. Seavers is tasked with finding the actor and returning him to the set before the studio shuts the project down.That's just the tip of the iceberg. As Seavers unravels the mystery of the star's whereabouts, he is framed for murder - to take the fall, as it were.True to its mission statement, the action sequences of 'The Fall Guy' are state-of-the-art. A turbo-charged chase through the streets of Sidney is as good as it gets.And as thrilling as the set pieces are, the movie has heart and grit. The dialogue is whip-smart and the quieter scenes between Gosling and Blunt resonate. They have obvious chemistry and 'The Fall Guy' has all the best elements of a Rom-Com sprinkled between the action.I have to say that I've seen so many mediocre-to-bad movies this year that 'The Fall Guy' is an inspired breath of fresh air. Even the end credits are entertaining with behind-the-scenes footage of the film's signature stunts.","4 out of 10 found this helpful."

Emily Blunt plays the director of the film-within-a-film, called Metalstorm.The Fall Guy simultaneously depicts and spoofs the making a big-budget action film, with outsized personalities and egos clashing or combining with practical concerns large, small, and absurd. There's a lot a meta humor in how the relationships between the characters, and the relationship of the movie to the audience, are handled. There's lots of fun with props, too! The lighthearted vein of the story is consistent throughout and makes what would be distractions elsewhere part of the fun.The personalities of all the characters are the main propulsion for the story; how the characters react to situations is as interesting as the situations themselves.I've not seen the 1980's tv series staring Lee Majors that this movie was inspired by, and therefore can't speak to many references or easter eggs that might be contained in it; I can say that the film certainly stands on its own.Worth seeing and re-seeing!","4 out of 10 found this helpful."

The movie simultaneously celebrates everything that we love about cinema, while also giving a glimpse into the actual productions.Basically, this is what entertainment is all about. Once we see this movie, we're bound to wonder whether stunt work will ever be an Oscars category; it should be, considering what they have to go through.Anyway, great one.

It wasn't particularly funny, I chuckled about 4 times. It didn't really work as an action movie, because the bulk of the action takes place in the final 20 or so minutes, and the couple of fights and chases which come earlier are separated by long dull scenes of dialog. Sooooooooo much bland dialog. A chase scene which repeatedly cuts to people talking... and not in a funny or meaningful way. A scene where I though ""They're talking about split screen, and this is shown to us in split screen, that's pretty neat""... but the scene kept on going and going without doing anything for the plot. I found myself looking at my watch and thinking ""We're 30 minutes in, and virtually nothing has happened yet"". That turned into an hour. Then 1 hour and 30. OK, now they're finally ramping up things. Yeah.Blunt's is utterly wasted in this film. She could have been replaced by a faceless voice a'la ""Bullet Train"" and it would have made very little difference. Palmer was decent (didn't even recognize her right away), but she had only like 5 minutes of screen time. Taylor-Johnson did an OK job as the arrogant movie star whom Gosling's character doubles, but he was missing for half of the movie, so didn't really make up for the blandness of pretty much everyone else. And that includes Gosling. There were several well placed cameos, but those were too short to elevate the movie in any significant way.As they're both adaptations of 80's TV shows where comedy mixes with action, then it's worth comparing ""The Fall Guy"" to 2010's ""The A-Team"". Yes, that movie is not well regarded, but frankly speaking it was way more entertaining than what I watched in the cinema today. The dialog was way tighter and served a purpose, the romantic interest wasn't just a pretty face, it fully embraced it's ridiculous premise and actually had charismatic main characters. All things which ""Fall Guy"" misses.TL;DR: save your money and wait until the movie reaches streaming services. Then you can watch it while doing chores etc, and have the option to zone out during the many many many boring bits.","54 out of 91 found this helpful."
"8","/10","An awesome ode to the stuntmen","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9770253/?ref_=tt_urv","michvanbeek","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22969565/?ref_=tt_urv","3 May 2024","A new film by director David Leitch is always something to look forward to of of course. With previous films like Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2 and Bullet Train still fresh in memory, only Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw was a reasonable mistake in my opinion, although the film was fairly received anyway. So now there's The Fall Guy starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt. Gosling was recently nominated for an Oscar for his role as Ken in the film Barbie and Blunt we know of course from films like Edge of Tomorrow and Oppenheimer, for which Blunt also received an Oscar nomination but also failed to cash in. The film is also a remake of the 1981 television series The Fall Guy, which ran for five seasons. This film has been in development since 2010 and before Gosling got the role, names such as Tom Cruise, Keanu Reeves, Nicolas Cage, Jason Statham and even Dwayne Johnson have been thought of.The film itself has become a very entertaining film that is a full ode to stunt people. Funny that David Leitch directs the film again, because Leitch himself has been a stuntman in no less than 82 films for years. The film opens with stunt scenes from Leitch's action movies, including scenes from Atomic Blonde. Colt Seavers tells how he is the stuntman of world famous and immensely popular actor Tom Ryder. He is also in love with the then camerawoman Jody Moreno. But if a stunt goes wrong and Colt breaks his back, Colt disappears in the air, until the day Colt is asked by producer Gail Meyer to do the stunts for Metalstorm, where Colt's services were explicitly requested by director Jody Moreno. However, a big problem appears among the recordings and that is that protagonist Tom Ryder has disappeared from the face of the earth and Gail asks Colt to start a search. Then the whole gelazer starts and as a viewer you are thrown into one action scene after another. When Colt is drugged in a luminous suit by a drug dealer and begins to see unicorns, it immediately becomes clear what kind of action we get to see and that is with a lot of humor and heavily exaggerated and that is precisely what makes the film so much fun.The film shouldn't really have the story. Yes it's a fun story, but it doesn't pale of the originality or of the genius plot twists or anything. This is also not important, because the simple story keeps things nice and light and doesn't make things unnecessarily complicated or long-winded, because the pace is really good. One of the very best scenes in the film is the one when Colt goes behind a garbage truck and fights with the cooks people who are always behind him. Under Phil Collins Against All Odds, Colt ends up in a container that drags behind a car and in which he fights while the container is dragged through the streets at high speed. It's impressive to see and it offers top entertainment from the top shelf. Towards the end it becomes clear how the fork is in the stem and we get the grand final, which is shown to the viewer with many explosions and wild chases. For the real film freak, there is also a lot to enjoy, in the sense of the many references that are reviewed in the sense of spoken one-liners from old films.The Fall Guy is a wonderful ode to the stuntmen who have shown us the most bizarre stunts over the years in the movies we watch. With a lot of humor and action, you end up in a roller coaster ride of more than two hours, where you have to tighten the belts of your cinema chair firmly. Many references to other films, humor and a nice story that is of secondary importance, by the way, make this one of those action movies that you don't get to see much. Gosling shows that he is still cut out of the right wood and is really an all-rounder in the acting profession in Hollywood. The role of Emily Blunt is fun, but actually it doesn't represent that much in the film. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who will most likely be the next James Bond, portrays the annoying and above all self-righted actor Tom Ryder in a good way and also shows with this role that the acting profession is perfectly understandable. For the rest, this popcorn entertainment is of the top shelf and the film is definitely a must to watch in the cinema.","3 out of 7 found this helpful."

Beginning as a stuntman, he has now directed some of my favourite action movies, such as JOHN WICK, ATOMIC BLONDE, and BULLET TRAIN. I think his latest one just might be his most fun yet. THE FALL GUY is an action rom-com that is a love letter to the stunt community. They do very dangerous work while most of the time getting no credit. Loosely based on the 80s TV series, this story is about Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling), a stunt double for an action superstar who's a complete diva Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). After an accident sidelines him for some time, Colt is brought back into the world he loves by producer Gail (Hannah Waddingham), who tells him the woman he loves, Jody (Emily Blunt), is making her directorial debut. He goes, only to become part of a mysterious conspiracy. THE FALL GUY is my favourite comedy in years. The writing is hilarious, full of meta humor done right. The chemistry between Ryan and Emily is perfect. The action scenes and stunts are aptly fantastic, as they should be in a movie that focuses on them. They even earned themselves a Guiness World Record for most cannon rolls in a car: 8.5. Gosling has an undeniable charisma that Blunt successfully matches here. Most of the reviews I've read have said it's a little too long, but I had so much fun here I didn't care how long it was. This is the definition of a popcorn movie, and I highly recommend seeing this with everybody you can, and their families. Pure fun!","3 out of 7 found this helpful."

For the rest of the two hours, it gets sillier and more over the top and I ate up every second.Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are so cute together. Their on screen chemistry is undeniable. And Ryan is absolutely jacked as the super athletic stunt man, adding plausibility to some of the more physical stunts.The film continues exploring their relationship, and the truth behind what was happening, by stringing together stunt after stunt. You can truly feel the love that the movie shows for all of those people that make action films so exciting. So many explosions!

A year after an on-set prang Hollywood stuntman Ryan Gosling (great) is flown to Sydney by producer Hannah Waddington to work on his ex-gf director Emily Blunt's new epic... and to investigate star Aaron Taylor-Johnson's disappearance. While superficially light, writer Drew Pearce sharply blends the worlds in front of & behind camera - it's Hollywood's fun take on Hollywood, and is superb - all richly directed (esp the stunts) by David Leitch. Cameos from Jason Momoa, Teresa Palmer, Lee Majors etc add polish, and though too long (2hrs 6min) it's still tremendous entertainment. Boom!","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

How many audience members, for this demographic, would make that link. I was 6 when the Bionic Man was on tv?Too try hard which was a shame :)","18 out of 27 found this helpful."

It didn't make the mistake of tryibg to be too serious. Gosling and Blount had a great chemistry and did an outstanding job.A real look behind the scenes at the thankless life of stuntmen, and a very pointed message to the Academy.

"9","/10","Very Disappointed This Didn't Go Over Bigger, My Favourite Movie of 2024 So Far","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9820208/?ref_=tt_urv","CANpatbuck3664","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur63857399/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2024","As much as the premise is intriguing by shining a light on some of the less glamorous aspects of movie-making, if they didn't cast the right people, The Fall Guy would have been stuck in neutral. I watched Ryan Gosling in this movie and was wholly flabbergasted. He's a powerhouse of a dramatic actor but he's also RIDICULOUSLY funny. I trumpeted this after The Nice Guys and I feel like the rest of the world caught on after Barbie but he's a riot. He's also versatile in doing it, he can actually pull of slapstick gags with aplomb in a way that reminds me of Jim Carrey. It's not fair that he's that handsome and also that funny. Emily Blunt was also a treat, she's funny in her own right, she's sweet and vulnerable when she needs to be and it never felt like she was trying to pander to this lighter fare. She's a great actress period and I liked her chemistry with Gosling. I also want to mention that Hannah Waddingham as sleazy producer Gail Meyer. She stole every scene she was in, if you were wondering if the acclaim she's been getting from Ted Lasso was a fluke, this should make you reconsider. I've never been the biggest Aaron Taylor-Johnson fan but he does a great job of playing a jerk as movie star Tom Ryder. I'd also give a thumbs-up to Teresa Palmer in her brief role as Tom's co-star Iggy Starr. She's playing into the tongue-in-cheek selfish attitude of the actors & actresses in Metalstorm and I got a few laughs from her.The Fall Guy has each of its respective feet in a different genre, let's start with the action. The film is directed by David Leitch, former stuntman and co-director of the early John Wick films and the director of Bullet Train and Deadpool 2. Leitch knows how to shoot action and the more bombastic moments in the film walk a fine line between being thrilling but not too crazy. Colt Seavers crashes cars, fights criminals and gets lit on fire but it all looks great. I was dipping and dodging in my seat, the action wasn't revolutionary in how it was portrayed but it was well captured and balanced being fun along with raising the stakes. My favourite was Colt's car chase with Jean Claude in tow but the hallucinogen fight in the club would be a close second.I'm also happy to report that The Fall Guy had me laughing throughout. The movie also weaves it into scenes organically, The Fall Guy also features a sweet love story between Colt and Jody but it never got too sappy or saccharine because I never stopped chuckling. Gosling's got serious chops but Blunt & the rest of the cast are more than game and I hadn't seen a movie of this type that worked so effortlessly that hadn't been a superhero tentpole in what seems like forever.My complaints for The Fall Guy are mostly minor and they barely affected my grade on the movie. I did think that while the ending set-piece was plenty fun and exciting, it also did run on long and it could have been a little tighter. The Fall Guy also barely avoids being too silly, the reveal of the antagonist and their villainous plan wasn't badly done or sloppily put together but it doesn't always seem plausible and the script was smart enough not to linger on it too long so you have time to ask questions.The Fall Guy is kind of a throwback, I'd even call it an old-fashioned crowd pleaser. There's something here for almost everyone and I'd recommend it across the board. It's not perfect but it's so good at what it does and it's too bad we likely won't get a sequel because of the box office performance. It may be out of theatres not but if you're intrigued and haven't got a chance to check it out, it's worth the trip to the theatre.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

Seriously this is the movie of the year so far hands down.Blunt and Gosling have incredible screen chemistry. They work so well together and this is the most animated I've ever seen Gosling. I truly believe their on screen love affair and I was 100% invested in them. They are individually so funny too. Sometimes the humour is hidden and you have to do a mental double take to let it ripen. I was chuckling my way through it all the time.And yet despite the humour, I was sitting tensed up during some of the scenes as the action was so fast, violent and realistic. Emily Blunt fights like an MMA master!The story is so simple and yet the film is a smoked cigarette longer than 2 hours. But it never felt like too long as the story is paced well and there's always something happening. It's also one of those films where not one member of the cast lets it down. Everyone plays their part perfectly and each character is brought to life perfectly.The effects are amazing and during the end credits there is an outtake roll playing showing some of the real stunts from the film.This film packed a punch for me and if you like MI:, or Bond, you are going to love this film. I scored it a solid 8, right up there with the best of them in my opinion.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

But while it would be an overstatement to say this is a romantic comedy with some action thrown in, it wouldn't be off by all that much.The movie is about a stuntman whose back, career, and romance, are all broken in one moment. Then he's asked to return to work on his lost love's big sci-fi epic.For the first half hour the movie is almost entirely a romantic comedy with a background of behind-the-scenes filmmaking, as the two leads, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, banter in amusing but heartfelt ways. The chemistry of these two is terrific, and you're pulling them from the start.When we start getting action, it's imaginative (especially that striking fight in the club), funny, and still tied very much to the romance. No matter how much is going on, the movie always makes sure to tie back to its love story.The second half of the movie is more pure comedy action, with most of the actual story crammed in, although even then it never lets the romance out of its sight.The movie is very funny and very charming. The action sequences are lively and fun. The cast is terrific. The behind-the-scenes stuff feels authentic (director David Leitch used to do stunts).I was a little torn between giving this movie an 8 or a 9. I feel like if I take a step back then objectively it's not *really* a 9, but it was just so much freaking fun that I can't help myself.Highly recommended.","3 out of 9 found this helpful."

From its head-scratching quotes and title play to the unexpected plot twists, this film is a rollercoaster of entertainment. And don't get me started on the behind-the-scenes-exploring the intricate world of movie-making, where the magic of doubles, angles, pyro, and action scenes unfolds.But that's just the beginning. As a film enthusiast, I was captivated by the flow and display of behind the scenes of this film. Ryan Gosling's character, Colt, embodies this mix of vulnerability and resilience-taking beatings like a champ while navigating the complexities of romance and regret.One of my favorite scenes was him singing to Taylor Swift in the car because he knew he messed up and got caught by his former love, awkward, I know, but hilarious for me as a viewer. I've been there before.The movie truly has it all-action-packed sequences, top-notch cinematography, and a seamless thematic flow. It's a blend of tension, romance, and laugh-out-loud humor that keeps you hooked. And those memorable quotes? They hit hard, especially when Colt confesses to Jody (Emily Blount),'None of it ever hurt as much as not being with you.' Referring to Colt's stunts hurting him but not as much as losing the love of his life.In a nutshell, 'Fall Guy' is a must-watch that showcases Ryan Gosling's versatile acting prowess, placing him in a league akin to Ryan Reynolds.

But boy, what a misfire. I haven't seen anything this badly put together and clunky in forever, so here's what's wrongThe dialogue is awful. It feels like two people who aren't naturally gifted at ad-libbing have been asked to ad-lib. It's about as inane and facile as you might fear, and it just keeps going ... on and on and on. This film is already long for a rom-com, and it really feels every minute of it because the dialogue is utter torture. Both Gosling and Blunt seem oddly unemotional and disconnected from everything, as if they can't wait for the whole thing to be over, which brings me to..The chemistry between Blunt and Gosling is non-existent. It's almost as if they detest each other - the best scene between them is when they're talking on the phone - and when they're together I can barely remember them wanting to be near each other. Nada. Nothing.The stunts. I love stunts - I grew up watching Steve McQueen hop barbed wire on a motor bike and scoot around San Fran in a Mustang, the French Connection car chase, James Bond barrel rolling a car over a river, Burt Reynolds romancing Sally Field with a Trans Am - and always thought there should be an Oscar for them (there still should). But there's no stunt here that hasn't been photographed better in other films, which brings me to...The direction. Leitch may be a terrific stunt guy, but as a director he sucks the life out of scene to the point where there's a ho hum quality to the whole thing. But those rolls, you say - so what? There's no sense of threat or thrill, and again. Any one of the numerous car flips in Fury Road easily surpasses this particular stunt in terms of visual flair. The pace is leaden throughout, it trudges through pages and pages and pages of stiff exposition and mind-numbingly witless banter, interspersed with fight scenes that feel rote and an overall sense that the director didn't know what kind of film he wanted to make.5 of us, of varying ages from 20s-60s, went to see it and while I was the harshest critic of it, the most any of us gave it was a generous 5.There's a much better film about stuntmen called The Stunt Man, an 80s flick with Peter O'Toole, or even Hooper with Burt Reynolds.But yeah, there definitely should be Oscars for Stunt people because they invariably make some of the strongest and long-lasting moments that films have to offer. Just not in this case.Lastly. Our iMax screening was preceded by the longest trailer I've ever witnessed for a film: Furiosa. If you've ever thought you've seen a trailer that gave too much away about a film, you ain't seen nothing yet. I've never seen a trailer than came in parts, literally with intertitle parts and names (all that was missing was an intermission). Overall feeling, besides the sense that I've just seen the entire movie, is that this looks like a massive dud and there's a desperate air of being battered over the head with shiny visuals demanding I go see it. That and ATJ, an otherwise fab actor, looks horribly miscast. Nope.","24 out of 40 found this helpful."

It's an action / comedy. Because of Hollywood's ""Rule of Cool"", if it's cool enough, a few plot holes are allowed.2. There's a real story. There's heartache, there's love.3. It's a love letter to stunt people, and the audience gets to join in.Towards the end of the film, #1 and #2 are completed. That's when the plot gets silly, because we're still wrapping up #3.The purpose of the last 20 minutes isn't the love story. It's ""hey, everyone, let's make a movie!"" It's straight up a celebration of filmmaking. It's joyous. It continues straight through the film's conclusion to the credits with outtakes.Anyone criticizing the film for plot holes just doesn't understand its actual purpose.Actually, The Fall Guy is genius. It's somehow both a well-written, thoughtful movie, but also a powerful action flick. It doesn't take itself seriously but is also very moving. It's a tribute to stunt people and can be appreciated culturally the same way that other films bring you into other cultures and peoples.It is similar in its joyousness but a far, far better film than Drop Zone (1994) with Wesley Snipes, which celebrates skydivers.What a wild ride, and a great homage to the original The Fall Guy, which started Lee Majors, whom you may know better as TV's The Six Million Dollar Man.When I was a kid, my father let me stay up ""late"" (8pm) to watch Lee Majors. It was so thrilling to be up past my bedtime and sharing an adventure that just washed away all my little kid troubles.The new film did the same for all my adult troubles. Just go see it and let yourself experience joy in a way that (as a planet) we've had rarely in the last few years with covid and politics and war.To me it's the first film since Top Gun: Maverick that I've wanted to see more than once. It's a party. It's a celebration. It's got world record setting stunts. Stop complaining. Go see this film and join in!","3 out of 9 found this helpful."

Together, they made the screen explode.The ensemble cast was excellent as well. Winsten Duke, Arron Taylor as Tom Ryder (was that a poke at Tom Cruise just a little bit?) and the woman from Ted Lasso. It was a funny movie.It did not feel like a romantic comedy more than anything as the movie focus on the relationship of Colt and Jodi with everything feeling secondary to that. In fairness that could just prove how amazing Gossling and Blunt are together.I also felt that considering this is a movie adaption about a TV show about a stuntman I honestly thought i would get bigger, better stunts.

The problem is, it's all a facade. David: if you're going to make a movie that puts the focus on stunts and stunt performers, why have a cast of obnoxious characters doing improv for over an hour of the movie's runtime? Why did you introduce the movie instead of having the stunt performers do it for once? Why did you not call out each stunt performer by name in the credits, showing which stunts they did and actually show them up close for once? Instead you gave us a clip reel of BTS footage of the movie's stunts that barely even shows the performers' faces (set to a terrible Blake Shelton song that I'm sure he made more money off of than all the stunt performers' pay combined).This movie spits in the face of the stunt performers who risked their lives to bring the movie to life by not building an interesting movie around the action, and by only acknowledging stunt performers in a very shallow way.

Music selection is kind of OK, but nothing special. Mr. Gosling and Ms. Blunt lack mutual chemistry (although they're very good in their respective roles). Ms. Waddingham is an excellent hyperactive neurotic psycho, maybe a bit overdone here and there. Same goes for Mr. Taylor-Johnson. Cameos (wait until the end, if you have patience) are a nice touch but can't save lack of a proper writing and dialogue. The movie as a whole looks far-fetched and pretty chaotic.

Will definitely see it a few more times in the theatre and add it to my personal collection once it's available.","2 out of 6 found this helpful."

This movie is exactly what we need more of. It's not perfect, and it doesn't need to be. It's just a lot of fun and a great excuse to get out and go to the movies. It was exactly what I'd hoped it would be.Ryan Gosling is great, Emily Blunt was great. Solid acting all round, movie looks great, I really can't complain. I saw Bullet Train as well which is from the same director, but honestly that was a much weaker movie. This movie is much funnier, and the script is a lot tighter. Sometimes it's cheesy, and it knows it's being cheesy, and that's totally okay cause you're having fun.See it in theaters while you can!","2 out of 6 found this helpful."

The Fall Guy film adaptation was a really great film. It's great to see a old school TV show like the original series get the film treatment like other shows like Dukes of Hazzard and A Team, but this is easily the best of them all. Directed by a Hollywood stuntman, this film tells a great story of Colt Seavers after a stunt accident being called back into action, only to get in a big pickle involving the film in productions star and a murder case put upon him. Mayhem ensues and comes great action, comedy, with a well done romantic subplot between Seavers and his girlfriend Jody, the director of the movie they're making in the film. The stunts in thf film were amazing and I loved the references of the original show such as the classic GMC truck, the new version, and the song ""Unknown Stuntman"" playing during the credits. There were a few references to other classic action shows and films such as Fast & Furious, as well as an Easter egg to Smokey and the Bandit. Stunts Unlimited also knocked this out of the park with their logos on some of the stunt equipment, which founder, stuntman-turned director Hal Needham would have loved this film. This film was an absolute blast and I thank Universal Studios, the filmmakers, the actors, crew and especially the stunt crew for bringing a very well done tribute to the big screen. It just goes to show that Hollywood can still make a great and entertaining film and I hope more action stunt films will be made in the future. 10/10.","2 out of 6 found this helpful."

That says it all.Seriously now, how can you go wrong with Ryan Gosling and Emma Blunt's first collaboration in a story about a lowly stuntman who goes through several very intense days in order to achieve his ultimate goal: a coffee?Even more serious now: this film celebrates the lowly stuntman by putting one in front of the camera: Ryan Gosling! Never really appreciated because of famous people like Aaron Taylor-Johnson taking all the spotlight.OK, for real now, it's an entertaining movie, set in the world of movie making, focusing on a stuntman, a little bit of romantic tension and love interest going on, a mystery, a lot of action, some comedy, a lot of meta nods to the film industry and references and the like. A little bit of everything, but made with a lot of taste and the little foreshadowing followed by the reveal done in a way that shows someone thought the scenario through before starting to make the movie. I really appreciated that.But it's not ideal. The film is overly long, I imagine a lot of people skipping it because it's two hours long and they have an hour and a half time budget. Also it didn't need to be that long, the last act is really dragging and it also feels like people weren't that much into it. Emily Blunt is not as ravishing as before and I didn't really feel she was enjoying the production that much. I know it's harsh to start criticizing women just over 40 for not looking rugged and handsome like their male counterpart, but it was also the attitude. Perhaps she was upset for getting so little screentime.It was fun, the credits scenes show actual stuntmen doing the stunts that Gosling's character was supposed to do, so at one time there is a scene with three people who look almost identical and are dressed the same. The very last scene was fun, too. I wonder if actors are just as disdained in real life on set like implied by this movie. That would kind of suck for everybody. I hope it's not that bad.Bottom line: Ryan Gosling really inhabited the role very well and infused the film with a lot of charm. Without him, this would have been an average situational comedy. But I see how it would be a great start for the blockbuster season.","2 out of 6 found this helpful."

This film works as a tribute to stunt people that make action films exciting, while also being a fun action movie like we used to get in the late 80s/early 90s, with plenty of it's own excellent stunts. It's directed by Leitch, who has already proven himself with 'Deadpool 2', 'John Wick' and 'Bullet Train'. In the film, the director is Jody (Blunt) who has a relationship with the stunt guy Colt (Gosling). Colt is the stunt man for up-and-coming actor Tom Ryder (Taylor-Johnson), perhaps a parallel of Gosling 15 years ago. Something goes wrong, and Colt ends up trying to find where Tom's gone, while attempting to fix his relationship with Jody.Good support cast - stunt coordinator Dan (Duke), Tom's agent Gail (Waddingham) - and nice to see Sydney looking great as a location, even if you know the route they take on the garbage truck chase isn't possible. I wonder if that's what LA/Atlanta locals always feel watching films set there? Also fun to see some part of the fictional film they're making - 'Metal Storm' which has nods to 'Mad Max' and Dune' - at the end. The storyline is paced quite well, there's plenty of laughs and a nice ending.Both Blunt and Gosling are great leads and have lots of nice moments and plenty of screentime. However, the film never gets too serious or dramatic and makes sure it pays adequate homage to the stunt teams of Hollywood by having an excellent car chase, good fight scenes, exciting boar chase, superb beach-based car rollover and a great final 15min which have about 20 stunts crammed in, including a crazy car jump. The bar's been raised for the next 'Mission: Impossible'!","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

With Howie replaced by the excellent as always Winston Duke as Dan.The stars here as you would expect are the stuntmen and it is a feast of practical, record breaking crashes, flames, bangs and jumps not just for effect but baked into the story and arcs of the characters. It really is a love letter to these performers by former comrade David Leitch and Gosling, Blunt, Duke, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and even Hannah Waddingham get in the spirit.Whether this made enough to get a sequel is doubtful but it seems the sort of catnip that Netflix or Amazon would love albeit expensive, it is also the kind of project Gosling and Blunt would likely come back for with things easily set up now for Colt to do his Private Detective/Bail Bondsman thing with Dan as his new gig while they still working the stunt crew for Jodie.I hope this does massive on VOD because it deserves to be a bigger hit than it has been.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

What the trailer depicts and what you see appear to be two different things, but that may have changed since its release. I loved the whole behind-the-scenes feel of the movie within a movie. Don't let the two hour runtime scare you as the film has 90% good pacing. It has an energy I wasn't fully expecting especially with Ryan Gosling. Luckily this wasn't some sappy love story, but a comedy action film that entertains and makes you laugh.While I feel all Gosling-ed out he's still relatively enjoyable in this film. I wasn't as impressed with his performance as I was with Emily Blunt's. Emily was enjoyable and brought great energy to her role. Together they were funny and had great chemistry together. It took me slightly too long to realize Hannah Weddingham was in the film, but she was hilarious and a good addition to the cast.The film is action packed and pays a decent tribute to the stunt community. It brings a small perspective to small community you might not think of otherwise. It plays well on the life of a stuntman minus the whole sa.... Never mind, that might be a spoiler. Anyways, I loved the behind-the-scenes and seeing how a shot is done. This isn't a spoiler, stay tuned for the credits as it shows behind-the-scenes shots of stunts done in the film.Overall, this is a film I would watch again especially in theatres if it wasn't so expensive. While it can feel a little long at times the two hour runtime isn't bad. The acting is good, but the cinematography is amazing. Solid songs make up the score, and the references to other movies are a hoot, if you get them. Highly recommend checking this one out in theatres if you can make it happen.That's it for now.

Emily Blunt is equally great as the up-and-coming film director whose botched romance with Gosling's stuntman is the only stumbling block in their working relationship. In this goofy adventure, they chance to re-unite in a filmmakling endeavor that is her major project and his shot at a career comeback.In an era of Hollywood walking a delicate tightrope of adherence to feminist values, this film feels like a nostalgic breath of fresh air. Gosling's protagonist is the perfect everyman who also happens to be nimble and adaptive enough to navigate the ambush of danger once his assignment gets him in the crosshairs of some sketchy criminals. Through all the plot's twist and turns, Gosling takes it all in stride like a veteran stuntman would. Aaron Talyor-Johnson is ideal as a loutish A-list icon who regards filmmaking crew members as nothing more than rented mules.Very important: Be sure to watch this the whole way through the credits. Don't leave while any credits are still rolling. That way, you'll catch the film's postscript that almost everyone else will miss because they'll already be heading home. Highly recommended to all viewers, bar none.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

It's based on a TV series with the same name that i haven't watched but i've heared that the movie and the series are pretty diffrent in terms of story. In this movie, the story is really fun and entertaining but since there are some quotes and film terms throwned around, for some people, it might feel convoluted. I don't know everything of course but i wasn't lost like some people told me they were.The director - David Leitch was a stuntman himslef before becoming a director so he is the perfect choice. His direction was pretty good. Everything was looking good and the action scenes were also very good, which was expected, knowing that he has worked as a stuntman.Now - the actors, like expected, they were incredible. I don't think that that's a shocker to anyone, considering that the main actors are Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt. Also the chemistry between them is also incredible.So, the music was also good. Nothing in particular made me want to listen to it over and over again but there wasn't anything bad.Now, the best for last - the production design and stunts. That is really what glues the movie together. It was just incredible. Altough, you can see some visible VFX, the practiacal stunts thrown in here outwave that.""The fall guy"" is just incredible.

The chemistry between Blunt and Gosling was genuine and palpable. Nothing new or original in the plot, but the story was fun and the action was compelling. The dialogue was a bit hard to follow on occasion, but that may have been a function of the volume more than the accents.

One aspect that stood out to me was the exceptional writing. The script is filled with scenes where names and words have meaningful, relatable connections to the plot and characters, creating a tapestry of subtle hints and foreshadowing. As the story unfolds, these connections become increasingly apparent, culminating in an ending where everything makes perfect sense. This thoughtful approach to writing adds depth to the film, making it not just entertaining but also highly satisfying as all the narrative threads come together seamlessly.Maybe 10, 15 years ago I would have give it a 7 or 8, but in this generation that movies are becoming blah with non-sense stories and boring plots this is a gem.","2 out of 7 found this helpful."

And now, fresh off an accident that nearly ended his career, this working-class hero has to track down a missing movie star, solve a conspiracy, and try to win back the love of his life while still doing his thing. Daily work. What could go well?When entertainment falls into good hands, we may be completely surprised, as is what happens with this wonderful film that turns out to be The Fall Guy. The good hands are those of a director who knows what he wants and what he does like David Leitch and having two stars of the moment such as Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt as kings of the show, from there everything that comes already means a additional plus.Drew Pearce's simple, but fun script takes flight once all the action begins and we realize that we are having a wonderful time in front of the screen where we are receiving an action romantic comedy that at its heart offers a love letter to one of the most beautiful professions in cinema, such as action stuntmen. That mixture works in all its aspects and is what one can value the most about the result achieved by Leitch and company, since they never lose the intention of giving us a blockbuster of those that we all look for, but without leaving aside their own blood that they have harvested. In the life.It is pure entertainment, made with love, passion and mastery, which in turn is presented by artists who care about their work and want the viewer to be happy. They manage to give us an authentic visual and comedy show in equal parts where they know how to take advantage of the charisma of their protagonists and the incredible chemistry they transmit. But if we have one to highlight specifically, it is Ryan Gosling, who makes his comic side more and more necessary in our lives with which you enjoy every interaction and every dialogue he delivers with all that angel and which he has taken to its maximum. Splendor.Leitch's experience and appreciation for stunts adds an endearing layer to our enjoyment of all the action on screen, the cleverness with which he takes us behind the scenes of the film within the film is what makes you value all of it. That ode to his beginnings in the industry and his own tribute to his specialists. The director's most authentic and honest look at a profession that made him shine, but that also helps him again with spectacular scenes and really fun sequences, where the director makes some changes to his previous works, but allows himself to be more mature to give the balance between spectacle and mechanics. He teaches the audience to appreciate the number of people it takes to pull off a car accident or a human torch stunt.And by the way, the director also uses his ability to give us a romantic comedy with all the possible clichés, but they are handled correctly, which makes us be in the presence of one of the great romantic comedies of the year and that is what it is. An absolute surprise.It is a film that will surely be one of the highest grossing films of the year and also, with its own merits, one of the great films that 2024 left us with. It is a real pleasure to enjoy it, love it and appreciate it, it is a film that fulfills everything it promises and also with giving you the best 126 minutes in front of the screen.I am left with very pleasant sensations where I find an exciting spectacle of gigantic proportions and although it is not Leitch's best film, it is probably his warmest, most sincere and endearing film where the director dedicates himself to the industry and the viewer of a once and for all.","2 out of 8 found this helpful."

It's not.It seems just like the people writing, and making this movie just didn't care about the story, the characters or the viewer.

Overall, a fun watch that blends action and comedy very well as David Leitch creates a love letter to his careers as a stuntman and a filmmaker, with polished technicals, hilarious humor, and memorable performances from Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt bringing everything together.Direction: Good
The direction on a macroscale is well executed as the action sequences and stunts are very well choreographed and feel very personal to the direction (a former stuntman); the direction on a microscale is good as the interpersonal sequences bring out the humor and romance in the movie; direction of actors is good as it just felt like everyone had fun making this movie; storytelling is pretty similar to other action-comedies (with some 80s flavors); builds tension wellStory: Pretty Good
The concept is good as it is an action-comedy that is an homage to stuntmen, filmmaking, and the 80s; the plot structure follows the action-comedy template; the character writing is decent as it is pretty formulaic (but I did like how they gave more personality to the forgotten stuntmen)Screenplay: Good
The dialogue is incredibly funny as it uses self-referential, dumb humor to make this movie a well-executed over-the-top comedy; the movie does a good job at incorporating meaningful romantic dialogue (even though it is a bit cliche); the foreshadowing is used very well to help tell the story (especially in the final hour)Acting: Good
Ryan Gosling: Good to Very Good (He shows that he is the master of over-the-top comedy as his charisma and timing is just perfect; his energy is infectious as he really brings out the best in everyone, and he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt)
Emily Blunt: Good to Very Good (Commands every scene she is in and has an aura that is infectious; has very good comedic timing and great chemistry with Ryan Gosling)
Aaron Taylor-Johnson: Good (Does a good job at playing the out-of-touch, empty-headed action star)
Hannah Waddingham: Good (Has a lot of charisma and works well off of Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling)
Stephanie Hsu: Pretty Good (Barely in the movie but plays her part well)
Winston Duke: Pretty Good (Plays his part well and has good chemistry with Ryan Gosling)
Rest of the cast: Pretty Good (Action-comedy templated characters that are performed well)Score: Decent
Helps with establishing the tone and providing flavor to the action sequencesSoundtrack: Good
Makes up for the score as it helps give the movie an 80s vibe and set the tone of the sequencesCinematography: Very Good
Polished and helps create very well executed action sequences; given that Emily Blunt's character is a former camera operation, it is only fitting the cinematography creates synergy with the stunt/action choreographyEditing: Good
Very polishedSound: Good
Helps bring out the action-sequencesVisual Effects: Good
Enjoyed how they favored practical effects over CGI, even making the CGI in the fake movie look amateurish, but I think the CGI they used was fine in the actual sequencesProduction Design: Pretty Good
Enjoyed how they used Sydney and the sandy film set (the year of Sand is officially upon us)Makeup: Pretty Good
Helps show the grit and grime stuntmen have to endureCostumes: Pretty Good
Helps bring out the characters, and I enjoyed how complicated they made the alien suitsPacing
Pacing is good as it is fast in the action scenes and slow in the interpersonal and comedic scenesClimax
Climax is executed very well as you see grand, well-executed action sequences that show the strengths of stunt-choreography, practical visual effects, and polished cinematography (with comedy acting as a glue to bring this all together)Tone
Tone is very similar to other over-the-top action-comedies (but pays homage to 80s action movies)Final Notes
This movie was so much fun to watch (its movies like these where you are happy to go to the theaters); this is the perfect movie post-Barbenheimer because this was Kentty (Ken + Kitty); this movie is 'we are back' personified.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

In 1980, Steve McQueen had an unexpected hit with THE HUNTER - the story of modern day bounty hunter. The following meeting happened (probably) at a studio nearby around that time:STUDIO HEAD: We just signed The SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN, Lee Majors to a TV Deal, what kind of show can we put him in?Executive 1: How about a show about a Stunt Man like in Hooper?Executive 2: How about a show about a modern day Bounty Hunter like in THE HUNTER.Executive 3 (Michael): What if we put him in a show about a guy who is a Stunt Man by Day and a Bounty Hunter by Night?STUDIO HEAD: Michael...you're a genius.And that, presumably, is how the TV Series THE FALL GUY was born.Now fast forward to 2023:STUDIO HEAD: What have we got?Executive 1: We just signed Ryan Gosling to a movie dealExecutive 2: We just signed Emily Blunt to a movie deal.Executive 3 (Michael - still at the studio after all these years): Why don't we put them both in a film based on THE FALL GUY TV Series from the 1980's?STUDIO HEAD: Michael...you're a genius.And that (probably) is how we got the the action/comedy/romance THE FALL GUY.The studio also ran into some luck as Gosling (Barbie) and Blunt (Oppenheimer) are BOTH coming off Academy Award nominations after the Summer of 2023 was named the summer of ""Barbenheimer"".Gosling, as one would expect, is charming as stunt-man Colt Seavers who is brought back to a movie set (after an accident has sidelined him) to once again be the Stunt-Man for Action Star Tom Ryder (a very good Aaron Taylor-Johnson). Only problem is that the Director of this film is his former girlfriend Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt) and there's a pushy Producer, Gail Meyer (Hannah Wadingham - Ted Lasso) and a sinister sub-plot that gets Seavers and some of his stunt buddies (like Seavers' stunt-coordinator buddy Dan Tucker - Winston Duke (US)) involved in.All to say that the plot is as thin as ice on a warm afternoon, but serves it purpose to move this film from one stunt to another as THE FALL GUY is nothing more than a bouquet of love thrown to the most unheralded of all people on an action movie set - the Stunt Men and Women.And...thanks to strong direction by David Leitch (the criminally under-rated BULLET TRAIN), THE STUNT MAN is the family, friendly, PG-13, Action/Comedy/Romance that we did not know we needed...but we do.Gosling sets the tone and is a fine center of this film while Duke, Taylor-Johnson and Waddingham all valiantly support the thin plot as it hops from stunt to stunt. Others in the cast like Stephanie Hsu (EVERYTHING, EVERYWHERE, ALL AT ONCE) and Model Teresa Palmer show up, briefly to move things along.And...one might add...so does Blunt. The biggest complaint for this film is that it does not give Blunt (who has proven she can do action films when she was in LIVE, DIE REPEAT...or, I mean...EDGE OF TOMORROW) much to do besides being the love interest who is unaware that Seavers is dealing with a sinister sub-plot because she is so focused on her film.Now...to be fair...that's the tension that moves the story along and gives Director Leitsch plenty of room to deliver fast-paced ""put down"" dialogue between Blunt and Gosling - and both bring their ""A"" game to this. They are equals here...and their chemistry jumps off the screen.It's doubtful that Blunt or Gosling will be Oscar Nominated for this film, but it is this pairing...and the stunts...that makes THE FALL GUY worth seeing.And further cements Executive #3 (Michael) as a Genius.Letter Grade B+7 1/2 (out of 10) Stars - did I mention that the plot is paper-thin?And...you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

I think the callbacks and repetitions of old jokes are very similar, in the vein that sometimes they made the entire theater laugh, and the other time it was one guy cackling to himself.Despite those small criticisms, I think the rest of this movie was great. The story is a bit simple, but that is what you're going to get from a movie that focuses on its action shots, which, by the way, are very entertaining. Ryan Gosling fits this role very well, the character was built for him, and uses his natural charm very well, along with his great comedic timing.I was surprised about the amount of profanity in this movie, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just surprised me. I like the take on pushing the PG-13 rating, just because I think there should be more mature movies being made, but not ones that would warrant an R rating.All and all a good movie and I think it's a great sign of what's to come this summer.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

It's a mystery that has no questions to ask.The fall guy claims to be a romantic action comedy love letter to stuntman. It even has Ryan Gosling and the Director reiterating this point before the film.It's a thin plot with an overlong run time. The second d half is exceptionally dull. Even with amazing stunts, the movie drags . We had 7 people in the theater. Two left at the 40 minute mark. They were bored and made fun of the movie. My wife fell asleep. My niece didn't laugh once. Was bored. In the end, we all agreed it was a waste of time.Ryan Gosling comes off as a dope who can't be hurt. Emily Blunt has about 4 scenes and the karaoke is pretty bad. The bad guy is Gail.It's a dumb movie that people seem to like... but it's funny how they usually focus on the ""on set chemistry"" which only counts for 10% of this jumbled mess. BTW, that's malarkey. Their on screen chemistry is a few scenes with her sitting on a table, counter, or ledge while he pulls in close. The rest of the movie could literally dumped the love story and not changed. That's just how unimportant that is.The action:Nobody cares. We've seen stuntman directed films and it usually ends with Keanu Reeves falling down 100 flights of stairs for the fifth time while shooting everyone else in the noggin.

They put this stuff out here for our entertainment and I appreciate it. Thanks Lee and thanks to the cast that gave me a good memory. Salute.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

However, I was very pleasantly surprised by this one.Ryan Gosling is perfect in his role as a suave stuntman and the chemistry between him and Emily is very solid. Gosling is full of charisma and you see the levels of his talent as he can go from very funny to serious in minutes and make it fit within a movie that's primarily an action comedy.Action sequences are impressive and the stunt scenes do not disappoint. In an era lacking magnetic male leads, Ryan Gosling is one of the few leading men that gives you hope.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

There's still a sense of over familiarity with Gosling's turn as the potentially genius/potentially misguided Seavers and there's not many moments in Fall Guy where you feel Gosling is really owning proceedings here, marking this role down as a key career moment for the beloved star where he will either continue to bunker down with this type of project or start to recognise it is perhaps time he gave this version of Gosling the A-lister a rest.A well-intentioned film and entirely inoffensive, there's glimpses of the film Fall Guy just might have been and there's going to be some fans of the film unearthed no doubt but overall this films the exact type of forgettable Hollywood film the industry really didn't need right now.Final Say -Failing to excel in the action or comedic stakes and unable to do much with the chemistry between Gosling and Blunt that could've been mined far greater than it was here, The Fall Guy is a disappointingly lacklustre and disjointed outing that has strangely been greeted with a far kinder critical reception than it deserves.2 unicorns out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","34 out of 65 found this helpful."

I saw a few episodes as reruns when I was a kid. About a month and a half ago I bought the first season on Amazon and I've been working my way through it and I love the show. When I bought it I had no idea whatsoever that they were making a movie of it. Turns out that movie came out this last weekend and I saw it on Saturday. I loved it. It was probably the best experience I've had at the theater since I can remember. It's a cheesy love story comedic murder mystery action movie kind of thing and it's a showpiece for cool stunts and it was downright delightful. It is not a modern take on the television show. They keep the character names and the fact the main character is a stuntman but the story is a complete reimagining that does its own thing. I liked that because it doesn't compete with the show. It stands on its own merits. They did pack it with Easter Egg homages to the show though. Only complaint is they didn't tell you explicitly it had been a Tv show but I loved the cameo in the credits. Highly recommend both the show and movie. This movie is endearing and sweet, yet cleverly meta at the same time.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

They jump from heights, they get banged up in car crashes, get burnt in fire scenes but at the end of the action scene they show a ""thumbs up"" to the relief of the director and crew. So is the life of stuntman Colt Seavers ( Ryan Gosling) who goes through this ordeal with supreme confidence and coolness. His ambitious director Jody ( Emily Blunt) is making this movie about cowboys and aliens within the movie. Fabulous is the word for this movie with eight and a half car rolls in the action sequences.There is something fascinating about a movie which is showing a movie being shot within a movie. There is plenty of stuff for the movie buff. There are a number of ""behind the scene"" revelations specially from the stuntman's point of view. There are references to iconic movies like "" Pretty woman"", "" Notting Hill"", "" The fugitive "" ,"" Thelma and Louise"" among others while the stuntman and the director converse. An interesting scene is when they discuss the pros and cons of a split screen and the visual goes into split screen. Another scene shows improvisation of dialogue on the set of a sea beach in the midst of chaotic action when director Jody asks Ryan what should be his reaction in a scene and he in turn asks the co actors. A democratic way to shoot a movie indeed. One tends to think thinks that movie making is now more technology centric and less content oriented. The stuntman's job is described as ""nihilistic"" by the director Jody. There is plenty of action, comedy, self spoofing and parody for continuous entertainment. Towards the end a song brings out an appealing thought of a stuntman who says he doesn't want a statuette for his work, the scars are enough reward.Director David Leitch's homage to the stunt man makes for an excellent movie. The exciting visuals, the peppy songs, the sparkling dialogue are all engrossing. A thrilling climax is shot in Sydney. The cinematography and editing are top class. Ryan unleashes his charishma and swagger all throughout as only he can. ( A much needed contrast to Ken of Barbie). Emily acts well as Jody the animated director of the movie. Together their chemistry is great and carries the movie splendidly.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

This film contains elements of both environments, but nothing else.How can these actors not leave after the first shot? They must notice the difference in the quality of the drafting, story, and dialogue.Okay, this is a comedy, but stupid jokes seen a thousand times, such as a dog biting in the pants, are not entertaining at all. I waited 40 minutes for the plot, but there was none, and when it was disclosed, it was so rudimentary.When it becomes a torment to watch a comedy all the way through, I have to realise it was not meant for me.

But I feel bad for stuntmen if this is the representation they get. Action scenes are extremely unbelievable, but that's not the biggest problem. They are so fake that it completely brings you out of the movie. No hits seem to land and at one point you wouldn't even know what's going on if it weren't for a loud bite sound. The sound design is carrying the action hard in this movie.The rest of the movie is even worse. A missing person case turns into a murder case and all of the usual twists and turns unfolds. But this feels like the subplot of an entire different movie. It's supposed to be a romantic movie, but that's pushed aside for this storyline that just wastes time instead of developing the movies strengths. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt. While they don't get a lot from the script, at least they do their jobs as actors and has somewhat of a chemistry. The problem is that they have so little screen time that just makes the movie drag in between. If you are going to be a clichéd romantic action movie, why not just follow a working formula where they are both in this together instead of having them on separate places all the time? Instead we have a movie that doesn't know if it wants to be romance or action.Then we have the script. As said before, there are clichés all over the place which makes the story so predictable that it's hard to be excited for what's coming next as it feels more like a confirmation of what you were waiting for. The dialogue is terrible and it proves how good Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt is as actors to be able to deliver them with at least some credibility. Too bad both the script and the editing kills any subtlety they are delivering and instead wants the audience to know exactly how ""smart"" it is.This leaves a two star rating, one for Gosling and one for Blunt. The best part of the movie is the end credits where you get to see how the stunts were made.","18 out of 32 found this helpful."

It's actually an action movie that has romance in it. This smart direction allows the film to do what it wants to do which is to be a ""love letter"" to stuntmen as well as general movie making. And the stunts are done very well!Smartly, we know the motivations of our main leads. They don't have to come out and say where things can lead. Will the fall guy win back the director? The outcome is possible, but only if he does and says the correct things. Explain why he left her. Win her back. Prove he's worth another chance. The fact that he has to use his stunt skills to keep his job and therefore stay on the film set around his former girlfriend is a great way to show his loyal need to the film production, but also his willingness to prove his worth to her. Along the way, we get meta conversations that are tied together with filming and editing techniques. We get drug-fueled visuals, comedy, and impressive action that continues to prove why cgi should be used sparingly.Of course not everything makes total sense. But the movie is a lot of fun and makes you not care about these small drawbacks, although the ending seems to have been re-shot. One ending was set up and would've worked very well on multiple points, but we are treated to something that ends the movie on a bit of a bum note.

The marketing of this movie reminded me of Goslings other film The Nice Guys(2016) a detective -noir film that I love and was hoping to get a similar experience here, but alas it's nothing like it.

The word of mouth of this film is not very positive and therefore I went to the cinema without expectations, only with the thought of having fun and a little fun. But it turned out to be something else! This film perfectly mixes action and comedy through the great work done by the actors, with Ryan Gosling, Emily Blunt and Aaron Taylor-Johnson at high levels and who perfectly interpret their characters. The surprising thing about this film is that it is a film inside the film: this movie is about Colt, a stuntman, who after a serious accident retires. One day, however, he returns to the track with a new job offer and this will lead him to reconcile with many old friends and to live dangerous and unforgettable adventures. In fact, the weak points of the film are the plot and the writing, very simple, but I don't think they are ugly, on the contrary, I liked them. And then, to be clear, these films do not need an incredible plot, the important thing is that they are films that entertain the viewer with a bit of madness! The characters are all beautifully characterized and in-depth and I loved the friendship and romance between Colt and Jody, a perfect couple. But I also loved Dan thanks to the performance of Winston Duke that always drives me crazy, I laughed like a child. Also in my opinion in this film there is also drama and sadness, mixed perfectly and there is a scene on which I was going to cry, an unforgettable scene. The rhythm of the film is absurd, there was not a moment when I got bored. Leitch's direction is excellent with an incredible photograph, in my opinion this film and ""Bullet Train"" are on the same level, perhaps slightly higher for the soundtracks, the best point of the film. I loved the ending and this movie is probably one of my ""comfort films"". I can't wait to see it again digitally..

Instead of his other movies where he does nothing at all besiding looking okay and staring at the camera for screen time. For example in remember the titans, he is literally there just for diversity and looking good. In Fall Guy he actually acts and takes the role of a main characer improving the movie. All the stunts(even though it was done by a stuntman) he still looks very good in the stunts.

With a charming number of add on ending credit scenes and the atypical use of a split screen scene, The Fall Guy focuses on the behind the scenes role of stunt doubles and a rather convoluted mystery behind the disappearance of the main star of the science fiction action adventure movie within a movie. The romantic undertones and overtones between Ryan Gosling as a talented stunt double and Emily Blunt as a camera woman with higher ambitions have already started off before the movie even begins and proceeds to evolve over the course of the entire movie with good moments between the two actors. The action, drama, and the comedy are fused together in a difficult balance that eventually succeeds on the screen. The Fall Guy is entertaining and well done with a carefully but difficult to edit into a creative and somewhat unusual and entertaining storyline.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

The Fall Guy made stunts look cooler than ever, and we even got to watch Ryan Gosling behind the scenes of him performing his own stunts for a movie about stunts. The action was a little slow in the first half, no surprise, but was top tier for the last hour. The comedy wasn't balls to the walls funny, but the amount used fit perfectly with the tone making it nearly as funny. It's a shame that Ryan Gosling doesn't do more action/comedy, because he is really, really good at it. Unfortunately, I did have outrageously high expectations which hindered my viewing experience, but no complaints as a whole. I fully recommend The Fall Guy to anyone because it is just so enjoyable.

In fact, I was beginning to believe that there is only so many ways to make a film that tells an engaging story in these cinematic genres.Enter, ""The Fall Guy.""From the opening scene, it immediately becomes obvious that you are witnessing movie magic. Since the 1970's, I've lost track of the number of romantic comedy and action movies I've watched, but none of them are as original, smart, sly, funny, action-oriented, and emotional as The Fall Guy. This film is literally firing on all thrusters while it hits ALL of the above adjectives - in a single movie.Sitting in a theater in 1979 watching ""Alien"", I marveled at the jump scares that movie elicited among the packed audience. Now, in 2024, The Fall Guy grabbed me in just the same way, but instead of jump scares, I found myself astonished by the ingenious plot twists; staring in awe at the insane stunts that were sprinkled throughout the movie, erupting in laughter at the constant barrage of comedic elements, cheering triumphantly during the car chase scene involving the dog, and feeling that tug of emotion when (for just a moment) Jody believes that all might be lost. I particularly enjoyed the way The Fall Guy paid homages to past movies in an almost Jeopardy-esque way, daring us to guess the name of the old film before it is revealed to us - this becomes a humorous running motif throughout the movie.In terms of a virtuoso performance, one might compare this movie to True Lies, but I believe The Fall Guy resonates better with its audience than James Cameron's film.Here we find Emily Blunt giving a leading lady performance that immediately and authentically connects with the audience. Her incredible talent is on full display from start to finish.Ryan Gosling has truly given us a number of unique and distinct character portrayals over the past decade, and he delivers once again here - but this time he unleashes his athleticism at a sustained peak-performance level I've never witnessed from him before. This movie simply would not work if he had not been able to convincingly embody the character and aura of a stunt man in the way that he does.Simply put, I've not had this much entertainment fun at a movie theater since the 1990's. Rating: 9.5 out of 10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

What a waste of a great cast, extravagant set pieces and budget. Did anyone actually read the script and let out the slightest laugh. The two leads did their very best but the only thing laughable was the fact this remake of the 80's TV show got made in the first place. And I so wanted to like it.","7 out of 12 found this helpful."

This is his love letter to stunt men as the closing song plays. The screenplay has to be nothing short of amazing but I'm not so sure it works as much without Gosling. He is that guy. His charm and brilliant comic timing elevates every movie he's in ten fold, imo.If you want to laugh for two hours escaping reality while also appreciating the stunt comminty (GIVE THEM OSCARS ;).

The plot centers on a stuntman who, after a debilitating accident, loses both his confidence and direction in life. A year later, he receives a call for help for the woman he once loved, prompting him to return to the movie industry to help her. However, upon arrival, he discovers ulterior motives at play, leading to unexpected twists and turns.Directed by David Leitch (Bullet Train) and featuring a star-studded cast including Ryan Gosling (Barbie), Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer), Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass), Winston Duke (Black Panther), and Hannah Waddingham (Ted Lasso).The Fall Guy had the potential for a compelling romantic comedy, but unfortunately, the excessive $130 million budget leads to over-the-top scenes and cheesy moments in almost every frame. Despite solid performances from the cast, the film suffers from poor editing and unrealistic storytelling. While there are a few good lines and a touching love story, the movie is weighed down by drawn-out scenes that diminish its impact. Even after the apparent conclusion, the film continues with behind-the-scenes shots during the credits and additional scenes post credits, prolonging the experience unnecessarily (even if I did enjoy the behind the scenes shots).In conclusion, while The Fall Guy boasts a promising premise, it succumbs to overproduction, poor editing and an abundance of cheese. I would rate it 4.5/10 and recommend it only with appropriate expectations.","7 out of 12 found this helpful."

But the plot, ah, it was kind of mess, bit ok, it was supposed to be a light fun, not an Interstellar. But what about the dialogues? Pretty cringe romantic-comedy shots seriously bombed and the rendered the atmosphere in theatre hardly bearable. No chemistry between Ryan and Emily, really. Regarding the acting, the Tom Ryder guy was really great, the producer (actress from GoT, cannot look for the name right now) was sometimes great and sometimes just overacted.Long story short: if you are a big Gosling and Blunt's fan and/or you really like John Vick/Too fast too furious action and can easily make compromises on cringe humour, this one is for you.

Then a joke follows. Then again - an explosion. The problem is there is no empty moment throughout the whole movie. Just the new pattern I've been noticing in the last few years - action, joke-action-joke. As if the script was written by an Ai, while checking the dopamine release in your brain after every joke-action sequence. The plot is so thin you can read through it. The dialogues are messy and so excess, that my head hurts from all the meaningless talking and hyper ventilating. If we strip the move to it's core, it's a regular love/murder story, written by someone on drugs, with ADHD, sugarcoated with 80s music. The good stuff - the stunts. And the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emily blunt. Unfortunately it was badly hurt with the insensible, unemotional script, which covered every human emotion with some classical pop song, instead of actors actually having to show that emotion.I feel sorry for the modern cinema.

But eventually got around to doing so, as I had the opportunity to do so.The storyline in ""The Fall Guy"", as written by Glen A. Larson and Drew Pearce, was okay. It wasn't an outstanding or memorable storyline. Sure, it was watchable, but it felt somewhat flat and generic at times.I found ""The Fall Guy"" to be entertaining for what it was, but it was hardly an outstanding movie for me. It just wasn't really tickling me in the right places, and I have to say that I was expecting a tad more from director David Leitch's 2024 movie than what ""The Fall Guy"" turned out to be.The acting performances in the movie were fair. I am not particularly a big fan of Ryan Gosling, and ""The Fall Guy"" was hardly among his better of movies. And Emily Blunt, well, you know what you get with her in movies, so there's that.Visually then the movie was good, and it was the action scenes and sequences that kept the movie afloat and kept it watchable.While I did manage to sit through this movie in its 126 minutes runtime, which felt long, then I was only mildly entertained. ""The Fall Guy"" is not a movie that I will sit down to watch a second time, as it was enough of a struggle to sit through it the first time.My rating of ""The Fall Guy"" lands on a very generous five out of ten stars.","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

However, much like a stuntman missing his mark, the film stumbles in its execution, leaving me with a feeling of ""been there, done that.""The plot centres around Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling), a washed-up stuntman lured back into the game when a Hollywood star mysteriously vanishes from a big-budget production. While the idea of a stuntman doubling as an investigator is intriguing, the mystery itself feels derivative. We've seen this whodunit play out countless times before, complete with red herrings, double-crosses, and a climax that feels telegraphed a mile away.The film's saving grace, however, is its charismatic lead duo. Gosling brings a winning blend of cockiness and vulnerability to Colt, while Emily Blunt shines as Jody Moreno, the film's sharp-tongued director and Colt's potential love interest. Their banter is genuinely funny at times, and their chemistry is undeniable. But even their talents can't elevate the film's predictable script, riddled with clichés and groan-worthy jokes.Leitch, known for his work on action films like John Wick, delivers on the stunt sequences. The practical effects are impressive, showcasing the daring and skill of stunt performers. There's a clear love for the craft on display, reminiscent of classic action comedies like Rush Hour. However, the frenetic editing style, with its rapid cuts and shaky camerawork, often undermines the impact of these scenes, leaving me feeling disoriented rather than exhilarated.The Fall Guy tries to capture the spirit of 80s action-adventure flicks, but it lacks the heart and humour of those films. The soundtrack, while energetic, leans heavily on nostalgia without offering anything fresh. The cinematography is serviceable, but the use of colour feels bland and uninspired.Ultimately, The Fall Guy is a frustrating missed opportunity. It has the potential to be a crowd-pleaser, but its derivative plot, underwhelming direction, and forgettable score hold it back. While there are moments of genuine amusement, thanks largely to the cast, the film feels like a pale imitation of its action-comedy predecessors.So, should you see it? If you're looking for a mindless action flick with a forgettable plot and some decent stunts, The Fall Guy might do it for you. But for those seeking a truly entertaining and clever experience, this one's a flop.","10 out of 20 found this helpful."

Actor chemistry appeared to mesh well with Ryan and Emily leaning hard on their great comedic wit. Kudos to the script editors for keeping the love story & who done it plots manageable to follow with a manageable character roster.Again, not perfect but a great summer film we haven't seen for a while.

Is meta becoming that trendy? I think it is. In fact, I think for the first time I've witnessed, meta is becoming cringe. This is the movie that is causing the whole idea of a meta film to cross a line, and make it totally lame. In my life time, some of the meta films released have been some of the most unique and mind-bending films that have been created (Being John Malkovich comes to mind first), but The Fall Guy is, at its core, brainless popcorn garbage.This feels like watching a Deadpool movie but without the superhero costumes. It's not nearly as funny as it wants to be. It does not function well as a comedy. Yet, it is also far too corny to allow any real tension to build during its countless action sequences. You can't take any of these characters or the film's events sequences seriously, therefore you do not care if or when they might get hurt. I saw the majority of the twists coming before they occurred. I hated the soundtrack - I probably wouldn't get along with whoever did the music supervision; a lot of bad, unfitting songs are used. This movie did not need to be over 2 hours long.The first act moves too quickly and the interactions between characters are far from believable, the second act feels almost entirely aimless, while the third act does manage to deliver consistent base-level action film entertainment. Though his performance is nothing to write home about, it is fun seeing Aaron Johnson playing such a torqued-out villain. While Gosling and Blunt are charismatic enough to keep the movie as mildly entertaining as it is, neither of them shine, while brit Hannah Waddingham actually steals the show as the slimy film producer.All the post-release press about ""America asking for more original films and then not supporting them when they come out"" in light of The Fall Guy's release, is really quite comedic after seeing it. They seem to be ignoring the fact that ""an original script"" alone is not enough - the movie also has to be GOOD, but I would straight up call The Fall Guy a BAD MOVIE. It feels almost identical to watching a Marvel movie, tonally, and as far as I'm concerned, THAT is the LEAST refreshing thing one can possibly consume in the form of feature films in 2024.","5 out of 9 found this helpful."

Let's start with the fact that this film is not some sort of moody Oscar Winner.... Except if there was a Stuntman category which this film brings to obvious light. What the film does do exceptionally well is captivate the audience with action and stunts! There's a ton of them! From massive car rolls, boat jumps, fight scenes, high falls, huge explosions and let me say... so many man-on-fire scenes that must make even the most seasoned Stuntman cringe!The film stars the ever-favorite-as-of-late Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt as his love interest. Their chemistry is right on point. I loved Colt's (Ryan Gosling) puppy dog eyes as he gazed at his ever elusive love Jodi (Emily Blunt).Why did I give a non-painfully-moody, non-typical Oscar Winner a 10 out of 10? Because it's a good ol' fashioned fun movie! Isn't that why we watch movies anyways? Not all movies need to enrich your inner thespian or indulge your inner murderous rage (just kidding on that one).

It's exactly the opposite of what people criticize Marvel movies for yet it ends up being quite ""Marvel""-esque with non stop yapping and sparkly colored visuals style being passed on as comedy. It's got good reviews by most others as it seems, yet it performed poorly at the box office. Some blame its unnecessarily huge budget, but this movie is PG 13, the previous David Leitch movie, Bullet Train was rated R, had more well known ""stars"" and was released closer to pandemic times yet that one did quite very well.Something's definitely off putting about The Fall Guy as I find it hard to believe that people's standards of movie have gone so low they consider this enjoyment. All the crap surrounding the celebration of stunt people and them not being valued by Oscars, it feels wasted here as action in this one is seriously lacking some power.

What you do get is a stunt man on hard times who is offered a comeback...with a catch. The director is his former significant other who at the moment is truly not happy with him. They are working on her sci fi epic with a star who has gone missing. So the stunt double is basically doing his film to be filled in later with the principle. So far, pretty normal for the high strung types in the film industry, but something is rotten in the state of New South Wales (they are filming in Sydney Australia). This leads into a high action, very low credibility, plot with a lot of not so subtle digs against the industry pretentiousness, and producers who make politicians look like good honest folk. Just watch it for the fun and don't overthink it. It's enjoyable and you get to see some of the tricks of the trade you've seen hundreds of times before but never realized how it was done after some post production magic.

Very much a film that must be seen on the big screen, as the stunts are just fantastic.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

The plot is based on puppy love for a woman, add to this a detective story, and the explosive mixture of the pop genre is ready. The quality of the film is at a high level: professional staging, excellent cinematography (although without unique solutions), beautifully executed artistic component, exciting stunt work and an entertaining plot. For me, only the content caused a repulsive feeling. The film is designed for the average viewer, it will entertain, evoke sympathy, in general, it will be a good pastime in good company.At the very beginning of the story, the hero gets a spinal injury, but at the end of the first act, all the injuries disappear and the hero is still awake: jumping, falling, fighting - in general, turn off logic, and everything will become harmonious.The film imperceptibly imposes an gynocentrism social model of behavior in which a man cries, suffers and seeks female attention - this is very wrong, it destroys the male personality, especially for the teenage viewer - matriarchy in its vivid form. It seems that the whole of Hollywood is under a sharp metal heel, tightly compressed in a rigid metal corset, and sexism is the only sought-after product packaged in a bright wrapper.","3 out of 5 found this helpful."

The L. A. dolts are once again present, both in front of and behind the camera, and the condescension towards the paying audience is enough to suck the air from the room. Ostensibly a big-screen version of the '80s TV hit ""The Fall Guy"", this boy-girl tale in La La Land is about as far from a good ol' boy romp as you can get. Everything is hyped-up, sped up, jammed together and fast-forwarded through, maybe so we'll not pay attention to the plot. After breaking his back in an on-set accident, once-cocky movie stuntman Ryan Gosling has gone into hiding; he's now humiliating himself nightly by parking cars for rich a-holes and has left his love affair with camera operator Emily Blunt to wither on the vine. Flash ahead one year and Blunt is now directing her first movie, with absolutely no idea that her producer has lured Gosling out of retirement to do the heavy stunt work (Blunt finds this out after one stunt has already been filmed and wants Gosling fired, but she's told, ""There's nobody else!""). Slick, stupid, overtly commercial action-comedy, perhaps inspired by the Brad Pitt plot in ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood..."", but without Quentin Tarantino's intrinsic smarts and flashy style. Is there anything worth savoring in ""The Fall Guy""? Blunt doing karaoke to Phil Collins is fun until we get a dumb cutaway to a secondary character who whispers to his date in a noisy bar, ""I love this song!""

From its lackluster plot to its uninspired performances, this movie falls flat in almost every aspect.The storyline feels disjointed and riddled with clichés, following the tired trope of a down-on-his-luck protagonist who gets caught up in a web of deceit and danger. Despite the potential for suspense and intrigue, the narrative lacks depth and fails to engage viewers beyond surface-level entertainment.The characters are one-dimensional and poorly developed, making it difficult for audiences to connect with or care about their fates. Whether it's the bland protagonist or the generic supporting cast, there's a distinct lack of charisma and chemistry among the actors, resulting in performances that feel forced and unconvincing.Visually, ""The Fall Guy"" offers little to impress. The cinematography is pedestrian at best, with uninspired camera work and lackluster set design failing to create a compelling visual experience. Even the action sequences, which should be the film's saving grace, come across as generic and uninspired, lacking the excitement and intensity needed to keep audiences engaged.Overall, ""The Fall Guy"" is a disappointing movie that fails to live up to its potential.

Speaking of Emily Blunt (whos a rather good actress if given the right source material), she seems pretty wasted on this film. Not that she doesnt have any chemistry with Ryan Gosling whatsoever, but her character also seems unnessery for the whole premise. Its like the whole love plot is forced on the viewer. Gosling's character embarks on a mission to find the main actor of the movie he's working on. And while he's investigating, we're forced to watch a pointless phone call between these two characters. And thats not the only time this happens. On and on we're reminded this movie is more a love story than a movie about Fall Guy. The best part of the movie is summed up in about 15~20 minutes. These are the minutes that are actually devoted to stuntwork. The most entertaining part to best honest, were the final credits.So what could have been a beautiful homage to stuntwork and its unknown heroes endep up as a rather bleak romantic comedy.","3 out of 5 found this helpful."

Movie Review -David Leitch and Ryan Gosling flash on the screen in the very first frame and pay their homage to all the stuntmen who do the ""real job."" But does that all matter when the movie starts or ends? No. With The Fall Guy, David Leitch falls again. Back in 2022, he put a bullet in my brain and busted it with ""Bullet Train,"" and now I just witnessed my creative fallback as his viewer. ""It's high noon on the edge of the universe""-Thank god, Fred Zinnemann and Gary Cooper are not alive to see the ""High Noon"" word being used parodically like this. You don't have to love ""Notting Hill"" just because someone says so. Slap me for saying this, but I guess Leitch has cooked a mixed dish of Star Wars and Dune meeting Notting Hill to get the results of ""Tees Maar Khan.""Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) is one of the best stuntmen in Hollywood, and he primarily works as the stunt double for a famous action star, Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). One day, he gets severely injured while performing a ""jump from high"" stunt and quits the job. Colt quits his girlfriend, Jody (Emily Blunt), and abandons himself from social life and friends because he thinks that he is not special anymore. Cut to 18 months later, the same movie producer calls him and asks him to rejoin as a stuntman for a movie directed by his ex-girlfriend. To make things up with his ex, Colt comes back, and there begins a boring drama of two lovers trying to rekindle their lost romance. Halfway through, the boredom gets over as Colts finds himself stuck in the middle of a conspiracy, and now he must find a getaway to clean his name from this mess.Just like Bullet Train, The Fall Guy also uses absurdity as the main tool for comedy and somewhat succeeds in it. It's the yawning romance that puts you to sleep, and you are like, ""Come on, get over it. Let the film move forward."" Even I asked myself, ""Why didn't Leitch use absurdity in romance?"". Imagine two lovers meeting after one and a half years, and the next moment they are back to the old days, hugging and kissing each other. This way, he could have made a comic caper or that old-school screwball rom-com, but no. He had to be stubborn enough to destroy his own film with a boring romance. The ""happy ending"" shiit ain't working anymore if the director himself isn't looking for other options. The Fall Guy lacks creative ideas in the script, but more harmful is the childish plotting in the second half that causes a big-blow extinction of your expectations. What happens in the last 30 minutes is totally out of context, totally rubbish, and highly irritating. Some extraordinary stunts are eye-pleasing, and a few comic punches hit the right chords. That ""John and Amber"" joke didn't get noisy laughs in the cinema hall, but I was cracked up alright. Maybe it went over the head for others. There are a couple of more instances like this that are too smart to catch, but otherwise, it's just a fairly entertaining comedy-nothing great.Ryan Gosling plays a handsome fella who has every quality of a perfect boyfriend. The swag and looks have tremendous sex appeal, but the comedy part isn't that good from his side. Emily Blunt's accent wasn't appropriate, even though she felt innocent and cute with it on some occasions. Her chemistry with Ryan doesn't spark the screen, and that's the saddest part about this pairing. Those desperate, long conversations were only causing small headache attacks. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's cool and swaggery superstar was fairly good, but the role was cut short. The typical funny-friend-of-the-hero is played very well by Winston Duke, whereas Hannah Waddingham makes her presence felt strongly. Teresa Palmer, Stephanie Hsu, and the other supporting cast members didn't seem very visible here.Watching the TV series The Fall Guy back in the 80s must have been a different experience, but for today, it's definitely outdated. With someone like David Lietch, who doesn't believe in intelligent cinema, it becomes even more problematic. The idea of absurd comedy works fine with today's youth, but there has to be some merit to it. Using some movie titles, star names, and PJ won't bring genuine laughter. The Fall Guy couldn't overcome its thin plot and dead screenplay, and moreover, David Lietch Touch (not similar to Lubitsch Touch for sure) makes it fall lower. Despite good efforts by the stunt, action, VFX, and camera teams, The Fall Guy fails to provide enough. Eight and a half rolls are always welcome, but we need a two and a half-star storyline as well. Overall, it's another dead game by David Leitch after Bullet Train, and I wish he finds some good air next time. Nobody hated him as a producer of ""Nobody,"" but I hope, fast and furiously, he will find his ""High Noon"" and stay away from ""Tees Maar Khan.""RATING - 4/10*","7 out of 17 found this helpful."

And for that, I'm very happy watching only once.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

Not a chick flick & not a dude flick, the elements for dudes the chicks will still like & the elements for chicks the dudes will still like, as they all tie together. Starting with romance stuff, Ryan Gosling & Emily Blunt's chemistry is great although I admit I woulda liked to see a little more bickering in their early banter, maybe her be a bit more annoyed with him in the beginning for longer... that kinda stuff always makes the payoff better & adds a certain charm. I think most people expected a little more of that from the previews. For some of that ""Romancing the Stone"" vibe. (Where the 2 leads pretend not to like each other or at least in this case where she pretends not to like him while he clearly likes her.... but she let's up on that kinda early imho.) Obviously ya don't want that for the whole movie but it'd help if there was a touch more in first half. This is a bit of a nitpick though, & yes there's def still a touch of that. Their chemistry isn't built as much around that is all, i kinda wish it had been cuz it woulda been fun to watch some scenes like that, for added comedy, but there's def still chemistry & it's pretty darn great. Ur completely rooting for them by the end & it works.As far as the action/stuntwork, it's pretty great although there's no extended one-shots like Leitch did in Atomic Blonde or any sweeping grand stunt-fight choreography if ur looking for John wick or Matthew vaughn-kingman-church scene kinda stuff, or John Woo bullet Ballet style or anything like that but there's a record breaking car-roll and some great action all the same. It plays very well, looks great, stylish, & most of all, the story is set against a backdrop that pays homage to all the unsung heroes in the stunt world. Anyone who likes seeing ""movie-within-a-movie"" kinda stuff will enjoy that too.Don't expect a super realistic plot, this is all about fun, action, adventure, romance. I'm not gonna drop any plot/story spoilers.Musically, there's also a great classic Kiss song that gets used throughout the movie and builds up to a grand epic version in a crucial scene & personally as a fan of exciting music scores/soundtracks (& loved the 80s vibes of the trailer songs) ima HUGE fan of that kinda thing, and loved how it elevated the action. Not enough catchy music in action movies anymore. They hold off then at the climax cuz they already used the ""epic"" version by then, & so I kinda wanted more banger music during much of the climax but then they bring back the raw version of that track at a good moment. I know to some reading this u could care less about music but I'm a big believer that it subconsciously elevates the visuals when it's powerful.If ur looking for a connection to the TV series there's an Easter egg for ya to pay respect & homage & nod if ya stay tuned but the movie isn't about that so try to enjoy it for what it is.In conclusion this is a fun summer popcorn blockbuster that yes could use a few improvements but it's also kind of a banger & should leave most people leaving the theater with a smile, and possibly feeling a bit nostalgic for how movies used to make us feel. Don't set ur expectations thru the roof. That's probably the only thing that could leave anyone disappointed. Just expect some fun.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

In linear fashion, movie's star comes up missing (presumably on a bender), star's stunt guy goes to get him, finds out Star has gotten mixed up in shady dealings, stunt guy has to escape the bad guys, rescue the Star from said bad guys, all so he can save the movie production he's in & win the affection of the lady director. Stunt guy becomes The Hero, spoiled star is now The Damsel in Distress, & the director is both The Girl & The Queen whose kingdom The Hero saves.Except it's way more convoluted. Rather than having fun with the cliches I just describe, Fall Guy goes way out of the way to avoid them. Like around the world to get next door out of the way, & in about the most boring way possible. The action sequences are short, few, and warmed up leftovers from Leitch's better movies. The romance building scenes are overlong in a beat-a-dead-horse way. By the time The Betrayal happens, I felt like I was the one who was betrayed.There's some good bones here, & could've been a really fun movie, but ends up being more like something made by a committee of 14-year-olds.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

What initially made this film interesting was the idea that the stuntman would ultimately become the action star by going on this mission to find the missing movie star. This was the perfect set up to allow the stuntman to do a bunch of crazy stunts that were entertaining while also paying homage to the stunt community. Instead, this film delivers the most generic action sequences ever shown in film and doesn't even make them look good. Guys fall through glass, cars crash, a few things blow up but there isn't anything captivating about the visuals.Had this delivered on the action then the plot could have been forgiven. Unfortunately, that was not the case and the plot is revealed to be very weak. The central conflict that is supposed to drive the plot is very foolish which made the motives of the antagonist just the same. This resulted in the film having weak and undeveloped characters. The love story started off promising but quickly became very bland without any emotion to support it.The humor is very mild with only some chuckles to be had. It would be difficult to classify this as a comedy when the biggest comedic element was the ""twist"" reveal which was comedic for its lack of surprise. Some scenes dragged on for too long and there were too many references made about other films.The scenes which involved the movie making process were enjoyable. More of that behind-the-scenes insight would have made this film more interesting. It could have been an action film within an action film showcasing all that stunt people do. This could have been the ultimate action movie but instead it only has a good song to its credit (I was made for Lovin' You).","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

There were a few plot holes in the movie which were a bit strange but overall I enjoyed it. If you are looking for a good popcorn flick that is fun i recommend this.

Whether it is a reboot, an origin story for the main character (Colt) or a reimagining is unclear and probably unimportant.The TV show premise was a stunt man who takes on detective work as a side gig. Here Colt (Ryan Gosling) is getting back into stunt work and wanting to reconnect with his love interest (Emily Blunt as Jody). The detective task comes along eventually giving us enjoyable action in a relatively uncomplicated subplot.Besides the love story and detective subplot the movie also invites us backstage to view the making of Jody's movie project, giving us insight into the movie making process and the hype machine that is hollywood.The inside references are endless and I'm sure I missed many. More than a dozen movies are referenced directly as stage hands quiz each other with movie quotes and similar banter. More obscure references include a car jump stunt (such a stunt played a major role in the final season of the original show) and the name of the movie Jody is making: Metalstorm. A theatrical movie of that name came out in 1983 and is the worst movie I've ever seen in a theater.This movie tries to operate on all of these levels and it succeeds in all of it. The cast are clearly reveling in the joy they're creating and it shines out in every frame of the movie.Of course two stars of the original show (Lee Majors and Heather Thomas) get a cameo, and the torch is passed to a new fall guy. Hopefully this will be the start of a franchise.PS, stick around through the credits for video of how many of the stunts were actually done.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."
"9","/10","Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt in a movie about stuntmen; what's not to love?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9794953/?ref_=tt_urv","gnperuti","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur178239163/?ref_=tt_urv","17 May 2024","In an age where everything is CGI heavy explosion fests where nothing you see on-screen is real, a film like The Fall Guy is a rare commodity, making it all the more welcome. This film serves as a love letter to the unsung heroes of film: the stuntmen and women who risk their lives so the stars don't have to. It's also a well paced and written mystery, with some good twists and a solid balance between that stuff and the stuff with the film being made. Admittedly, the scenes of Blunt sniping at Gosling over their failed relationship were annoying at first, but they don't last too long and once we get past them, we get some conversations between them that are both deep and funny. And while not every joke lands (there's a running joke involving Gosling trying and failing to get a coffee that's lifted right from Hudson Hawk and doesn't even get a payoff in the end), the majority do exceptionally well. For example, while I don't usually care for when movies reference other ones, the parts where Winston Duke quotes different movies and Gosling names them got a good laugh. Speaking of, the cast is solid and works well together, especially Gosling and Blunt once we get past the awkward sniping scenes.Naturally, in a movie about stuntmen, the primary focus should be on the action and stunt work. Thankfully, thanks to the end credits, I can see that the majority of it was all done onset, which makes the action and stunts all the more intense and pulse pounding, especially the fight scene in the back of the truck and the climax. However, they also manage to fit in some great humor with the action. For example, at one point, Gosling is drugged, so in the following fight scene, sparkle effects are added to each blow, as well as another running gag for the next ten minutes or so where he keeps seeing a unicorn. Even the editing gets some good laughs. For example, in one scene where Gosling and Blunt are talking on the phone, she mentions doing a scene in split screen, and the rest of the conversation is shown in split screen. And of course, there are some awesome songs in the soundtrack, with the main theme being the KISS classic ""I Was Made For Lovin' You"".Overall, The Fall Guy was everything I hoped it would be: a fun, high octane action film where what you see on the screen actually happens. It's a shame it isn't doing well currently (there was barely anyone in the showing I was at), but hopefully, word of mouth will spread and it will pick up. If not, perhaps it will find new life on streaming.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."
"4","/10","Dull action comedy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9780554/?ref_=tt_urv","skjoe-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20011798/?ref_=tt_urv","9 May 2024","Firstly, I am confused as to why this movie has so many 10/10 reviews on here. The way they are written seems almost like spam posts.Fall Guy follows stuntman Colt Seavers. After an accident filming for actor Tom Ryder leaves him broken and working a dead end job, Colt is surprised when a producer wants him back to help work on a movie his ex-fling Jody Moreno is making. The tension between these two ex-lovers escalates and Colt is asked to go on the search for the missing Tom Ryder, pushing him into a plot of mystery and intrigue.The movie juggles a ""will they-won't they"" rom-com plot whilst sending Ryan Gosling's character on a messy and unfocused adventure to find a missing actor. Aside from the third act which saved the movie slightly, the pacing is awful (2 hours was too long) and the dialogue was painful to watch.There is hardly any chemistry between Ryan and Emily. We are supposed to be invested in their love story but aside from a brief mention at the start of the movie and an occasional flashback for a few seconds there is nothing to believe in. Their exchanges of dialogue are terrible. Emily being cold and uninterested and Ryan mumbling through his lines. There are a couple of moments throughout the film where I could feel my mind slowly fading away and my interest levels dropping rapidly.A scene in which Emily keeps making Ryan do a stunt where he is yanked back into a wall on the set of a sci-fi action movie. After takes we have to watch them talk on megaphones back and forth, as if they were talking about the characters but really it's about them, over and over. It's not funny, it drags on for far too long and it does nothing to help the films pacing or love story angle.During a pivotal scene of plot intrigue the two leads have a split screen phone call. They discuss the movie they are making for a while and then sit down and debate the plot of Notting Hill. Thats it. Just mindless chitter about an old rom-com. Doesn't have any relevance to anything, move the plot forward or foreshadow much it's just more filler in this movie.The film has us believe that Colt (and all of the stuntmen on this movie set) are action heroes with John Wick style fighting capabilities. Ryan acts like Jackie Chan in Drunken Master, flailing about but at the same time in complete control. Able to take on multiple assassins and armed guards whilst also making death defying leaps and moves. Keep in mind this is a man who suffered a career ending back injury at the start of the movie.The only chemistry that really worked and parts of the movie for me were when Ryan and Winston Duke's character interact (they actually had chemistry) and Tom Ryder. An arrogant and self-centred, over the top action star played quite well by Aaron Taylor-Johnson.The biggest problem with this movie though is the story. There are a few action set pieces here and there which are mostly decent (expected from the director of Bullet Train and Nobody) and the third act goes all out in terms of special effects spectacle but the plot is bland, boring and the worst part: predictable.I was able to figure out straight away who the bad guys were and the issues whilst at the same time being incredibly uninterested. The movie drags so much, due to the bland dialogue and mystery elements which take far too long to be explored. By the time the third act happens which does help focus the movie slightly and bring everything together, it's too late.This film is listed as a comedy but it barely managed a chuckle out of me. In fact I was in a pretty full cinema and I don't think I heard anyone laugh. Not once.The stunt work is pretty good though and I appreciate the film highlighting the hard work and dedication this bring in creating movie magic. Although it does take away from the point slightly when the main character is part of the stunt team but more often than not you can clearly tell it's another person doing the stunts.Ultimately, The Fall Guy is a boring rom-com with lacklustre dialogue and terrible pacing. Some good performances scattered once in a while and an entertaining third act can't save this one.","4 out of 12 found this helpful."

The action and stunts in both John Wick and Nobody far exceed what you get here.I had really high hopes for this and have been following progress for decades. I think Mark Wahlberg was attached in the early 2000's and like every action movie, The Rock was attached in the 2010's.It's just not a good movie despite having a good story and solid cast.This is better than the Roadhouse remake, but not by much.Best part of the film could be the Mid Credits scene, but even that didn't really fit, but it will make original fans grateful they sat through most of the credits.","3 out of 8 found this helpful."

It's just missing...something.I think a big problem is that the film leans heavily into the chemistry of the leads, and while Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are very charismatic individuals, they aren't with each other. I just didn't buy their chemistry. Less lovers, more siblings.The sound mixing of this film also left a lot to be desired. It's rare that I knock a film for technical flaws, but The Fall Guy sound was just not mixed well. Incredibly loud soundtrack and special effects often drowned out character dialogue. I probably missed 1/2 of what was said on screen.The plot itself was okay, but since I correctly surmised who the bad guys were in the film 10 minutes into it, maybe it was a bit telegraphed.The action itself was well done, and the technical details about stunt sequences were cool, but there just wasn't enough to this film overall to set it apart from other very similar films that have come before this one.The last thing I'll say about this film is my recognition that if this came out 10 years ago, it would've been a major blockbuster.

With Leitch it really shows in his movies.The opening scene, where he and Gosling address the audience was absolutely endearing!Bullet Train and Deadpool were fabulous, and I also had a great time with The Fall Guy.I love it, when Ryan Gosling doesn't play stoic types, but unleashes a broader spectrum of acting skills, like he did in The Nice Guys.So, go watch it. Maybe not a masterpiece, but close enough.And please, people like Martin McDonaugh, Shane Black, Chad Stahelski and David Leitch... we need you to keep making movies.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

The leads have no chemistry, everyone knows Emily Blunt is married to John Krasinski and Ryan Gosling does not match playing a stuntman, besides there is no back story flashbacks of him and Emily to relate to in what they had, besides the long run time and what the main focus of the movie is supposed to be, the Hollywood cliches of how everyone treats each other is a sad fact that bothered me in my being a production assistant on MR. Belvedere in how badly your treated.When I saw the title of this movie, it reminded me of the TV show starring Lee Majors and I thought it cannot be that good, well it delivered on that part. Let's be honest when you read what the movie is about, does it really draw you in, I turned it off about half way.The main focus of the film with all the unnecessary
stuff probably finally showed up, but at that point who cares anyways, stuntman should have been more of a theme here as they do so much and should be more of a focus in the credits, when they die that is when their talked about as Chris Pratt's stuntman was, show some more acknowledgment and do a better job Hollywood !","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

They are overproduced, the dialogue is extremely stiff and fake, and often everyone is just chit-chatting about nothing or screaming their lines. This feels like a movie made with a script that's 50 pages long. The rest is adlib. There are constant scenes where 2 characters are supposed have an awkward personal debate. Yet the cuts are overly fast, the music too loud, and the dialogue is horrible. The whole script is awful mainly because of the dialogue that feels like it's written by someone who has never written a script before. Someone trying to write a comedy for the first time ever without really understanding what makes a scene funny. So it feels like a cheap imitation of a mediocre movie.But then it's clear from the editing the producers didn't trust the story and acting to deliver so they overproduce each scene and cut it to bits. Everything feels extremely rushed yet the movie is overly long. Even the initial storyline kickstarting the plot is rushed via flashback and slow motion scenes. So many slow motion scenes everywhere! And then a 18 months jump in time where all this crucial plot development happened. They clearly had the runtime to tell a clear story yet just didn't. I can't even explain why. They had the actors, the budget, the runtime. They had everything to pull off a decent story. So the reason for the failure is just lazy people making the movie or no one actually making sure the quality is high. This is clearly produced, not directed.Also, the story makes no sense.

Leitch is hit or miss for me, anyway, since I hated ""Hobbes and Shaw"", don't care to ever see ""Deadpool 2"" again, and found ""Bullet Train"" just meh.But ""John Wick"" and ""Atomic Blonde"" rewrote the book on action scenes, so I expected something in a movie about Hollywood stunt workers that would rise to that level.Nope. What we got was the first hour full of a really boring, poorly written, poorly acted love story. I like Ryan Gosling a lot, but even he could not bring this script to life for me. In the entire first hour, we see two stunts... we don't even see the main stunt that starts the story rolling.In other words, this is not an action movie. Rather, it is a romance with mystery and stunts thrown in. Which would be fine if it had something original or slightly interesting to share, but it does not. Both the romance and the mystery are boring, tedious and awkward for an entire hour.Then, finally the action starts and honestly, I don't get all the hoopla. These are the exact same stunt sequences every film has, shot in exactly the same way. A car jumps a ravine, and we see maybe half of the shot but then it cuts to show a random mid-air shot and then a final cut to some random landing shot. Apparently this is called a ""cut on action"" or ""match on action"" shot (according to Google, anyway). The fight scenes are the same: punches are thrown in one shot, the connection is a different shot and the impact is yet another shot, etc.In fact, in this entire movie, every stunt is a cut on action except two (I only saw it once, so there might be more, but it's not a lot more).This is exactly the kind of TV action scenes I grew up with in the 1980s. There's nothing cutting-edge about it, except that it wasn't done in front of a green screen (I guess that's cutting edge in today's Hollywood). But that doesn't make it more interesting.You wanna make an homage to stunt people, show the entire stunt in one shot. That kind of camera work is what made ""John Wick"" and ""Atomic Blonde"" so much fun to watch over and over again.I doubt I will ever revisit ""The Fall Guy"". I'd rather watch an episode or two of the 1980s classic ""The A-Team"". I'd see the same action sequences and get a better story for my time.","2 out of 7 found this helpful."

I had high hopes for the romance because Blunt and Gosling look so well together on screen and have organic chemistry, but that too failed to give satisfying results, mainly due to depthless writing and lack of ambition pertaining to the romantic aspect.That said, I did enjoy what Gosling did as the lead; he kind of saved the film, if you ask me.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

It had a great mix of action, a cool leader character and awesome stunts. All done tongue in cheek.I've just finished this and boy, what a ham of a film. I recognise now that as a mid-fifties guy, I'm not its target market but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy puerile humour. That's not the point here. The characters are just plain lame. The plot is incomprehensible. But the stunts are great. And with the latter, anything is possible nowadays through CGI so don't put too much emphasis on this aspect.But regarding the two previous aspects - cast and plot, they need to be tip top or it's a flop. (I'm pretty proud of that one.)I almost suspect the director on this shouted to his lackey ""Get me Ryan for the lead"", meaning Ryan Reynolds but the runner mistook it for Ryan Gosling. He is so not a comic leading man. He's simply out of his comfort zone. It's as if his dialogue was written specifically for Reynolds.And Blunt certainly isn't a comic leading lady. She's better corseted up in some Victorian drama than this.I'd love to have reported a much better experience but sadly it isn't great.

I like Aaron-Taylor-Johnson. I like real stunts. And unlike many reviewers I even enjoyed the director's previous film (Bullet Train) in parts. So this movie was a no-brainer for me. Unfortunately what I got was the most meandering love story I had to endure. I can not stress out enough how abysmal the love story is treated. You will appreciate Star Wars Episode 2, because that one was at least unintentionally funny. Here it kills the movie dead in it's tracks, whenever the movie starts gaining some traction. So don't expect fireworks coming from Blunt, Gosling or the action scenes.I appreciate the sort of behind-the-scenes tone the movie is going for, I can not tell if it's parodying or documenting the chaos surrounding modern blockbusters nowadays. On paper, this should be light-hearted fun, but in reality, every minute of it felt tedious. You can guess all the story beats from a mile away, the big twist included. Every stunt set piece feels like it's five minutes too long. And the constant cross-cutting between two locations (and tones) during an action scene never works. Specifically the stunts are underwhelming, because they made them look like they were heavily green-screened even though they weren't. But Gosling is basically dealing with a few henchmen here and again it feels underwhelming how the story and action unfolds here. The director shoots for being Shane Black and Michael Mann at the same time but lands somewhere on Tommy Wiseau/Michael Bay territory. The film itself can not decide if the protagonist is a coward, a real human, a caricature or a superhero, so it rolls the dice every five minutes. Everything is so in-your-face and tries hard to amount to something: be it the obvious music choices, the movie references & especially the tired humour.Gosling, Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Hannah Waddingham are the only actors chewing the scenery, and who barely keep this corpse of a movie afloat. Emily Blunt is terrible in this, I want to blame the writing, but Gosling is punished with the heavy lifting here and he mostly makes it tolerable, but even he can't turn a turd into a cupcake. There's tons and tons of dialogue which is supposed to be clever, meta or just quirky but it's trying too hard. It's one of those movies where you already checked out when the final act comes along and arguably the best action scenes are thrown at you, but all you want is for the movie to end already with it's tacky happy ending. This isn't a homage to the 80's and it's respective stunt work, this looks and feels like any other mid-movie from Marvel or Netflix.3 out of 10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

From my recollection there were two points in the film that I gave serious consideration to walking out because it was a go nowhere film. But Ryan Gosling's presence was just enough to tie reasonably fun scenes together to keep me there till the end. This movie is a Solid 5 plus stars, but it's definitely not a 6. The entire scene of where she's getting back at him and announcing it out to the crew and they go back and forth on it, it's just so hackish but I can't believe it's in the movie and really soured any and all of the romcom aspect to it.

As a fan of the original show, I was eager to see how the filmmakers would bring this iconic story into the 21st century. While the movie does capture some of the charm and excitement of its predecessor, it falls short in a few key areas.What I Loved:Nostalgia Factor: The movie does a fantastic job of paying homage to the original series. From the theme song's modern remix to the cameos from original cast members, there are plenty of nods that fans will appreciate.Stunt Sequences: True to its roots, ""The Fall Guy"" excels in its action scenes. The stunts are well-choreographed and thrilling, offering a taste of the high-octane adventure that made the original show famous.Casting: The lead actor brings a fresh yet respectful take on Colt Seavers. Their charisma and physicality suit the role well, making for an engaging protagonist.Areas for Improvement:Plot Depth: The storyline feels somewhat shallow and predictable. While the action scenes are fun, the plot lacks the depth and intrigue needed to keep viewers fully invested from start to finish.Character Development: Aside from the main character, the supporting cast feels underdeveloped. The relationships and backstories that could add richness to the narrative are barely touched upon.Pacing: The film struggles with pacing, with certain scenes dragging on while others feel rushed. This inconsistency can take viewers out of the experience.Dialogue: Some of the dialogue comes off as clichéd and lacks the sharpness that could elevate the movie's overall impact.In conclusion, ""The Fall Guy"" is a decent attempt at reviving a beloved series, offering enough action and nostalgia to entertain, but missing the mark in terms of plot and character development. It's worth a watch for fans of the original, but it may not leave a lasting impression on new audiences.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

How far would you go for the one that you love?"" Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt)The Fall Guy, adapted from the 1980s ABC TV show, is blockbuster dangerous and romantic filling the need to see a summer actioner with intelligence that along the way teaches a loving audience about filmmaking. Bullet train's director David Leitch (a former stuntman from such films as The Bourne Legacy and double for Brad Pitt) and writer Drew Pearce have eloquently crafted a smart film about the essential visual component of the biz and an amusing love affair between Jody and Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling), a Swiftie crying to Taylor's All Too Well, that makes a satisfying rom-com for the summer.At a time when AI is a flashpoint about veracity and authenticity. The Fall Guy more than enough makes the case for the human side of filmmaking even if part of the film shows how stunt making can be a vehicle for bad in real life. Regardless, this film celebrates real artists supporting real art.It's a movie within the movie about Colt, the appealing stunt man, and his ex-girlfriend, Jody, who directs a sci-fi movie with a lead, Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), gone strangely missing. Colt is asked to find him and at the same time reignite his romance; it's complicated because it also involves a conspiracy. Echoes of the splendid Dune and light-hearted Cowboys & Aliens are all around.For those who like a mystery, The Fall Guy delivers. For those who love movies and die for peeks behind the scenes, the stunt sequences hold secrets of the art and craft that enhance appreciation. It features cannon rolls, pyrotechnics, smart dogs, etc. This romcom is like analyzing a challenging novel as it exposes some of the tricks and subtexts that make movies meaningful magic.You can't now do better for almost-summer blockbustering with a mind of its own.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."
