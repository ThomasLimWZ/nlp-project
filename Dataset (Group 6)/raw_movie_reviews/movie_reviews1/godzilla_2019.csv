Thus, my 5 star rating. Half of the movie involved the monster battles and that gets 10 stars. The half of the movie where there is no monster presence gets 0. That averages out to a 5. Perhaps some day Hollywood will re-discover the lost art of screen writing and combine it with CGI to create a truly fantastic movie. But don't look for it to change soon. A lot of people came out of the theater visually dazzled by the special effects knowing that the story was awful but still thought it was a great movie. So they will continue make a lot of money creating these kind of movies and save on time & expense by not having to pay top dollar for a writer.","537 out of 644 found this helpful."

Well you might agree after watching this movie.You'll probably hear a lot of opinions from people who aren't homegrown Godzilla fans - and they will have their own thoughts on this.
I, on the other hand, am a big fan of the monster going years back. Finding a Godzilla movie in the TV guide, or a DVD for one of the Toho movies to rent was like winning the lottery when my brother and I were young.Here are my thoughts plainly stated: Yes, this is a better Godzilla film than the 2014 movie. There are *aspects* of the latter that some might say make it superior, but that would only make it a better movie in general - as a *Godzilla movie* this new one is quite a bit better.Don't listen to the people on RottenTomatoes talking about how ""the special effects are overly relied on and can't make up for the bad characters and plot.""
No. Those CG monsters are the best part, and they almost singlehandedly save this movie. The solution is not to focus less on special effects and develop the characters better. The solution is to have every human character stepped on in the second act and have the last 45 min center the story solely on the monsters - which I guess would mostly be fighting.The problem is this does not happen. Every moment you see the monsters battle, you enter a brief moment of bliss before you are ripped away to deal with people you don't care about doing things you hope they fail at. The first ""clash"" occurs in Antarctica, and that scene was actually quite good despite the focus on the humans. You're just now being exposed to these titans duking it out, so having people there witnessing the madness and trying to escape help play into how incredible this event truly is.By the 3rd act, however, this tolerance has dried up. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't a movie titled ""Godzilla"" imply that he is the main character? Because he doesn't feel like one. Without a doubt, THE biggest problem that Godzilla (2014) and this film have is they place waaayyyy too much value on human beings. Everyone in the audience is waiting for them to shut up and go away, but the movie has its head up its ass and thinks what they're doing is somehow important and worth focusing on. It would be like two warriors facing off, and having most of the climax focusing on ants running around on the ground trying to save each other.The only ""characters"" here that need development are the Kaijus. Have them be your stars. Have them be the focus. It doesn't just have to be mindless action like how snobby people will pretend that's all we want to see. Go ahead and tell a story, but NOT with people. They are not the reason we're watching this, and we don't care about them.One exception to what I said in the previous paragraph: Ken Watanabe
His big character moment was incredible. If you must have human beings involved, do them like this. He was amazing.","517 out of 671 found this helpful."

Give this movie franchise 10 years time and give it to someone who wants to make a movie about monsters, gods, titans, whatever. And it doesn't have to be 132 minutes long if you have nothing to show!

Compared to its predecessor (2014), the pacing is quicker and the action is much more plentiful. While 2014 attempted to woo us with a slow-burn of Kaiju drama, it simply lacked what we wanted - fighting monsters - and instead tethered us to uninteresting human characters. With KotM, we have humans again, but at least they actually move the plot along and don't absorb 80% of the film's scenes. Here we have not 1, but 3 legendary Toho monsters slugging it out with our giant green protagonist. Visually the fights are awesome: lightning storms, ocean fights, and exploding cityscapes - all of which are drenched in moody color. While the plot can be ridiculous, I'm questioning the person who goes to see this movie expecting a writer's opus. You know what you're getting with KotM and thank God(zilla) for that.","19 out of 33 found this helpful."

You get to see each of the monsters' unyielding powers and characteristics, and them battling each other is nothing short of edge-of-your-seat monster excitement. However, the CGI on the creatures were too dark at times, making the monster battles hard to see. It is also difficult to see the creatures' faces and reactions - just a whole lot of head-spinning movements and swift actions.The human drama was average at best, and the good guys vs. bad guys subplot was a major distraction from the film, I thought. Much of the evil doers' actions were overkill, and our protagonists were too preachy, save for Ziyi Zhang's duo doctor roles, which is a great nod to Mothra's tiny twin priestesses in the classic films. I also liked that the filmmakers incorporated Mothra's Song in this movie.But, as with much of today's films, there is forced comedy to lighten up the mood, courtesy of Bradley Whitford's St. Stanton character. His humor was extremely annoying and distracting, very out-of-place for the movie.With all the hard-to-see monster action to the distracting human drama, there is too much in the film to digest and makes it hard to appreciate the main point, which are clearly the monsters. It leaves little room to sympathize with the human characters and leaves you craving for more of the monsters.Grade D+","41 out of 56 found this helpful."

I own everything there is about kaiju universe and have watched every single toho Godzilla film numerous times in dvd and most of those films in a theater back at the time.The first 1998 American remake was an entertaining movie but never the less a failure for the real Godzilla toho fans.the 2014 version was a vast improvement as it was closer to the real feeling a Godzilla movie should have.
this new remake had even greater connection to the earlier Japanese Godzilla flicks.
finally we got to see a big budget film with king ghidorah ... rodan..mothra which is reason enough to go watch this film if u are a toho Godzilla fan like me.unfortunately the film had scenario issues they could find a better explanation as to why the monsters were released but at least they tried with that part to explain and there were also messages about the survival of our nation.
another negative was they did not shown a lot of the rest of the 14 like monsters they were set free.
besides the big four we saw only a glimpse of 2-3 other monsters. the mutos a kind of mammouth which I don't remember to feature in any of the Japanese Godzilla films and I think I saw kamakutra a well known kaiju from the film Godzilla vs the sea monster (1966)
where are the rest of the monsters ?
where are gorosaurus...manda....anguiras....varan....baragon.....mechagodzilla....spacegodzilla...destroyer....gigan....and so many others ?
they could have included a scene like that in destroy all monsters film in which we can see manda destroy paris...etc..etc
anyways those were the only two minors the movie had.
as for the rest the movie was great. the monsters looked great. the fights were long and fabulous.
For those who complaint about that.......it's a Godzilla movie. it's supposed to have long fights.
This movie is in essence a remake of destroy all monsters 1969 movie or also a remake to king ghidorah 1964 and it's sequel Godzilla vs monster zero 1965.
if u watch those 3 movies u will find that this movie was based on those 3 earlier toho films.
All in all it was great to see those past forgotten kaiju monsters fight in a big budget film with Godzilla and next year we get finally Godzilla vs king kong remake 58 long years after the release of the original.

There was way more emotional intensity than I expected. And I think they actually did a pretty good job at creating a world with mythology and back story.But... I came here to see 200 million dollars worth of monsters fighting and destroying things!Alas, near the end, the constant stopping of the action to pour on more human drama got to be a little too much for me, and unfortunately I found myself feeling a little bored right when this movie's ""Godzilla surprise"" hit.It's almost like they went out to design some REALLY iconic images -- ones that'd make awesome posters -- then figured out how to wrap some fight scenes around them.It gets super-confusing when you consider the distances traveled and the amount of time taken, and the length of some scenes going from day to night to day again rapidly ... but, anyone looking for ""realistic"" or ""remotely plausible"" clearly shouldn't be going to a Godzilla movie.I don't have the slightest clue how Kong could possibly beat this guy, but we'll have to wait and see.Overall, I enjoyed the 2014 movie quite a bit more than this one -- the ""boring human parts"" did a much better job of staying out of the way and letting the real star shine.Still, I would recommend it.

BUT this is Godzilla and everything else is top notch. Godzilla is top notch in this movie.
The music is amazing, especially in some moments.
Visuals are stunning and the monsters look amazing.
Ghidorah is amazing.Not sure: There are some elements borrowed from the anime on Netflix. Like Ghidorah being an interdimensional being and Godzila/The Kaijus being a force of nature that are supposed to restore balance to Earth.
Not sure if these are general Godzilla facts or they just borrowed from the Anime.

I won't blame anyone for jumping at the chance to see this film, and it does deliver exactly what it advertises. That would normally set the right mindset for an experience like this. Unfortunately, the movie is both painfully straightforward while subverting expectations in a highly unsatisfying fashion. But instead of making another joke at The Last Jedi's expense, let's look at Godzilla: King of the MonstersGodzilla: King of the Monsters stars Raymond Burr as reporter Steve Martin, as he investigates sightings of a behemoth that has attacked ships off the coast of JapanWait, that's the wrong movieGodzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) is about ancient monsters awakening around the world, while the military and an organization known as Monarch try to handle the damage caused by these giant animals. As the enormous creatures start vying for supremacy against each other, humanity finds itself in the crossfire as the planet's largest battle for dominance is reignitedOr at least, this is what the story attempts, but ""attempts"" might be too generous. To say the movie crashes while flying its premise would imply it took off the ground at some point, but even three aerial monsters in the film didn't let it happen. The earliest sign of trouble with this story appears when the first of these titans rears its head and its features are barely noticeableThe decision to obscure these giant animals unfortunately extends to the territory battles between them. The fights are spaced far apart enough to not overwhelm the audience, but frequent enough to continue the thunderous footsteps. Unfortunately, on top of the behemoths being obscured by rain, snow, clouds, or smoke, the ""camera"" work involved with these CGI creations is close and chaotic to the point of being nearly indiscernible. There's rarely a steady point of reference to sell the size of these titans, and the ""color"" filter with their scenes only serves to hide them further even in plain sightWhat stands out the most about these monsters is the sound design, both the roaring movements and their musical motifs. The roars of the giant animals are excellently powerful, frantic, majestic, and threatening to match the titan. The vibrations of the tremors and trails from the wake of these behemoths emphasize their size and being where the visual framing does not. But by far the audio highlight in the best way possible are the creature's themes. Beautifully crafted masterpieces that invoke a sense of history from these ancient beings, while constructing a mythology and presence to reflect the nature of these leviathans. The extraordinary amount of care in this score is absolutely haunting, and by far the best part of the movieIt makes it all the more confusing that the film doesn't shut up. The fight scenes are spread out, but most of the space between them is intent on using loud tracks even when nothing cinematic is happening. Here would be a great time for the movie to let the audience catch its breath after its taken it away. It doesn't give time for the spectacle to settle, not for the frequency of the setpieces, but for the barely noticeable difference in ""volume"" between downtime and destruction time. The film wants to retain the viewer's excitement when the monsters are not on-screen (if they were even visible in the first place), but instead comes across as auditory hijacking. It overcompensates for itself and comes across as lacking confidence because of itThe most damning thing of all, however, are the human characters. If the monsters' presence is bombarded by inconsistent audiovisuals, then it's left in a heap by the infuriating human characters, and not because of military firepower either. Amidst the miscellaneous soldiers and scientists running about the story, are three thruline characters throughout the plot. One lacks purpose and personality in favor of being an audience surrogate. One is hyper-competent to a degree so as to nearly invalidate everyone else. One displays motivations that make less than no sense. And all of them are connected by tragedy via destruction from these behemothsThe dramatic thrust shared by these three characters is decimated by how poorly written they are. This is not okay. In 1954, there was a monster movie which had characters genuinely fearful both of the monster, and the consequences of what may happen should they take a certain step to destroy that monster. In 1989, there was a monster movie where a scientist was desperate to bring his deceased daughter back to life, only for it to backfire horribly. In 2004, there was a monster movie where the main hero's journey paralleled that of a monster fighting against an alien invasionThose films are Gojira, Godzilla vs Biollante, and Godzilla: Final Wars. They are different in tone from one another, but share in common a strong enough human element that contextualizes the sweeping spectacle of 50 meter, 80 meter, or 100 meter tall titans. Without that human anchor, action scenes featuring these giant animals can only carry a film so far before becoming boring. Not cheesy. Boring. This is even assuming the set pieces are compelling on their own in the first placeThis movie hurts. Even if the human characters were unremarkable, there's a baseline here that should have been highly entertaining for two hours. But not only are the human characters just milquetoast, they are aggressively aggravating. And the creature spectacle itself becomes tiring because of how haphazardly it's crafted. This film isn't painful because it could have been great, it hurts because there's a lot of care undermined by incompetence. It knows how to pace itself for breathers but doesn't let its downtime do what it needs to. It would have masterful sound design if it didn't insist on being loud all the time to the point certain music pieces can't shine through. The monsters themselves look great when they're not obstructed from view, while the roars and sounds from these giant animals project a lot of personalityThis film should have been an atomic blast but was instead a nuclear meltdown. After the studio behind this movie released two very solid monster films in 2014 and 2017, what should have been a three-peat didn't happen. The expectations on this movie weren't even the highest, because the monster films from 2014 and 2017 still had noticeable flaws themselves. Even carrying that tempered anticipation, this movie still hurts. I don't drink, but maybe Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) would be a better time if I wasn't sober","187 out of 291 found this helpful."

Things begin to get going, and it sets up for this basic and simple story. However, everything in the second half completely changes and turns terribly. The story just doesn't make enough sense, with tons of twists and turns which don't suit the situation of the film. The second half is atrocious, and starts throwing characters away left and right and they didn't even make audiences care for any of them. This was easily what brought the movie so far down, and ruined it. They tried to add humor multiple times, but it just never worked and nobody even laughed at any of the jokes. The characters are also very clearly used as story points, and they feel so unrealistic. They also make very dumb decisions, and many things happened that just didn't make any sense or couldn't be possible. For instance, one of the characters had their hand smashed onto by a huge stone building, and then used their hand perfectly fine afterwards. I could go on for days about what's terrible about this movie, but there are a few good things. Millie Bobby Brown's character was maybe the only one that could be semi-cared about. This movie has a huge budget of $200,000,000 and other than spending it on their impeccable all-star cast, it was mainly spent on CGI. This was so clear right from the first few scenes. The CGI was absolutely stunning, and the monsters feels more powerful than ever. Everything looked visually realistic and appealing. I could only name about 2 scenes that had somewhat bad CGI. The monsters are easily the best part of the film without a doubt, they're also taken very seriously. It doesn't make the commin monster movie mistake by using the monsters for dumb humor or anything like that, you can feel the power of these monsters, and when there's action, is when this movie shines the most.","27 out of 54 found this helpful."

The head scratcher in reading the negative reviews is ""seriously, what exactly were you expecting???""
I've enjoyed Godzilla flicks for nearly 40 years, Even Gogira, the original film most fans would unanimously anoint as the best of the series- for all its deeper metaphors relating to the dangers of the nuclear age & dark tones applied from being made before the 10yr memorial of Hiroshima & Nagasaki, it is still a guy in a rubber suit laying waste to miniaturized models of cities in Japan. Over the next 65 yrs from Godzilla's films have ranged hideously & laughably bad camp flicks (loaded w/ shameless stock footage w/ record scratching to communicate) to very epic Kaiju flicks.
Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a film designed for fan service to the many of us that grew up watching primarily films made during the Showa era on Saturday mornings. The birth of the ""monster mash"", the creation of Mothra, King Ghidora, and Rodan among others. In my humble opinion it delivers as promised!
While many like myself welcomed and enjoyed the 2014 release of Godzilla, there were valid areas of constructive criticism. Godzilla didn't need to be ""Jaws"" where he was barely seen and then quickly vanish into smoke or the ocean when he did appear. The human component to the storyline didn't need to dominate the film, and every time there was about to an aggressive confrontation-they didn't need to cut away from the action.
The 2019 installment drastically improved on a great many areas mentioned. It's not perfect and it was never made to be considered for academy nominations for writing or acting (I will say the main core of actors do well in explaining the nonsense & keep the story moving for the audience). For those complaining about the plot- there's no spoiler needed in saying it's almost nonexistent...It's Giant Monsters Fighting! Then again, trying to explain w/ a serious/straight face the premise for a great many Godzilla flicks is nearly impossible. Those reviewers claiming this is the worst, and then citing that as the reason really don't know anything about the genre. Almost all of the film plots have components involving aliens attempting to conquer earth, time travel, and/or giant robots (sometimes robots created by aliens*) or all of the above... and of course never mind that every film is centered around an enormous radioactive monster w/ atomic breath, that is nearly unstoppable to conventional weapons... truly, such realism is hard to come by in films.
Film aficionados can certainly poke plot holes in every one (including KOTM) large enough for Godzilla to stroll through...that's never been the point of them. This film gives many fans what they'd been praying for, and the first time they see Ghidora's lighting blast or hearing some of the original score adapted from Akira Ifukube it's literally goosebumps & an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia. The little throwback references & Easter eggs are also well done.
It's Kaiju Monster Mash with spectacular CGI to bring the classic Tojo characters back to the big screen in a way most fans had been hoping to see.
Enjoy it for what it is, and you'll get your money's worth!","11 out of 19 found this helpful."

The last time I cared about human characters in a Godzilla film was the 1954 version. And that's because those characters were important. In the following succession of films, until the 90's and especially in the 70's, the characters were either throw away or annoying kids. This film was a love letter to the fans. There were so many Easter eggs for the fans that it was ridiculous! I almost couldn't keep up with them.This movie gives the fans what they want: Godzilla fighting his most famous enemy: Ghidorah.

Sure, there were plot holes through which you could drive an entire fleet of trains carrying nuclear weapons, it featured coincidences that stretched believability even by Hollywood's standards, the human characters were paper thin, and it took itself very, very seriously. But I enjoyed it. Ironically enough though, what I admired most is the same thing that a lot of people disliked - the fact that Edwards kept Godzilla's appearances so fleeting. Personally, I thought it was a masterclass in directorial restraint, and it had the effect that when the big final fight came, it hit home on so many levels because here, finally, we were getting to see the big guy throw down. However, I understand why some people were unimpressed that a film called Godzilla featured so little, well, Godzilla!The third film in Legendary Entertainment's ""MonsterVerse"" franchise, King of the Monsters is a direct sequel to Edwards's film (although sadly, he didn't return as director), and sets up , which is scheduled for release next summer. However, whereas Edwards held Godzilla back and made the action feel smaller by focalising it through the human characters, new director  essentially inverts that formula, putting Godzilla front and centre and shooting the action in such a way as to make it seem as grandiose as possible. He isn't half the director that Edwards is, but King of the Monsters works well in a braindead summer action movie that's wall-to-wall giant monsters fighting one another kind of way. Sure, there are significant problems (all the best shots are in the trailer, the plot is beyond laughable, the characters are so thinly sketched as to make those in the first film feel Shakespearean, clichés abound, the talented cast is wasted), but all things considered, I enjoyed it, as it accomplished exactly what it set out to accomplish.Five years since Godzilla defeated the MUTOs, many more creatures (newly dubbed Titans) have been found throughout the world in various forms of hibernation. In charge of studying and protecting them is Monarch Sciences (introduced in a fledgeling state in , which took place in 1973). In China, Monarch paleobiologist Dr. Emma Russell () and her daughter Madison () watch the awakening of the larval form of Mothra. However, when Mothra becomes distressed, Emma is able to calm it using the ORCA, a device which monitors the Titans' bioacoustics and transmits a dominant ""alpha signal"" capable of placating them. Soon thereafter, eco-terrorist Jonah Alan () and his private army storm the facility, stealing the ORCA, and kidnapping Emma and Madison. In response, Monarch track down Dr. Mark Russell (), Emma's estranged husband, and co-designer of the ORCA, hoping he might be able to help find Jonah. Mark and Emma lost a son in San Francisco during the fight between Godzilla and the MUTOs, and whereas Emma came to feel the Titans could help humanity, Mark became convinced they should all be eradicated. Meanwhile, Jonah heads to the Monarch facility in Antarctica, and unleashes the only non-terrestrial Titan, a fearsome three-headed dragon codenamed ""Monster Zero"", but whom ancient humans knew as King Ghidorah. Arguing that humanity has brought the planet to the point of destruction, Jonah believes that if the Titans are awoken, the ensuing conflict would wipe out most of human civilisation, allowing the planet the time it needs to heal. And so, with Ghidorah awakening the various Titans throughout the world, Godzilla emerges to stand against him.Godzilla was originally created by , , and  in 1954 and was conceived as a metaphor for the destructive power of nuclear weaponry. King of the Monsters has one eye on its themes too (eco disaster, biodiversity, co-existence with other species, military impulsiveness, the insignificance of humanity compared to the vastness of nature), but really, the sermonising script by Dougherty and , from a story by , is so badly put together, with the characters' motivations so poorly delineated, that any thematic concerns dissipate into nothing. Part of this is that the narrative simplifies Godzilla's 'morality'. In the 2014 version, Edwards muddied Godzilla's intentions brilliantly, depicting a monster that was fairly indifferent to humanity, and was far more concerned with the biological drive to reassert his alpha status. In King of the Monsters, both Godzilla and Mothra are fundamentally good, and wish to protect humanity from Ghidorah, which is more binary and not nearly as interesting a position to take.And yes, the film does address the fact that through inattention and greed, humanity is on the brink of ensuring its own extinction. The problem is that the script is so ham-fisted and poorly structured, the eco themes so preachy, and the organic integration of those themes into the action so lacking, that they come across as background irrelevancies at best, and distracting moralising at worst. And in any case, the film ultimately undermines all of this in favour of reaffirming the clichéd old notion of human perseverance in the face of adversity.There are other problems with the script, however. For example, not one, not two, but three characters sacrifice themselves for the greater good (all at different times), resulting in none of the sacrifices really meaning anything. Another scene that doesn't work is the death of a major character; it happens so suddenly, amidst so much chaos, with the camera on even focused on them, that in the very next scene, the film has to show us their face on a monitor with the word ""Deceased"" written underneath. The character of Mark is also peculiarly written. Played by the top-billed Chandler, he has little to do for most of the film other than look at monitors with a concerned expression, coming off more as a fed-up dad than the protagonist of a Kaiju film. There are also far too many scenes of characters standing on the bridge of the Monarch flagship, the ARGO, spouting expositional word-dumps at one another. And not a single character in the film comes across as three-dimensional.There are also some hilarious spatial hijinks going on. I get that the ARGO is supposed to be a super-advanced high-tech mobile fortress, but it seems capable of flying from one side of the planet to the other in about ten minutes, and unless it's capable of transportation, there's some Game of Thrones-level compression of distances going on. Another problem is the twins played by . Except I didn't even realise there were two of them until I read a few reviews. Sure, I noticed what I thought was a singular character appear to be in two places at once, but because the ARGO had already been globe-hopping all over the place by that point, I just put it down to the film's lack of geographic realism. The fact that it's so easy to miss that there are twins is spectacularly bad writing, especially considering they're supposed to be a modernised version of the Shobijin. And don't get too excited about seeing a Titan battle-royal. Apart from the central tag-teams of Godzilla and Mothra facing off against Ghidorah and Rodan, most of the rest (including those newly created for the film) are seen only in news reports and a montage that plays behind the closing credits, although a few do turn up for one scene.But for all that, however, I thoroughly enjoyed King of the Monsters. Although the trailer did promise what the film can't deliver on (Claude Debussy and pensive apocalypticism), aesthetically, there's a lot to admire. , , and 's sound design is suitably deafening, and 's cinematography has a well-judged sense of scale, especially in the 2.39:1 3D IMAX format. This is complemented by , , and 's editing, which maintains the rhythm of even the most chaotic action scenes. The film also does some interesting things with colour. Whereas the palette is predominantly mixed when we're with the human characters, the Titans are coded in binary elemental colours: Mothra glows blue as a larva and gold in her final form, Rodan reflects the hardened red of the lava from which he emerges, Godzilla is the green of nature, Ghidorah is a neutralising dark brown. There are also some extraordinary individual shots (most of which have unfortunately been spoiled by the trailer); Mothra spreading her wings for the first time, Ghidorah perched atop an erupting volcano with a crucifix looming in the foreground, the reveal of Godzilla's lair. And the final shot is a goosebumps moment with which no Kaiju fan could possibly be dissatisfied. Purely at the level of craft, this is a hugely impressive film. it most certainly isn't, but who expected (or wanted) it to be. The key to really parsing the film is to consider the context, looking at what it was trying to be. And in this sense, it's a success. Sure, the script is hideous, and Dougherty is no Edwards, struggling to accomplish what Edwards seemed to do with ease; bring his own personality to the spectacle. However, if you approach it for what it is, a dumb summer blockbuster about large monsters punching each other, you'll like it just fine.","18 out of 35 found this helpful."

Please dont hate my opinion cause it's just that, my opnion.I'll say this, when I watched Godzilla 2014 I thought man this movie would be so awesome if Godzilla was in it more, but this movie does that and it made me realize why they did it in the first place. It made it so that when he was on screen is was simply put epic and special. This movie loses the specialness in that.
To me, someone who didnt grow up loving Godzilla, I rarely watched any Godzilla movies other than the original and the 2014 one and from that scale, I would say this one is the worst.
This movie does get props though, it's like the purge with how people complained about one main thing with the first movie and the studio listened and fixed it. This movie has ALOT more Godzilla and monsters. I'm sure people will appreciate that, but it just made me realize why they did it the way they did it in the 2014 movie.
To me, I think that since Godzilla was rarely in the 2014 movie, when he was in it, it was breathtakingly beautiful and truly epic, with this movie it happens so much it just turns into a big monster fighting movie. And some people will like that, but I didnt sorry.
I think Gareth Edwards understood scale much more than Michael Dougherty. Godzilla in 2014 was huge so he moved extremely slow and everything felt like it had weight. In this movie they move way too fast for how big they are, they are super nimble compared to the 2014 slow and weighty one.
One problem they both have is the humans suck, but if you had a problem with how fleshed out the humans were in the 2014 one, you will hate this one more. To me this movie's humans are so boring and if this movie was like the 2014 one with no monsters until the end it would be miserable.
I'll give the movie this, the monsters fighting is really cool and strangely beautiful in some instances. If this movie was mostly humans like the 2014 one I would hate it, but i like this one. I dont think I'll buy it on blu ray unlike me buying the 2014 one almost immediately.
TLDR: I personally still think that 2014 is a better movie all together, both have huge problems with its human characters but this one has more problems with it. The lack of weight and scale to the monster fights were a big problem for me. The monsters were way too nimble and fast for how big they were. But I'll say that's because the director isnt know for his scale and all that. I feel like Gareth Edwards shouldve directed this. See this in theaters if you can. 2014 had a lack of Godzilla, and that made it so that when he was on screen it was arguably the best Godzilla we've had, keep in mind I've only seen the og and the first American one, if you hated Godzilla 2014 for its lack of Godzilla then you will love this. Oh and the human characters are way worse than the 2014 one.","20 out of 41 found this helpful."

I love the concept of massive creatures that dwarf us. Something that started with my fascination of dinosaurs when I was a kid.
But to say that this movie was a disappointment is a gross understatement! Where are the good story tellers in Hollywood?!The Good:
1. Soundtrack
2. Sound Editing
3. Last minute of the final battle.The OK:
1. Monster design - Nothing spectacular. Especially did not like the design of the main antagonist. Seemed less organic and more of direct attempt to copy a certain design of a certain mythological beast.
2. Cinematography - Nothing new here. Broad sweeps of large areas and landscape, etc.
3. The conclusion.The Bad:
1. Side characters: Seems like the only reason most the side characters to exist was to fill a diversity and gender quota, to pay lip service to current trends. Just give them a few scenes with some dialogue and voila! Job done!
2. Obligatory side characters: ""Hey, we don't have a wise cracking guy..."" - Points randomly at a guy "" You be that guy. And be a .. I don't know...lead scientist. To justify your role.""
3. Dialogue: From the one liners to the nonsensical reactionary conversations, all seem to be very childish with little thought put into it.
4. Main characters: I like some of the actors, but the source material and direction was bad enough to make them seem poor at their jobs.
5. Obligatory roles: It's like the screenwriter/director had a checklist of things needed to do: Gender diversity. Check. Ethnic diversity. Check. Noble sacrificial situation/character. Check. Main character in bad situation to be saved. Check. Etc. Not the worst checklist, but even that didn't help.The Horrible:
1. Character motivations: Nonsensical, poorly portrayed and explained. And the decisions the supposedly intelligent people make are clearly not people with common sense do. Which leads to the next point.
2. Character Settings: The way this movie was likely made. The director/screenwriter wanted to create a tense situation. Doesn't matter if it makes logical sense for the actors involved, make them do stupid things, create an artificially charged situation, and then let them constantly survive again and again when they should have died in the first instance. Want to make us care for the main characters? Same modus operandi.The Unforgivable:
1. Contrivance: If there was ever a category at the Oscars for Contrivance, this movie would get it. If there was ever a Nobel Prize category for Contrivance this would win it! It's that bad. Right from the very first scene , till the end. It keeps getting hammered into the audiences face again and again and again!Honestly, it seemed like the movie was written/directed by a young child who doesn't exactly understand the basic elements of story telling. I didn't care for any of the characters, even those portrayed by actors I like! Even the few monster battles felt unepic for the most part, and dragged on. The main characters getting into impossibly dangerous situations like idiots, and surviving when they shouldn't have. Again and again and again.Never again will I watch a movie made by this director and screenwriter. I can do without the torture. Please don't suffer like I did!","180 out of 294 found this helpful."

Probably overkill on the ideas and tie-ins to the previous movies, but I still really liked this movie a ton. I had an incredible amount of fun and satisfaction of how much screen time both Godzilla and other kaiju had.The gist of this sequel is: 5 years (in real time, as well) passed since Godzilla's ""first"" appearance and not a word from any titan...but, of course, Congress is bent on doing more damage to the Monster University, Monarch, than any giant creature. Simultaneously, humans from both sides of all issues fight for their say while the monsters rise for dominance. Now (us as the audience): Let them fight.The movie's hardly perfect and mostly gets weighed down from the bickering humans and a too-long subplot of getting one's daughter back. Not to mention everyone's motivations take waaay too long to realize and when explained, it's hard to know where to side, period.But, like in any Godzilla or kaiju movie, we're not here for the characters. I just always pray, they don't dominate 95% of the screen time away from Godzilla and pals like they did in that terrible Shin Godzilla flick. Here, it was probably 60/40% in favor of the humans. What we saw in that 40% was all I wanted as my little inner-boy was all starry-eyed in wonder. Finally the Godzilla movies I saw as a kid came to life on the big screen with the best CGI money can buy.Yes, this, the 2014 Godzilla and Kong's latest outing have incredible special effects and a huge plus in seeing all the previous movies made with the proper technology. And, now, going back to my Japan quip...Shin Godzilla, which came out post-2014 Godzilla, had some of the WORST effects I've seen since Sharknado. I am completely baffled that Japan, the originator of Godzilla, would take gigantic leaps backwards while the USA, an imitator, takes massive leaps forward. There wasn't a single scene in the Monarch trilogy that I didn't believe was happening as if it were made practically.Yes, some of the puny human scenes were distracting, but I didn't come for them. I came for a big bulk of giant fights and giants, in general. I was not let down. Before I even saw this, I had already planned my second viewing: taking my dad for Father's Dad. His and my idea combined. And I simply can't wait to see this again......or King vs. King when Kong shows up to battle Godzilla next year. THAT will be another edge of my seat experience.***Final thoughts: Talk about Easter Eggs!! They're practically begging me to actually do that 35-movie marathon with how much they crammed in here for homage to the franchise. The post-credit scene alone is jam-packed with many interesting things to see/read, but it all goes fast. I was already going to buy this on Blu when it comes out, but now it's a must just so I can pause it to absorb more of the movie's radiation...of goodies!","13 out of 25 found this helpful."

I was so hyped form this movie yes even more excited than freaking endgame to see my four favorite monsters on the big screen . Also we needed a good Godzilla movie after Godzilla the planet eater which sucks and is my least favorite in the entire series . But this is easily my favorite in the godzilla movie in the monster verse series by far. It feel the most epic and huge . Also this movies is more fast paced than the previous movie and the monsters are it a lot more than the previous movie. The characters are good but a step from the characters from the previous movie . The music is freaking amazing they use old tracks from the older movies for godzilla and mothra which sounded so freaking great. Bear McCreary really did excellent job . Unfortunately we don't hear the themes for rodan and ghidorah but sill the music was still amazing . The design of the monsters where great as well . Godzilla is the same as he was in the previous movie but his spikes have changed to look more like the classic spikes and his feet didn't look like elephant feet this time around . Rodan was freaking amazing this is the best rodan (rodan , ghidorah the three headed monster, invasion of Astro monster , destroy all monsters, godzilla vs mechagodzilla 2, godzilla final wars ,and godzilla king of the monsters)we've seen since 1956 . Also i like how he comes out of a volcano and his fire on him . Also the scence were he's chasing the monarch base was really really well done . Mothra (mothra 1961,mothra vs godzilla , ghidorah the three headed monster , EBIRAH horror of the deep , destroy all monsters ,godzilla vs mothra, godzilla vs spacegodzilla , rebirth of mothra ,rebirth of mothra 2.rebirth of mothra 3, GMK, godzilla Tokyo sos,godzilla final wars, godzilla the planet eater ,and godzilla king of the monsters ) looks good , i do like how she looks more realistic than some of her previous design . Unfortunately mothra and rodan aren't in the movie that much was was a little disappointing because the movie focuses more on godzilla and king ghidorah but still it was nice to see them. Finally king ghidorah (ghidorah the three headed monster , invasion of Astro monster, destroy all monsters, godzilla vs gigan , godzilla vs king ghidorah , GMK,godzilla final wars , godzilla the planet eater ,and godzilla king of the monsters )was amazing . This is easily the best versions of the characters in the entire series . He was huge and massive he really felt like a threat in this movie. Also i loved how the heads had personalities. I do like the Easter eggs they have in this movie which you have to be a die hard godzilla fan to get all the references. The final battle was amazing this is the best looking godzilla fight i mean its not my favorite but still freaking amazing . I highly recommend to watch this movie right freaking now","6 out of 10 found this helpful."

The monster scenes and battles are glorious thanks to incredible CGI and director Mike Dougherty's love and knowledge of all things Godzilla. The human element is just fine despite what some critics have said and they move the story along while giving you a sense of scale regarding the apocalyptic consequences. Ken Watanabe as Serizawa again is magnificent, Kyle Chandler and Millie Bobbi Brown do a wonderful job of showing a family in strife after the fallout from Gareth Edwards' 2014 Godzilla in San Francisco. The supporting cast does a nice job of conveying fear, laughter and what it's like to suddenly be aligned with a Titan. You should see this on the biggest screen possible to enhance your experience as I've said the Monsters are breathtaking and are definitely an achievement in filmmaking. You truly believe these are living creatures walking among us. Definite 10/10 for me.

I only seen the American Godzilla movies and I tried watching Godzilla Vs Mothra. I own Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island on DVD, they're not barebones.I enjoyed Godzilla: King of the Monsters, it's a fun monster movie. I honestly prefer the other MonsterVerse movies but I may reconsider. Godzilla himself has plenty of screentime, you don't have to wait long to see him. People were naturally disappointed his role was small in the reboot, I knew about it going in because of FaceBook.Apparently people complained about the reboot's lack of action because this movie is action packed, the first action scene begins around the ten minute mark. The action scenes are fun but the second one was filmed a little closely and the third one was bland. The visuals are gorgeous but we know that from the trailers. I think the reboot's visuals were fine.Like most blockbusters, the characters are boring. Kyle Chandler and Vera Fermiga plays scientists and a divorced couple. Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things plays their daughter, a brave girl interested in science. Aaron Taylor-Johnson doesn't return but Ken Watanbe does. The acting was fine, I think Millie gives the best performance.Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a fun monster movie, I'm not sure if it's good though. I just moved so I was a little stressed. If you love Godzilla, you will see it sooner or later. If you love action movies like myself, you should see it at least once. Godzilla Vs Kong comes out in March 2020, it should be fun.","5 out of 8 found this helpful."

The monsters themselves, especially Mothra, come alive in great detail.Michael Dougherty clearly listened to the viewers who complained about the lack of 'Zilla in the 2014 movie, and to make up for that there is Godzilla galore in this sequel. King of the Monsters isn't as subtle or as restrained as Gareth Edwards' version but here the pace is faster, the action bigger and louder whilst the acting, especially from Ken Watanabe, is competent.The story however, is convoluted and absolutely ludicrous at times, and it was annoying to see characters globe trotting off screen between China and Antarctica and then Mexico and Boston of all places. Not only that but some of the monsters, especially Rodan, were completely wasted despite their prevalence in the trailers. These however, are small niggles.Anyone who wants to watch Godzilla wants to see monsters smashing the hell out of each other and for that you couldn't ask for more with this movie.","5 out of 8 found this helpful."

However, it soon becomes clear that the people meant to be protecting both humanity and the 'Titans' may have an ulterior agenda, and it's up to those who discover their manipulations to thwart their plans and give all life on earth a fighting chance.While a fair bit of the screenplay doesn't stand up to intense scrutiny, and some character decisions/plot points make absolutely zero sense, I still found it be a lot less convoluted than the 2014 redux, and a hell of a lot more coherent than the 70's set prequel. Once more, the screenwriters have a fair bit to say about the effects of the anthropocene on the planet, and while this is far more broadly laboured than in either of the first two movies, in this era of climate emergency and environmental crisis, it feels right that this message is as subtle as a 100ft behemoth crashing through a high rise.The human performances, for the most part are fine, and while the characters can feel thinly sketched, and very fine actors like Hawkins and Watanabe feel slightly wasted in underwritten roles, Oscar worthy turns aren't really the reason why people are going to see this movie.At the end of the day, it's all about the Titans going toe to toe, and on that level GKIM works magnificently. The cinematography and production design is superb, and the CGI really pushes the boundaries of what is possible within the genre. Each of the Titans felt like a rounded, individual entity, with true personality coming through in each interaction. Shot after shot left me truly gobsmacked, and unlike more corporate product released so far this year, GKIM really has a style and aesthetic which stands out amongst so many forgettable effects laden epics. Big props to the sound design team are due as well, some of the unearthly cacophonies unleashed by these beasts are truly terrifying.Overall, while GKIM doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to either the creature feature or disaster genre, it does do spectacular service to both tropes. If you're willing to check your brain in at the box office and go along for the bonkers ride, you may just find yourself having a hell of a lot of fun watching Big Atom Breath and his Gigantic Chums tear shreds off of Mother Earth. I know I did. (7.5)","5 out of 8 found this helpful."

and then we can talk about the visual, i'll say the last movie is better, cause when you say those monsters are god-like existences, then they are supposed to be mysterious and incredibly big, so the last movie did a great job by covering godzilla in fog and don't show the whole body of it. even though some people didn't like it, but i thought by doing that, they rendered the atmosphere really well.
now this one also did a great job but not as good as the last one, my favorite moments are those in which the monsters were fogged in the cloud and strom. but when they fight, it got kinda cheesy, you will immediately notice that they seem smaller and basically there's just two beasts biting each other, the fight scenes dissolved the mysterious and the solemn vibe that they put on the monsters.","8 out of 15 found this helpful."

The focus should be on the monsters and while there is more screen time devoted to them in this sequel, there is still way too much time spent following dull human characters. Any time a cool fight scene occurs, the film cuts away to the dumb humans and takes you out of the action.

Tick. Electricity-breathing three-headed dragon. Tick. Gargantuan luminescent moth and behemoth aircraft-eating pterodactyl. Tick and tick. All of the above battling for supremacy in our modern cities. Tick. If this all sounds as riveting as your list of chores for the weekend, then you can quickly and safely assume this movie isn't for you. If, on the other hand, that catalogue of mayhem-causing monsters gets you excited then this sequel could be right up your alley. Doubling down on the gigantic-scale action of 2014's Godzilla (and, well, every Godzilla movie), this follow-up ditches the slow-burn build up and cranks out set-piece after set-piece at a rapid rate, seemingly introducing a new element into each sequence. It occasionally suffers from Transformers style action - choppy camerawork, rampant editing and fuzzy CGI - but it thankfully minimises this in favour of monumental wide shots that artfully display the titans or in extreme close-ups that accentuate the enormous size disparity with humans. The sound design is once again on point too, the thunderous roars and penetrating shrieks reverberating through your body whilst Zilla's radiation-charging power-ups instantly gets the adrenaline pumping. Although kicking big goals in the action/spectacle department, the dramatic narrative filler is a major hurdle, particularly when it bloats the runtime to over two hours. Swapping out the Ford family from the first instalment for the equally boring Russell's here, the over-seriousness in which their familial turmoil plays out is completely misjudged and unnecessary. Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler and Millie Bobby Brown are all decent actors, but they're regularly asked to make the dumbest decision available to them and sell it like they're in an Oscar contender.

Giant monster fights Vs other Giant monsters, and not surprisingly, people, cities and everything else gets squished in the process. As before there are some people running around to let you know where the action is and what the name is of the current onscreen beasty. They are all fine with the little they have to work with - mostly an awe inspired stare. Still nice to see that Millie Bobby Brown can do good work with limited opportunity. As for everything it's all pretty good, though I do wish they had managed to incorporate the Clair de Lune music into the film, that was used to such great effect in the trailer. Effects are all first class, maybe a bit more variety in the design of the ""bad"" monsters would have helped, and on a personal note much preferred Gareth Edwards fleet glimpse of the creatures, rather than the full on in your face option here. Still it does what's its supposed to on the monster fight side, and there are some wonderfully composed shots with these behemoths framed against a firey background.","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

After Edwards' gorgeous launch of this cinematic world with Godzilla 2014, I was hyped for this installment. Overall, I'm satisfied with the presentation, not so much with the depth.Visually the film looks great. The CGI is well done although inconsistent. We get a lot more of Godzilla which fixes the biggest issue of Godzilla 2014. The Titans he goes up against look great as well. As far as creature designs go I have little to complain about.The big issue with the film is the character roster. There're just too much characters to keep track of and to get invested in. Vera Farmiga and Milly Bobby Brown do their job in carrying the plot but the talent on display can't distract you from the absurd plot of the flick. The need to include such a convoluted and far-fetched narrative baffles me. There's no need to stretch a plot so very thin in a Godzilla film. The Gareth Edwards venture handled this aspect far better.Godzilla 2 delivers in the action department. It's well shot and well executed. The cinematography took a noticeable hit compared to the 2014 installment and was therefor a bit disappointed.Overall Godzilla King of Monsters does enough to keep fans of the 2014 Godzilla satisfied but not enough to attract new fans to the theater.","7 out of 13 found this helpful."

I've seen the original Gojira film from 1954, the awful American remake in 1998, and the 2014 version, which kicked off this new run of films that Warner Bros. hopes to make into a giant franchise, crossing over with King Kong. With all of that out of the way, I was going into this sequel hoping for some monster action that far exceeded its predecessor. It may be the fact that only briefly knew the names of these others monsters throughout the film, but having not seen the classic franchise, seeing them for the first time here was quite the spectacle. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is by no means perfect, but I believe it's worth seeing for the visuals alone.Loosely following Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) as they plan to slowly release each new found monster one by one, they're caught in a bind when things begin to go astray and every one of them is released at once. With the falling out of their family in the past, Madison must decide if her father or mother is truly the one on the right side of things. Aside from that, this movie is all about the spectacle of giant monsters fighting, with a clear set-up that will eventually lead to the film Godzilla vs. Kong next year. If you can invest yourself in the numerous overblown action sequences, then this is the movie for you.The human characters are throwaways, even though I would like to put an asterisk next to Millie Bobby Brown's name. Although she is given some of the worst dialogue in the movie (and there is a lot of that to go around at times), she is a fantastic young actress that will only continue to strengthen her ability to steal the show as time goes on. The humans throughout the course of Godzilla: King of the Monsters really do feel like plot devices or stereotypical scientists just so that these monsters have a logical reason for being released to fight. For that reason, I found no possible way to fall in love with this movie at all.That being said, the promotional material for this movie has been promising a lot of action and a lot of action is what is presented here. There are some massive throwdowns and the CGI is quite impressive as well. On top of the action, this is a very well-shot film by cinematographer Lawrence Sher. Yes, the visual effects definitely add to his shot composition, but there are some beautiful images sprinkled throughout this film, making a few moments during the battle scenes feel like a piece of art.In the end, Godzilla: King of the Monsters put the human characters in the back seat in terms of development, which works out in terms of presenting numerous action scene, but ultimately feels slightly hollow at times because of that. From the very nice score that gave me chills at times, to the visual effects actually impressing me quite a bit, I was able to forgive many of the flaws here. That's not something I usually say, so I'm giving quite a bit of praise to the overall look of the film and the spectacle that goes along with it. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a good movie with many issues, but I really would recommend it to action/monster movie fans.","5 out of 9 found this helpful."

And so we have Godzilla II: King Of The Monsters: the third installment in Legendary Pictures' MonsterVerse, following Godzilla (2014) and Kong: Skull Island (2017). It's easily the most ambitious film yet, uniting several classic critters straight out of Godzilla lore and finding pretty much any excuse to have them fight one another. The final result is both bold and bonkers - good and bad, often in the very same moment.THE STORY: Monsters break stuff, including people. It's a fact of life that the broken Russell family must deal with after Godzilla's epic battle leaves downtown San Francisco in ruins. Grieving and newly sober, Mark (Kyle Chandler) stalks wolf packs in another part of the world. Emma (Vera Farmiga), his ex-wife, continues to work on the Orca, a machine they created together that can emit soundwaves capable of calming or infuriating Godzilla-scale monsters. Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), their precocious daughter, is caught in between - especially when Emma's decision to use the Orca sets off a chain of monstrous events that could lead to the end of the world as we know it.THE GOOD: The concept at the heart of Godzilla II, quite frankly, is off-the-wall wacky - so bold and audacious and weird that you have to give director/co-screenwriter Michael Dougherty some credit for effort, even if his execution of it is somewhat lacklustre. This is no mere story of monsters raining mayhem down upon mankind. Instead, the film moves its mythology quite firmly into the realm of faith; Godzilla, the film suggests, is as much god as monster. It's actually quite remarkable to see a mainstream blockbuster movie embrace - rather than shy away from - religious iconography, folding in theologies and environmental philosophies from Greek myth to Thanos. As such, Godzilla and his arch-nemesis, King Ghidorah (a three-headed Hydra-esque dragon beast), aren't just having their version of a bar-room brawl - their earth-shaking clash is a battle for the survival of humanity.THE NOT-SO-GOOD: It's a shame that the film as a whole can't keep up with its high-concept ideas. The writing ranges from inspired to insipid, with character motivations dancing ridiculously back and forth - dictated mostly by the rather demented plot. As a director, Dougherty exhibited some skill with subversive comedy in cult horror flick Krampus, but very little of that is evident here. It's not just about sacrificing soul for scale - Dougherty occasionally struggles with telling such a massive story in visual terms. Some of the film's action sequences are so choppy as to be downright confusing. It doesn't help that Dougherty's preferred aesthetic tends towards the grey and grim, which makes it even harder to figure out just what is going on while monsters are duking it out in frustratingly murky lighting.THE MONSTER MASH: The first Godzilla film in the franchise suffered for shoving its titular monster into the background, having him play second fiddle to human characters who weren't all that well-written to begin with. Godzilla II tries to rectify that, somewhat, by flinging so many monsters at the screen that you'd be almost glad to get back to the human drama after a while. Apart from Godzilla and Ghidorah, fans will be glad to see old-school Toho favourites like Mothra and Rodan in action too. (If they could actually see them, that is. Seriously - the monsters are beautifully rendered, but the bruise-toned lighting does them no favours.)GOD(ZILLA)-LEVEL CASTING: If Dougherty learned one thing from his predecessor, Gareth Edwards, it's the importance of casting a bunch of top-notch character actors in an otherwise barmy creature feature. Veteran performers like Oscar nominee Farmiga, West Wing alumnus Whitford and Charles Dance (that's Tywin Lannister to you) reel off awkward exposition and pseudo-scientific claptrap (""bio-acoustics"", ""the Oxygen Destroyer"") like it's actual real human dialogue. It's quite remarkable to see Friday Night Lights' Coach Eric Taylor in action anti-hero mode, but Chandler - just as Bryan Cranston did in the 2014 film - brings an everyman weight to a character whose narrative arc is muddled, to say the least. The MVP here, though, is Brown. She brings to Madison the same soulful blend of toughness and tenderness that made her such a breakout star in Netflix's Stranger Things.RECOMMENDED? It depends. Godzilla II is a hot mess... but it's a fascinating hot mess, and surprisingly fun to watch and even think about.","16 out of 40 found this helpful."

Just wow. What a complete disaster of a....""film"" which it doesn't even deserve that title. Where to start? The movie starts off absolutely ridiculous. Very unrealistic scene that didn't make any sense. There are lot of scenes in the movie that literally just made no sense at all. The fight scenes were awful. They barely showed the monsters fighting and focused more on the human characters. In the middle of a fight scene I don't care what the humans are doing. The humans are literally right in the middle of the monster fight scene, right next to them and flames, shards, everything is flying around the human characters but yet none of them got injured or hurt all. Very unrealistic. The fight scenes were also very dark, and no this wasn't my tv. The scenes were literally dark, I had to turn the brightness up just to see what was going on. Horrible graphics. It was like I was watching a bad cartoon. Godzilla had no detail features. He literally looked like just a dark blob. The girl from ""stranger things"" is so bad in it. I never realized how bad of an actor she was. She was calling all the shots in the film which was just stupid. Her mother in the film was doing a ton of things that no mother would do and that made NO SENSE. The 2014 Godzilla film was pretty good overall and the fight scenes were great, but it was nothing to brag about. This film makes the 2014 film Oscar worthy. This is definitely one of the worst films I've seen in a very very long time. It was torture having to sit through it for 2 hours and 10 minutes. The. Only reason we kept watching it was because we want to see the new Godzilla vs. Kong which is a follow up to this 2019 Godzilla film and Kong: Skull Island (which was amazing by the way. Highly recommend Kong: Skull Island). If you can spare yourself from watching this movie just fast forward it until the end. Wish we would have done that.","8 out of 10 found this helpful."

But that was a Japanese movie while Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an American film that rather follows the gloomy Godzilla released five years earlier that was overall convincing despite a few lengths. This movie here rather compares to the shallow Kong: Skull Island and offers a brainless but entertaining spectacle.To be honest, this new film is rated so positively because the special effects are astonishing, the pace is breathtaking and the monsters look amazing. Godzilla gets defeated on two occasions but always manages to come back stronger than before. The return of King Ghidorah is spectacular and the monster convinces as giant antagonist. Rodan is also featured in a few scenes but far from being the most spectacular monster. Mothra's appearance is somewhat disappointing as the legendary character only appears for a few scenes and fails to impress.The story however is insultingly ridiculous. It features many plot holes and the characters are constantly making stupid decisions. One can't expect performances worthy of Academy Awards of course but the characters in this film are particularly irrational, shallow and unlikable. Especially the Russell family is quite annoying. The mother is willing to sacrifice humanity because she can't cope with the loss of her son. Her daughter follows her blindly, constantly risking her own life and those of others around her. The father is arrogant, grumpy and headstrong as he ignores orders and thinks he is cleverer than anyone else. One couldn't care less about such antipathic characters.In the end, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the kind of film that invites to switch your brain off and enjoy a colourful, effect-ridden and fast-paced spectacle. This film is great for what it is but might only be memorable for young audiences and those who aren't familiar with the legendary franchise. Some of the old Japanese movies were also quite silly but the original Godzilla: King of the Monsters which was released sixty-five years ago is still more thought-provoking, realistic and dramatic than this high-budget Hollywood flick. Hollywood should leave this Japanese franchise alone and Western cinemas should have the courage to show films like Shin Godzilla in the future.","4 out of 7 found this helpful."

For one, GODZILLA IS ACTUALLY IN THE FRIGGIN MOVIE! Gareth Edwards is NOT a good film maker. Rogue One suffers from the same stigma that Godzilla 2014 does, awful, paper-thin characters that you don't give a crap about.King of the Monsters suffers from the same issue of terrible human characters, but it improves so much with the visual effects and the amount of monster battles in it. Scored only on the effects and monster fights, this would easily be a 9/10. But sadly the human half of the story isn't good at all. The script in this needed so much more work.It's hard to believe that within the 5 year gap that this is the best script they could come up with. They try hard to make the characters likeable, but they're just boring. Millie Bobby Brown does the best she can with what little material she is given, but her character is just a kid in distress the whole movie. Kyle Chandler is a unsung movie legend and I am glad he is in more big movies, but his character isn't interesting in the slightest. Mostly he just says over and over that we need to kill the Titans. Vera Farmiga's character motivation also just makes no sense at all. It's sad that all of this talent was wasted on some of the most mediocre material.Visually this movie knocks it our of the park. All the monsters and destruction looks fantastic. They really capture the scale and size of these titans. The action is big and bombastic and you can actually tell what is going on. The cinematography is stunning and really adds more visual depth to the monsters fighting.We shall see how Kong v Godzilla turns out. I hope the human story is actually a good one and is well written. The action in this is good, but I don't think I'll be interested to see Kong v Godzilla if it's only merit is the action and visual effects.","4 out of 7 found this helpful."

I had the pleasure of seeing it in IMAX, and then 4DX, and the screenings nearly brought me to tears with how great they were. 4DX especially is something I never imagined I'd even be able to experience. Every footstep is felt, the gust from Ghidorahs wings are felt, splashes of water that comes from Godzilla rising out the ocean all makes you feel like you're in the action. It's a thing of beauty. Though I'd recommend watching the film in IMAX first, as to not get distracted by the 4D elements,Ghidorah is awesome and full of personality. I was worried that they wouldn't be able to emphasise that each head has their own personality, but they do a great job. The middle head is the alpha and really pushes the other two heads. The pacing is ok, the final act escalated extremely quickly. The first 20 minutes or so are quite slow, but necessary for the plot. The characters weren't bad like many of the critics would say, there are a handful of emotional moments throughout the film, it's just that they weren't given much to do outside of stand in a room and talk, though I really do want to see these characters flushed out in the next entry.All in all, King Of The Monsters is a film of EPIC proportions, 2019's true BLOCKBUSTER. Through the criticisms, this film is still a labour of love from fans of the genre FOR fans of the genre, and it shows. Many critics won't understand the references, or what they were going for when making the film, but they definitely succeeded in what they set out to do.","5 out of 6 found this helpful."

"","","Hail GODZILLA, KING OF MONSTERS, baby!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4901341/?ref_=tt_urv","skywalking997","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31936361/?ref_=tt_urv","31 May 2019","Sometimes, as Freud has probably been egregiously and recklessly misquoted for, a cigar is just a cigar. This is also true of movies, and it is something that a lot of high-falutin' film criti-mi-cisms frequently forget, or choose to overlook. Godzilla - King of Monsters is a well crafted movie that accomplishes what it probably means too - in that it creates a world of giant monsters (or, to use the preferred nomenclature from of the movie - titans) and lets them wale on one another for a couple of hours.This is not rocket science; but it does make for a fun time at the movie theatre.The movie is careful to create a certain ebb and flow to the titanic slug-fests, and like any action movie there is a back and forth build-up between the two primary antagonists (Godzilla and King Ghidorah, the later being a three headed dragon and the former being, well, Godzilla) with a few lighter skirmishes, building ultimately toward the epic, final grudge match. Along the way, various other Titans get to peek in for a look a the goings-on, with Mothra and Rodan (the later a semi-flaming, semi-Pretandon, and the former a semi-moth) getting the most secondary screen-time, and contributing to the final smack-down in their own ways.The movie also folds in a nice environmental message, which is fitting to the overall, original conceit of Godzilla, in that he was a menace that humans had awakened through careless use of atomic power - in this westernized version, the Titans are a course-correction brought forth by the planet itself, in order to reverse the environmental horror-show that we are creating in the world. This is not a point labored unnecessarily, but it is highlighted sufficiently as to ensure that it lands. Interestingly, and after years of Hollywood's infatuation with large scale destruction, King of Monsters also takes some time to go back to the scene of the 2014 film's cinematic carnage to underscore that, in the wake of that destruction, life and nature have flourished - which is a nice nod to the idea that the films are not, ultimately, about the apocalyptic end-times, but rather a natural renewal - if we could see our way toward a sort of balanced co-existence with the planet, as here characterized by the Titans.Understandably, much of the narrative lifting is done by the Titans themselves, and the human characters are along mainly to string the plot together and keep everyone (including the viewers) up to date on why and where things are happening. In this, the human cast is pretty good overall - especially Vera Farminga, who is somewhat underused, but has a fascinating character arc, and probably should have been more central to the story, as hers is the most interesting narrative journey, by far. Ken Watanabe (returning from the 2014 'Zilla) brings requisite weight and gravity to his role, but like in the prior film, seems (still) sadly underutilized. Millie Bobby Brown (of Stranger Things fame) is solid as well.There was, truthfully, no one in the film that you really wanted to die - unlike, say, all of the Jurassic Park movies, most of which had characters in them that you really wanted to see eaten by the dinosaurs (""hero"" characters, I mean, not the ones that are intended to be dino-fodder), The most regrettable of the lead characters, in King of Monsters is actually the male lead, who seems to be the eternal answer to every question that no one ever wanted to ask, in a manner of speaking. He spends the entire film being able to do everything, and provide the ""right"" answer to every situation. He is literally without flaws, and has no character growth whatsoever - barring, I suppose, a rather impatient ""they all should die"" impulse toward the Titans, which ""grows"" to ""ehhh, Titans"" by the end of the film. He is almost, by definition, a complete Mary Sue - and while he was not an annoying character, he was badly overused in virtually every situation.Would that they have made him a little bit less central, and shifted some of his screen time toward Farminga and Ken Watanabe, the film might have carried its human elements with a bit more panache. Still and all, the movie is a good time, and it deftly alludes to the franchise future, particularly with regard to the (looming) Godzilla vs. Kong, which will follow along in due time. It also does some neat things with tying in allusions to various myths and legends throughout history, implying/suggesting that most are rooted in a time lost to the mists of time, in which people and the Titans co-existed, which is a neat concept, and if handled well, could allow the fledgling Monster-verse to flex out into some intriguing directions. It even casts some aspersions to (potentially) the idea of a hollow Earth, and/or Atlantis, which again, if explored in the future, could make for some interesting stories.A good time will be had by all, so let them fight ...","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

Too much info is packed in with too much CGI action and it shows a lot, but Godzilla is truly some star power and he does not let down when he gets on the screen.

Directed by Michael Dougherty (Krampus), it is a loud, explosive continuation of the MonsterVerse that delivers just what it promises, both good and bad.Five years after the events of 2014 film, the giant monster Godzilla has been closely tracked by the top secret agency known as ""Monarch"". From what Monarch has observed, Godzilla has no personal interest in purposely hurting humans and only intends to reaffirm his status as King of the Monsters. However, one day the giant three-headed extraterrestrial monster King Ghidorah is awoken from his frozen tomb in Antarctica and sets out to challenge Godzilla's supremacy in an all out fight to the death. To make matters worse, other ancient monsters reawaken as well, including Mothra the flying insectoid and Rodan the Pteranodon, causing mass destruction around the world. With the ever growing challengers for dominance showing up one by one, Godzilla fights his way through his opponents to try reclaiming his place as King, all the while humanity can only watch on in horror.As an improvement over its predecessor, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is pure fanservice for any hardcore fan of the franchise and provides just enough entertainment for newcomers. One common complaint about the 2014 film was Godzilla's lack of screentime and general slow pace. Thankfully, the filmmakers appear to listened to feedback as this film fixes most of that with its quick over-the-top action scenes and, as a result, it is never boring. Unfortunately, most of the human characters are one-dimensional and forgettable. Most of the time, they are only there for the purposes of exposition or to spout some cliched dialogue (""May God have mercy on us all!""). Despite this, the action is fantastic enough to forgive some of it. Watching these iconic giant beasts fight to the death while causing collateral damage to nearby buildings is still incredibly satisfying to see on the big screen. Audiences must also remember that films like this are made as enjoyable popcorn entertainment and not on an intellectual basis. Personally, I place this film in the ""guilty pleasures"" category, alongside the likes of Independence Day and Jurassic World. Be sure to stay after the credits for a bonus scene likely related to the upcoming ""Godzilla vs. Kong""I rate it 7/10","3 out of 5 found this helpful."

And how the director (Gareth Edwards) made the specific choice to keep cutting away from shots of Godzilla in favor of the human story involving Elizabeth Olsen & Aaron Taylor-Johnson? Well, I'm not pleased to say Michael Dougherty took that criticism and threw it out the window. Instead of 25-30 minutes of screentime like it was in 2014, Godzilla is in this film for about 35-45 minutes. He doesn't even enter the film until 40 minutes in, takes a nap in the middle act, and has a pretty cool final fight with Ghidorah. And that's basically your movie. I understand having a human side to these stories is essentially unavoidable, but then don't spend millions on great actors, cut down the runtime, and spend the remaining budget on more CGI monsters. Or better yet, stop making the same dang story with these 'classic' monsters around them. 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters' is pretty close to a train wreck.3.5/1","45 out of 79 found this helpful."

The flaw is , in which the first part was stronger, are the characters. There are just very few you really care about or are properly developed.
Kyle Chandler is not really changing his facial expression throughout the whole film. Also Vera Farming has seen much stronger days in her career. Ken Watanabe Is very cartoonish in general. Sally Hawkins was rather useless which was the biggest waste of the entire film. I liked Ziyi Zhang who finally got a role in a Hollywood film again and the best part of the film was Millie Bobby Brown.
The screenplay deserved more work besides the character development as well but for the fact that it purely concentrated on the fight scenes between the titans it was fine enough as it offered many epic moments.","3 out of 5 found this helpful."

The title is Godzilla, but most of the film has nothing to do with it. The storytelling is uneven and highly problematic. Human drama is faulty, unnecessarily long, and does not possess any sense of credibility. The large-scale set pieces and monster fight sequences are sensational but too short. To the end, the film cannot explain why Godzilla is the king of monsters, which just begs the question.","8 out of 20 found this helpful."

The story: TERRIBLE. From the start, the script was all over the place. I wasn't even sure what I was watching. My friend went to toilets and when he returned and asked what he missed I said honestly like... nothing. It was that bad. The family's story was weird and uncompelling. The scientist who freed the Hydra monster had such a terrible plot that it was sadly laughable! And all along the movie was desperately missing a reliable hero that will make us care.
The battles: phenomenal. The monsters were designed very well and they were scary. Godzilla was majestic and the three headed Hydra was frightening to say the least!
Movie set and atmosphere: another thing the movie lacked is the set. It felt very claustrophobic. We were missing all the effect on people's lives with the monsters, the news clips, the president reacting, REAL PEOPLE. The only people we saw were the boring scientists inside the submarine, and boy was that daunting. Occasionally, we saw some people running from a monster with buildings falling over their heads but it just wasn't well made. The frame is a huge part of a movie and any good monster or disaster film must have a good frame to make it work, intimacy with the characters and their world. This film was too distant and paid too much attention to battles at sea without the human factor.Conclusion: long and daunting, with phenomenal battles between monsters, terrible plot and horrible characters.","4 out of 8 found this helpful."

"7","/10","A fairly run-of-the-mill blockbuster, but a vast improvement on the last film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4897045/?ref_=tt_urv","themadmovieman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39953227/?ref_=tt_urv","29 May 2019","I vividly remember just how disappointed I was with the last Godzilla, with all its promise of thrilling, moving blockbuster excitemenet brought falling down by a bland, empty and painfully slow reality. As a result, I had the lowest of expectations going into King Of The Monsters, so I'm glad to say that, for the most part, this sequel is far better than the original.While by no means perfect, and still a fairly run-of-the-mill blockbuster, King Of The Monsters at least introduces three-dimensional characters and writing that prove really engrossing at times. Couple that with yet more spectacular visual effects, bold directing and a wonderful musical score, and you have a film that's thoroughly entertaining at times, and a great improvement on one of the most disappointing blockbusters of recent years.So, the best place to start with this movie is the story, and although I can't say that it's a particularly thrilling or unpredictable one, I am happy to say that I had good fun with King Of The Monsters throughout. This time not relying entirely on a false sense of tension surrounding the illusive Godzilla, King Of The Monsters gives the titular titan a bigger role in the story, all the while crafting a narrative that makes the action flow a whole lot better.Last time, with the exception of that excellent opening act, the movie was pretty much a waiting game for Godzilla to turn up on screen and fight the big baddie in San Francisco. And that was about it. In the sequel, however, you have a number of different stories and characters that play into the eventual clash of Godzilla and the other titans, and while there's still that big, destructive action setpiece at the end as you'd expect, it comes about far more organically and as a result of mroe interesting storytelling that has developed throughout the film previously.The other big plus in the story department is the fact that there are a number of moderately interesting human characters as well. In the first film, Bryan Cranston was a brilliant lead, but he was killed off early and replaced with painfully bland characters played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen.In the sequel, we get a little more character intrigue and ambiguity - mostly surrounding Vera Farmiga's character - as well as more insight into the motivations of some of the scientists who have studied Godzilla for years, with Ken Watanabe's character being promoted from quippy side character to a genuinely interesting and important player.Having said that, I still can't say that the characterisation here is of the highest order, and while there is character intrigue and multi-dimensional development throughout, it comes in small pockets where one character or another has there most memorable moment, rather than working as a consistent stream of development and deepening intrigue through the whole film.What's more, the film once again really fails to nail down Godzilla's character in the way it wants to. Different from the unmatchable Japanese original, as well as Hollywood's terrible 90s reboot, this film tries to use Godzilla in a more interesting capacity than just a big, destructive monster. However, its idea of that is seeing him work in tandem with the human characters to defeat the evil monsters simply by turning up at random times just before a major character is about to die.It's nice to see Godzilla being used in this way through the whole movie (the last one did so towards the finale), but it's a repetitive and fairly lazy characterisation that grows tiring very quickly, and once again, this just doesn't feel like a great movie about Godzilla in the way that the Japanese original really is.And this where the comparisons with Warner Bros.'s related Kong: Skull Island come in. In Skull Island, King Kong was used in a fairly similar capacity, yet given a surprisingly riveting and engrossing personality that made him a major player in the story, rather than a random hulking monster who happens to turn up now and then to save the day.That's one of the areas where Godzilla: King Of The Monsters really pales in comparison to Kong: Skull Island, the other being that, while this is an entertaining movie, it still feels like a rather run-of-the-mill blockbuster.Director Michael Dougherty impresses a striking style onto King Of The Monsters, bringing dazzling cinematography together with a beautifully elegant score, but unlike Skull Island, this film just lacks the charisma and energy of a really great action movie.Skull Island had humour, intelligence and a brilliantly original premise - linking King Kong up with the Vietnam War - whereas King Of The Monsters is, for the most part, just a movie about saving the world from destruction again, with little more depth or secondary themes at play. It's a fun watch, don't get me wrong, but it won't ever stand up to films like Skull Island that bring more ideas into play, ultimately making this film still feel a little underwhelming.Overall, with improved dramatic depth and character intrigue, Godzilla: King Of The Monsters is eons better than its bland and painfully disappointing predecessor, all the while furthered by entertaining action, great visual effects and bold directing and music throughout. Unfortunately, though, it's still a bit of a generic action movie, paling in comparison to Kong: Skull Island, and often proving repetitive and predictable in a way that hurts the sheer blockbuster entertainment of it all, so that's why I'm giving it a 7.3 in the end.","6 out of 14 found this helpful."

So many conflicting feelings on this one. The trailers and posters looked amazing, yet the end result is disjointed. The promise of monster fights and stellar visuals are delivered. What takes the punch is the human story, which fails to be interesting and instead muddled. While I enjoyed what the 2014 film was going for, I was ultimately disappointed in both the execution of the premise and how little of the titular character was even featured. The Kaijus had personalities in the classic Japanese films - especially in the Showa era. Adding Ghidorah, Rodan and Mothra offers plenty of possibilities of monster interactions. Besides, they are the most iconic line-up. Ultimately not enough time is given for all of them to share the screen together. However, the scenes they get are terrific! They all get some fierce action moments which are the biggest highlights of the movie. Didn't care for all of the stupid conveniences and just how the human characters are handled in the plot. The exception is Ken Watanabe as Dr. Serizawa. That character was given respect. I especially liked how you saw some of the legacy from the original film shine through with his arc and how they concluded it by tributing the original Japanese work. It was also nostalgically amazing to hear the real Godzilla themes be used again. Finally!Right before the movie began two Aussies sitting next to me proclaimed that ""Godzilla is rad"". They were clearly fans since they picked up on all of the easter eggs and references. Which shows that the filmmakers know the preceding entries well and that they respect it. But at the same time that also baffles me because of some choices they went with. I don't care for all of the Titan talk. It's Kaijus, come on! Godzilla (plus some of the other monsters) were created due to the atom bombings and other nuclear tests. He wasn't a being from ancient times. They got it right Rodan and Mothra though. They shouldn't have changed too much from the already established mythology. You can instead expand it further, but here it's like they wanna simplify it for a wider audience. The human characters already explain too much and honestly I was getting tired of the military stuff. Go for some other perspectives. If you're gonna have the humans be so central, then spend more time with their development. And also, dial down on the jokes. Because that was distracting. The actual Kaijus, Serisawa, the visuals were a spectacle. Those are the aspects that prove that the movie works best on the big screen. If you're unfamiliar with the franchise, then you're gonna be lost. But for fans and admirers, you'll be happy with some of it. Still not quite there. I'm not hyped about the ""Godzilla vs. King Kong"" remake. If they don't get that one right... Well, then I'll be done with the MonsterVerse.","5 out of 11 found this helpful."

However, this film unfortunately fell into the same trap as the DCEU's Batman v. Superman: too much too quickly. Batman v. Superman was an attempt at a three-hour epic that dove into all sorts of aspects of DC mythology, introducing dozens of new characters along the way; however, that film was only preceded by Man of Steel, and as such it felt like the ""epic throwdown"" vibe the film pursued was entirely unearned. Similarly, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, attempted to accomplish far too much with too little background to support it-the introduction of three new major monsters (Ghidorah, Mothra, Rodan), around thirteen other minor monsters that will undoubtedly return in future films, the eco-terrorist organization led by Charles Dance's Jonah Alan, and the ORCA machine, to name a few plot devices the packed movie attempts to juggle.On top of this Batman-v.-Superman-esque blunder, there were a few other elements that detracted from my enjoyment. On a surface level, the entirely yellow-and-blue aesthetic of the movie had an unearthly feel that was a lot to get used to. The human characters were largely unconvincing and confusing, and did little to add emotional depth to the human side of the story. And most disappointingly, King of the Monsters lacked the same realistic and grittier nature of Godzilla (2014). The first chapter in the Monsterverse, no matter how ludicrous its plot, managed to retain a much more realistic and genuinely engaging aesthetic and tone, while King of the Monsters scrapped any facade of realism and dialed the crazy action-packed monster fighting up to an 11. In addition, the whole ""hollow earth theory"", while consistent with the previous two chapters in the franchise, felt silly and distracted from the plot more than it enhanced it.All that being said, however, I really did enjoy plenty about this movie. The monster design was a big part of it; each monster had a lot of character that, in many ways, made the monsters much more interesting than the human characters. The monster fight scenes were a lot of fun, and I don't believe they took up too much screen time, contrary to what some critics may say. There were plenty of easter eggs and throwbacks to keep Godzilla fans pleased. Ultimately, flaws set aside, it felt like the plot was packed, yet still enjoyable, complicated but not over-complicated, and sets up what will certainly be an interesting cinematic universe.And, on a final note, it was really nice to see the final battle take place in Boston, rather than NYC or San Francisco (for the zillionth time.)","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

There were multiple jaw dropping moments in awe of the fights and the shots of the monsters. There were also a lot more fights in this film. The cast, particularly Kyle Chandler and Millie Bobby Brown, gave good performances. However the plot of the film was lacking logistically, as in some of the choices made by the human characters were abrupt and didn't really make sense to the plot as a whole, they just kinda happened. There was also a lot of exposition, which isn't really an issue as long as there is a good story behind the movie but it was a bit much in this one. The human characters were somewhat forgettable and had little development, minus the return of Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins' characters from the first one and the Russell family. Like the Brody's in the first one, the most memorable characters were the Russell's. In comparison to the 2014 Godzilla, the first one was better if I'm being honest. The plot was better and while the memorableness of the characters were about the same, the first one had better development with the characters. Both gave the same awe and great visuals and action, and while there are more fights in this one both films had the same jaw dropping fights but the fights in this one were a bit better than the first film. Overall the first one was better.

Stunning visual graphics and excellent cinematography. There's no such thing as too much ""Godzilla"" ...I want more such movies...
However the plot was a little dodgy, as if it was made up just to fit in between each of the fight scenes. Can't blame the cast for such a bad plot though. Vera Farmiga should have said no when she read the script.
Coming back to what really matters, Godzilla was a little too buffed in my opinion, but I worshipped Him nonetheless. Ghidorah should have been a little more monstrous and bloodthirsty, not enough human kill count in my opinion.
Loved the giant VTOL Blended Wing Body (BWB) Aircraft.
Nevertheless, this movie would definitely quench the thirst for monsters in all of us and definitely please a whole lot of Godzilla and Sci-Fi fans alike. Long Live the God-King of the Monsters. Good Job Legendary Pictures.","16 out of 26 found this helpful."
"7","/10","I really wish people understood the modern movie making process","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5106535/?ref_=tt_urv","sepiasiren","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21042825/?ref_=tt_urv","7 September 2019","Reading the reviews gave me a good indication why Hollywood keeps making crappy movies. The average person has no idea about the process and seem to assume writers have the kind of power they just do not. Maybe once upon a time we had the autonomy to sit on a beach and hammer out RAGING BULL while sipping piña coladas, but not today.Why do you think the WGA strikes so much?In the industry, we sit dead bottom on the totem pole and we just don't have much say in what to write and how. We almost always never get any rights to our work, and are the lowest paid in the industry spectrum outside of crew.
Instead of getting mad at the GAME OF THRONES writers, for example, folks should have taken it up with the show runner and the studio execs, who hand writers the canon for the season and tell us not to deviate from it. Same with studios, with Netflix ranking the worst for mistreatment and high turnover. Much like the music industry, corporations took over and now it is about formula. A writer balks? He is easily replaceable, no matter how big a name he is. Ever wonder why writing consistency never remains the same throughout a show's life? Yah got the answer. The RARE exception, like SUPERNATURAL, is NOT the rule.Want better work? Support the writer's ability to have more leverage and more say in the filmmaking process.Also noted people saying two contradictory things: They wanted just to see the monsters and/or they wanted a better story. Good lord, which one is it? I mean, you could have a movie that just has the Titans on an island killing each other for two hours, but then the film would be devoid or plot or context. Another posted that the characters were not important as all anyone wanted to see was the creatures. One even said the humans in the story were just mere annoying ants and no one wanted them in the film at all. Okay, bet, so why flesh them out if they are not what you came to see? In this regard, it really is an either or proposition. Don't send mixed message as you will only get out of Hollywood what yah ask for, but, yah gotta be clear.I didn't mind the movie but my hubby, a true Godzilla fan, said it kept true to the older concepts. He agreed that no one has ever fleshed out Godzilla outside the battles, nor have I ever heard of anyone winning an Oscar for their portrayal in the films. It was always about the monster, so in this regard they kept true to form, and thus, was enjoyable for the type of movie it was.Again, want better work, support the WGA.I will say that I loved the CGI FX and the fact that Godzilla moved like a land lizard--and he glowed. I never knew he did that--hubby said he always did. Nice touch. Of all the creatures I loved Mothra the best and was saddened when she died. I will agree with many that the story lacked depth but given the response here, why create depth when the characters are all expendable and second fiddle to the monsters. That is like buying Ming China just to break it. Just saying.Overall it was watchable action and I enjoyed seeing the critters. I give it 7 on visual alone, with the understanding that this wasn't supposed to be a think piece and the plot was thin because the monsters were the real stars. In other words, it's a monster movie and monster fans, by their reaction here, seem to not to want character development of any type. Hubby may have rated it higher being a fan but I wasn't really converted as I like a bit more story meat in my films.As aside: Why do people act like woman and POC just appeared in movies in the 2000s? Or that there were no political movies ever written until then? For the love of all that is holy, LOOK WHO IS COMING TO DINNER and 12 ANGRY MEN, heck, even MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON are a famed few, and would never be able to made today as the so called alpha, non PC crowd would freak out and write effed up ish about it in comment sections. Heck, I LOVE LUCY had a mixed marriage in it for crying out loud. All are timeless classics. The only time in history there were no dark skinned folks or women were in theater, was in the time of Shakespeare when all the parts where played by Italian men, including the women. Also, the Moor in Othello, in that time, was not played by a Moor either.Having POC and women in a film DOES NOT make it automatically PC. Heaven forbid anyone get a job who isn't pre approved by the alphas.I watched Godzilla thinking to myself at least some dude won't complain that the woman was wholly good and the guy made to look bad because, man, she was god awful, yet, lo and behold someone actually said that very thing, I kid you not. I was like, what the heck movie was this dude watching? The woman was an eco terrorist who put her own daughter in harm's way to release monsters on the ENTIRE PLANET! How the heck does one get she was innocent and deemed wholly good out of that? In fact one, of the side characters indicated she was a horrible parent.I suppose if you don't have anything to complain about, you'll make it up?As for profanity, it was rate PG-13, not G. I only counted a handful of bad words, and believe it or not, kids 13 and up use bad words too (Stephen King really captured that nuance in STAND BY ME). I find it amusing that the ""anti- snowflake"" crowd are the first to clutch their pearls over a millisecond of a word being said on a screen. The same who tell me not to get upset over certain words, mind you. I'll never understand it. In either case--okay movie I just wish viewers would get out of their own way and support the industry in order to get what they want out of it. I'm done... *picks up soapbox and exits left*","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

Adding more military elements to this film didn't help much either, because its cringely apparent the director had zero knowledge of the subject matter and didn't bother to source an advisor. As a result, we see clashes between human factions that are equally idiotic, and we get shots of rifle optics that are clearly just camera overlays, among other lazy oversights that distract from the rest of the movie.At the end of the day, we eventually get what everyone came to see, a monster fight.

I think it is a grounded movie. So after 5 years, this comes out and it does what most sequels do, which means it does everything more: more actions, more screentime for Godzilla and more dramaGodzilla: King of the Monsters is a mess but a beautiful mess. Messy part of this movie is human drama and characters. Central family drama is very poorly written. Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown are the least convincing mother and daughter in all of the movies I watched recently and also performances from both actresses are below average. The motivation of Vera Farmiga character is very much like Thanos in infinity War but only not interesting.
The story is crowded with a bunch of stereotype characters but at least colorful cast added layers and depth to them and made a bit more enjoyable. Kyle Chandler, Thomas Middleditch and goddess Sally Hawkins are really goodBeautiful, lively part of this movie is gigantic and satisfying monster fights, for entertainment value those are really good. Also, orchestral music composed for this movie feel so divine, it is Oscar worthy standard","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

The movie seems to be attempting to introduce so many characters that Godzilla seems to get limited screen time. Don't get me wrong, those fights are freaking cool, but with several main characters and many parallel stories that seem to crowd one another, it's hard to be drawn in to any specific tale being told.

One of the main criticisms of that movie, was how little of Godzilla we saw and that it focused too much on it's human characters. Five years later, Godzilla II finally hits theaters, does it deliver what the trailers promised?Godzilla II has to be one of the most epic movies i've seen, and i mean that in a literal sense; massive monsters fighting each other in big, loud and visually impressive battle sequences. The movie has much more action than it's predecesor, but also less character depth and a convoluted plot. The main actors deliver pretty good performances, specially Kyle Chandler and Ken Watanabe, and the latter, who returns from the first movie, has more screen time and much more to do than simply standing around. The ""villain"", played by Charles Dance is as generic as bad guys get, the actor is great but the character is just meh. The plot is convoluted and almost overstuffed, and there's a little too much exposition, which hurts the movie a little. The first movie focused a little too much on it's characters, but the story was pretty straightforward, it's a movie about giant monsters fighting anyways, there's no need to overcomplicate things.What does deliver, and it does it absolutely right, it's the monster action. The battles are epic in scale, loud (in a good way) and visually impressive. Those battles are worth the price of admission alone. Imagine the fights of the classic Toho movies, but with state-of-the-art visual effects and earth shattering sound design. It's truly impressive stuff, and if that's what you're looking for, epic summer popcorn entertainment, look no further, King of the Monsters delivers that.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

But at the same time, it was a little disappointing due to a mediocre story that can sometimes get predictable. The characters are weak, including Emma being hard to root for and is rather clueless. And the message about the environment is kinda preachy. But thankfully, there can be aspects that can make up for those flaws. The visuals are amazing and takes the power of monsters to a whole new level. The action is exciting. And the movie has listened to the criticism from the 2014 film and focuses often on the monsters because that's exactly what people want to see in this movie. It actually does take time on Godzilla to present the battle scenes instead of just jumping to people evacuating. Now, if you are a Kaiju fan and want to see the monsters in visual form, this is a movie you may check out. This Godzilla movie can have improvements from last time, even if it was only a little bit.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

A misplaced wrong understanding of facts, human psychology and emotions, Why on earth would the survival of humans matter to a Godzilla, you provide it with food, good sex or something?
Or all of a sudden the whole story becomes about the family coming together and all, like all this mambo jambo of special effects and 3d work was there to just bring that freak of a family of that daughter back together, and how all the effects and the interactions of the monsters should either copy or totally correspond to human understandings and expectations.

Whatever problems with the plot/human characters is pretty much absolved by Literally Everything Else.Although i felt like it focused more on godzilla and ghidorah than i thought it would, it was still satisfying watching the four titans brawl in the climax.In godzilla 2014, the monsters felt like acts of nature, but in this, the main four titans felt like their own characters. If goji 2014's slow and deliberate approach to their kaiju wasn't satisfying enough, then i assure you, KOTM doesn't hold backWhile I personally felt like godzilla 2014 focused a bit too much on the pretty bland main character, KOTM finds an equal ground between monster action and human drama. Said drama might not be Oscar worthy, but at least they didn't kill off three most memorable human character within the first thirty minutes.The score was also the best I've heard this year. Between this and God Of War, Bear McCreary is becoming one of my favorite composers. Each titan has their own unique theme that fits their character, along with certain elements associated with the character.I can understand why critics aren't exactly onboard for the film. This is an unapologetic love letter to the King Of The Monsters, so if this is your introduction to the franchise, or if the previous monsterverse movies were, than this might not be for you.If you want a godzilla movie that focuses more on human drama and less on kaiju action, theres plenty of movies in the series for you, from the original 1954 movie, to 2016's shin godzilla. But if you want to see four giant monsters go ham in a city, then watch godzilla KOTM","27 out of 48 found this helpful."

And right you are my friend for today we review Godzilla: King of the Monsters! With monsters both old and new appearing in this long-awaited follow-up, who will be the one King to rule them all?Plot
Godzilla II: King of the Monsters is set exactly 5 years after the events of Godzilla (2014). The world has become weary of Godzilla and the other monsters that are beginning to re-emerge upon the Earth. Because of this, now governments all over are aiming to shut down the secret Monster Hunting organisation Monarch for not taking action against them. But when a splinter group of the organisation lead by a rogue agent steals a top-secret device, they effectively unleash the dreaded Titan of King Ghidorah along with Rodan, Mothra and a whole battery of monsters that threaten to tear the whole planet apart. Leaving only Godzilla as humanity's last hope.Likes
Godzilla Returns to the franchises roots like never before. Delivering a seismic, action-fuelled thriller ride that brings in much of what old time fans of the series have missed for many years. The action scenes both in the Monster and in human battles are bigger, meaner and ground-breaking than ever. Leaving you literally at the edge of your seat. The effects are superbly focused and captivating in the environments and the destruction sequences, especially with Mothra and her light ray abilities, to King Ghidorahs lightning ray blast and Godzilla's Atomic breath.
The designs of the Monsters, especially Godzilla are just awesome. Keeping them true to their classic counterparts and origins while improving upon their foundations and adding more realism in their biology. Even the personalities of each monster are well done too. In a lot of ways, they do exhibit a lot of personal traits that do make them very close to being human.
Godzilla continues to show a stoic character while continuing to pursue his destiny as sole guardian and ruler of the Earth. His special symbiotic relationship with the giant butterfly Mothra was something I never imagined I would see in any Godzilla film until now. I enjoyed how their bond mirrors that of the two being the King and Queen of life.
Also I like how this movie throws in a lot of call-backs and references to elements of the Godzilla franchise, such as Godzilla's roar being much closer to the 1960's iteration and his theme music from the 1954 original film. Along with Mothra and Rodans music refurbished into the new film.Dislikes
Now, let's be clear on this. I like this movie a lot, and the reasons I put on here don't affect my personal opinion except as just being minor annoyances. So on a subtle level there are a bunch of things about this film I don't like. For instance, the plot and story are weak in comparison to the solid plot of 2014 Godzilla. But more importantly some of the human characters don't really have much personality or memorability when it comes to their side of the story. Then occasionally they have questionable motives that sometimes make no sense. Since there are a multitude of humans and generic goons in this I'll just stick to four I know.
Like, Mark Russell has a deep hatred for Godzilla being responsible for the loss of his son but he just suddenly sets aside his hatred after encountering him underwater just like that. Okay? How did that happen?
Then his wife Emma Russell seems to have even more questionable motives than him. Like the whole plot twist revolving around her working for the Eco Terrorists and wanting to release all the monsters on the earth and prefer having them destroy the human race is unspeakable and insane. Since she was someone who didn't want a repeat of losing another child but yet she's okay if King Ghidorah kills more innocent families and their children just for the sake of one? It's abruptly confusing to me especially since that's something I don't think that my child would want me to do if they died in something like this so I would have been very wise not to get involved in such a plot to begin with.
Their daughter Maddison Russell is basically a Mary Sue with no actual flaws in her character to exploit. The only thing she will ever do is disrupt the main human villains plan by stealing the Orca Device to draw King Ghidorah to Boston. Where LOADS of people may still be endangered. And that's just it.
And the main human villain played by Game of Thrones actor Charles Dance is probably the worst of all of them as he doesn't even explain once why he himself wants to release Ghidorah so he can destroy the world and why he betrayed Monarch.
So to make a long discussion short. The new characters are blatantly forgettable and have no development. They aren't as hateful as what you get from an Adam Sandler or a Michael Bay film, they just don't interest me much. And to me it appears that Godzilla and the other Monsters are the ones who have more character building than the humans do. (With the exception of Ken Watanabe's iconic Dr Serizawa of course). The only characters that you will remember and connect with after this one will just be him, Godzilla and the monsters involved.
Verdict?
In terms of quality and Monster battles, this film is a major step from the action seen in Godzilla (2014). But when it comes to an underdeveloped cast of characters and a watery plot it doesn't really live up to its predecessor much. If former director Gareth Edwards was a part of the movie again as a producer, I think the characterisation and plot would've been more thought provoking. But for Godzilla fans that have waited for a film that finally brings back the series to its old roots and the return of some of Tohos most iconic monsters, you will not be disappointed whatsoever. So in a matter of speaking, go see the movie for the monsters if that's your thing. But not for the man down below their feet.

From Mothra being reborn under an ancient temple in China to Ghidron in Antarctica to Rodan in Mexico. Rodan the flying lizard battles with jet fighters, plucking pilots from cockpits and devouring them. Godzilla fights Ghidron in Antarctica but falling electric pylons in the background bring back memories of the original Gojira film.

"7","/10","The Action Sci-Fi film everyone wanted from Godzilla, but nobody cheered for","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4970508/?ref_=tt_urv","gdeangel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0941769/?ref_=tt_urv","1 July 2019","Let's face it, this film was a flop, despite have a respectable user rating and many ""10"" user reviews. It failed to break even in the US. Abroad it did o.k., but not anywhere the numbers for a colossus special effects, battle royale action film. In Japan, the native land of Godzilla, it churned out an anemic $20+ MM. In fact it barely grossed half of what it 2014 progenitor raked in.... so the question has to be why?It's not the plot, which by the contemporary standards of Marvel movies, is robust and, while it has one or two plot holes, pretty much holds water and is internally consistent. As the supposed much-coveted ""universe"" film in a Monarch franchise, it doesn't rely on ret-con gimicks to address the the prior 2 films, which frankly were pretty weak.It's not the special effects, which are pretty much spot on. Godzilla is there in full glory, not constantly obscured by fog, buildings, and spider-monster appendages. The titular hero even gets some proper anthropomorphication, finally erasing the ""dinosaur run amok"" image of the 1998 film. The film probably has one too many supersonic jets being munched out of the sky by winged monstrosities with zero aerodynamics, and it definitely over-uses the word ""Orspray"". And there are extended sequences of human dialogue -- it relies on a big battle, back to the boardroom, rinse and repeat formula. Then again so do many other highly successful films. In the boardroom, the characters hold up well. There are two slightly tormented male leads carrying around Godzilla family baggage. There are the less flushed out comedic characters and the tough-as-nails female military field commander. So what is it that doomed this film?The film has basically three problems. First: the human villains. The villains are essentially disciples of the Thanos philosophy, but they fail to conform to the modern villain demogrphic. Neither inspires much fear and hatred. There is no the hulking toxic-male aggression. Instead there is an impotent looking old man with a velvety voice and demeanor. Rather than seething of toxic masculinity and acting like a psychopath, his character is an environmental terrorist who is basically apathetic to people and conflict. Then there is his partner in crime, who I won't give away, but whose back-story flunks the 21st-century Hollywood litmus test for who can be a megalomaniac.Another flaw that audiences in the screening room will tire of, it is in the way the human stories drag on the action. Themes of sacrifice, redemption, hubris, mourning the loss of a child -- all plot enhancers -- are just piled on until there are too many to sort out. Give us a neophite scientist struggling against the massive military-industrial complex, and we're more than happy to wash it down with a popcorn and a coke. Give us mish-most of complicated backstories, and no amount of pauses in the action give us the time to chew it up and process it. Also, this is a point where the film's color pallet fails. Those pauses in the action when the good guys return to base and lick their wounds while giving exposition and advancing the plot have been been blue light enhanced to the extreme -- the 21st century's paint by numbers substitute for quality acting.Yes, many of the monster-battle backgrounds had to be produced right from the photo-shop color wheel, but it would be nice if at least the set-filmed segments look like they are taking place in the real world of color, and that the pallet was used to in ways to offset rather than enhance the drag of watching the humans mull over how bad their situation is. By literally slamming the breaks on the audience adrenaline and cutting off the air supply with human sacrifice after human sacrifice, by the time Godzilla finally climbs to the top of the monster heap, the audience is in tears rather than exploding with cheers and applause.

Michael Dougherty was marketing himself as a Godzilla fan, a fan of the Toho monsters and yet the disaster he has served us along with the studios is just shocking. Why include the likes of Mothra & Rodan when you're not give these icons the screentime and respect they deserve. Look at the OG movies! The human angle which regularly cut in and stole the limelight from the kaiju action was just awful. Gareth Edward's Godzilla was a more satisfying ride and that barely had any Godzilla!

A lot of reviews pointing out all the flaws basically described without realising it, what a classic Godzilla is supposed to be like.
As a long time fan I can safely say that nobody watches Godzilla for the humans. The cheesy plot lines only add to the whole movie and make it a fun and memorable experience.

This is the best kind of movie to turn my brain off, and enjoy the chaos and destruction caused by the monsters. I really liked the lore they created for this series of movies, and the CG work on the monsters it's fantastic, I loved how expresive they looked, and the fact that they basically acted and moved like real animals. The callbacks to the older Godzilla's movies were a nice touch.

The film barely had Godzilla in it and it was mostly about people but the little amount of monster action there was looked really cool. I actually give this film a 7.5/10 but since I can't do half reviews, I've rounded it down to 7 due to my ratings at the end.I would have given this film a 9/10 if it weren't for the humans and decisions made throughout the film. There are some excellent actors in this film and I'm not sure if the actors weren't on top form or if the script was not the best and they tried their hardest to make it work but neither of those excuse the fact that the human characters were really awkward and, to be honest, bad. In my opinion, Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) was the only good human in the whole film.Even though the humans and script were a bit dodgy, you shouldn't go to see this film to see top notch Tarantino style dialogue and characters and you shouldn't put this film off because people complain about the people and script. You should see this because it had what the first Godzilla film didn't: ACTUAL MONSTERS AND FIGHTS. For once, I think that the creators listened to fans and provided them with what they wanted. There were so many more monsters with awesome designs and when they were all fighting, the visuals and cinematography were awesome. The final showdown had some gorgeous shots and people who were complaining about ""the rain being in the way"" are just being unreasonable. Bear McCreary's soundtrack was also really good and it really fit the things happening in the background.I'm not a massive Godzilla fan but I've seen reviews on this website from people who eat, breathe and sleep Godzilla, and they really enjoyed it so ignore the extremely unfair 40% Rotten Tomatoes score and pay attention to the 84% audience score and good reviews on IMDb.My Ratings:

He gives it a 10/10 and absolutely adored it. I give it a 6/10 because, whilst the monsters were pretty spectacular and certain moments in the film fairly wonderous, it was a bit messy and had some aspects that I felt really let it down.As a father, I was disappointed with the inclusion of rude language. Hollywood seems to have long since decided that sh-- is not a bad word when it is not something most parents want in the ears of their kids. The when the f--- word was dropped I was pretty annoyed. It added absolutely nothing to the film, it was completely unnecessary and the film makers surely had to know this film would appeal to kids. It's a film about giant monsters! There was little to no blood in the film too.That aside, most of the humour fell completely flat. I don't know anybody who thought the Gonorrhea joke was funny so was baffled that they included it. Just cut that line out the scene and the film is better for it. I can only think that it was a pet idea of the director so was kept in the final cut.There were several tropes that just weren't required and served as annoyances. At one point they exit a plane with the first couple of soldiers being vapourized instantly. I guess it is intended to inject DDay-like battle anxiety in the viewer but it doesn't work at all - firstly there's not enough build up of the emotions the soldiers are experiencing as they arrive at the scene facing almost inevitable doom, in fact they completely gloss over the absolute fear everybody should be experiencing, and secondly because those vapourized soldiers are green screened into the shot we have no reactions at all from the protagonists.The monsters frankly moved too quickly at times, especially during fight scenes. It detracted from the sense of scale. It was a problem not present in the 2014 Godzilla where the movement was very well judged. There's also a moment in the film where something happens to one of the monsters that is passed off as 'not part of the natural order' but, again, the speed at which it transpires was just far too quick.There were also several bizarre time and space jumps. Often location changes seemed to involve traveling ridiculous distances in nonsensical times. There's a certain moment in the film when several monsters show up that would have required them to travel half way around the globe in just a few hours.What they really nailed right in this film, which they got badly wrong in the 2014 film, was the perspective changes during the monster battles. In the 2014 film it was almost entirely from the perspective of people on the ground, which meant you rarely understood what was going on in the fights between the monsters. In King of Monsters the perspective is shared between a proper action camera and the perspective of the protagonists on the ground.By far the most interesting point of the film was when they go in search of Godzilla, leading to the only really adventurous period of the film, culminating in a moment that should have been quite emotional as a character volunteers for a suicide mission, but I found myself not caring due to the failure to properly build the characters in the film, which was a shame.Why do I write all these criticisms? Probably because I felt this film could have been a classic. Instead it is a competent monster action film with a better story than the 2014 film but a sub par script and characters (no fault of the actors IMHO).","20 out of 34 found this helpful."

A lot can happen in five years and the sequel certainly carries a different vibe from the original. It attempts to fix the flaws of the first movie but along with it, sacrifices some of the positives of the original, resulting in a mixed bag in the end.The most prominent problem with the 2014 film? ""Godzilla"" does not really have Godzilla himself. It was slow, and we never really encountered him in his entirety until the climax, preferring instead to offer glimpses through the characters that come near his presence. This made for a very slow pace and very little screen time of Godzilla, aside from witnessing him from secondary sources (TV, etc.). But the slowness wasn't all for naught; it provided build-up.""King of the Monsters"" scraps this notion of slow-pacing and delivers a lot of action and spectacle. It is unlikely that anyone coming out of this movie would complain that Godzilla's screen presence wasn't enough. There are a lot of action sequences in the movie among the beasts and they are epic, visually stunning, and fun to watch. Yet, I feel they don't feel as exciting as it was in the first movie. Granted, the first movie barely had action, but the glimpses of the monsters and slow-pacing allowed a building of anticipation for the ultimate climax. ""King of the Monsters"" had no such build-up leading to action sequences that ultimately don't really have weight.It doesn't help either that the human story is boring, and the characters are forgettable. The only ones I remember: there's Millie Bobby Brown, a person who pronounces Godzilla's name correctly, and a character whose job is to say the new monsters' names. I understand that the sacrifice of a compelling story arc was to make way for action sequences, a major departure from the focus of the first film. But the characters had very questionable motives and sometimes, illogical reasoning for the actions they did that it's hard to really ignore the humans and just focus on Godzilla and friends. They tried to implement a family arc into the movie, but it wasn't even decent. I felt it was put there hardheartedly, and could have been scrapped, instead of being a nuisance. I guess this is the problem when making movies where the main attraction is non-human and it's hard to really go down a certain direction.Ultimately, ""King of the Monsters"" is fun to watch but the human element feels boring and becomes a nuisance. They might very well be better off scrapping the whole human thing and make a movie with just the monsters, it could be more interesting. The humans in the movie do actions that seem to matter, but in the end, they barely make a dent. They're supposed be our eyes, whom we relate to but I couldn't care less. I cared more for the monsters. It's a cool monster fiesta flick, but nothing more.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

This sequel is directed and partly written by Michael Dougherty, the director of Trick 'Treat and Krampus.In the film, after the events from the first Godzilla film, people have founded a crypto zoological institution called Monarch. Here people are researching creatures such as Godzilla, to investigate which monsters are good or bad to humanity.
Mark Russel (Kyle Chandler) has lost his son by a monster who has destroyed a city and would rather people wipe out all the monsters. His wife Emma (Vera Farmiga) thinks that humanity can get better with the help of the monsters. For example, she is urged by Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) to wake up a newly discovered monster. After awakening, this monster causes chaos among the other monsters, disturbing the balance. Humanity must now hope that Godzilla will win the battle against this monster in order to restore the balance and to protect the earth from destruction and taking over by the monsters.Because Godzilla fans have complained a lot about how little Godzilla was actually seen in the 2014 film, they have more filled with moments in which Godzilla and another monster can be seen in this new film. Gareth Edwards, the director of the 2014 Godzilla film, despite the fact that Godzilla did not appear frequently in the film, knew that Godzilla could be shown in a realistic clear manner and in a large way.
Despite the fact that Godzilla and the other monsters can be seen more in this new film, Michael Dougherty has unfortunately not always portrayed them clearly or filmed the scenes a bit too much. That way you don't always get a clear picture of what exactly happens in every scene.
Fortunately, there are some scenes that have been portrayed a bit better, but the large monsters are moving at a fast pace, so that the fighting does not seem as realistic as they did in the first film or, for example, in the first Pacific Rim film. Yet they have managed to fill this film well with overly large monster battles that you should not think too much about and just try to enjoy the stupid action.Fortunately, the effects used to place the samples in the movie look good or beautiful for most monsters. For some monsters that have a special shape, you can see earlier that they were placed in the film with CGI.Although the monster is now a bit more in the film, there are also many scenes with the human characters. Compared to the monster scenes, these appear somewhat less interesting and entertaining, because people try to study the monsters more. Sometimes they have to attack the bad monsters with weapons, but these scenes are not as entertaining as the scenes in which the monsters fight each other.
The cast does provide good acting, but they don't really have a script that they can turn into something special. Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga and Ken Watanabe seem so good in the film, but just stick to standard acting. Bradley Whitford gets some chances to come across as funny in the film, but otherwise it doesn't really do anything special. For Millie Bobby Brown, this film is her first real cinema film in which she gets the chance to act as an actress. People who are more familiar with her thanks to her role in the TV series Stranger Things may expect a little more from her, but the script of this film does not really give her the chance.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

Let's start at the end and go backwards. It is supposed to be a poignant moment when the mom dies. We are supposed to care YET we don't at all because 1) Vera was horribly miscast in the role and 2) The script was sooo bad, the dialogue so wooden and cliche, that the audience actually hated her and thought ""good riddance"" when she died.Kyle was also a horrible casting choice. Almost no stage presence, at least in a
CGI ""blockbuster"" like this. I can't say enough about how bad the script was, the dialogue so simplistic, unimaginative, so borrowed from every other bad movie that Michael might have been kicked out of film school if he had submitted the script then. Pacing was completely off, continuity and color and sound issues throughout (why is Kyle looking in the wrong direction throughout all the closing scenes on the helicopter as Millie looks in the right direction?)Almost no character development to speak of other than junior high character tropes. If this is the best you can do with $170M then you are unqualified to be a film maker or screenwriter. I assume most was wasted on the CGI. The film would have benefited greatly from a few longer, quieter character development scenes (with some more human and creative and heartfelt dialogue) and those in real places, real settings. Seemed like other than a moment here and there of b roll footage of china and antartica, etc that ALL the dialogue was done on sound stages. That became terribly monotonous and boring. Indeed the initial command center and the one on the plane and the one in the sub, etc they all looked the same. You need distinction between scenes and sections of the film. Why not have had more scenes in a real setting like the kitchen scene between Emma and Madison?You only cast a single actor who could have carried this movie and that was Millie Bobbie Brown but then you barely used her. She should have been the center of the entire movie. Once you saw the early dailies you should have rewritten the entire movie around her. Then you do a bunch of ""cute"" things that just distract from whatever storyline you perceived was there. Bradley making ridiculous wise remarks after every scene (and not very well written ones unfortunately). Why exactly with presumably hundreds of millions of people dead would he be calm and smiling and making stupid jokes? The volcano type scene you tried to channel Vesuvius, you threw in a second Asian woman who looked just liked the main one but never did anything with that (and why was a Bill Cosby doppelganger hired to go out and look for her??). The final scene with Godzilla standing as king of the hill (and which hill is that in Boston near Fenway exactly?) was unspeakably unimaginative. That's the best you can come up with to end the film? Even if you went cliche and had Madison and her father standing on the edge of Boston harbor as the sun was rising and Godzilla disappeared off into the water and then a touching moment between them that would have been infinitely better.Holy cow, what absolute utter crap that was.","8 out of 12 found this helpful."

On the positive side, I think Warner Bros. heard that and this movie corrected that. There are plenty of fights between Godzilla and the other Titans and they are exciting. The hits are bone-crunching, they're easy to follow and observe, the CGI animation is done well and those scenes help magnify the high stakes they're trying to sell you on. I was never bored during one of those scenes (my favourite one was the climax in which a couple of new monsters join the fight) and they helped the movie pick up the pace (this movie moves pretty quickly and usually moving at a quick clip is better than letting things drag). The visuals and the sound are top notch throughout the film and the movie knows how to keep you entertained with the spectacle and the required level of eye-candySpeaking of the effects, the design of the creatures also consistently impressed me. My favourite was Mothra but every creature had moments where they stole the show. I won't claim they re-wrote the book on how to do this kind of movie successfully but as I pointed out in the last paragraph, it does genuinely feel like they listened to the critics and decided to up their game. I'm not a Godzilla fanboy but from what I understand, there were tons of Easter eggs and callbacks to previous movies in the series through these designs and that simply went over my head. I'm sure there's lots of stuff in this for die-hard fans of the series and I applaud the creative team (writer/director Michael Dougherty and others) for including them.Godzilla: King of the Monsters brings the spectacle, the action and the tension and all of these are required elements to a good couple hours spent in the theatre. But the movie is also FAR from a complete package and I have to start talking about these parts now. While we start out with a fairly strong twist, after we get through the 1/3 mark, the plot of the movie just gets shoved out of the way. It made me feel bad for the cast, they are legitimately trying to do what they can with the material but every time they went back to the human characters, I wanted to press the X button to get through the boring cut scene. There's a lot of talking about the hole Mark dug himself into after the events of the 2014 movie but we never see it and it feels like lip service instead of bringing us in. Someone could make the excuse ""do you really care? C'mon! Its supposed to be about the monsters"") but while the focus should be on the creatures, you can do both. The story in Kong: Skull Island had a lot of pathos and emotion, between the PTSD from the Vietnam soldiers and the subplot of John C. Reily's character having an unlikely friendship with the Japanese pilot. So that's a weak excuse at best. There's a huge amount of science gobblydegook that isn't supported or backed up (it felt like someone tapped the writers on the shoulder and said ""well there has to be some kind of an explanation, it doesn't have to be GOOD, it just has to be there""). I also really couldn't get attached to the characters, the movie lays the groundwork for the Russell family and their Monarch associates but by the turn into the 3rd act, they want you to care way more about them than you can with the limited time they give you. Character motivations switch on a dime (looking at you Mark) and some of the dialogue is eye-roll inducing with a lot of cheesy one liners being tossed in the final act. There's a lot to enjoy in this movie, you just have to ignore how poorly handled the emotional arc and how the characters/story/dialogue are treated at points.I might be railing against the human parts of Godzilla: King of the Monsters but I want to make it clear that I don't blame the cast. In fact, this is an example of why you try and hire good actors and actresses, they can elevate bad material to become passable. Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Charles Dance and even Thomas Middleditch are delivering on what they can but you can only build up so much when you lack the material. I will say that while I like Ken Watanabe as an actor, his performance came off as one-note. But again, I don't think it was his fault, he was let down by the material. The person I felt the most sorry for was Millie Bobby Brown, she's great on Stranger Things but this movie just relegated her to annoying kid who flip flops and does little (she gets her moment in the 3rd act but its too late to really care). It's not due to her performance, its due to her character not getting the proper time to flesh out her motivations (I also thought she might have been a little old for the part, with the lack of wherewithal Madison has, maybe it was written for a younger actress?).I would describe this movie as thoroughly mixed but ultimately disappointing. You get a lot of bang for your buck with all the action and fighting but I did find myself snickering more and more as the movie went on. The movie doesn't fall on its face but after a strong opening (which felt a lot like BvS in the opening scene to me), it just loses its way and by the end it just turns campy when it comes to the plot and dialogue. I'd rate it about the same as the 2014 Godzilla but its funny how their strengths and weaknesses are almost mirror images of each other. I still have to go with Kong: Skull Island as the superior monster romp, it might not be a popular opinion but that's the gold standard of these giant monster movies that have been made lately. If you want to go see this, I think you'll get a kick out of it and seeing it in a theatre will help you appreciate the scale of it. But if you're like me and you thought the promotional material was very mediocre, you can wait to catch this on your preferred streaming service.","3 out of 7 found this helpful."

Now that I'm not watching this on the big screen, the same can't be said. But back then, I had only seen the two American Godzilla movies prior to this, so I couldn't truly enjoy this glorious tribute to the 60+ years of Toho Studios Godzilla.The 2014 Godzilla was something that tried to be true to the spirit of the original 1954 Godzilla, and this stayed true to every Japanese Godzilla that came after. The way those movies had ridiculous plots, stupid naming conventions, convenient characters and situations were funny and for a lot of them kind of charming too. This uses some of those si;;y stuff and makes it just serious enough to include in this setting. So, there is some residue of the silliness here but not exactly making everything too ridiculous. For example, King Ghidorah's name doesn't have any justification in the original film, and it being called Monster Zero was just something added by aliens in another movie. Here, the term Monster Zero as well as King Ghidorah is justified.The first time I saw this, there were a lot of things going on and a lot of the plot points just went over my head. Do they ever actually explain why Godzilla would absorb an atomic bomb as energy, other than mentioning that nuclear bombs woke him? It was definitely properly mentioned in the old Toho films, so things like that made a lot more sense now after watching all those films. I mean I don't think I even understood that Zhang Ziyi plays a double role here, even though she's completely wasted.However, it was the music from the Toho films modernized for this movie that made me really fall for this movie. When the subtle instrumental version of Mothra started playing first, it just blew my mind. That's such an iconic song, I wish they even brought back the singing fairies. Then Godzilla's re-emergence had the original Godzilla theme from Toho too. With these theme-musics playing and the last 40 minutes of monster mayhem, this movie was worth everything. This is so much fun with all this. Yes, if the script, especially some of the cheesy af dialogue were better, the movie could have been a lot better. It did feel weird that they decided to add so many cheesy dialogues in there and decided to omit a lot of exposition for the audience to figure out themselves.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

In fact, the movie was so predictable that even a dead man would see things coming before they happened.Visually, then this movie was quite impressive. The CGI was just phenomenal and really brought the various monsters to life on the screen. Just a shame that most of the scenes were constructed with sort of a haze going on to distort and cover up some of the scenes. That I didn't really understand.The monsters in the movie were quite wonderfully brought to life by CGI, and they were astounding to look at in terms of realism and levels of details. So if you enjoy a good old fashioned monster mayhem, then you'll definitely like what the CGI team managed to do here.A real shame that the movie was horribly brought to its knees by the lack of writing talent from Michael Dougherty Zach Shields and Max Borenstein. How can three people collectively manage to spew out such rubbish and pass it for a proper storyline and plot? It was so simply that even a small child could manage to write this stuff.They did have some good acting talents on the cast list, just a shame that they were given such a lousy script to work with. The cast list includes the likes of Kyle Chandler, Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Bradley Whitford and Charles Dance. Not even bothering with mentioning Millie Bobby Brown, because she is overrated.It seems that director Michael Dougherty had bitten off more than he could chew with this 2019 ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" project. And while the movie was visually astounding, the rest was just mediocre. I am rating ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" six out of ten stars, solely because of the visual effect, the fact that this is a Godzilla movie after all, and also because of some of the abovementioned actors and actresses.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

It's a rewarding experience for fans of these monsters and they are done justice and not just visually or in the action scenes. Firstly you will be glad to know this does contain a hell of a lot more Titan scenes than 2014's Godzilla. They aren't totally dominating the screen but without the human characters the plot wouldn't be able to progress. This is also the case in most of the old Godzilla movies, occasionally involving politics or issues like the environment and man vs nature.
My only issue with this film is not a technical one within the film itself but I think the more of a Godzilla fan you are, the higher your enjoyment will be through this movie. If you don't know any of the monsters or some of their history it might not bring a huge smile to their face when you first see Mothra or they may not get pumped up when Godzilla and Ghidorah finally meet.
The films plot revolves around using a sonar device to send out signals to awaken certain titans, all in the hopes of restoring balance to the world. It isn't exactly the selling point of the movie it serves as more of a way to move our characters towards the next goal, a titan or the next conflict.
Although the human characters aren't (and never really were) the sole focus of these types of films, I find myself not disliking them. I actually kinda routed for them, Millie Bobby Brown is wonderful and charming, Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler were fine, this family that has fallen apart and lost a child due to the events of the first film. I was hoping for them to reconcile throughout and make it, which helped the tension throughout some intense action scenes. The rest of the supporting cast weren't really memorable but I didn't mind.
As a mega fan I was super excited everytime a new monster would emerge, or a conflict was about to erupt I was filled with child like wonder and sheer joy at watching these icons from the monster movie universe being presented. It wasn't just the fantastic design, making each one feel unique or the way they moved and sounded when they roared. It was that each one had a personality and wasn't pushed to the side or felt like they didn't matter in the final fight. They aren't the only monsters in this film but these 4 serve as the main stars of the show. I loved the build up to each battle, the cinematography and the epic pure colossal scale of each beast squaring each other off before charging into each other firing off atomic blasts and lightning just gets my blood pumping everytime.
To sum up, Godzilla King of the Monsters is a solid monster battle on a grand scale, that will satisfy you on the visuals and sound alone. If your a big fan of this franchise, it's a true delight, the ultimate clash of the titans done justice with a big budget and with a director who is actually a fan of the characters. A must see!
P.S. You will fall in love with Mothra!","23 out of 40 found this helpful."

After that comes this sequel, which feels like Hollywood's struggle to reignite interest in creature features. Honestly, Eight-Legged Freaks is fine enough for me. Still, this was densely packed with themes, interesting images, and a literal worldwide creature fight. Also, a laugh-out-loud dig at how American pop culture can't figure out how to pronounce ""Godzilla"" in Japanese. As great as it all was, there were parts that lacked a great thematic punch, too many deus ex machina moments (a couple felt goofy and nearly predictable), and the script felt like it tried hard to fence an R rating. I ended up counting how many places would've been ""perfect"" for an f-bomb. Quite a few that went empty. Instead, they bordered the PG-13/R line with two amidst many other swears. Honestly, if you're going to make a cinematic universe this crazy, go all-out with R-rated fanfare or release an unrated versions. Still, in this generation, this was a good creature feature.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

Absolutely! Was it what I hoped for? Sure! Was it more? Unfortunately not but with that being said Godzilla: King of the Monsters was a good film. It has its narrative faults and obvious character faults but the special effects, fight scenes, shots and overall tone are very good. I really enjoyed Millie Bobby Brown, Kyle Chandler, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance and Vera Farmiga though the problem with this film to me was that it introduced too many new characters, most of which are irrelevant to the story and end up taking away time from an already weak central plot involving The Russells, Monarch and Charles Dance's eco-terrorist group. On top of that, although I consider this a minor complaint because in the end it served a purpose but I also felt overwhelmed by all the monsters in this movie when I feel like they should have just stuck the conflict between Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, and Ghidora (whose a more convincing villian than Charles Dance's character unfortunately) because it overstuffs the plot but at the end I can see why it served a purpose. Still, I found King of the Monsters to be a good film. Unfortunately it suffers a bit from sequelitis as its nowhere near as good as the 2014 Godzilla, which gets undeserved flack from people whod rather watch a 3 hour Michael Bay Transformers porn than watch a slow burning, intensely paced monster movie similar to Jaws or the original Godzilla from the 50s. I'm still excited for Godzilla v Kong and further Monsterverse entries just as long as they pump the brakes now while trying to build these monsters and characters trying not to get lost in the shuffle.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

You watched Godzilla as a kid and you want to see his evolution.
2.) You want to see maximum destructionI'm more in the first category than the second. I loved Godzilla as a kid back when his battles seemed more tame and less destructive.Just like 2014 Godzilla, again he has a major foe. This time his nemesis is called Monster Zero. Being that San Francisco and Las Vegas are already in ruins it's time to destroy other U.S. cities.This plot was moved along by a misanthropic scientist. Like so many movies there's always the human hating individual that sees the planet's survival as being dependent upon mankind's destruction. You know: overcrowding, pollution, war, etc. as if human beings have never done anything good.For the Godzilla fans that want to see more 'Zilla and less other stuff, we got to see a lot of 'Zilla. He was looking in fine form. He even got in a couple of hero poses.For my money I wasn't too impressed. The devastation is so massive and so widespread it becomes numbing. Almost like it has no real value. Like, hey, it took 5 years and a billion dollars to build that building. But not just the buildings. It's not like you see the thousands, if not millions of lives lost and ruined. It's not like you see the global effects of this devastation upon the whole world because a major city was just flattened. It's just pancake a city and move on.I also had a problem with the plot. Like I said, the plot was advance by some misanthropes. I get tired of them. Not only do they seek to wipeout as many people as possible, they always have this altruistic sounding diatribe as if they're morally superior and know what's best (I'm looking at you Thanos). I just want to yell, ""Shut up!"" But I can't because I'm in a theater. Well, that and they can't hear me anyway. My point being that the human hating is getting old. It's time to come up with a new reason for wanting to kill so many people or at least revise the human hate speech.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

They start with a premise that had the potential of going somewhere but then immediately let it fall apart. After that the story is just tidbits of this and that, just enough to link the action scenes together. Basically, an average tv ad has more storyline than this. The dramatic moments that are inserted at random times are completely forced and come off cheap and one doesnt feel anything because we've had no chance to connect to the characters. The young actress from Stranger Things, I always tought she had some potential now not sure anymore. She is capable of exactly two expressions. A scared look and confused/unsure look. She comes off wooden as wooden an actor can be.
So all in all, way too much action that devalues it, waters it down because there is no tempo, no feeling to distributing it throughout the movie. As in raising the anticipation. Not to mention its mostly so stupid. Try counting how many times they are saved JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME, like a second before they would perish. Its ridiculous. Or how a character can escape 10 miles away, yet the monsters will always be fighting exactly right next to them or above them. Horrible film. And I love me a good B movie, with a simple silly generic plot and nothing too special. But this is nothing of those. Its just bad with some good CGI.
p.s. No im lying, I did love one thing, the plane. That enormous beast of a plane(/flying fortress more like it) they flew around the world with,coolest thing ever, some S.H.I.E.L.D type stuff. Talking about a dream job piloting sth like that if ever existed.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

Though the series is riding off of the 2014 remake, most people recall Godzilla as a guy in a suit destroying Tokyo as far back as the fifties. It's spawned over thirty movies and created a monster that's good enough to stand with other classic monsters like the Frankenstein monster or the Xenomoprh from Alien. Even those that don't watch Godzilla movies are already likely to know what they are. It just matters if they want to watch monster destruction or not.I still standby that the 2014 Godzilla was a fantastic movie that knew how to use the Godzilla monster more then the 1998 version and was able to take a Japanese idea and translate it into an American story. I do understand the complaint that people were waiting too long to see the destruction of the monster. I guess the producers took note as the previews for the sequel have teased a lot more monster action. So let's see if this newer monster mash can raise the stakes in Godzilla: King of the Monsters.It's been five years since the events of Godzilla. The world is now in a place where several giant monsters, called titans, have been discovered and there's been a debate about what to do with them. Many governments and military would rather have these things destroyed. Other scientists think their essential to the planet and not all are bad. An organization called Monarch as run by scientists Dr. Ishirö Serizawa (played by Ken Watanabe) and Dr. Vivienne Graham (played by Sally Hawkins) is dedicated to containing them and studying them. Though more titans including Rodan, Mothra and Kong have been uncovered, no one's seen Godzilla in years.One scientist, Dr. Emma Russell (played by Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (played by Millie Bobby Brown) are kidnapped by an eco-terrorist group for the use of her invention, the Orca, which allows them to communicate with the titans. Emma's ex-husband Dr. Mark Russell (played by Kyle Chandler) is recruited by Monarch to help rescue them. They locate them in Antarctica where the Orca is used to awaken a giant three-headed dragon called ""King Ghidorah"" . While escaping, Godzilla appears to fight him. Ghidorah escapes and starts to call the other titans to rampage further. Will Godzilla be able to defeat him?Here's what I'll say about Godzilla: King of the Monsters; this is a movie that lives up to it's promise of monster fights. Even though the titans are all CGI, they look amazing and the movie knows how to shoot them to give us their size and scale. It's not just rampage they create, but lots of it from Mexico to Antarctica to Boston. I wont spoil them, but each monster gets their turn and I didn't even blink once when something was going on. We've got monster throws, fire breathing, lightning, flight and nuclear explosions!Does this make it a great movie? Well...the movie still has problems and it's big. It not with the monsters but rather the people. We have a lot of big stars that we've seen in better movies, but their either too bland or underdeveloped. Much of their reactions are the same. The look in awe at the monsters, run from them, or try to find them. I wouldn't have a problem with that if the characters were at least more established on why their running or studying. Jurassic Park is a good example on how to have great characters and still have cool creatures.The other problem is a little too much attention is put on the people. While I didn't have this problem with the 2014 Godzilla, I have that problem here. Many of the scenes with the people is just story exposition which make it a lot longer then it needs to be. It needed at least twenty minute cut to get to the action a little faster. Had it taken a John Wick approach, in which it was a continues chase (which is what I think they were trying for), I would have loved it more.I'll give this six King Ghidorahs out of ten. Call it a conflict. I don't want to watch the people again, but I would love to watch the monsters fight again. There's a good story trying to get out, but the producers need to figure out what their priorities are. It's a roar of a movie, but one that I'd fast forward through next time.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

The first film I call Godzilla in 2014 and it had everything you could want in a Godzilla to me, great Godzilla action, awesome enemies, great effects and characters that were panicking all wound together to produce a great story and spectacular movie led by a great Bryan Cranston and a solid Olsen and Taylor-Johnson.The trailers for this movie were very good, intriguing, fun and had me excited for this one. I mean it looked like the first Godzilla with more enemies and bigger stakes. However this film suffers from sequilitis and really struggles to deliver a solid story, delivers nothing but average acting, an unbelievable plot and even average special effects compared to the 2014 version. They tried to do too much and they paid for it, the director had a great reason for not showing too much Godzilla and used him wisely in Godzilla. Edwards knew what worked, this guy does not.Bottom line. The plot is terrible, the acting is very average, characters you do not care about at all and the effects and monster action is underwhelming.Avoid this one.

'Godzilla: King of the Monsters' is an American monster film directed by Michael Dougherty. It is a sequel to Godzilla (2014) and is the third film in Legendary Pictures' MonsterVerse. Now those who know me well, know that I am a big Godzilla fan. I think all the movies based on the character are entertaining. So, I am going to try and be as unbiased as possible during this review. Having said that, the movie is entertaining, but very flawed. Not totally sure why people are coming out of seeing the film with an 'it's not what I expected' attitude. It's a Godzilla movie. You can't go in expecting an Oscar worthy film, just a fun Blockbuster.
The movie centers around a group of scientists trying to awaken these Titans that have been frozen or hibernating for thousands of years, and a group of military professionals that are trying to stop them. That's is the plot of this movie and obviously the Titans get released and Godzilla must fight and stop them before they destroy the world.
Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga play ex-husband and wife. Which I guess is a good thing because they have zero chemistry together. I'm not a big fan of Kyle Chandler and he didn't win any points for me with this film either. He was pretty one note and I didn't like the character. I adore Vera Farmiga's dramatic work (Bates Motel and Running Scared are me two favorites) and I was excited to see what she could do in this movie. Sadly, nothing her character does makes any logical sense. She is working with the scientists trying to release the Titans while Kyle Chandler is trying to stop them. She has no reason for doing this besides she is told to, I never bought into it. Millie Bobby Brown plays their daughter in the movie and she is amazing, unfortunately under utilized only having minimal screen time.
The flaw in this movie was the same as the other two before it, bad human characters. I mean, I get why they're there, but a lot of the decisions that are made are stupid and pointless. No sane person would think that it is a good idea to set all of these monsters free. That was a dumb premise that I think could have done with a rewrite ort two. But I don't write for the movies, I write the reviews.
Overall, this movie was very entertaining while Godzilla and other monsters were on the screen. I was glad that they gave the monsters more screen time in this film too. If you're a fan of monster movie this will be right up your alley.

I feel like it was a major step up from Godzilla (2014), which to me was already pretty damn good of a movie. This one was by no means perfect, but it was dramatic and intense and had scenes that made me smile, frown, jump a little in my seat, and leave me begging to see more.
The CGI graphics are PHENOMENAL. The team clearly knew what they were doing, everything was recorded well and seemed so real. A movie that felt like even the staff had fun making those scenes. The actors were great too, though I feel that anyone will be more attached to the titanic monsters that capture the spotlight more than anyone else.

This one does not have these intresting characters and instead settles for an all out awsome monster brawl. The characters hear are ok but jesus christ the motives behind some of them make no sense. I'm not gonna name them but two characters who turn out to be evil probably have the worst motive in the world and then when their 'master' plan goes wrong they are shocked despite anyone with half a brain cell can see that it was always gonna go wrong. However their master plan going wrong is what makes this movie so good. The action is great and the introduction of new monsters leads to some great visuals and action peices.

The big fight sequences didn't really do anything for me either, which is kinda reminiscent of 2014's 'Godzilla' in truth. I do like the titular character, but these (sole) two experiences of it have been underwhelming.Vera Farmiga is alright as one of those onscreen, I'm a fan since seeing 2011's 'Source Code' so have been wanting to see her act further. The cast, including Farmiga to be honest, are all quite forgettable in this (not helped by issues that I alluded to with their characters above) - so much so, I'm unable to pick a standout. Bradley Whitford's Rick Stanton, conversely, is somewhat irritating.Here's hoping I will actually enjoy what 'Godzilla vs. Kong' has to offer.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

I'm not a huge Godzilla fan, but TV's 'Breaking Bad' had just ended and none other than the ever-awesome Bryan Cranston was cast to go up against the giant scaly beast. However, that never really happned. Cranston's character was not in the film for more than about half an hour. The rest of the story was carried on by his bland as sand kid.Not only that, but there was a hell of a lot of criticism regarding the fact that in a film entitled 'Godzilla,' you never properly saw him (at least until the final throw-down). In quite a long film the producers mercilessly teased us as to what he'd look like, before we finally saw him head to toe.I mention all this about the first film because it wasn't just me who felt let down by it. This tone of voice reached the film-makers, so they made sure they corrected their mistakes when it came to the sequel.Now - believe it or not - Godzilla is in it more - not THAT much more, but he's in it more. And, when he's not stomping on things in general or shooting blue fire up into the sky (he does that a lot, seemingly to announce his presence and to generally look cool) there's a whole horde of other giant beasts stomping their way around the globe. And none of them are that friendly. If you check out Godzilla's Facebook profile you won't find a single one of the other 'titans' on there. So he has to fight them and prove that he's the king.So, before you think this film is just going to be one long tale about giant beasts crashing their way through the world's cities and slugging each other the head, I should point out that someone decided to put a human or two on the cast list. And, when I say 'one or two' I mean a whole load of annoying, erratic lunatics who do the craziest things in order to make sure that their lives are as terrorised as possible by giant, flesh-eating lizards and the like. You may recognise Charles Dance as the bad guy. He's motivated by being bad. And Vera Farmiga in on the cast list. She's the one making all the crazy decisions to destroy the world because it's the right thing to do, or something.Basically, the humans are pretty dire and if I was watching this on DVD I'd be skipping a lot of stuff involving them, especially when we have the obligatory sub-plot of a father going off on a mission to rescue his daughter.I liked bits of 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters.' I thought it could be fun. And some parts were, especially a few classic set-piece monster fights. However, for every five minutes of fun it was followed by twenty minutes of humans talking and arguing. The film's over two hours long and it sure dragged when the humans were on the screen towards the end.I hear that off the back of this one they'll be pitting Godzilla against King Kong next. Just from that idea it sounds like it could be fun, but if they make it another two hour film and fill it with an hour and forty minutes of humans arguing, I really don't think I'll be watching this one. It wasn't a complete waste of my time, but I don't think I'd be watching either Godzilla (2014/2019) again (although, for some weird reason, I did love 'Kong: Skull Island!').","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

The plot is ridiculous and makes no sense. Besides Ken Watanabe, the rest of the characters are completely pointless and do nothing but ""try"" to be comedic or straight up tell you what is happening. The bad guys' motivation just makes no sense. They want to restore balance to the world so they release the Monsters, claiming that once the monsters destroys a city, new life will grow. They immediately regret it right away and I was expecting them to look at the camera and shrug like ""oops, we didn't think this plan through."" Also the actors act with no emotion, and you know there is something wrong when you feel more for Mothra (who is only in the film for a few minutes) than the human characters you spend 2 hours with. They are really that bland. Zhang Ziyi is only in the movie to tell us the names of the monsters, for example she will be like ""this creature is called Rodan,"" or ""this is call Ghidorah."" The action is just ok since the cgi is kinda bad, and the fight scenes take place too close. We don't need a close up of Godzilla's shoulder when he is fighting. I know why all the fights take place at night and in a rain or blizzard. It is because it helps hide the bad cgi and animation. Very disappointed with this movie. I felt the script was a very first draft. Characters have no story arc, people create new weapons out of nowhere, characters just disappear and never seen again, and the comedic dialogue is cringe.

"7","/10","A huge love letter to Godzilla in a really messy, unfocused film.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4933450/?ref_=tt_urv","GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30915026/?ref_=tt_urv","14 June 2019","As a die-hard Godzilla fan and a defender of the Gareth Edward's slow-burn sombre American remake, I have been looking very much forward to seeing Legendary's versions of Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah interact with Godzilla on screen. Also had been curious of seeing horror director Michael Dougherty bringing his own take on the iconic Toho monsters in this sequel.Dougherty's love, care and obsession with Godzilla and the rest of the Toho monsters are on full display. Dougherty embraces the look and feel of the Showa, Hesei, Millennium era of the Toho films to even making some big callbacks to the original 1954 film. The Dougherty is able to take the futuristic sci-fi technology and the deep mythology of the monsters (in this called Titans) from the older Japanese films and make them fit into the already established Monsterverse. Each monster gets moments to shine from action sequences to the way they display each of their individual intelligence and personalities on screen thanks to the vfx work from MPC and motion-capture actors. Godzilla is given more expressive range to make him feel less animalistic but more world-weary and intelligent while still retaining his savagery. The close-ups of his face can tell you so much about what this near-omnipotent creature is thinking from the way he glares at his rival King Ghidorah to looking down at a helpless human. The film's interpretation of Godzilla's iconic nemesis Ghidorah is truly terrifying. The way each three heads interacts with one another and looks at humans with curiosity and disdain makes Ghidorah feel like the other-worldly demon that he is. Rodan is also a standout as Dougherty gives the winged titan one of the best aerial action sequences to display the full power of his giant wings. While Mothra is kind of resorted to being a deux-machina and would wish to have more screen time, her ethereal-like presence creates breathtaking imaginary making her the most visually stunning of the monsters. The battles are truly epic by definition with the monster's movements and fighting style feeling more character-like similar to the costumed performance from the classic Toho film. The light effects that each of these Titans emit from their bodies and as well as the dramatic weather in the shots make their fights feel like rich paintings of primordial gods duelling over the natural world with us watching as the unintentional spectators.The dividing line I see between fans and critics on this film is does really good monster action justify the weak story and characters. As someone who has come to expect Godzilla movies don't have complex human characters generally because the humans are just there to react to the monster(s) and serve the plot and themes. But my big nitpick I will say I have with this particular movie is that it makes it plot too convoluted. The advantage the older Toho films had as well as I think Godzilla 2014 and Skull Island, was either being shorter then 2 hours or having an easy plotline you could tell where point A to B is. Dougherty's attempts, along with co-writer Zach Shield, to expand the Monsterverse with multiple plots and characters unfortunately makes what should be a simple premise feel unnecessarily complex. This is particularly when it focuses more on pointless character explaining the plot rather than exploring how humanity deals with the arrival of multiple Titans. It is especially annoying when Dougherty puts these characters in peril in an failed attempt to create human stakes and it forces a lot of the monster battles into the background of the shots rather than be front and centre.In terms of the cast, Kyle Chandler and Ken Watanabe are the only two who sell the seriousness and are close to being characters with actual depth. Watanabe particularly gets the best non-action scene that gives his character Serizawa a perfect emotional conclusion and best defines Dougherty's respect for the Godzilla franchise's cinematic history. While the movie's attempts at humour don't usually work, Bradley Whitford delivers the funniest lines (by going full Rick and Morty) while Thomas Middleditch didn't work as the comic relief. Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown do give solid performances but feel like they are just plot devices to get things to happen. As a recent fan of O'Shea Jackson Jr., I was really disappointed to see him get stuck playing one of the many random forgettable military soldiers.Bear McCreary's score goes above and beyond to what this film attempts to be. He not only successfully recreates Akira Ifukube's iconic theme but also still manages to make it feel new and fresh. The use of vocal chants makes you want stand up and cheer for Godzilla when the music starts playing.The movies does carry on the tradition of Godzilla being a metaphor of man's incapability to control nature and goes even to asking can humanity co-exist with the Titans knowing the destructive powers they can unleash upon the world. A lot of interesting ideas are introduced about how important Godzilla and the other Titans are to the ecosystem and their functionality as one big giant monster community but unfortunately could have been handle better with more actual showing and less explaining. Maybe it's also a problem King of the Monsters gets stuck trying to be thematically serious like Godzilla 2014 and still trying to appeal to those who had criticism of that last movie for not being enough like a fun popcorn movie.As a lifelong Godzilla fan I can't say I was disappointed since it was so satisfying to see these monsters come to life and feel like real, believable characters but just wished the movie they were in was more focused and shorter to fully appreciate the spectacle, creatures and the engaging themes it wants to tell. The human plot wouldn't have been so bad if the was just half of it and allowed the conflict with the monsters be the heart of the story.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

There are so many plot holes that I'm convinced they wrote the screenplay on a sieve. There's a magic machine called the Orca which can make monsters Calm or Angry, but as it turns out, Ghidorah is an alien and impervious to the sound. Yet he can control the other monsters with sound and later in the film is triggered by the Orca which, as was established earlier, doesn't affect him.
The monster action, which should have been the best part, is barely visible. If it's not shaky came, its extreme close-up cam, and usually in the pitch dark/ in a storm/ at night, something I should have noticed when the first battle was in Antarctica in a blizzard at night. The fights with Ghidorah are in a storm cloud that apparently follows Monster Zero around so you're not gonna see much there either.
It's not all outdoors though, there's a secret submarine,a secret plane and a secret base. Hard to tell the difference though since they are all a dimly lit control room filled with computer screensThe sound is dreadful, just LOUD all the time which is sometimes OK as it drowns out the terrible dialogue.I had two naps during this film but I should just have got up and walked out.","8 out of 13 found this helpful."

It's like when the 'good guy' is face-to-face with the 'bad guy' and then they simply refuse to shoot the 'bad guy' in the face, due to some existential crisis (or just due to a horribly written script)... well that happens multiple times in this movie. The CGI in certain scenes are also sub-par (though most scenes are fine)... they probably used multiple different CGI-studios on the movie, and that's why some CGI scenes look worse than others.

Another big improvement is, obviously, the creature scenes. Firstly, there are a lot of them. Secondly, they do not use smoke to make the creatures hard to see. Thirdly, they are full of colors, not bleak. Also, they are not edited in a way that only baits this or that, they deliver what one would want from this sort of film. Another improvement on the first movie is the cast in general, if we're talking about characters and actors again.The visuals and the sounds are not up there with a movie like the first ""Pacific Rim"", for example. They lack that passion and precision. In detail, here is what the movie has to offer. The creature effects are brilliant, nothing less. But the cinematography could have been better. It may not rely on shaky cam, but it is still a bit rough. The sound effects go without saying. No problem there. The music could have been better. It does add power and feeling to the movie, but it does not boast melodies that could be instantly associated with this particular movie. They work well within the movie, during viewing, but not more.The main characters are not disposable action figures, nor are they charisma lacking figures. And this is the right moment to point out something very important. ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" does lean respectfully on ""Godzilla"", and even if you haven't seen that movie, this movie makes sure you understand what is happening, while introducing new characters with their own stories and journeys to make. There is nothing genius in that regard, of course, but competent. Also, the movie can be easily viewed as an addition to ""Kong: Skull Island"", exploring the ""Monarch"" organization and their activity.The movie has a lot of material, it is rich, but one cannot say it is all perfectly balanced. Yes, the monsters have their stories and their time to shine. So do the characters portrayed by actors like Vera Farmiga, Charles Dance, Ken Watanabe, Kyle Chandler and, a welcome surprise, the young Millie Bobbie Brown. But because of how much is going on, it isn't a very smooth sailing. The movie lacks air, it lacks the time to breathe, even though it does have scenes where things get quiet and our heroes just talk to one another in a friendly environment.

bad, but let's kick off with the good first. Nobody wants to read the negatives first, do they? Let me say this: People mess everything up. The mother, the father, the daughter-I understand a bit of drama is necessary in movies like this, but Godzilla's always been about the monster more than anything else, right? With these movies, there's never time for sex, with a maybe a spot of drama, and in that order. So when they threw in what they threw in (because I'm not telling), I was lulled into a few catnaps. Not kidding- I dozed on Godzilla. But not on the good parts.Everything military where they had to fight or help fight was cool but, the truth is Millie Bobbie Brown was unnecessary. If I could re-watch the movie, with all of her scenes deleted, I guarantee myself and you, it would be a much better show. Straight Talk.The monsters were on point! I loved everything about them. Were some of the battles a little too long? Yup. But they gave the movie what it needed to be a fun monster flick, but from what I gather, a box office disaster. So what does that mean?Godzilla 2 is an ""okay"" movie. I'd hoped for something more, but it was nostalgic and brought back some serious memories. I was even expecting Dr. Russell to open a briefcase containing two miniature Asians, singing ""Mot-su rah!"" to Mothra! LOL Sadly, they did not, friends. But the movie is worth the cost of matinee. So, now that I've given you what you need, go! Enjoy as much as you can. But please- don't pay full price! Oh, and check out my video- Cheers!","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

My friend is a huge fan of kaiju movies and he showed me the trailer of this movie when it first came out. I was struck in awe. I couldn't believe something so legendary looking was actually going to be made while I live. The poster and promotional materials were also looking so much filled with fantasy. I watched the 2014 Godzilla to watch this. If you've seen my review of that movie, you will know how much I loved it except for the human part. But when I watched this movie, I was very dissatisfied.The problem that plagues Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the humans. First of all they are talking so much. The whole time all we see is talking, talking and even more talking. First Madison and her mother are talking, then the army is talking, then the eco terrorists are talking. And finally when Godzilla and Kong Ghidorah finally start fighting, then seen cuts to the humans running. Look, I have no problem with humans being shown in Godzilla movies. But it should be like the 2014 movie, where humans are only shown when the monsters are walking and not during the fights.The human plot of this movie is very pathetic. The eco terrorists had a point and I completely agreed with them, but as it was shown how they are supposed to be the bad guys was not very surprising. I have never understood movies which villify eco-terrorists. Like, why don't they ever explain why they are supposed to be bad? Take a moment, think about valid points and just speak them out. It doesn't have to be ""you're the bad guy boo-hoo!"". This only makes us feel like the bad guys won.The CGI, however, is where this movie is an absolute win. I will give it full marks for that. I just love all the fight scenes from it. When Rodan seemed to have killed Mothra I was feeling very bad for her, but seeing how she made a comeback was very surprising. The part where Rodan and King Ghidorah fight the planes was also very cool. I really wanted to show that scene to someone else (sadly I'm the only person who is interested in Monsterverse and those who are interested already watched the movie before me).Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a movie that completely tested my patience. It was fun, I'm gonna remember all the monster scenes, but I don't think I'm ever gonna have the courage to watch this ever again. Some things are best left in memory, and that's what I'd say about this movie. It's a good thing Godzilla vs Kong removed the bad parts and made what we wanted to see. That's how this franchise is supposed to be, not like this one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."
"7","/10","Godzilla: King of the Monsters delivers epic action and spectacle as expected.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4918046/?ref_=tt_urv","politicidal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57075719/?ref_=tt_urv","7 June 2019","GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS delivers spectacular kaiju action and mayhem, seemingly as an apology for the slow-burn reveal of the 2014 film. The action scenes and the visual effects are incredible. The trailers do not do justice to just how insane and crazy the action scenes become. The giant monsters all have distinct personalities and giving them different musical themes was a nice touch.The ensemble cast seems aware that their gigantic CGI costars are the true draw of the film but they nevertheless take the proceedings as serious as need be. Ken Watanabe and Vera Farmiga especially have more gravitas than expected. Kyle Chandler is adequate as a reluctant hero but man, Charles Dance was wasted as the leader of an ecoterrorist group. Ditto for Sally Hawkins' next-to-nothing appearance before she is unceremoniously dismissed.The main plot where the monster agency Monarch and Godzilla race to thwart the awakening of other monstrous creatures is surprisingly gripping; there is a weird environmentalist angle that does sound nice but is negated by the villains. Yeah there's still human villains in this for some reason despite there already being a 500 ft three headed dragon.The cliffhanger ending is a treat for franchise fans. But it also leaves too many subplots unresolved. Unless the next film GODZILLA VS KONG explains it, the human antagonists escape repercussions for their actions. There's a weird setup for a potential romance between Kyle Chandler and Zhang Ziyi that goes nowhere too. Just random stuff like that. Truth be told, the film would had benefited from cutting at least ten minutes.The film's decision to go big pays off for one grand helluva finale but the human cast is only so sufficient to balance out the huge size of the movie's visual scale. And so the best installment in the Monster-Verse series remains KONG: SKULL ISLAND since that not only was better paced, its human characters were more interesting.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

The cast we're quite good in the first part of the movie, like the first hour of it, then it took a turn for the worst.Started out with what appeared to be a great story and great acting but then....it turned into a chaotic bunch of yelling and screaming with nonsensical situations to the point that I could no longer suspend my disbelief.You had main actors and the monsters fighting right above them with chaos all around them, and pieces of buildings falling all over, and nothing happens to them. They're just fine. How does that happen? Too many impossible scenarios that were just too much.Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Ken Watanabe head a very talented cast, but it all soon turns to garbage.Supporting players include: Millie Bobby Brown, Aisha Hinds, Charles Dance, O'shea Jackson Jr., and Bradley Whitford, not to be mistaken for Aerosmith guitarist Brad Whitford, in fact Whitford is the only character I couldn't stand.As much as I don't like CGI, it was well done in this film. However, having said that, one thing I noticed in this film and have noticed all the way back to GODZILLA (1998) is where the monster looks the human squarely in the eye up close. That is so STUPID!! That would never happen in real life, he would've destroyed that person or eaten them.I've never heard of most of these people (actors), like Kyle Chandler, but they all did well in the first part of the film.I liked that they didn't waste any time from the previous film to now in bringing Mothra, Rodan, and Ghidorah to life in this film. They might as well have just called the film GODZILLA VS. GHIDORAH, because that's essentially what it was. Ghidorah was definitely the main antagonist.7 STARS.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

The story, once again, focusses rather heavily on humans, but this time around Godzilla gets the attention, screen time and level of intimidation he deserves, just like his titan friends. From monster designs to fights, there are more than just a few memorable, extremely well presented moments. And when the Godzilla theme plays and you are allowed to see the king in all his glory, it's actually very touching.The effects are hit or miss on occasion, but for 90% of the time your eyes will be fed with beauty. Sadly, there was rarely a shot which showed all monsters fighting at the same time from an acceptable distance, and pretty much every battle started with the movie instantly going back to humans.
There are a few cringeworthy moments when it comes to dialogue and story, and these make you believe you are watching a movie which in part heavily tries to appeal to children, though that's not necessarily a bad thing since Godzilla's target audience were children for decades. It's quite often a back and forth between a witty 90s movie and a try to move onward.If you are a person who heavily enjoyed the 2014 film, you may have a few problems with this one. The fights are faster and way more chaotic and Godzilla himself can rarely be fully appreciated outside of the scenes solely dedicated to him, thankfully those scenes are outstanding.What fans wanted was more, way more Godzilla, and this is what we got. If you just want to see Godzilla slapping big monsters while everyone around acknowledges his glory, this is exactly the movie for you. None of the negative points I raised truly matter if you can leave the cinema with a smile on your face, because the movie gave you exactly what you asked for. They listened, they genuinely tried and they succeeded and the outcome should be celebrated. It's a great, faithful film about everyone's favorite oversized monster.","40 out of 77 found this helpful."

I enjoy a good dumb romp sometimes, but mind melting stupidity and self seriousness is a really bad combination.It has endless, very serious exposition from the human characters that no one is there to see. It has a washed out color pallette that I think was supposed to provide contrast to the monsters but just made the whole thing feel pretentious. It has some of the absolute dumbest notions I've ever seen in a movie, the two standouts being an ECG tracing they get from sound recordings and a bomb that destroys oxygen. It tries to use a statue as a jump scare. It moves around so much in so little time that it completely ruins the scale of the setting, with the entire earth feeling the size of a closet. It wants you to feel sympathy for characters that do nothing to earn it. It has no sense of levity, not enough monster action, and is absolutely no fun in its bloated 2 hour plus runtime.Maybe the last 20-30 minutes that I bailed on contained the monster fighting fun time that I bought a ticket for.

Especially when its gigantic monsters destroying cities and wrecking havoc. I liked the 2014 incarnation of Godzilla. It was a lot of build up and following the humans and a little monster battle but I still thought it was engaging. When I saw trailer number one for this film, I thought we were going to get a beautiful epic. The score and visuals of that trailer made the hype so real. The film is a real mixed bag but overall it had every right to be way better than what we received.The film takes place after the 2014 film and new titans (gigantic sleeping monsters) are awoken and immediately start causing chaos. The titans are led by King Ghidorah, which is a three headed alien and ancient being that uses electric sparks to kill and destroy. Enter our old friend Godzilla, a benevolent monster with a weird connection to human beings. Godzilla and Ghidorah battle, while the humans attempt to ensure that the titans that have awoken don't destroy humanity as they know it.I'll start with the positives. There is more Godzilla in this and visually its great (albeit a bit dark). The monster fight scenes are amped up. There are more monsters now and just hearing them roar and battle is a fantastic spectacle to behold. That's pretty much where the positives end unfortunately. Every human character in this film is a waste. What was the point of Millie Bobby Browns character, or anyone for that matter? O'Shea Jackson Jr. is super underutilized here. The plot is not only thin but the reason for awakening the titans is sheer stupidity. There is no smart decisions being made by the humans and they not only conspicuously survive mass destruction but they just get in the way of everything.Anytime the humans are on screen its dull, incomprehensible and most unforgiving of all, its beyond boring. This had the potential to be a monster movie for the ages but it whimpers. Which is a shame because the actual monster battles are good its just that its overlong and everything that doesn't involve Godzilla feels like a waste. Super disappointed by this because I had high hopes. I'm not sure how I feel about Godzilla vs King Kong now as I think now that it can easily turn out to be awful.6/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

Before I start complaining I'd like to make it clear that I liked Godzilla: King of Monsters. It's a decent Godzilla movie that delivers satisfying giant kaiju action. It's worth the price of admission and worth seeing on the big screen, despite its faults.No, the biggest problem with Godzilla: King of Monsters wasn't fat Godzilla. Just like the biggest problem with BvS wasn't fat Batman. Its biggest problem was the bloated cast. The movie featured Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidora, three of Godzilla's most iconic contemporaries, each worthy of more plot development and screen time. Maybe even their own movie. This problem was compounded by the addition of multiple human character arcs that really weren't needed, as many other astute reviewers and fans of this universe have pointed out ... so back to my point: of all the Kaiju, Mothra was particularly underserved. If you've seen all the trailers you've basically seen 90% of Mothra's screen-time (more on the trailer issue later). King Ghidora had a really cool action scene, which I can't spoil, and Rodan had what I think is the best scene in the whole movie. And lastly, Godzilla had a couple of really dope action scenes ... and yet I can't shake the feeling that the movie could've been much better. It was less than the sum of its parts.That's because like they did with BvS, WB squeezed what should've been two or three movies into one team-up movie in order to get to the big showdown pitting Godzilla and King Kong (the movie had several Kong related teases, which I won't spoil). Another big issue with the film was its ad-campaign, which just about spoiled every single cool scene in the movie, except for two that I can think of. And there were no surprises because the advertising revealed every big-name monster in the film. This is reminiscent of the disastrous BvS advertising that spoiled every single character and character reveal in the movie ... UGH! When will the execs at WB ever learn? Seriously? Look, Godzilla King of Monsters is fine. If you have any interest in watching it, go. It's pretty good. But it could've been so much better. WB could've done so much more with these iconic characters then lumping them into one rushed movie in order to get to a bigger cash cow movie. This movie was green lit years ago ... probably by the same gang who thought the BvS approach was a good idea ... so hopefully they are no longer making decisions on this property and at WB in general. And if they still are, they need to be out of a job. Now! *end of rant*","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

"9","/10","Hyperbole or Spot-On? A Review from a critical Godzilla Fan","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4910149/?ref_=tt_urv","kevingarnettfan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur95082569/?ref_=tt_urv","3 June 2019","Godzilla Fan: I was three years old when I was first introduced to the big guy. I can recall checking out 1973's ""Godzilla vs. Megalon,"" 1974's ""Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla,"" and the ""Godzilla Compendium"" from my local library, ordered by the library specifically for me. To this day as a 26 year old, the librarians that knew me then still call me ""The Godzilla Kid.""Having been an avid fan of Godzilla for many years, I also know of how incredibly cheesy and at times over the top Godzilla films have been over the years. Even at six years old I thought the 1999 ""Godzilla"" film was an abomination and rewatching it recently, I continue to take the same stance. Being an amateur film critic as well, I knew that this upcoming Godzilla film ""King of the Monsters"" was probably going to disappoint me, and in a couple of ways it did. In other ways it blew me away!Firstly I would like to discuss the major issues I have with this film.1) This film suffered from an over-abundance of characters, mostly the human ones. Bradley Whitford's, Thomas Middleditch's, Aisha Hinds' and Millie Bobby Brown's characters I found incredibly superfluous. Brown's character was at least acted well due to Millie Bobby Brown being an outstanding actress. But none of their character's add anything to the plot. The major problems critics take with the script are with Whitford's and Middleditch's characters. They are supposed to be ""comedic"" but their execution is terrible and the jokes written for them either make little sense, are very ill-timed and/or are simply not funny. I never laughed at one of their jokes and their characters do nothing to add to the plot. Aisha Hind's character is basically the military representative who basically has no character traits other than commanding troops. Her presence also introduces a lot of other military personnel who characters are also superfluous.2) The human drama is rather misplaced. There is drama between a supposed divorced father and mother and their daughter that I felt was something that the film did not need. It took away from the monster fights that I think needed to be more central to the plot. I am not one of those actions junkies who thought Michael Bay films should be Oscar nominees, but the monster fights are central to the plot as the main characters of the film ought to be Godzilla, given the title of the movie. Most importantly, the character development between this family is rather superficial. Thus, when terrible things are happening to them there is no emotional appeal for me to empathize with them, unlike Bryan Cranston's character in 2014's ""Godzilla.""These problems are rather serious, so why the 9 star rating?1) The sections of film that focus primarily on Godzilla, whether it is the humans giving exposition or watching Godzilla fight, it was given the greatest of care and was executed flawlessly. Any critic who says that there is too much exposition in a movie has never seen a Godzilla movie. Human characters in Godzilla movies are almost strictly for exposition and to show how desperate humanity is with an invincible monster wreaking havoc. The part that I agree with critics is how the film tries to create drama between these human characters that only give exposition. Trying to make me care about these characters is a flaw in the film (as mentioned above) but I do not think it takes away from the plot of the film and how flawlessly the Godzilla-focuses portions of the story were executed. There were also many salutes to previous Godzilla films with naming Ghidorah ""Monster Zero"" for most of the film, the using of an Oxygen Destroyer, and...2) Using the original score added with a fantastically composed score by Bear McCreary. This film score is Oscar-worthy! I still get chills listening to it on Spotify. Not only does McCreary create his own score, but he even uses the original Godzilla score from the 1954 classic. He even adds some excellent elements of his own such as adding chants during the fights between Godzilla and Ghidorah. The chanting reminds me of Polynesian war-dances. McCreary even uses Mothra's original theme! And finally after years of missed opportunities, they use Blue Öyster Cult's ""Godzilla"" in the end credit scenes sung by System of A Down's Serj Tankian. I cannot express how absolutely beautiful the music in this film was!3) Ken Watanabe's Dr. Ishiro Serizawa-best character in the film by far! To me, he epitomizes the perfect human character in a Godzilla film. In the 2014 film, you learn that the pocket watch he constantly carries around was his father's. His father was killed in the Hiroshima bombing in 1945. From that 30 second tid-bit you learn all you need to learn about the emotional drive of his character and can safely assume his emotional development as a child while growing into adulthood. His character primarily gives exposition while driving the plot forward with his very emotional performance. He is a character you can empathize with while he does not take the focus away from the film's main character, Godzilla. Thus, Dr. Serizawa personifies the perfect human character for a Godzilla movie.Now for some debunking of common criticisms that are quite unfair to the film.1) Lighting
For those who complain that Godzilla fights always take place in the dark need to evaluate a couple of things. Firstly, why do you think the studio made those decisions for fights to take place in the dark? From a cinematographic standpoint, darkness always puts an audience on edge. Why are there no complaints about horror films taking place during the day? To do so would take away from the factors that make you feel on edge. Additionally, I don't think the studio was wanting to hide poor CGI behind a dark screen. The 2017 film Kong: Skull Island showed an impressive CGI spectacle that took place during broad daylight. The studio can make a very realistic show that takes place during the day. However, many of the effects that take place such as Godzilla's glowing dorsal fins, his emitted radiation, his atomic breath, and even Ghidorah's lightning effects require a dark canvas for lighter colors to pop out and make for a brighter show. Bob Ross taught us that years ago! Having lighter colors in the backdrop during the daytime would make the colors from the monsters' effects seem more dull and less noticeable. I am not against a daytime fight by any means; I am rather welcome to that idea. However, if you are introducing new powers to a monster (or any super hero/villain) that emit bright colors, you need a darker backdrop to display all the colors to show the new ability's with all it's splendor. Additionally, with Ghidorah bringing a storm wherever he goes, it is going to create a darker environment. If one has a problem with Ghidorah creating storms wherever he goes, then they do not fully understand Ghidorah as an invasive species on earth.2) Characters and Script
If you have been reading this review you already know that I have problems with some of the script and some characters. However, the critics who criticize all the characters and the entire script are deeply steeped in hyperbolic snobbery. It is not all that bad. The characters listed above, I firmly agree with the critics. However, the rest of the characters do a very good job and their lines are not bad at all. Michael Chandler's character is a little over the top and unnecessarily angry at times, but it is tolerable and in other cases performs quite well.Are the characters boring? In many instances yes, but in totality, no. As previously mentioned, Dr. Serizawa is a very compelling character. Vera Farmiga's character is pretty well executed as well and adds some extra elements the plot needs. I do agree that there was too much focus on characters that are not that deep nor empathetic. There definitely needed to be more focus on Godzilla, especially during scenes when he is traveling. But these are minor quibbles that do not detract from the joy ride that the monsters themselves bring.-Conclusion-
""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" is one of the funnest films I have watched in a long time. There are minor problems with the film, but overall I do not think that takes too much away from the main focus of the film-the spectacle that is Godzilla. Critics are being far too harsh with this one, and I do not understand why. This film is an almost perfect Godzilla film and I hope it leads to bigger and better spectacles in the future.","6 out of 8 found this helpful."

Production costs are obviously high. Acting is not great, but is above average. Story is okay... but thats not the draw to Godzilla movies. Special effects are also top notch. You get, not one, not two, not three but four major Godzilla monsters. The recipe for at least an above average movie was there. Unfortunately, they decided to go all in the human/people drama. The movie is about 2 hours, and out of that run time, 90% is all about the humans. I know you can't make a whole movie only on monsters fighting, but wow, they really went overboard. Every time you finally get into any monster fights or just monsters appearing, within 10-20 seconds, immediately cuts to the human drama. It would be nice to get about a minute or two of just the monsters going at it from time to time. It all just felt very unbalanced and awkward, and felt more annoyed by the characters than anything else. If you want a great example of balancing human drama with suspenseful monster fights watch Pacific Rim.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

Edwards delivered a film that held back the beast, making us wait for the smackdown between giants whereas Michael Dougherty has opted for a different approach, delivering smackdown upon smackdown as if going out of fashion.Crypto-zoological agency Monarch find themselves out of their depth when Godzilla crosses paths with fellow titans; Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, King Ghidorah, leading to a fight for supremacy, the likes of which have never been seen.They were definitely thinking go big or go home with this film and the result is a summer blockbuster where logic takes a back seat and you should prepare yourself by strapping into your seat because this film is loud. King of the Monsters doesn't tease us the monsters like its predecessor, instead opting to show them in all their glory, with some quite stunning shots thrown in to emphasise the sheer scale and power of these beasts.When they come, the action scenes are quite something to behold, the impressive visuals bringing the magnificent beasts to life with such detail and ferocity. They are entangled amongst a very messy screenplay, the human characters providing the film with quite a few moments of failed humour however, I can excuse dumb human characters when they're not the main event. Godzilla and his fellow titans are what we're all in the cinema to see and on that note, Michael Dougherty's film does not disappoint.The characters being a little dumb doesn't mean the performances are bad mind, the main trio that drive the human narrative forward; Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown, being the best of the bunch. Charles Dance hams it up in an expected villainous role while Bradley Whitford is unfortunately lumbered with a lot of the lame jokes that plague the screenplay. Films like this always make me judge the performances more on what they've been given to work with and, with such a screenplay, they've actually done a solid job.In a world where superhero franchises rule the box-office, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a welcome reminder that it's not just those from the world of Marvel and DC can provide so much city-levelling entertainment. Godzilla vs. Kong next year may just be too big for even an IMAX screen.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

I get people are saying that no one goes to watch this movie for the human characters, which is true, but at the same time we do spend about 80% of the movie with them so it would help if they were written a bit better.As for the monster action, I thought it was good. Some of the shots were beautiful, the music was good and you truly felt like Godzlla is the King. The sound for this film is great, you can feel the size of these monsters with the sound effects alone. Every time the monsters were fighting, I was invested.
Overall, I would say this is an average movie with some great moments. If you are a kaiju fan you will probably love this film, but I kept getting taken out of it by the human characters. However, if you came to see monster battles, you will not be disappointed, as these scenes is where you get your money's worth.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

The older 60/70's movies did absolutely nothing for me even as a kid. The modern takes on the monster have been a bit underwhelming as well. The CGI has created some awesome visuals but, the stories never seem to focus on Godzilla as much as random characters the writers hope you will connect with. How many times will they drop a family into the chaos and say empathize with their plight? If they focus on Godzilla and offered an origin story I would be more entertain. This was the closest to such a story. However, it was still glossed over in order to concentrate on humanizing Godzilla! It's been done! I do not want him humanized... in all fairness, they took the premise of ""Kong:Skull Island"" and just threw Godzilla into the fray.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

The rest is made up of more underwhelming human drama and WB has done their usual thing where they saw the negative feedback about the over-serious, brooding tone of the previous movie, tried to do the opposite here, and seriously overcompensated. Now everyone is making little jokes and quips almost constantly, but also in the usual WB fashion, none of them are actually funny.This is the level of dialogue you can expect here:
Character 1: ""Oh my god.""
Character 2: ""...zilla.""It's almost a constant cringefest that's only broken up by an occasional serious dramatic moment, most of which will have you shaking your head at the nonsensical decisions all the characters make.Look, I get it, the old Godzilla movies were always bad and were only enjoyable in a so-bad-they're-good kind of way, but this is 2019 and this doesn't cut it anymore. The fights here aren't good enough to make the rest worth sitting through and it's an incredibly bad script in terms of both drama and comedy. If you want to see some good modern cheesy giant monster movies check out the Pacific Rim movies instead (or even Kong: Skull Island), but this? I can only imagine that the people gushing all over it have some serious nostalgic fixation on Godzilla that's blinding them to the fact that this movie is just plain bad.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

The Monarch Corporation wants the creatures studied and has established locales to study the ones they have found currently hibernating. The U.S. Government wants them destroyed as they do not want repeats of the destruction that was previously caused by Godzilla.Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobbie Brown) have developed a device known as Orca that will allow them to communicate with the creatures using specific sonic frequencies.After a successful test under duress; the duo are captured by a ruthless Eco Terrorist group who want to use the giant creatures for their own objectives.
This leads to a chase around the world with Monarch attempting to stop them and with Emma's ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) deeply involved though he is deeply divided as he blames Godzilla for the loss of their son.
When a gigantic creature is freed; Godzilla faces his greatest challenge as there is a race against time to save the world.While the film has some very impressive visual effects, the film drags as aside from a couple of brief encounters; the audience is required to sit through roughly 90 minutes of plodding story to get to the action which is roughly only the last 15-20 minutes of the film.The human characters were very disinteresting and many of the international cast looked at times like they were sleepwalking though their lines as they seemed to have a real lack of passion for what they were given to work with.
The human characters were also very annoying and I found myself hoping that they would be taken out by the creatures as I had no connection to them and they did not inspire any sympathy.While it may possibly appeal to hardcore fans, this was a miss for me as there simply was not enough creature action to counter-balance having to sit through the human characters and plodding plot to get to the good stuff.2.5 stars out of 5","24 out of 54 found this helpful."

Not overly impressed by any of the leads, particularly Farmiga who is poor, but Chandler is terrible. Thankfully Charles Dance adds a bit of gravitas and could have done with a lot more screen time. I like the monsters, they're very good although I doubt Ghidorah could fly with that wing to body ratio. Direction is a bit muddled and had del Toro or Nolan had the lead, maybe even Ridley Scott we would have had much more rounded movie.

If you have strong feelings towards Boston, you should check this out.Now, when it comes to Godzilla,all I want is big dumb CGI monster fights. I wasn't a fan of Godzilla(2014), but I did enjoy Kong:Skull Island. I feel Kong vs Godzilla would've been the perfect little trilogy, but now we have this weird 'middle' movie, that exists cause the studio can squeeze more money out of us.Let's get the negatives out of the way- if you don't like Monster Mortal Combat, there is nothing else for you here. The plot is downright embarrassing, the characters are insanely boring and your suspension of disbelief is tested to its limits. The main humans in this movie are immortal- so much so, that they amaze me more than the Kaiju. I'm more worried about the monsters getting injured, because the movie establishes pretty early that leads actors will never ever die (and further go on to survive radiation blasts, hyper cold arctic temperatures, citywide destructions, the works). The story makes no sense; don't attempt to think about it if you hope to enjoy this movie.All that being said,I was prepared to ignore the flaws in lieu of monster fights, and it totally delivers. Any Kaiju sprawl is incredible - visually stunning, beautiful soundtrack and cinematography, top tier VFX, in-depth design. I was completely pulled in during a clash or throw down, or even just watching from afar. That's pretty much the lone plus.As someone who wanted 'only' a CGI fight-fest, and didn't expect anything else, I was not disappointed. The fact that Boston is such a pivotal part of this film, scores a slight bump from me.
I'd say, if you want to watch this, go for the IMAX Dolby large scale experience. If you miss that, there's no point watching this film later.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

What a ride! if you thought Godzilla 2014 was boring and didn't have enough monster action, and then you're in luck: this movie has memorable, engaging characters and non-Stop monster destruction and fighting. This movie is a spectacle and a half with absolutely gorgeous monster fights.Vera farmiga and Kyle Chandler bring some heart to the movie as they process a family tragedy in two very different ways with Millie Bobbie Brown being the connective tissue between them. Ken Wantanabe is much more efficiently used in this film then he was in Godzilla 2014, he has important things to say and a genuine impact on the film. He doesn't just stare the entire time again I promise LOL. Bradley whitford and Thomas Middleditch provide a lot of the film's comedic relief. I disagree what are reviews I've seen, calling the movie's jokes more miss than hit. I actually found myself laughing fairly often and really appreciating Bradley whitford's wry comments. I think the best thing I like about the human characters is the fact that the majority of them have something to do with Monarch. One of my frustrations with the first film was how little of this organization we saw. Well that isn't a problem this time and that was a great choice.Monsters. You can tell director Michael Dougherty love's him some Godzilla. The designs and sounds of the monsters are fantastic. The updates to Godzilla's design make him all the more imposing. Rodan is elemental and primal. Mothra is beautiful, graceful and is not in the movie anywhere near as much as I would like her to be. She has some real spin-off potential and I was picking up on the ground work they were laying for that (providing Toho rehashes the rights after 2020). King Ghidorah is fearsome. Not just because of his terrible visage, but also because he seems to have genuinely dark intentions and a certain malevolent curiosity. I really appreciated the character that they put in each of his three heads and the ways they interacted with one another and things around them. I'll also add that the animalistic behaviors they gave Ghidorah are incredibly interesting as well and a welcome addition to the character.The score of the film is something else and Bear McCreary of Stargate and God of War 2018 fame does a fantastic job with it. He paid excellent homage to original Godzilla movie composer Akira Ifukube: at least three of his iconic themes are sampled at various times throughout the film and they are used to excellent effect.Also, quick shout-out to the visual effects team! This was some hard work. Especially Ghidorah and Mothra.","15 out of 25 found this helpful."

With that, this 2019 edition was generally painful. Only a couple moments that made me happy to see the big guy. The producers of this film, and the actors, just tried too hard in their attempt to make blockbuster extravaganza. They took themselves too seriously, and as a result, came across as forced. As actors go, both of the Russells are perfect examples of this. Further, I'm tired of films being attempts at social engineering. I will go no further in describing this postion. Finally, why would they not have titled this film ""Godzilla: King of the Titans""? I look forward to the day someone gives Godzilla the treatment he, and Captain Marvel, truly deserve.

The human plot is, in a word, bonkers. The feature follows Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga's divorced couple Mark and Emma - scientists who previously worked for Monarch (think SHIELD but for giant monsters) - and who have gone down very different paths following the death of their young son. A group of militant eco-terrorists with designs to use the former couple's sonar technology (nicknamed The Orca) to awaken the slumbering titans of the world and create an extinction-level event to save the future of the planet intervene, and thus we're thrust into a plot with perhaps one good twist (spoiled by an early trailer) and not a whole heap of logical connective tissue.But if you're stepping up to Godzilla: King of the Monsters seeking well-rounded, three-dimensional human characters acting as more than mere story fuel for the world's largest wrestling match, then perhaps simply purchase a ticket for Rocketman instead. This one isn't for you.But oh those wrestling matches... for any long-time Godzilla fans, this movie is a genuine treasure; an unbridled, unabashed, unashamed delight designed to reawaken your slumbering, titanic inner child and have them punching the air with glee. It's an undeniable gift to fans of the franchise, and the soundtrack by Bear McCreary (of last year's God of War, on PS4) is an absolute belter; perfectly tiptoeing the line between referential homage and modern Hollywood bombast.Also of note is the returning Ken Watanabe, who truly is one of the movie industry's greatest imports, and brings a sense of zen gravitas that keeps the film ticking over in quieter scenes.All in all, if you're a fan of Godzilla or simply giant monsters, then you should be already out the door and on your way to the next available screening if you haven't already seen it. And if you think this all sounds like a preposterously stupid waste of your time? Well, King of the Monsters has virtually no interest in convincing you otherwise. Hail to the King, baby. SKREEEEEEEEEONK!","15 out of 25 found this helpful."

I have been a life long viewer of the iconic, mutilated beastie so the movie sated that, my desire to view a ""Big Green"" movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the CGI variations of the classic monsters and their shenanigans that would end in the oft death and destruction of humans and their abodes.Afterwards I decided to visit the Internet Movie Database Site to attempt to gauge the response to the movie. This site has actually in that vein become useless in that so many false reviews are posted as to skew any reliable rating.Let us define what the vast majority of imbeciles deem a review. They post ""opinions"". Are you aware that an opinion is NOT a review. If a person is to proffer an objective review, it would entail such observations such as quality of cinematography, quality of music, sound, acting, story, quality of special effects, etc. One would take these individual observation and explain in detail why they fail or succeed.The large percentile of bipedal, thought deficient twits that decide to write a review dwell into nary a reason as to why their opinion should even be perused. Hence I was quite entertained by what I read.Let us start with ""This is a GODZILLA movie"". The cretins that proclaim this movie deserves a 1 or 2 have obviously never seen a Godzilla movie. ""It had a horrible story"" they whine. Please elucidate me. Name the academy award winning ""Godzilla"" movie you are comparing this to? I have seen every Godzilla movie made. They are like old friends. Let me expound upon this. When I find myself under the weather and convalescing, I love throwing in a good old Godzilla movie. If it is an MST3k or Rifftrax version, all the better! I can only liken it to having a companion sitting in the room with me and it brings me comfort.What are these decriers of the film screaming about a poor story? We have seen this story in countless other Godzilla movies. How many times have you seen the monsters controlled and utilized by aliens to wreak mass destruction and death? I can name the movies. How many times has someone used an oxygen destroyer? I can name the movies. How many times is the focal point a child? I can name the movies. How many times is the military brought in to deal with the problem with new weapons? I can name the movies. How many of them have a revenge motive? I can name the movies. Story wise, is it is a Godzilla movie, what did you expect you anencephalic twits?We are discussing THIRTY FIVE films! The majority consists of grown individuals in rubber suits wrestling with each other on miniature constructed sets they destroy and due to sweating profusely, also smell intolerable! All are horridly dubbed. My preference is to have captions on and soundtrack in native language. You want bad? I will make you watch ""Godzilla VS the Smog Monster"" from start to finish. Then you will know what ""BAD"" is. So essentially take your 1s and 2s as your rating and cram them up your posterior orifice! You demonstrate you know NOTHING about Godzilla movies or movies in general. You would not know a bad movie if it crawled inside your underwear and stitched your buttock together with cat gut.This one is even more inane. ""The acting was horrible!"" Can any twit enlighten me as to when it was a requisite to have the ability to act to be in a Godzilla movie? These movies have always been low budget films. The acting in the new movie is more than adequate. The cast is comprised of some very well-known actors and they are more than competent in their roles. What did you expect, Shakespearean trained thespians?Anyone that complains about the CGI qualifies for a trans-orbital lobotomy. ""Calling doctor Freeman and please bring your ice pick!"" If you are attempting to contend that prior movies consisted of better effects, I am truly sorry about whatever unfortunate circumstances befell you to cause such a monumental amount of brain damage. I guess neural plasticity is of no benefit to you. CGI was very good and I could recognize the monsters with no difficulty. We even get our obligatory shot of Godzilla standing up in the middle of the ocean which he can do, no matter the depth! His great girth is very float worthy.I was disappointed that they did not use the Blue Oyster Cult song ""Godzilla"" at the end of the movie. The version used was dreadful. The sound track was more than adequate as well likening back to variations of previous tried and true and recognizable themes.Even if you are not a Godzilla fan or are a Godzilla fan, the movie does deserve at least an average rating. It is hardly the worse movie ever made and it is not even close to being the best movie ever made. There is a reality, why not attempt to seek it instead of wallowing in your version of it.","1 out of 6 found this helpful."

Over the last few years the genre has performed much better than the superhero genre in terms of entertainment in my opinion, might be controversial but I stick by it.Godzilla II had me excited ever since it was announced because I loved the first one and Vera Farmiga being in it was a bonus. The reason this films doesn't do as well as the first one because the plot begins abruptly and has unnecessary twists which add no value to the movie. Unlike Kong Skull Island the battles in this movie was very nerdy than bloody. Too much was focused on the visuals and very less on action. Charles Dance was very disappointing in this film and the whole ""eco terrorist"" thing was very lazy.Though the second part was quite disappointing I still look forward to watching Kong vs Godzilla next year and I hope the battles in that are very bloody with lots of tensions and scares.","1 out of 6 found this helpful."

This is important because the destruction wreaked by the Titans -- Godzilla and his ilk -- will put millions in what's left of the streets. The monsters are undeniably big and powerful and a handful scenes cast some truly memorable images of giants slugging it out.Still, the monster combat is for the most part linear and suspenseless. And I couldn't help but wonder throughout at the inconsistencies in their destructive power. The monsters seem to have no problem leveling an entire metropolitan downtown area -- either by marching through buildings like matchsticks, or by generating F5-level tornadoes by simply flying over it -- yet when the protagonists' vehicle it struck by one of the monsters, the worst they suffer is a cracked windshield.Which leads me to the main characters, an estranged combat-scientist couple who vie for the attention of their plucky adolescent daughter. This movie would have you believe that their little family drama is the most important thing going on against the backdrop of cataclysmic, extinction-level events threatening the human species. Inexplicably, world government organizations tasked with the study of the monsters and the preservation of human life in recognition of their existence diverge from their mission, on multiple occasions, to help this trio of protagonists, while presumably millions of others are being massacred.Is it worth it? If you love Godzilla, this is another film in that series, so queue up. If you enjoy plot, suspense, character development, or even inventive onscreen action, the best part may be the end credits.","14 out of 30 found this helpful."

The monster fights were probably only 20 minutes of this 2 hour movie. There were 17 monsters, and only 20 minutes of fighting??? How do you fail that much?I consider story to be the most important aspect of any film. And that is why this movie was such trash. I wasn't expecting any story, and that would have been WAY better!

I personally wish they fleshed out Charles Dance's character a bit more, the group mentions his backstory, briefly, and they really only touch upon his motives, Dance did a fine job nonetheless.

If you came to this movie to see human drama drown out the main reason of the movie then go watch bumblebee. This movie was made with fans in mind and it's a shame that just because this movie doesn't have some clique romantic interest and doesn't follow a complicated plot that it receives such bad reviews. Would you go to Olive garden expecting a grand meal? No, you go there for the breadsticks and to take what you ordered home for later. It's as if critics are trying to complain that this was supposed to be some epic about the human condition, but got an authentic Godzilla movie instead.

But if you accept this going in, then you can phase out and enjoy the CGI art (if you are into that).On the other hand, the CGI artists have done their job well. When it comes to the build ups here, I think every scene is well built up. You are at the edge of your seat waiting for Godzilla to roar. The fight scenes are very well choreographed.

I mean, all the dialogue, motivations and actions of our ""heroes"" are nonsensical and stupid. The stuff that happens in this and the situations they get into and out of are beyond implausible. I laughed a lot in this, mostly because of the stupid things the adults do and say. I made a mistake of eating while watching and I did spit out countless drinks cause of how unintentionally funny it was.For the first hour, I only wanted to destroy this movie, but after I finished it I can't rate it less than 6/10. I am not a Godzilla fan, but I know some of the lore, mostly from old AVGN videos, so I recognized and recalled the names of the most iconic monsters (they do, however, spell them for you).I was surprised and amazed just how awesome and breathtaking Godzilla can be. When he's on screen, it just blows your mind, SO MUCH POWER! He looked great due to good CGI work and he sounded like pure power due to professional sound design. Imagine seeing something like this in real life? Impressive.So, while this is sort of a guilty pleasure, I did enjoy Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and so will you. I think, sitting through an hour of stupidity is still worth getting to the fun part.P.S. Surprisingly enough, this movie uses the orange&teal look which was very popular in the early 2000s. Also, thanks for using the classic theme <3To the Director - seriously, what is up with that in-your-face Jesus symbolism?","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

Because it's the dynamic between Kyle Chandler, Ken Watanabe and Ziyi Zhang is what made the scenes they share more tolerable despite some atrocious dialogue and unbearably cringe-worthy one-liners. And because Millie Bobby Brown could have single-handedly made the formulaic dramatic arc work if it wasn't for the fact the film went for the action from the get-go and for almost the entire first 40 minutes, which is basically consists of a set of crammed together segments of non-stop action and explosions which are all devoid of the slightest tension.After showing many monsters on screen, for a reason or no reason, to give those who hated Godzilla what they wanted, the plot began to unravel. But the rest of the movie isn't actually any better. As the more the story proceeds, the clearer it appears how superficial and uninspired it is. I liked both Gareth Edwards's Godzilla and Jordan Vogt-Roberts's Kong: Skull Island, so it's not like I can't stand a mindless creature feature, but this is just extremely poorly made. Even the CGI that most people were praising I found quite disappointing. King Ghidorah, in particular, looks so cartoonish. I mean, Disney's Hercules's Hydra looks more realistic!(3/10)","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

One of the things I like about this movie is the continued Worldbuilding of this Kaiju/Titan world. The movie explores the mythology of the Kaiju's, and the scope of the reign of the Kaiju's which is interesting. But the movie does a good job in other regards as well.One of the things that I believe this movie does well is getting more Monster action. The thing I wish the 1st movie did better at is at least giving us a decent look at the Monster fights, and this movie did well in that regard. Especially in the third act. The way they used the Kaiju's in combat were interesting. And some of the kills were actually pretty awesome. The only complaint I have is that we didn't get more through out the movie.Obviously, the human stories are known for getting sidelined, and not enough care. I would say that compared to the previous films, they did a better job in that regard. Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga did a good job with their characters and actually had interesting arcs. Shoutout to Millie Bobby Brown. She was surprising, and had a great character arc in the film as well. And of course, Ken Watanabe. He will always have a part in this franchise in my eyes. He did well.There were definitely more shots in this film that were memorable. I really liked the Cinematography in this one. As well as the score. Shoutout to BearMcCreary. The way he handled Godzilla's theme was a standout.Overall, this is a better film then the rest, but it's not perfect. You either eat up all of this Monster action, or you don't. As for me, I'm still here, and giving it a fighting chance.King of the Monsters is a very respectable C+","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

Why is it that they always cloak the FX in darkness, rain, and tiny micro clips of action? Grow a pair and show a daytime cloudless battle where the monsters battles are at the forefront of the action. I'm not asking for 10 uninterrupted minutes of monster fighting each time, for that would get tiresome, but please.I'm praying that the new director for the Kong movie will provide us with a fresh perspective on this.

Unfortunately they really didn't imo and if anything they complicated things. I wanted more focus on Godzilla and the monsters and less on the human characters and that was achieved barely. We still had an overabundance of human character drama and screen time with fights sprinkled in every once in awhile. When the monsters were on screen the CGI is just overwhelming at times and looked unrealistic at times. I know it's hard to portray giant monsters smoothly, but something just felt unnatural in some of the cgi renderings. Maybe it's the fact they had more fights and scenes in more lighting variations and colors. I commend them for at least trying to show more than the first film but they haven't perfected it yet in these newer Godzilla films. Overall there's still some redeeming visual moments but I really expected more this time around. If they want Godzilla vs Kong to be amazing like it should be, they need to shift focus on the battles instead of forced character drama.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

So I'm left reflecting on what I can remember about it now.Having lost their son in the initial Godzilla battle, Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is working for Monarch on a way to communicate and control the various monsters they've identified around the world. Her research is stolen by the eco-terrorist Jonah (Charles Dance) who wakes up a number of the creatures in an attempt to cull humanities influence and reboot the planet.Sign me up as another one who prefers Garth Edwards 2014 version over this one. Though I didn't care for the characters in that one, the decision to have Godzilla's battles as background until the very end was a good one, as presumably he realised that the actual fights between the monsters are pretty boring. This is not a lesson that ""KOTM"" understood, and there are several dull (but beautiful) fights between Godzilla and the other monsters, each one generally like two skyscrapers banging into each other.The human characters surrounding the fights are again, not great. There is no cliché left untouched with the various scientists and military types - nothing original or interesting. Ken Wanatabe speculates wildly as to what the motivations for the creatures might be, providing a context that isn't really earned. I swear the line ""You have got to see this"" is used at least eight times.Reflectively, I think I feel a bit better about it than I did at the time, as what I can really recall is those pre-fight scenes of the monsters facing off, where it almost looks like a renaissance painting and I'll see the King Kong crossover next year, but I shan't be rushing back to rewatch this one any time soon.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

"6","/10","Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a film worthy of the greatness of its protagonist. The monsters on screen are well used and the fight between them is visually impressive","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6274308/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","15 November 2020","Whether from land, fire, water or air, the imposing titans are the true protagonists of Godzilla II: King of the Monsters, however much the title character is used as the axis that makes everything develop. The creatures presented give enough gas to make this sequence a combination of fan service with a somewhat limited history, but still decent in delivering pure entertainment. Godzilla, one of the most important characters in Japanese cinema, regains his due place in American mainstream cinema as part of the Monsterverse, started in 2014, and now with much more company - both to show how far he can go and also to see a portion the potential of other creatures. This portion is one of the most interesting in the film, but it is not 100% used when we analyze the greatness of each one. If in the previous film, Godzilla was another element of the narrative and not the protagonist in fact, now the situation changes. The film invests much more in kaiju, creating an arc of its own. His first appearance is well presented, as well as his first fight against Ghidorah. This makes the film much more intense and fun for those who wait for a work with giant creatures.However, if this time the monster gains more space, the script loses in depth. Not that in the previous work this was relevant, but here it is no longer important. Humans are in the background, but it is not as if there is a precarious development of the characters. Vera Farmiga, Ken Watanabe and Kyle Chandler, together with the young Millie Bobby Brown (who will certainly be more used in the next film) and a small participation of Charles Dance, support the arc that addresses the weight of the choices in reviving the kaijus in the face of disasters that have been plaguing the Earth - as much as it is not possible to see something special in most of the performances, with the exception of Farmiga and Watanabe. The seriousness of these characters towards their missions is reflected in the film as a whole, which is even darker than the 2014 film and whose atmosphere is totally different from Kong: Skull Island.
Director Michael Dougherty is right to create a feeling of inferiority, not through the use of any benchmark, but through the impact of the action. Each blow is capable of destroying a building, the flapping of wings creates a gale, a walk is capable of causing a small earthquake. All of this builds a chaotic and confusing scenario, but well used by the direction that, even with quick cuts and sudden camera movements, manages to situate the audience of everything that is happening in the scene.With very few explanations, we are already introduced to a device called ""ORCA"", which is nothing more than a sonar for communication with the titans. This device is what, apparently, would allow peaceful coexistence between humans and monsters, and it is what it demonstrated when we met the first of the main titans of the plot: Mothra. However, ORCA would end up in the wrong hands, and is now under the tutelage of British ecoterrorism Jonah Allan (Charles Dance), who kidnaps Emma and Madison together with the device. By taking possession of the equipment, Allan could achieve his main objective: to make human beings and the titans live and rebuild the terrestrial ecosystem, but not without cleaning it up.The script forces us to buy a motivation that doesn't seem ready. Up to a certain point, the mystery and shock of a revelation accompanies us and anesthetizes us for a treatment that is not very good in relation to the ""great reason"" that, in truth, does not apply as promised, which weakens the side of the ""Bad humans"" at some point in the projection. Adding this to the other problem of the final block that I mentioned earlier, we find the set of major annoyances in the film. If the viewer is very demanding in terms of gadgets and use of technology for zoological and biological purposes, or if he has a high sense of collection and oceanographic and geological veracity, he will certainly leave the room with a few more problems on the list and maybe like it less of the movie. It doesn't help that the script is so condescending to the viewer, with dialogues constantly explanatory, and that the performances are so lukewarm, despite the cast itself being good: Farmiga and Chandler do not show an ounce of emotion, which is also seen in Millie Bobby Brown; the Stranger Things actress is even worse for being the focus of many dramatic scenes, but never indulging in the role. All of this feeds the idea that the whole human side only serves to complete the two hours of duration, since everything seems poorly planned and is poorly executed.
The problem is precisely how the human core is reactive to the real interesting side of the feature, serving only to create a new perspective that, in the end, does not fulfill the objective of facilitating the viewer's empathy and, even worse, complicates the use of the other half. Human dramas are necessary for the narrative, and even serve as a backdrop for battles, but the characters do not captivate and the performances do not convince. The story is generic and forgettable.
King of the Monsters makes much of the mistakes of his predecessors in the process. Despite being a sequel, the film carries almost nothing from the 2014 Gareth Edwards feature film, but rather much of the elements introduced in Kong: Skull Island (2017), such as the role of the monarch mega corporation in identifying and researching giant monsters, called Titans - which, in turn, are awakening worldwide and threatening the human race. That's where Godzilla comes into action to defend it. It is interesting to see the kaiju finally being presented as an ally from the beginning, indicating that from now on the franchise is very likely to get closer and closer to Japanese approaches - and thus create its own new stories without relying so much on human characters. It is not for nothing that the confrontation is easily the best part of the film, which delivers great confrontations between the protagonist and classic monsters of his mythology, such as King Ghidorah and Rodan. In addition to the creatures having a grotesque enough look, it is in these moments that cinematographer Lawrence Sher takes the hand and portrays the conflicts with a terrifying notion of the Titans' dimension.The film treats monsters as gods and uses Ken Watanabe and his devotion to Godzilla very well to address this bias. And one of the most beautiful scenes in this film comes from Watanabe. There are also some small easter eggs, which relate the names of the Monarch bases to the canon of monsters, an extra glow that shows how aware of themselves this work is. There are very positive aspects besides the fights and action scenes, but the script really tries to ruin everything. Unnecessary twists, villains explaining in detail their plans with the right to video and infographics on the subject, shameful dialogues and protagonists who know absolutely everything better than all the specialists on the scene, which does not make sense.
Due to its long duration, the pace of the story is also slowed. The focus between the introduction of each kaiju and the resolution of the problems of those who work together with the Monarch company is lost a lot, sometimes during long explanations to contextualize all the choices made so far, sometimes with the sub-plot of the family involved personally and professionally on the issue. With a montage attached to the standard of films of the genre, such scenarios do not connect as well when the fights gain more prominence. At various times, the excess of visual effects and sound gives us the impression that the film will never end. It seems that we are seeing the same scenes being repeated in looping, which is extremely tiring.Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a film worthy of the greatness of its protagonist. The monsters on screen are well used and the fight between them is visually impressive. The soundtrack lacks a little personality, which depends a lot on the action of the film to stand out, but there is not a single striking theme. Nothing that harms the film, that knows that its merit is in the monsters and clings to it strongly. There are some bridges established for the future of the franchise, with King Kong and Skull Island being mentioned several times throughout the projection. If it continues at this pace, it is difficult to imagine how many films planet Earth will be able to resist to this wonderful duel of titans.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

Picking up where we left our characters off, Ken Watanabe & Sally Hawkins now are part of a program called Monarch which monitors the Titans (the emerging giants) in the world to make sure a repeat carnage of the original doesn't repeat itself but when a husband/wife (Kyle Chandler/Vera Fermiga) team of scientists (who are separated due to their loss of their son from the events of the prior film) are besieged by some eco-terrorists hellbent on letting the monsters destroy the planet to reboot our environment, their focus is on awakening King Ghidorah (or Monster Zero), the alpha of the bunch, to lead the imminent chaos using a controlling device which the 'on the outs' married couple created. When it turns out the alpha is controlling the creatures due its alien origins, our favorite sky high stomper is enlisted to win the fight before we're decimated for good. Introducing new characters into the mix may've sounded good on paper (especially Millie Bobbie Brown as the couple's daughter) they really add more noise to the mix when the monsters themselves (taking a back seat to all the domestic strife) become background figures. Even in the heyday of Godzilla films (at least for me) in the 1970's, the Japanese filmmakers knew when to give human beings their small share of the action letting the main events (namely the bestial fisticuffs) take center stage. We'll see if they've learned their lessons since the next bout will be Kong versus Godzilla & humans having their moment in the sun will be the last thing on a ticket buyer's mind when they plunk down their money.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

The Japanese created Gojira as a means of sneaking socio-political allegories in their movies and then the Americans took over, made the name Godzilla a household name and started doing larger than life monster movies. It was basically created as a B-movie where people wore latex suits to look like monsters and punch each other on set. So what does the new Godzilla do? It follows both its Japanese and American roots by creating a massive monster flick with deep seeded social allegories.I don't go to a Godzilla movie expecting an Oscar-bait and neither should the critics responsible for its low score. It was clearly made for fans who loved and stayed with Godzilla all their life and I dare say it's the best one yet.The two biggest downsides to this movie are ice thin plot and even thinner script. The plot is not necessarily bad but mainly serves as a breather for the next action sequence. The main intention of the ""bad guy"" is undoubtedly the worst motivation and reasoning I've seen in a movie. But once that is out of the way the plot progression is relatively passable. The story basically circulates around a device created by the scientist played by Vera Farmiga (I think she's called Emma, I didn't care and kinda forgot) and her dumb reasoning and approach to awaken the Titans and destroy a portion of humanity in order to ensure sustenance of the rest. And if that sounds familiar then congratulations you've seen Infinity War where it came off less sadistically and goofy than in here.As for the script, well there isn't one. I can bet the director walked in and said, ""Listen guys, it's a Godzilla movie and no one cares about the humans. So just say whatever pops in your head and we'll run with it"". And that is exactly what happened or if that isn't the case, they should fire whoever wrote it.As we all know, a bad script brings forth bad acting and there are a few. Well I wouldn't call it bad but it surely was lackluster. Ken Watanabe yet again wasted in a movie but I'll let it slide as he was responsible for a very awesome scene which I won't spoil. Thomas Middleditch was there doing usual Thomas Middleditch stuffs and Kyle Chandler seemed to be talking to a wall at one scene and his character felt like a ""know-it-all"" snob and was unbearable for the most part. Bradley Whitford mainly carried on with the jokes and Sally Hawkins did absolutely nothing. Vera Farmiga seemed like she was still in the Conjuring set and provided nothing out of the ordinary. The only decent performance came from the oldest and the youngest of the cast. Charles Dance was as threatening as he was as Tywin and did the best with what he was given. Millie Bobby Brown was given to be the damsel in distress and she actually did a fantastic job.Now that we've dropped off the cheap script, subpar acting and a plot as thin as it can be, let's take a look at why it is the best Godzilla movie ever made. The visuals were just jaw dropping and some of the shots in the film were absolutely sublime. The use of color to mark creatures was extraordinary and highly appreciable. The cinematography for the most part was solid aside from a few close-up shots but those were very few and far between. The monster designs were hands down the best I've seen and their scales were appropriately huge. Mothra looked absolutely beautiful and Ghidora retained its serpentine traits.The scale of this movie has to be mentioned as that is what drew me towards it. The sheer size and volume of each titan was a sight to behold as were the trails of destruction that followed. Words can't explain how much I loved the massive scales of everything.The fight sequences were truly fantastic and are a worthwhile. You can never go wrong with big monsters fighting each other in a half destroyed city and this movie cements that case. And this is the first Godzilla movie that offers more than a fair share of monster brawls and that too with gorgeous visuals with technical mastery. All my life I waited for a Godzilla movie that had each of the aforementioned elements and with Godzilla: King of Monsters I've finally found it.The movie contains its fair share of Titans although I was expecting some more fan favorite ones. Luckily a few of them were teased and although I wouldn't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet but let me just say two words: ""Oxygen Destroyer"". If you get the reference I'm sure you're just as excited for what's to come just like me.The movie pays proper homage to Japanese classics and even managed to play a variation of the core monster theme songs. The sound mixing was pure bliss as was the score in general. The classic Godzilla scream and the heavenly Mothra noise are all there as is their themes. They even teased the Mothra fairies in a way and I can't believe they actually made it work without coming off as super goofy.
In all fairness Godzilla: King of the monsters is a movie I've been waiting and wanting to see ever since I first saw the animated show and later got reacquainted with the Japanese classics. If you want to get the essence of a Godzilla movie, its lore and just basic monster on monster action in a grand scale with masterful visuals; this is the movie for you.

"6","/10","It's far from terrible overall, but could have been better","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5613166/?ref_=tt_urv","Jeremy_Urquhart","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26226712/?ref_=tt_urv","6 April 2020","Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an interesting film, and it's one that I had a surprisingly neutral reaction to overall. It's notable for being the first American Godzilla film to contain other monsters from the original Japanese films, and so there is a certain thrill seeing them brought to life with all the money and technology that an American studio can allow.For the most part, the scenes with the monsters doing their thing are quite entertaining. I generally liked the designs for all of them, and the variety was nice (there are even a few brand new monsters glimpsed that all looked pretty decent too). My one complaint regarding the monsters though would be how just about every monster scene is shot either in darkness, the rain, or with huge amounts of dust and smoke blowing around. Or a combination of two or all of them.I think audiences are savvy as to why this happens: it hides flaws with the CGI, and look, doing it every now and then is forgivable, but it's extremely noticeable when it happens in almost every single monster scene (I think the one monster sequence that was well lit and free of obstructions was Rodan's first scene). Kong: Skull Island was, from memory, well lit and colourful; I wish its influence could've rubbed off a little here.But there are other good things here. The music, for example: hearing the old Godzilla and Mothra themes reworked into the soundtrack here was great. I also like the casting here; there are so many actors in this movie I've loved from other projects, like Bradley Whitford, Charles Dance, Sally Hawkins, Kyle Chandler, Thomas Middleditch, and CCH Pounder. Unfortunately, they're not given great material to work with. Characters are extremely simplistic, even by Godzilla standards. It's hard not to zone out of many of the human-centric scenes. Godzilla (2014) may have had less action, but it did have a human storyline that was for the most part tolerable.It's still watchable because of the mostly entertaining monster stuff, and some of the human scenes aren't completely awful, but it adds up to a movie that can't quite rise above decent. The premise is pretty insane when you think about it, and so maybe a similarly absurd, even humorous storyline (like in Godzilla: Final Wars) could have worked, but I'm sure they were afraid to have a non-conventional human storyline in here, in case it turned people off. However, now that the human side of things in this movie has been almost universally criticised, hopefully we'll get another movie with a similar budget but a more fun or simply less annoying human storyline.Time will tell. Admittedly, I'm still looking forward to Godzilla's upcoming fight with King Kong. Until then, I'll hope that it can at least be a little better than this somewhat entertaining but ultimately very flawed film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Also I have to say that I am in the minority in the fact that I really enjoyed the first film ""Godzilla"" back in 2014 by Gareth Edwards. I suppose if we are looking at the bigger franchise or universe as a whole I also quite enjoyed ""Kong : Skull Island"" in 2017. So the odds are stacked in favour in this film.......for me personally anyway.In a nutshell I was really let down by this film, I'd have to say that its the weakest out of the three films in the ""Monster franchise"" at Warner Bros. It did the exact opposite of what the first film did right. The biggest complaint of the film ""Godzilla"" was that it didn't show enough of Godzilla himself, which actually I thought was one of the film's biggest positives. I really liked the fact that you didn't see Godzilla fully until the end of the film, just giving you hints here and there throughout the rest of the film. I know I'm in the minority but I really like that aspect, it gave the end battle scenes more spectacle and wow factor. Definitely reminded me of ""Jaws"" and ""Jurassic Park"".Unfortunately this film has taken that complaint from audiences and has gone 180 degrees the opposite in this film because there is so much action and Godzilla fighting that it becomes boring and bland. Within the first 15 minutes there is a fight between monsters, for me all the anticipation leading to the fights is over. After that its just more and more dull as the film goes on because you just bombarded with fight after fight after fight. It gets exhausting! For me and I know I'm probably in the minority again but in this film there are too many monsters and too many action scenes, its over used.Its not helped by a range of characters that you just don't care about at all. Especially for the new characters, which there are a lot of them, the development of them is very weak. It means that as an audience member you cant gravitate to them or connect to them, which ultimately means that you done care about what happens to them. Don't get me wrong the performances they were fine across the board, however I was wanting more time with them. The only characters I slightly cared for were Sally Hawkins and Ken Watanabe's characters but thats only because they were set up in the previous film.Even though I was really disappointed there are some positives, as I mentioned the performances were fine. Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga and Mille Bobby Brown were fine not to the same level as Bryan Cranston in the first film but still good. The effects are great, the scope and scale of the first film has carried on, and there are some really beautiful shots in this film. Lastly I would say this film does at least try to connect to the wider cinematic universe although its not done fully that well.Overall its 65% out of 100 or 6.5 out of 10 its ok and that is being very generous because I could have easily given it a lower rating but strangely I am still looking forward to when Kong and Godzilla eventually meet. The story is a bit all over the place, to much overused fight scenes and action, not great dialogue for a cast that is at least trying buts its not terrible. Unfortunately thats probably the overriding feeling is that it wasn't terrible.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

Starring Kyle Chandler, Ken Watanabe, Vera Farmiga, Bradley Whitford, Zhang Ziyi, Thomas Middleditch, Millie Bobbie Brown, Charles Dance, Aisha Hinds, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn. (PG-13)A few years after the events of Gareth Edwards' ""Godzilla"" reboot, the world is full of massive monsters (kaiju called ""Titans""), though they're largely dormant...until they, of course, awaken, or else it wouldn't be much of a movie. Before long, the Mothra larva has cocooned itself and a not-particularly-bright paleobiologist (Farmiga) has awakened Rodan and King Ghidorah, and they're all on a collision course for an epic smackdown. There's also some human drama stuffed in there (taking up too much screen time), including eco-terrorists, family crises, and more; ingenuous Zhang, solemn Watanabe, and a few wisecracks from a bleary Whitford are fine, but the rest clutter up an already overly busy motion picture. The kaiju bouts (the reason to watch) are periodically intense and engaging, but Dougherty sets all of these sequences in dark, wet, smoky conditions, either in a clumsy attempt to add hackneyed atmosphere or to obscure special effects that wouldn't be up to snuff otherwise. Either way, the murkiness diminishes the visual excitement, and without the eye-filling presence of Gojira and crew, all that's left are a bunch of people prattling on about what the beasties are up to--what a gyp!57/100","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

I just find it odd then that it's let down by things much easier and potentially cheaper to fix.The primary culprits are the writers I would say. The main problems seems to be the way things are knitted together. Elements of the storyline that seem to be critical to its explanation are mentioned in nothing but a passing breath, and then other far less important topics are covered with far too much attention. Sometimes the script seems to jump about and at times the acting seems to falter, primarily because the material they were given doesn't deliver the performances the actors/actresses are capable of. All in all, it ends up feeling a bit wonky and disjointed, and at times mildly confusing. Which is strange and frustrating for a movie franchise that has so much potential.Still, I would never want to make people believe this is a bad movie, it's not, I really enjoyed it a lot and am looking forward to the next instalment.

And secondly, of things I probably haven't said first: Godzilla 2 is amazing. Ignore the critics, not because they're wrong (well, they are still wrong, in the sense that they think The Last Jedi is a good movie and got so much hate), but because they aren't YOU. You, as a person, should judge this movie as a person alone. Critics are wrong in the sense that they are objectified by watching film, and have gotten bored doing it. The person, in this case, meaning YOU, probably only watch 1 movie a weekend, like me. They're entertaining because you don't watch film often, and it creates a wholesome experience. Critics are bored, drawn out, and occasionally idiots when watching and reviewing film, because they have seen SO. MANY. MOVIES. The average viewer likes (or hates) movies and study them well, and are right when judging them, because they put so much love into their work. Critics watch hundreds of movies every month, and are getting so disconnected with these movies that they just follow the big trend with the movie. If it looks like it's hated, even without watching, they just say it's bad and go on. This is wrong. Now, when looking at this movie, it has problems. Obvious ones. The family drama is wack, and also kind of underwhelming, and the humans altogether are kind of big buffoons that make jokes every five minutes. Although, going back to the ""critics"", they said it's boring. They said, a Godzilla movie is BORING. I have NO clue where they decided to pull that out of the deepest parts of their empty souls, but it doesn't matter. The goods in this outweigh the bad. The music is phenomenal, and the fights are outrageously fun. To sum it all up in one insanely tasty taco, this movie is a blast, and I plan on seeing it once more in the theaters.

Critics have yet again forgotten what it means to have fun at the movies. Take your kids, friends, co-workers, take anyone! Words do not do this film justice go see it on the biggest screen possible. Now that Endgame has come and gone it's time to make room for heros of a larger stature.","67 out of 138 found this helpful."

G2 turns out to be so bad, it's hard to believe adult people are responsible for it. The movie goes through every imaginable trope without an ounce of imagination, whether we're talking about plot, dialogue or pacing. The end result is really a Syfy production blown up to gargantuan proportions causing one to squirm in one's seat.
A lethargic and miserable-looking Kyle Chandler plays the lead as a family man trying to save the world from the monsters with the help of an all too serious military personnel. And why shouldn't Chandler be dour? His lines are laughable and he must have spent weeks under artificial rain. The entire second half happens in rain and storm; thus, G2 is an unbelievably bad-looking movie, shot in ugly shades of miserable greys. The generically swelling music destroys the soundtrack.
G2 is a massive spectacle, that needs to make a half a billion dollars to break even; so, how was this script, which seems to be written by 13-year-olds get an approval from the producers? All the ideas are worn-out. None of the handful of jokes are remotely funny (""hey, that monsters name sounds (nowhere near) like gonorrhea!"") Think of the worst moments of Independence Day 2 (a very bad movie) and spread into two hours.
There's action, sure - ad nauseum. It becomes numbing, not helped by how lousy the heavily filtered image looks.
One more thing. As the movie progresses, Godzilla himself (a supporting player in his own movie) starts to get disturbingly human characteristics. Incredibly, Mr. G starts to resemble a really, really grumpy, weary old man. I thought G was an over-sized lizard. The anthropomorphising taking place is the ultimate wrong note in this cacophonic symphony of rot played entirely out of tune. It's no fun.","51 out of 152 found this helpful."

The premise of the film sees 5 years after the events of the previous film Godzilla has gone missing and is forced to resurface when other Titans rise up to threaten the world.Main Character
The film has Godzilla in the title so I guess that is where I should start and Godzilla is awesome in this film. He gets more to do and we see way more of him in his epic glory as he fights more interesting Titans in this film and this is finally the Godzilla we truly deserve and the film does a great job in making him super cool in this film. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is out as the main human lead replaced by Kyle Chandler and though he is a bit better then Johnson he still is a weak element of the film. In a film where lets face it we are rooting for Godzilla, it doesn't help when one of the main characters on screen is basically against him and it makes him a character that is hard to like or care for.Supporting Characters
Millie Bobby Brown plays his daughter and I thought she was good, she is the character we are meant to root for other then Godzilla and her character is actually handled pretty well. I mean she isn't amazing or anything but she is a young actress who does a good job with the material that she is given to work with. Ken Wantanabe is back as the number 1 Godzilla fan and he is good again, he is a fun character and clearly he is somebody who enjoys himself when making these Godzilla films for sure. Charles Dance plays a bad guy and he is entertaining, the character is rubbish which holds it back but Dance is really trying to make it work and because he is so good it almost works. Also the Titans are much cooler in this film and they are way more interesting then the majority of human characters. The issue is there are other characters where it doesn't work Vera Farmiga's character is awful here, her whole motivation and character arc is absurd and really pulled me away from the interesting parts of the film . The team of protagonists is much larger here and there are these generic army guys and comic relief scientists and they just don't work, there are good actors here and it just feels like there talents are wasted.Story
The story involving Godzilla and the rest of the titans is easily the best part of the film. As we find out more about them and there backstories, the fights are given way more weight and depth to them because of the time taken with the lore and time the Titans get. The problem is like the majority of these monster films is that the human characters and their story just falls flat, There is a twist quite early on in the film and it made me just kind of check out of the human story line and though not terrible it just makes me wish the focus would go more onto the Titans but I don't think that will ever happen.Script
The script is okay, there is some good drama and emotional moments that despite my lack of interest rises the human characters up a bit and its decent enough for an okay script. Though this film isn't as stoic as the first film the humour is pretty weak and just didn't work despite the obvious attempt.Style
Easily the best part of the film is the style. This film looks amazing and finally gives these Titans the presence and fight scenes that they truly deserve. The previous film spent way too long hiding Godzilla but this film shows him in all of his glory and the action fits the magnitude that it deserves. The pacing of the film is very good too and it the film seemed to flow very nicely and kept the tians on screen for as long as possible.Overall
Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an above average film. In terms of these Monster films this is the best one yet but it still falls flat, it is clearly style over substance and if you want to see these monsters fight then yeah this is worth a watch but be prepped for the weaker human elements.Rating - 6/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Godzilla: King Of The Monsters is a Masterpiece, it's a fascinating, well-written, visually amazing film that won me over. Godzilla (2014) was really good, but the biggest downside of that Movie is that we never got enough Godzilla. And Kong: Skull Island was also a great and entertaining Movie, and they got King Kong right in many areas, but then again, he could've gotten more screen time then before. And now comes Godzilla: King Of The Monsters And holy crap this Movie is freaking Amazing and it's the best Movie I've seen all year besides Endgame.
Godzilla: King Of The Monsters is transcendent in its large scale and appeal and REAL fans are definitely in for a treat. This Movie is pure Cinematic Awesomeness that will leave you on the edge of your seat and watch amazing Kaiju fights. Easily, THE BEST GODZILLA MOVIE EVER MADE and you should definitely check it out because you're gonna get exactly what you want!","73 out of 152 found this helpful."

I'm 52 and love all creature features moves from Jason And The Argonauts to Pixar Animation Studios. Have been looking forward to this movie for a long time.
Positive: All of Charles Dance 2-5 minutes on screen was great. The few scenes that they let Millie Bobby Brown act other than looking sad or crying she was great.
Negatives: Story = There is none other then there are a bunch of monsters living under the earth and they rise up, and there are a bunch of actors that we know nothing about except the main family that we know are a family because we saw a family photo of them, and the parents split up. Main character played by one of my old time favorites from Friday Night lights Kyle Chandler has two expressions, sad eyes and surprised. All of his dialog is done in a whisper because he doesn't know what the F is going on from one minute to the next.
Special Effects: So BAD... every scene on a ship air or water; shaky camera followed by flashing red lights over and over again...Monsters are so blurry, colorless and no detail. I think Game Of Thrones has set the bar so high that any special effects studio that does movies from this day forward are going to have to step up their game.
Positive: All of my family together watching a movie, popcorn was good for once ;)
Negative: $100 plus and movie was waaayyy to long at 131 min. Was ready for it to be over after 30 min.
Save your money, wait until you can stream at home and can turn it off ;)","10 out of 23 found this helpful."

The conversations were also boring and empty.The last song was pretty good after the last scene.So overall they made a movie which looks like a tv movie from 2010 and feels like the worst of the 90's. I didn't fall asleep because I had to work...
Maybe they tried to mimic the Godzilla animated series and they'd put every episode together.... I'm not sure but I can't understand who payed for this movie, who payed for them to make it and who watched it in the cinema.You should not watch this, it's complete waste of time.

In fact, it's one of the worst films of 2019. It's just not interesting, like at all. This is definitely a problem, especially considering that it's about huge fighting monsters. It's very difficult to care about anything that's happening as you don't really care about any of the characters or situations. A lot of stuff is going off and a lot of it should be at least slightly engaging, but it just isn't. A lot of people complained that 'Godzilla' (2014) featured too many humans and too little monsters, so this time around they've tried to balance that a little. Unfortunately, though, the human stuff is even duller than before and the monster stuff is somehow arguably even less interesting than that. If you're going to make a film like this, then at least make the action watchable. These sequences are way too dark and shaky to really even understand, or at least engage with, and even when you can see Godzilla battling it isn't 'cool'; it's like trying to watch a T-Rex have a boxing match. Maybe I'm being a little harsh on it, but it's just so completely un-engaging and quite frankly boring that it's hard to recommend to anyone. I'm certainly not looking forward to 'Godzilla vs. Kong' (2020) that's for sure. 3/10","4 out of 7 found this helpful."

The first few minutes maybe a bit too slow but after that I was riveted to my seat until the end, that I managed to hold my urge for bathroom break; I would've always find a way to go to the bathroom but not this time. It was truly an exhilarating experience watching the plot being unfolded and the volatile actions that went with it.","65 out of 135 found this helpful."

There is just too much to handle for the viewer in two hours of time and it's a yawnfest especially during the last 30 mins, where you'll be just waiting impatiently for the goddamn Godzilla to emerge victorious & be accepted as the 'King' by all the other monsters!The story of the film begins with the crypto-zoological organization Monarch tracking down and studying Titans, giant God-like monsters that once dominated the Earth. What happens when these monsters rise again, leaving humanity's existence in doubt & how our hero Godzilla saves the day, forms the rest of the story.There is a scene in the movie where a woman claims that the mismanaged cities and the ever-growing population is destroying the planet and by allowing the monsters to destroy our cities, we should let nature take its own course! - which seemed very absurd to me!Although the movie has some mind boggling CGI action, almost the entire movie shows this action taking place in the black thunderous foggy skyline with several bouts of fire and bright lights flashing, which is kind of a distraction for the viewer.Overall this movie is an unwanted, violent, action-filled & messy monster slugfest which should be watched only if you are a fan of the MonsterVerse franchise or if you are game for some head spinning destruction scenes and some blaring sound effects!","7 out of 15 found this helpful."

I only viewed this at the cinema after reading reviews stating it compares well with Shin Godzilla. It doesn't.It's so stereotypically Hollywood..
There's a boo-hoo backstory of a grieving, dysfunctional family.
No suspense or build-up. No arty cinematography.
The whole film is shot in gloomy lighting -scenes are either at night / in the rain / indoors with poor lighting. Maybe this helps with the CGI, who knows but it looks like continual twilight. Oh, and the general global population seem to have vanished; in the city scenes there are no people present apart from the main characters. Not even a stray dog.Dialogue is cringeworthy, with predictable heartfelt speeches and clumsy ecological theories. There isn't even any humour.One has little sympathy for any of the characters so there's no one to really root for.

I came in the theatre expecting giant monsters to stomp humans for no particular reason and military to kaboom them, end of movie. I really dont want to spoil the movie, but given the ridculessness of the premise, that is 'existence of pointlessly giant monsters fighting for god knows why', I would rate the plot 9/10. I do not say this lightly, the most difficult element about monster movies is making the audience feel personally invested in the monster fights. No amount of CGI will make random monster fights interesting to watch. They did not just set a high benchmark for future monster fight movies, 10/10 monster fight, REALLY, they also did the impossbile, they made the monsters seem 'human'. Not the the fake human emotions other monster movies portray, but PURPOSE, purpose of existence. To that end I would say the movie is truly a work of art.I just finished reading the negative reviews, ignore them. They come in two categories, people going into a GODZILLA movie and hating all the monster fights???, people going into a GODZILLA movie and expecting to watch a Martin Luther King Life Story??? beyond ridiculous.I cannot overstate how well delivered this movie is, very well done.","7 out of 10 found this helpful."

I'd watched Godzilla (2014) a few days prior for the first time too and to say i actually liked Godzilla (2014) as i enjoyed the tone, story and camera placement. Apart from moments being a little daft, as a monster movie it worked well.Then watching Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) i didn't get that atmospheric tone. Most of the decisions characters made were dumb for the sake of moving the plot forward to the monster action. It was like they thought of the third act (the city destruction scenes) as the main drive for this film and all the story building up to that was just filler, so that's why we got Madison's mother making dumb decisions and Madison having clearance despite her being a child just so the audience could see CGI epic room rattling roars and destruction.Not much goes to say, i liked the cinematic-ness of this movie but it just seems they sped up all the story just so they could show the epic monster fights. It makes the whole thing look weak, it's the type of movie you watch in the cinema for it's visual effects and surround sound.

It's been 5 years since we've seen Godzilla in action; Monarch has formed since, an organisation set on discovering all the titans that reside on earth and determine which ones are a threat and which ones mean to protect us. When an ancient Titan is set free to cause mass destruction, Godzilla is our last hope to restore balance. The Godzilla films do have a bit of a hard time balancing human drama and monsters bashing the crap out of each other; too much of either would potentially ruin it and it's no easy task which is credit to the film crew. Although it's performed well by the entire cast and is well balanced here with plenty of action as well as the down to earth human interaction, I felt the film could have been trimmed down a bit and we still would've felt the characters are real. There are a few scenes of exposition that I felt a bit disengaged in and found myself pining for more huge scale spectacle! Having said that, when there are massive monsters on screen, its cinematically brilliant and genuinely awe-inspiring, almost terrifying moments. You need to see it on the biggest screen possible; the sound design and visuals are truly spectacular! Much like its predecessor, you can really feel the gargantuan nature of the creatures on screen. The introductory scene for Mothra is quite beautiful and she has been designed wonderfully; a real ethereal quality when she glows on screen. This is the work of filmmakers who really love their monsters and portray them with real emotion and not just physical bravado. The score also really stood out to me; Bear McCreary (10 Cloverfield Lane, The Walking Dead) creates a truly epic soundtrack that is grand yet also delicate when it needs to be and really beautiful. Overall, absolutely worth a watch on the big screen and has breathtaking moments","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

What is the point in what Dr. Russell (Farmiga) and Alex Johan (Dance) are trying to achieve? How are (in fact highly radioactive) monsters contributing to a better environmental balance on the planet? Weak acting and plenty of cliches in the script (family drama, escaping little girl under risk, bad mercs, etc.) complete the human-induced mess. You get the picture.By contrast, the scenes of monsters wrecking havoc and fighting each other are well made and all the money! That's what the Godzilla brand is all about, people! Pure, gigantic, extravagant and incredibly-premised fun. The monster subgenre does not lend itself well to making a sober environmental parable, so if that's what you want to do, leave the ""Titans"" out of it and into their own style.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

In the 2nd place, I'd put KOTM but it was mostly because of the awesome representation of the other big 3 of Kaiju realm...Rodan, Mothra & Ghidorah. Other than that, now it seems Gareth Edwards' 2014 GODZILLA at least did better than KOTM in terms of the Scale/size representation of the monsters, the momentum build up before their each appearance as well as treatments of the human characters(!). There's no short-lived, moving character like Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody this time; instead they introduced a kind of similar major character, Dr. Emma Russel (played by Vera Farmiga) but with questionable or at times laughable motivation & decision making level. Moreover, the way they put Millie Bobby Brown's 'Madison' into the midst of the epic finale also wasn't convincing at all, IMO. That being said, KOTM is still a great fan service for the Kaiju lovers. Monsters' brawls were quite epic from start to finish, specially Rodan & Mothra both were phenomenal and I wish they would have made a solo film for both of them in between of Skull Island & KOTM. Absolutely loved the way they introduced Ghidorah with distinctive personality for each of his head, he was totally the big badass of the story like the way he deserved to be in. Expected to see a little more diversified range of other monsters but overall Michael Dougherty & his team did a good job regarding the mythological aspects of the Titans.Aside from the cheesy writings here & there, GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is an absolute must see for fans of big G; a solid summer blockbuster. I'll give it another watch pretty soon.","7 out of 10 found this helpful."

If you want mindless action were you caht even see what's going on half the time you'll like this but prob for the only half an hour total screen time of action scenes, the rest of the film consisted of a terrible plot and absolutely horrendous dialogue. CGI was amazing and looks beautiful so all credit to the VFX team who worked hard on this. In saying all that this film has some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a film. Its laughable how bad the lines are. None of the jokes land and you laugh at times that you're not ment to. And you couldn't care less about the human characters in this, and several plot points don't make any sense and you'd wonder how the producers and writers thought this was good while reading it back to themselves.","6 out of 13 found this helpful."

You should probably still watch the 2014 Godzilla as it is a good movie in its own right.Can we just get it out there that most people go to see a Godzilla movie for the fight scenes? Don't get me wrong, you don't just want a two-hour movie dedicated to nothing but Godzilla smashing buildings from the first minute, you do need some build up/a plot. However, I'm not sure why so many critics are completely slamming this movie into the ground over the fact that there is a lot of Godzilla fight scenes. I feel this movie did a good enough job to keep a sensible balance between human interactions and monster interactions. CGI was good as well, you can tell by the level of detail that plenty of time was spent perfecting this. Was this the best CGI/VFX I've ever seen? No, but a great job anyway.You can tell Kyle Chandler wanted this film to succeed, the emotion, the intensity, just everything... he does it well here. May of overshadowed Millie Bobby Brown's big film debut a little bit, she did an excellent job as well but hats off to Kyle, brilliant performance.Even though I would still suggest watching Godzilla: King of the Monsters, it did have a few flaws. Firstly, when monsters are fighting, it goes into a shaky cam mode to try and show off the enormity of the action. However, the camera tends to shake a little too much. There are some scenes that you will struggle to follow precisely what is going on. This movie has the tendency to throw in some super cliche moments. To avoid spoilers I won't say what parts but just think of generic action scenes and multiply the same cliche parts by about 10, scatter them throughout the movie and you have Godzilla: King of the Monsters.Lastly, the movie ends quick. It doesn't cut to black mid-sentence like the Sopranos but you definitely expect a 5-10 minute cool down scene which never appears. You do want to end on a high but there are a few unanswered questions that I don't think will be addressed in the next few installments, shame really.RATING: 6/10P.S - There is an after credits scene, it does raise even further theories/questions but generally worth sticking around for.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Never has a Godzilla movie ever had one. I was in purely for the visceral and visual CGI eye candy. I spent extra to watch the film in RealD 3D and the ragdoll tossing, vibrating D-Box seats for maximum effect. I almost never do that anymore but I loved the old Japanese movies. It isn't often a Godzilla movie comes along on the big screen offering to show more monster and less cheesy dialog. This film also has a great cast of actors so maybe I might be in for a surprise?Well, there definitely is more monster than previous *American* remakes. But there is plenty of chalk screeching on blackboard dialog from amazing actors like Kyle Chandler & Vera Farmiga. It was totally weird. They belt out very good acting performances in this film despite the horrendous dialog they were expected to deliver on camera. The dialog has tons of sarcastic bravado lines that seemed more appropriate for teenagers.But despite the monster battles, I was never awe struck by the visuals. It just didn't wow me at all. I was disappointed they didn't choose two lovely Asian girls surrounded by a tribe to sing and awaken Mothra like the original japanese movies. Instead we get the tired and overused secret science lab in a cave using electronic devices to awaken it. Personally, I really think they should have given us some entertainment here by having them sing to Mothra. That what was so cool about the original films.Anyway, I give it a 6-2/3 for 7 stars rounded up. It is what it is. but even knowing the script wouldn't be great, it still left me unsatisfied.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

"6","/10","Disappointing kaiju extravaganza","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4928501/?ref_=tt_urv","jamesrupert2014","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur58781741/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2019","Eco-terrorists connive to release the quiescent kaiju held by ""Monarch"" (some kind of paramilitary crypto-zoology organisation) in an attempt to restore balance to Earth before the careless current alpha species (us) destroys the planet. Not surprisingly, the former lords of the planet have their own agenda. The film, number 35 in the long-running and now international, franchise, is long, loud and over-wrought. The whole eco-terrorist subplot gets tedious fast, especially Vera Farmiga's self-righteous/bitter/villainous/heroic-mom shtick and her bonding/unbonding/rebonding with her precocious daughter. The plot relies heavily on a McGuffin - the ""ORCA"", a one-of-a-kind monster-controller gadget that seems virtually indestructible, adaptable to any available wiring, and seemingly operable by anyone. There are lots of stylised shoot-ups as eco-mercenary Alan Jonah (Charles Dance, famously impaled while on the toilet in 'Game of Thrones') and his generic gunmen attack Monarch bases, first to get the ORCA, then to release the beasts. After a while, it all starts to look the same. Sadly, the film spends too much time on the flimsy 'human component' of the story, at the expense of showing lots of monster mayhem and obliteration of famous landmarks - often the best part of this type film. Many of the monster scenes are too dense, too busy, too rainy/cloudy/smoky/dusty, and too full of rapid-fire cutting to really get a good look at what 200 megabucks can buy. Another problem is a fractured sense of time and distance: any character (human or otherwise) seems to be able to get anywhere in the world as quickly as the plot requires, resulting in too many last-minute Deus ex Machina rescues that dilute any sense of menace developing in the story. The acting is about what you'd expect in a Hollywood hyper-action film, but given the script, not much more is needed. The music is nondescript up to the moment when elements of Akira Ifukube's iconic themes are introduced. Fun for aficionados but likely lost on most viewers, the film references many elements from the long-running kaiju series for good and for bad. As in the original 1954 film, there is a heroic scientist named Serizawa and 'oxygen destroyer' über-weapon. Monarch's base is named ""Castle Bravo"", which was the name of the Bikini Atoll H-bomb test that contaminated the Japanese fishing boat Lucky Dragon 5, inspiring Toho Studios to make a film about a monster born in radioactive fire. The eco-babble about the 'Titans' being guardians of Earth was reminiscent of the various stand-alone Mothra story lines (as are the sparkles that accompany the giant moth) and there is a hint that the she-monster's tiny twin priestesses might show up. Monarch's giant plane is similar the various flying super-weapons fielded against the big guy in the Heisei-era films and one point Godzilla overloads on radiation, turns red, and threatens to explode, as he did in the Heisei-era capping 'Godzilla vs. Destroyerah' (1995). On the downside, there is an annoying kid who (long) outstays her welcome (a staple in the later Showa-era films) and like most of the preceding 34 films, there's a plot that, if you pause at any moment and think about it, doesn't really make any sense, even by the credulous standards of the genre. I liked the 2014 American reboot and was looking forward to a multiple monster epic (having enjoyed 1968's rubbery 'Destroy All Monsters' and 2004's delirious 'Final Wars') but this film was a disappointment. The insipid story, weak script, and bland acting fatally undercut both the impressive CGI and the homages to earlier films (iconic and otherwise). Too bad. Next stop: 'Godzilla vs King Kong', last seen in the ring together in 1964 (in the first of the silly, kid-friendly films that was also the top money maker in the Toho series). Hard to believe that a 2020 remake could be worse, but also hard to believe that two decades into the second millennium, a fight between giant ape first seen in 1931 and an overgrown lizard who debuted in 1954 could still fill theatres.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Godzilla: King of the Monsters. The talk I heard about this one before going into it was, the monsters fighting was cool, everything to do with the humans was stupid. Do I agree with this? Absolutely! Of course there has to be a human plot, right? The alternative would be talking Godzilla? Or narrated, turning almost into a Nature Channel documentary? I dunno. To sum it up quickly... Tywin Lannister is an eco terrorist that wants to wake up all the sleeping Titans to return the Earth back to its natural state, to do this he needs Norma Bates, and her sound machine that essentially wakes all the Titans up, blah blah. Along with Norma comes her daughter Eleven for some reason, who is way to involved in whats going on... And Tywin's main goal is to awaken King Ghidorah, ya know the three headed dragon, to wage battle across the globe with the other titans, and obviously Godzilla, whom the humans have recruited to their side? Yea... the plot, I dunno... But yes, the clashing of the titans is pretty sweet, made you feel like a kid watching Saturday morning monster movies... So in between the plot, and the massive amounts of product placement, and the dropping of Skull Island about a dozen times, we get it, next up Godzilla Vs. King Kong, there was some cool stuff in there... I just realized this is The Avengers of monster movies, with post credit scene and all... ugh...","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

These are: Popcorn movies, and Oscar movies.
Popcorn movies set out putting action, and cool imagery before the story, and their goal is to make you wow and awe at the big screen.
Oscar movies however, put their story first, and set to draw you into their story emotionally, making you laugh, hurt, smile, and cry.
It Is due to this, that I rate these movie categories separately, as they are in no way alike.Godzilla: King of the Monsters is in its nature, a popcorn movie. The team behind it most definitely set out without too much thought for the story. But you know what? That's okay; if you're going to Godzilla expecting a AAA story, then you're in the wrong cinema.From the get go, Godzilla wags its big budget at you with the use of big booms, big noise, and big monsters. Unlike its 2014 predecessor, Godzilla: King of the Monsters focuses on just that; the monsters. Throughout the entire movie, the audience was captivated by the amazing CGI put on display, showing off some of the coolest movie scenes I have ever witnessed.It is true that the script takes a backseat in this one, just like with most popcorn movies. The characters make questionable decisions, most of which make you raise your hands in confusion. But at the end of the day, Godzilla: King of the Monsters achieved the goal it set out to achieve, and made us all leave the cinema saying ""Wow"".Popcorn rating: 7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

I had a lot of hype and anticipation when it came to this film and I have to say that it didn't disappoint for the most part. By the end of the film, I walked out feeling pretty satisfied, but like any these kind of films there are going to be a few negative things to take notice of. Many of those who go to see these films don't expect to see stellar writing and storytelling, they come to be entertained and awed by the sheer spectacle. I feel like this film falls under the scenario of ""matter/style over substance"".On a technical note, the film succeeded greatly while its narrative/storytelling aspect fell short. The immense spectacle of Godzilla and the other Titans conquered the screen with each and every appearance. Awesome creature designs, well composed/framed action shots, booming sound design + music, and great use of color. Visual effects and grand spectacle elements made this film an immersive experience on a large scale.From the narrative/storytelling side of the film, I found it to be a little weak and basic. I don't mind simplistic stories in many films- in this case of the creature features or action films specifically but at least some attempt to add a little flare and substance to make it more developed. There is an underlying story in this film, but not a very strong one. Messages possibly revolving around environmentalism can be seen yet they are not very effective in bringing awareness to it. One positive note I will make about the story is that I appreciate them attempting to explore the background and history of Godzilla and the Titans. The characters felt not as vibrant or interesting with the exception of Ken Watanabe's character. Godzilla being the main man of the show came in big and strong for the spectacle, however, I would have liked for him to have liked for him to have more substance and humanity- making a monster feel relatable or something more. This film just didn't quite make that turn towards a potential achievement.Overall it was an entertaining film that had things for me to stand up and cheer about, while at the same time it had things I might be rubbing my eyes thinking, ""why?"". It wasn't a great film, but certainly entertaining to watch the spectacle. I would definitely recommend the film if you're looking for an energetic, action packed creature feature and to be entertained by such a classic character.

They're dumb, although entertaining, movies where monsters brawl mindlessly in a city. Usually there are prior military attempts to wipe out the creatures, but these giant monsters can only be killed by another giant monster which is represented by a big fight at the end. That sheer entertainment is what we strive for in the old Godzilla movies, however not very much in the new Godzilla movies. I was underwhelmed and disappointed with this film, and I believe most of that emotion was because I expected more from today than say Tokyo in the 60s. This movie did nothing to impress me unlike the 2014 one which had me in complete awe by the end of it.

The movie juggled unevenly between intense action scenes and character drama, at times causing unintentional laughs.For example, family and colleagues just finished talking, and 1 second later, explosions threw everybody off. The uneven pace and predictable dialogues didn't help either. Luckily, the likeable cast of seasoned actors helped keep the movie believable.CG wise, the monsters could have looked more lively or nimble, considering the movie budget was $200M. Godzilla's reappearance in this sequel didn't feel exciting. Instead, the introduction and fight scenes of Mothra felt more touching for me (anime, mecha and monster fan). The 3 headed Ghidorah looked quite menacing. I'd like to see it again in a future sequel.The dramatic / sad music scores are quite touching, but the action sequence scores are not memorable, comparing to 300 and Pacific Rim soundtracks.The nuclear and thermo attacks from Godzilla and Ghidorah were blinding at times - I had to close my eyes!

If that's what you want, then you get your wish. The fight scenes in this movie, of which there are plenty, are some of the most impressive action sequences in movie history. The monsters look absolutely incredible, and the scope of them and their fights is done perfectly. The final battle, between Godzilla and Ghidorah on the ground and Mothra and Rodan in the sky, is excellent, featuring all the large-scale destruction, this time in Boston. Hey, at least it's not New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco this time. The environments in this movie, from waterfall where Mothra grows, to the ice where Ghirorah was frozen, to the submerged Egyptian temple where Godzilla lives (it makes sense in context) all look great. The movie's soundtrack is also very good.The downside is that there's also the people in this movie. There's a pretty good cast - Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler, Millie Bobbie Brown, and Ken Watanabe are in it. The problem is the simple fact that these characters aren't interesting and get way too much screen time. They're bland, cliché, and make stupid decisions. The whole thing with that British ecoterrorist was stupid. They could've thought of a much better way for Ghidorah to come out of the ice. The human aspect of the movie also takes up way too much time, and the whole film could benefit from being 20 minutes shorter. Plus, there's at least 20 minutes in this movie that could easily be cut out.At the end of the day, King of the Monsters is a spectacle. You don't watch a Godzilla movie for a story about a family of human scientists and all that. You watch a Godzilla movie to see him destroy stuff, and in this case, beat up other monsters. And it does deliver on that, just with a bit too much extra baggage.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

The conflict is between Monarch a crypto-zoological agency that fights monsters and the revived dormant monsters. I know that seems contradictory but that is the scenario. Godzilla is apparently on the human's side, but his nemeses King Ghidorah, aka the three-headed monster is not. In plain English, they are fighting over supremacy.Sprinkled in there are Dr. Emma Russell, Dr. Mark Russell and their daughter Madison. The Russell's are still grieving the loss of their son at the hands of Godzilla. This grieving results in Dr. Emma Russell, making some bad choices. Vera Farmiga portrays Dr. Emma Russell. She's usually formidable, but in this movie, she's just flat. I could not muster any empathy for her character. Millie Bobby Brown is Madison Russell and let's say this part was not an evolution from her Stranger Things character eleven. Kyle Chandler is the most likable out of the Russell bunch as Dr. Mark Russell, but even he couldn't salvage this.You may be asking how that plays into the monster storyline? It doesn't.That's the problem with Godzilla; it's preposterous even by action movie standards. We don't care about this family and its issues. The beginning of this movie is slow and drags. I found myself almost falling asleep, which seems hard amongst all the noise. The plot is nonexistent. They attempt at various stages to pull us in with the scientific mambo jumbo, but it just doesn't work.At one point we are inundated with so many monsters that it's just overkill. Also, the special effects weren't the greatest. Some of the CGI is quite comical.One aspect of this movie I did enjoy is the diversity in its cast. There's been much discussion on how best to apply diversity in a film. Godzilla does. O'Shea Jackson Jr, Ken Watanabe, Zhang Ziyi, Aisha Hands, Anthony Ramos, and Elizabeth Ludlow all have roles with purpose.I didn't expect Godzilla to be Jurassic Park; however, the biggest sin is that it's boring. An unutilized stellar cast, overkill special effects and to many monsters makes for quite a snooze. If they do decide to make another movie in this series, I urge them to keep it simple. In the end, less is more.Scale: This movie gets a five. An action movie that was dull.Diversity: This movie gets an 8 for having a diverse cast from starring roles to supportive roles.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

I thought Kong: Skull Island had the same problem, fantastic visuals but dismal writing.Speaking of the fantastic visuals, this film is very respectful of the old Toho movies and I was quite moved by the beautiful makeovers that Rodan and Mothra have been given. The soundtrack also seemed intentionally reminiscent of past monster glories, adding to the enjoyable nostalgia. Godzilla and King Ghidorah did not excite me as much as I had hoped but both definitely had their moments.I love Godzilla and Mothra movies, I'm glad they are still being made and I would like to see more. Increasing the monster screen time and taking a few story line risks would be a good start for any future efforts, but as I said, keep them coming.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an epic Godzilla movie. It does contain GREAT human characters. (I don't get the critics calling them bland) but it shows that it's purpose was to give the audience some awesome kaiju fights. Also, the nods to previous films are pretty awesome, I won't spoil anything but they might give people that don't know anything about previous films a bit of a ""wait what?"" moment. And some nods require some explanation but it doesn't take away from the film.If you REALLY want to understand all the nods read up on some of the popular movies from the franchise and watch the previous Monsterverse entries.Anyways, please PLEASE do not miss out on this movie. Hollywood needs to realise the potential market of giant monsters. Don't make the excuse of ""B-b-but remakes b-b-baaad!!!"" cause that's a lie. This movie might not be the most original thing ever. But it provides a story that hasn't been seen in a Godzilla film or any film for that matter.","18 out of 32 found this helpful."

If you're expecting anything else, then why the hell would you even bother?Just set your expectations appropriately with that in mind, and you'll enjoy it. Sure, the film in terms of writing isn't flawless, far from it. There were times that I was just getting bored by the human characters, and their dialogue had, like, SO much cheese. Like, even compared to the 2014 Godzilla. That being said, it had some crazy-cool and beautiful visuals and shots that made up for it.So that's why I'm giving it 2 separate ratings: as a film on its own, like maybe a 6.0/10. But as someone who knew exactly what I was expecting to get, as in, a Godzilla film, like a 9.0/10. I think Toho would be proud of what Hollywood pulled off with their franchise with this entry.

Minus one was amazing with a heartfelt human story, but I'm not gonna complain if a movie is based around titans bashing it out.However there were a few things that could've been done better, we never got to see Dr Emily before properly but her shift in character and motivation was a bit sudden. So i was left just as shocked as the husband and monarch that she did it.Oh my god, one of my favorite scenes that stuck with me from the first time I watched this, was when Rodan flew over the city and left destruction in his wake. It's still just as cool now. I feel like a kid, how excited I get. The fire demon has so many cool scenes. It's also amazing to see so many titans here, they don't all get ample screen time though.

From my seat, it was too much exposure on these superb actors (even thought they haven't much to chew on - they perfectly know monters are the real stars here), as was mentionned several times here, but also the battles, the bacon of this breakfast, could have been handled better: As a rule they lacked a wider angle, the camera work being close, and brief.Much of the other monsters appear solely as eye candy, probably to let more place to human dramas few people care for.

However there is a huge downside. The focus has been set on the human drama way too much, which is kinda annoying and also a little bit irrelevant.
There's another negative point. I haven't seen too many movies with Zhang Ziyi, but her English is completely horrible and I needed subtitles only for her parts. Also I'm not sure if she's a bad actress or her bad acting is due to her lack of the language. I feel sorry for the other actors, because of this, it ruins a lot of the mood in the movie.

But with this one, they couldn't be more off. They all complain about the characters and how they're not ""compelling"" or ""3-Dimensional"", which begs the question: What were they expecting? What monster movie or Godzilla movie has compelling characters? Godzilla is the main character, not the humans. They only serve to propel the plot forward and to get to the monster action. Critics also talk about the ridiculous story. Like, what? It's a monster movie, it's entertainment.So, the movie. The movie is very fast-paced and simple to understand. To the critics who said it was confusing, I'm not sure if we saw the same movie or not. I really enjoyed Michael Dougherty's direction, he retained some of the elements of Gareth Edwards with shooting the monsters low and from human angles but wasn't afraid to show the monsters up close. There are also ton of really nice shots. Some of them could actually be paintings, that's how beautiful they are. The music was godly and Bear McCreary did a phenomenal job with the music, capturing the scope of Godzilla, something the 2014 one did not do.So the human characters are okay. You understand what they want and what they are doing, despite the dialogue being iffy and having lots of exposition. It also has a lot of jokes like a marvel movie and some of them are okay. Others not so much, but humor is subjective. Kyle Chandler and Ken Watanabe are easily the highlights of the human characters. Bradley Whitford is a little hokey but that's the spirit of the movie. The human characters are a lot better than the ones in the 2014 Godzilla. Except maybe Bryan Cranston. While the characters may not be the best written, they are at least animated and entertaining to watch, which makes this movie, which 132 minutes long, feel like a short thrill ride. The movie really did not feel that long. The movie also isn't some dark and depressing nightmare like the 2014 one.Finally, the monsters. They were obviously the highlight of the film and the actions scenes were just awesome. Pure spectacle. Easily the best monster fights ever put to film. The CGI is absolutely stunning too. You can actually see the monsters fight, unlike the 2014 one.I'm a lifelong Godzilla fan, so for me, I absolutely enjoyed this film and this was the film I always wanted as a kid. You can also tell that Michael Dougherty is also a big fan and you can really feel the passion he has. I think that if someone was expecting something more cerebral, or if someone is trying to find some profound theme like the meaning of life, then they're going to be disappointed. If you just want to kick back and have fun at the theater, then you're going to enjoy this movie. Also, if you were disappointed by the 2014 one, I would say that this one mostly fixes the mistakes. I feel like the critics are pretending to be a lot smarter than they really are by saying that ""the characters aren't compelling"" and that the movie ""favors spectacle over story"". Literally every Godzilla movie does it and this one is no exception.So, to sum things up: The movie is a lot of fun, very fast-paced and action packed. If you're a Godzilla fan or even a casual movie goer, I think you'll enjoy this movie. Easily the most fun I had at the movies in years.","16 out of 28 found this helpful."

No I go to see the Kaiju. This film insisted on giving me way too much of the former and not enough of the latter. The worse offender is the climax is built around the family drama while the ultimate fight literally plays out in the background. This is frustrating as no one cares about the humans in films like this. The human story does not even make all that much sense. (For one thing why wasn't any base warned?). The character are pretty bland. Worse poor Sally Hawkins is dragged into this mess and given one of the worst woman characters in memory. The character might as well as been named emotional helpmate for all she does in the film.With that being said the Kaiju action is good. I really, really like Mothra's redesign. The fights were brutal and somewhat unpredictable. Ghidorah was finally given a comedy bit that should have happened decades ago. Godzilla was monstrous again. There is a great deal of Kaiju fun in this film.Alas the silly humans were the focal point.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

Instead of giving fans what the title suggested, an all-out war between monsters, we got a few monsters and barely visible fights. If I have to imagine most of it, I don't wanna watch it.Should have just let them fight it out, spare us the drama, ""hidden"" messages and sacrifices.

Gosh, I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.Mostly, I feel bad for some of the well-respected actors who will forever be associated with this mess. Most of the characters written as complete morons, doing one illogical thing after another, seemingly trying, repeatedly, to get their character killed off (probably to escape from further involvement in the movie). Repeated, ginormous explosions (often resembling mini-nuclear-force detonations), generating massive rings of flying debris, often relatively close to the main cast of characters, and they simply cover the face, and magically, walk away unharmed.The ""bad guy"", the one person responsible for unleashing hell on the entire planet, resulting in the death of who knows how many hundreds of millions of people (or billions?), suddenly having an ""ah-oh, my bad"" (change of heart) moment, like that will somehow make up for their involvement in a mass, planetary genocide.Put simply, I couldn't really get into the monster (titan) stories, because the rest of the film was so poorly written/constructed, and hence, continuously distracting. Maybe the monster interactions were supposed to make sense (heck, maybe they did make sense to some folks who are super fans?), but I was too (repeating myself) distracted by everything else that was so incredibly wrong in the film, to ever really get into the titan's stories.Unless you just want to watch it for the monster-related VFX, I would definitely recommend not wasting your time on it. (I think it might have actually been more enjoyable, if they just had the monsters/titans going at each other, continuously, for the entire movie, while buildings, towns, and no-name ""extras"", got trampled and obliterated. Maybe/hopefully, some super-fan will re-edit it, and release a bootleg version, with just the monster fights. That might be worthy of your viewing time.)","4 out of 8 found this helpful."

The second Godzilla movie had an amazing trailer with the Clair de Lune orchestral song. It still is one of the best trailers to come out in a long time. The trailer was so good that I decided to watch this movie in the theatre on day one in IMAX. However, I came out of it with a mixed thought towards it. The premise is ""Members of the crypto-zoological agency Monarch face off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah. When these ancient super-species-thought to be mere myths rise again, they all vie for supremacy, leaving humanity's very existence hanging in the balance"". So has my feelings towards the movie changed or do I still have the same mixed thoughts?The biggest praise I have is that they used Godzilla monsters from Japanese movies. The MUTOs from Godzilla (2014) were fine but not memorable. Here the monsters are all different and unique. Mothra looks beautiful, Rodan looks scary and Ghidorah looks grand. They all have great monster designs that stick in your mind with Ghidorah looking like he could take on the legendary Godzilla. The CGI, visual effects and sound effects are all phenomenal too. Another big problem in Godzilla (2014) was the lack of Godzilla and that has been addressed. Godzilla appears way more and does a lot more fighting this time.On that note, the action scenes are still exhilarating to watch. It is also better choreographed than the previous Monsterverse movies which mean more exciting titan action. Visually the movie is also gorgeous to look at thanks to the cinematography by ""Lawrence Sher"". Some stunning wide shots illustrate the massive nature of these Titans. The director also uses brighter colours, plus a lot of colour blue, compared to Godzilla (2014) which makes a lot of the scenes more visible including the action scenes. I also really loved the score by ""Bear McCreary"" who incorporates the classic themes in Japanese Godzilla into the movie. It elevates a lot of the scenes and makes them feel grander.Unfortunately, the story is incredibly stupid and ridiculous. Previous Monsterverse movies had simple plots that just revolve around getting from point A to B with the monster story happening concurrently with the humans. However, here the humans play a central part in what is happening with the monsters causing the focus to be on the humans rather than the titular Godzilla. The main plot shoved in our face is the human family, the ORCA (a magical plot device that affects the Titans), and some eco-terrorist. The human family soap drama is genuinely dumb and the ORCA is constantly used to do whatever BS the plot requires. There are also some eco-terrorist and their plan is evil yet the movie somehow wants to justify their plan when it's dumb. These stories hog a lot of screen-time and it especially affects the pacing in the second act by spending too long on it that I was getting bored.It's made worse by the fact that the characters are no longer just uninteresting but downright hateable. Dr Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) is the main lead who lost his son because of these Titans and hates them including Godzilla. He gets an arc where he likes them more now because the plot needed him to be I guess? Dr Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is Mark's ex-wife who believes letting all the Titans wake up is going to be great for the world. Her plan is stupid and because of her a bunch of people died yet the movie still want the audience to feel for her. Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown) is Mark and Emma's daughter who sides with her mum but then changes her mind. None of these 3 main characters sounds remotely interesting but you're going to spend the most time with all these 3. There are also some other one-dimensional supporting characters including some from the original Godzilla (2014) but they are all incredibly bland as well.On that note, the tone of this movie is quite comedic and more far-fetched compared to Godzilla (2014). Sadly none of the quips is very funny and it can even clash with the moments which are meant to be serious. For example, there is a scene where the human characters found something astonishing so a natural reaction is ""oh my god"" but then another character adds ""Zilla.."" to the end of it and I cringed from the stupidity of that line. There are a couple of other moments that feel like that and it just doesn't work. Some death scenes occur which the movie attempts to make sad but it doesn't work as the human characters are forgettable and it then gets overshadowed by jokes or dumb dialogue.Overall, Godzilla King of the monsters is very silly and tries to incorporate a serious human story in it but fails miserably. Nevertheless, the visual effects and the monster battles are still great which in the end might be all that people want. After watching this though, I want a movie with better human characters though because the Monsterverse so far still can't provide it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Most of them go like this: A monster shows up. Military and scientist people talk. A monster shows up. Military and scientist people talk. A monster shows up and maybe fights another monster. Repeat. Godzilla: King of the Monsters was pretty much a modern big-budget version of a classic Godzilla movie. Godzilla movies don't appeal to everyone so this movie isn't for everyone, but as a Godzilla fan I got my fix. It was so cool to see all the things I saw these monsters do in the old movies with modern effects. There were a ton of really cool references to the older movies, references to King Kong (which I'm so happy is just a part of the Godzilla universe now) and new monsters, not just the big four that were advertised! The story also had some pretty interesting themes and ideas having to do with environmental disasters, which is a fitting update for these movies. The age of the atomic bomb is over. What do these monsters represent today? The monsters were also surprisingly expressive, you could tell what they were thinking and feeling and they showed a lot of personality. There were some issues I had with the movie, it cuts away during the monster fights a bit too much, sometimes it focuses on the human characters for a little too long (the old movies rarely exceeded 100 minutes. This movie is over 2 hours.) and some of the fights were hard to see, but overall I think this is a solid Kaiju flick! If you aren't a fan of Godzilla, I don't recommend this movie. It technically isn't a great movie. However, if you are a fan of Godzilla and love all the classics, I think you'll get a kick out of it!

One for your subjective opinion of the film and one for how good you think it is objectively. Tons of people are going to give this a 10/10 because the good parts for them are so good that they'll ignore the bad parts, and I sympathize with them, because I buy tickets for movies I think I'll enjoy, not for movies I think I'll only appreciate. I mean, I can appreciate a movie like Ingmar Bergman's Winter Light, but I wouldn't pay to see it in theaters. But I think that devalues the 10/10 rating. This isn't 2001: A Space Odyssey or Stalker or Blade Runner here. And even on its own terms, Godzilla: King of the Monsters could've been better than it is.I think I should also mention that I think I know more about Godzilla than the average moviegoer, having watched maybe a quarter of the 30 or so films back when I was a kid (most were from the Millenium era and a few were from the Showa era), but I'm really not much of a fan. Anyway -Subjectively speaking, I enjoyed this a lot. The monster fights are some of the most exciting things I've ever seen in a movie (and I highly recommend seeing this in a theater if you can). I will say, though, that the law of diminishing returns applies here to a degree. But, whatever, you've got a giant amalgamation of a T. Rex, an Iguanodon, a Stegosaurus, and an alligator fighting a giant three-headed dragon that can shoot lightning (yes, I know they're gravity beams but you say gravity beams to a layman and they might not know what to imagine) out of its mouths. You won't get too tired of it, if that's what you're into. The music's good too. There's a new rendition of the original Godzilla theme here and it's used at just the right parts. (If you know more about Godzilla and other kaiju than me, you'll also probably recognize Mothra's theme.) Subjective rating: 10/10Objectively speaking, this isn't a very good film. The plot is just there to (barely) hold the monster fights together (I know the monster fights are the main draw, but a focus on monster fights and discipline in the story department shouldn't have to be mutually exclusive). The characters are thin. Much of the dialogue is just exposition and the jokes tend to be awful. Objective rating: 3/10 (and I'm being a little generous).So, I'm averaging my two scores and rounding up to the nearest whole number, so Godzilla: King of the Monsters gets a 7/10 from me. I can enjoy the movie for what it is. With all the huge blockbusters coming out each year, I sometimes forget how lucky we are to be living in a time when movies have more money put into them and special effects are better than ever before.And I hope that the day won't come when every movie with a budget of $150 million or more is a superhero movie. I hope Hollywood will remember to give us different flavors of stupid. Superhero movies are the kind of stupid I hate, but these kaiju movies are the kind of stupid I love.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

The monsters look great, cgi is gritty and mean. The actors are great aswell, and nicely cast in my opinion.
I like monstermovies, b-movies aswell for that matter. Trashy can be great. I'm not asking for an amazing story when watching those movies, I get easily entertained. I don't need common sense either, that's not what movies like godzilla are made for. But the least I and in my opinion, every one should be asking for, is actual sense.
The movie looks great, but nothing the ""story"" offers makes sense. It's all over the place without meaning. Behaviour of every person is nonsense and swaps 180° when necessary to get it to progress the movie. No meaning or reason behind any of the dialogues and storyline.
It looks great, but that's it. Can aswell watch it for the visuals with sound off and listen to your favorite music over it.
I liked the first one from 2014 better. It had it's unique style. This one feels like a random GI Joe movie with monsters.","4 out of 8 found this helpful."

This movie has barely anything to do with Godzilla and as a matter of fact most of the time they're fighting in the background while the story follows a boring family around and their drama. The worst part is none of them can act and that girl from Stranger things needs to stick to stranger things.I hate when Hollywood white washes Japanese films. The original Japanese shows always revolved around the monsters and this movie just revolves around the boring actors. I don't get why they can't just give you what you came to see a giant monster movie about giant monsters fighting. This thing is 90% family drama and 10% Monsters.They just took the plot from Godzilla vs. Destroyah and incorporated it into this movie in the worst way. Also why is Mothra so weak when Mothra is one of the hardest monsters to beat even for Godzilla and why is Mothra so tiny when it's bigger than Godzilla? Better yet why is Mothra one of the most recognized monsters in the series just a small role that serves no purpose? This moving is stupid, boring, and excruciatingly long. The monster effects and scenes were actually the best part and only good parts yet the monsters are treated like background extra's like this movie isn't titled Godzilla.A better title for this movie would be Boring White Family featuring cameos by Godzilla,Mothra, Rodan and Ghidorah.","4 out of 8 found this helpful."

But then it gradually descends into absolute nonsense in terms of plot and vapid propaganda very subtly aimed at Chinese audiences to inflate their ego (because China is still a lucrative market for Hollywood).Ok let me first go over my impressions on the movie as a whole before I delve deeper into this curious instance of Godzilla changing his identity from Japanese to Chinese. The basic premise involving the rift between the monsters themselves is decent. The subplot about the estranged lead husband and wife characters , who incidentally were the only somewhat interesting characters, could have easily been used to mirror the divide among the monsters, these Titans, in the human world. But this potential is hampered by stupid, inconsistent character decisions that really make you completely detached from every single character. There were also so many moments of unintentional hilarity that sometimes even challenge the more comedic light heartened older Godzilla films in terms of stupidity and goofiness. Another major flaw is that they give ZERO character development to any of the monsters. This is especially bothersome because in the third act, when these Titans have the major showdown, the film wants you to empathise with some of the monsters, particularly Mothra, but we literally don't have ANY scene of Mothra beforehand showing some evolution or character progression save for his genesis. Finally, that child actor really started giving a bad performance towards the third act, although by that time, the plot had immersed into maximum cringe. Overall, after coming out of the theater , I had to take two cups of tea to get rid of a storming headache attained from all the pointless absurdity that had transpired onscreen.Now, let's talk about the China pandering, something way more interesting than the plot. As was the case with the King Kong reboot, one of the good scientists is a Chinese lady, Chen. However, unlike Kong:Skull Island, this movie gives the Chinese character a much broader role. In the first half of the movie, Chen is somewhat relegated to the background while the Japanese scientist, played by Ken Watanabe, serves more as the symbolic link to Godzilla's cultural ties to Japan . As in the 2014 film, he is the main human character conduit to convey Godzilla's personality to a Western audience in the first half. But then suddenly out of nowhere, Chen takes over and becomes the mouthpiece of Godzilla in the second half. She is the one who provides the exposition on Godzilla's current state of mind. She is the one who starts taking a big role in guiding the other characters as to how to deal with every situation. In a particularly interesting scene, she is whispering to the protagonist husband in front of an AMERCIAN army general while the latter is giving a briefing on the crisis. The general expresses his irritation at this upon which she stubbornly tells him how the AMERICAN army is doing it all wrong and how she is there to give them the right guidance . There are several other instances where the filmmakers try to desperately orient the Godzilla/Kaiju mythos to a more Chinese cultural foundation. Personally, I don't care much about this fad but somewhere deep in my conscience, it struck a bad chord with my inherent appreciation and fondness for Godzilla as a JAPANESE mascot. But sadly, that childhood construct seems to have been now obliterated by Hollywood.Just don't watch this film.","6 out of 14 found this helpful."

But I will mention these negative things below.This movie felt to me like having sat in a really loud and noisy roaring airplane for 2 hours. - It's a bit exciting, but wow it makes you tired in the long run, when can it just end?.
I advise you not to watch it after a heavy day where you mind might need to rest.Many big movies with big clashes gives you time to relax a little in between, but in this, if the monsters aren't roaring, then then the music is, or running, screaming, bombs.. etc.There is so many monsters and people you barely get to care anything about any of them.
The close calls are endless, and become borring pretty fast.
And again many of the scenes are very dark, which was a critique in the last movie too.The Godzilla movies have never been about being super realistic, how could it be, it's about giant monster shooting beams at eachother, but I think they could had made it feel a more clever at times.

I may not sleep ever again after seeing that!Generally this film works just fine. There are some things that aren't brilliant, but there is always going to be with a film of this type. Don't think too hard about it and you should enjoy it though. I did.To some degree though, it is a shame that technology has moved on so much in the last century. As a result the films have had to move forward too. This means that items such as rocket launchers, bazookas and nuclear missiles are more commonplace in our current age and easier to hand to fight the beasties. Not to mention the tracking equipment.But back in the 1940's and 1950's the challenge was how to do it, not which weapon to try first and why not have the instruction sent from anywhere around the world because that's possible now with the internet.As such, what was essentially a simple battle of the Titans story, back in the day, has become something that requires clever plot twists and turns and different factions of people trying to utilise the ""Monsters"" for their own purposes and generally causing the problems in the first place. Which in fact just goes to show who the real monsters are!I personally loved the original Japanese Godzilla films that were shown late on a Friday night. They were a pleasure for their unpolished, rubber suited simplicity and hold a nostalgic place in my heart.I say spend more money on the writers and less on trying to beat everyone else with massive explosions and the best CGI.In this film poor old Godzilla, disturbed from his peace yet again, is needed to defend the world from all of the other Titanic creatures that have been found around the world since Monarch (The group represented by John Goodman's, Randa in 'Kong: Skull Island' (2017)) was formed on the government's behalf to identify and contain the various life forms and of course potentially weaponise them.So who is going to make things difficult and bugger up the world? I'm not going to tell you, because I don't do spoilers if I can help it, but I'm sure you can guess that they're humans.Let's just say that everyone seems to be having the same idea as Thanos.What I liked about this one over the last 'Godzilla' (2014) is that you get to see far more of the actual characters that you tune in for. Mr Zilla might as well have not been in that one, but at least Aaron Taylor-Johnson was as hot as ever, but I digress.King Ghidorah and Rodan are a bit basic though. There doesn't seem to have been much of an update for them. They look like creatures from films 20 years older than this one and maybe not even that good, but Godzilla himself looks great as if he's had some great rest and relaxation and like maybe he's been working out by the pool or something. He's definitely beefed up a bit.Other things that annoy me are that they insist on shooting at the big brutes. Do they really think that it's going to work? And surely if they've been studying them as they are supposed to have been, they should have a new type of weapon in circulation that would be more effective?And sacrifices are made that are totally unnecessary as well. It's not a sacrifice if it didn't have to happen.It's also quite predictable and not as epic as it should be. I think that producers should be nailing films like this by now. The talent is all out there to be utilised, but sometimes it just feels like they're in a rush to get things out there so that you don't forget them.With regards to the actors, Kyle Chandler isn't quite the right guy as the action hero and maybe that makes him perfect for the role, because who could play a Godzilla specialist and estranged dad put in this crazy position anyway? But for me he didn't have enough of a presence and a bigger star should have been given the role and more screen time perhaps.I also think that Charles Dance could have been used more. The man is hugely talented and it felt as if his part had been largely edited out of the finished film.But actually overall, I wouldn't omit this one from the series when I watch them all again. It certainly does its part well enough.722.92/1000.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

"7","/10","It's ""good enough"" - monsters fighting each other","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4914605/?ref_=tt_urv","bankofmarquis","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10919398/?ref_=tt_urv","5 June 2019","I grew up in the 1960's watching old monster movies on Saturday afternoons on an old black and white TV in the home I grew up in. A staple of these Saturday afternoon movies was the Godzilla monster movies from Japan, featuring such great monsters as Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan and Ghidorah. So, imagine my excitement when I realized that they all would be in the same film.And...that film...GODZILLA - KING OF THE MONSTERS...delivers the goods just fine. Sometimes you go to the movie theater looking for laughs, sometimes you are looking to cry, sometimes you are looking to have your mind stimulated with interesting thoughts and ideas and sometimes you just want to watch giant monsters battling it out over the remnants of Fenway Park in Boston.The 3rd in the ""Monarch Series"" of films from Warner Brothers (following the surprisingly good 2014 GODZILLA film and the fun KONG: SKULL ISLAND movie of 2017), GODZILLA - KING OF THE MONSTERS follows Monarch as they find (and in some instances, re-awaken) giant monsters - TITANS as they are called - the Titans attempt to take over the planet from the humans (there's a ""save the planet"" message that is being used as the excuse)...but here comes good ol' Godzilla to save the day.Besides the monsters, there are quite a few humans along for the ride...Kyle Chandler and Vera Famiga as a dysfunctional couple (who also happen to be experts in Monsters) who are trying to keep in check their daughter, Millie Bobbie Brown (STRANGER THINGS). Ken Watanbe, Sally Hawkins and Jason Strahairn reprise their roles as members of MONARCH from the 2014 GODZILLA film, 2 veritable ""that person"" actors, Thomas Middleditch & Aisha Hinds as other members of Monarch along with Ziya Zhang and O'Shea Jackson, Jr. - all of these actors are ""serviceable"" to the plot and machinations, reacting appropriately to the green screen carnage and monsters that they are pretending to react to. Only Bradley Whitford (as a Monarch Scientist) rises above things with a goofy, ""almost too over the top"" performance that captures the spirit of the proceedings. Add into this good ol' Tywin Lannister himself (Charles Dance) as a shadowy, non-feeling bad guy that seems to have an inexhaustible supply of men and material - kind of like Tywinn Lannister - and the ""human side"" of this movie is fun...enough.But, make no mistake about it, this film - and the reason I came to see it - is to watch giant monsters fighting each other and destroying everything in their wake and this film delivers the goods. Director Micheal Dougherty ( KRAMPUS) does a ""serviceable"" job keeping the action moving and coherent while avoiding (for the most part) the headache-inducing ""quick-cut"" editing sequence. There's nothing much new or innovative in his approach to showing us monsters fighting and creating massive destruction, but he doesn't take away from the spectacle of the action on the screen so that's a good thing..There are 2 more Godzilla films currently ""on the books"" to be produced - including next year's KONG vs. GODZILLA - which will keep me coming back to the IMAX in the multiplex for years to come...and that's just fine with me.Letter Grade: a solid B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

Godzilla fans probably dreamed of these designs, of the tension and the roaring calls of the monsters. But the rest, I have to admit, was poor work.
The storyline was very predictable, and the fights between the monsters were very interesting to watch, but I have to admit, that in my opinion, the fights could've been better. Spitting at each other with laser beams, something that every monster can appreciate having the power to do, but I hoped that they could've done much more than that. The characters are not well known enough for us to deeply appreciate them in our hearts, they're easily forgettable, and so there is much more space for improvement, but it is a well made piece of work, and true Godzilla fans, I assume, will enjoy this film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

The trailer showed off far too much action for my liking but ultimately I enjoyed this as the big action film it was.One constant problem folk had with the previous film was the lack of Godzilla. Personally I found that approach the best way to go. Here it's the complete opposite. Once the pesky plot is out of the way it's mainly monster action and scientific plot. Much to my surprise I actually enjoyed the human aspect of the story for the most part.There is an interesting eco terrorist aspect of the plot which is spelt out during the opening 45 mins. As the viewer, the science is explained as you go so just go with it. Charles Dance has limited screen time but a meanacing presence and wasted in this film. Ken Watanabe has much more to work with this time around and has a nice story arc in amongst the destruction despite the joke about a fortune cookie. Kyle Chandler handles the role of the exasperated eco warrior father whilst Vera Farmiga seems to be all over the place. Save the world, destroy the world.....make up your mind. Millie Bobby Brown is the driving force and the star of the non Kaiju cast.One such problem is the narrative in which Godzilla is seen as a protector. He is almost viewed as a domesticated pet, here to save humanity. No, he want's to save his home ie the planet and we just happen to be on the same side, or in the way. Apparently a number of Kaiju are awoken in the film but only 4 get any screen time. Yes, there are a couple of moments which refer to a large gorilla but that is for another movie. Ghidorah, Godzilla, Mothra and Rodan are the only Kaiju with any screen time. Alas Mothra doesn't get the time she deserves. The destruction is spectatular yet the action scenes featuring the Kaiju are slightly clunky especially towards the end. And if anything they feel rushed in places which takes away from the spectacle.Don't expect anything mind blowing and you'll be grand. Big action fun with a sprinkling of science and plenty of plot holes but still enjoyable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

This sequel just felt like a Michael Bay movie, all shiny battles and explosions with a flat and effortless storyline. At least try to have some semblance of realism.

Absolutely unbelievable, nobody read it before they gave them money for it. It is almost like if it did not have any script at all and they wrote it during lunch break on day one of shooting of this ""movie"". Anything that happens on the screen in between monsters fighting each other yet again is pointless fluff with one bad line after another and you can see on actors the know they are there only because they are cheaper than extra hour of CGI.I imagine the process of making of the script resembled this:
The director was like ""Oi Steve, we will have Godzilla fighting Gidorah in the ocean, write something to explain how they got there from Antarctica."" and whoever wrote this was like ""ok Mike but which ocean is it, Atlantic?"" and Michael Dougherty (the director) was like ""did you said Atlantis? Great idea Steve write that in too"" and the writer of this garbage was like ""my name is not Steve :(""2 stars = watch it only if you are having a ""lets watch bad movies"" night with your friends.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

Instead, I sat there shaking my head in disbelief wondering how professionals in the industry could even think this to be remotely interesting. Apart from being too far-fetched and too overblown on every level, the script, the dialogue, the acting, everything was just dreadful. Even Vera Farmiga - whom I generally enjoy in a film - wasn't believable here - maybe because she had to portray a weak character who never knew which side to choose and seemingly couldn't make decisions of her own free will. Kyle Chandler was by far the best, but maybe he's too good an actor for a lousy film like this.There were also way too much CGI for the film to be taken seriously. Speaking of CGI, the visual effects weren't even good. Much of the film looked like an animated film, or even a cartoon coming to life. The film didn't even really revolve around Godzilla. He was absent for most of the film, and only on screen when he was really needed. Oh, and now this monster is suddenly friendly towards humans and helping them???!!! WTF!!!!

""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" is an action thriller centering around the Japanese monster of the same name. The film is a sequel to the 2014 film ""Godzilla,"" which was a reboot on the story which dates back to Ishiro Honda's 1954 ""Godzilla."" The film follows Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) as he joins up with the military contractor organization dubbed Monarch to rescue his wife, Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and daughter, Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown), from eco-terrorist Alan Jonah (Charles Dance), while the larger-than-life monsters battle for supremacy. The 132 minute movie brings back many of the familiar creatures seen in previous movies, including Mothra, King Ghidorah, and of course Godzilla himself.For Parents:
""Godzilla: King of Monsters"" is rated PG-13 for some language, violence, and destruction. That beings said, the expletives occasionally seem gratuitous, but the destruction is all part of massive monster destruction, and all of human fighting does not contain blood, guts, or gore.Critique:
I was never a huge Godzilla fan growing up. I enjoyed the 1998 reboot of the film, proceeded to watch a few of 1950's/60's black-and-white adaptations, and saw the 2014 film in theaters. For the most part, these movies lack a significant plot other than ""the monster is going to kill us,"" and this film is no different. Throughout the movie, you question who the actually villain is, and therefore who the protagonist is. Are the eco-terrorist threatening the fabric of society itself, or are they really benevolent in their intentions? Is the military representing everyone's best interest, or are they just war mongers looking for a fight? Is Mark Russell truly opposing the group Monarch, or are they two peas in a pod? The movie blurs the lines on the issue- and not in a good way. Likewise, writer director Michael Dougherty seemingly forgot to do his job of creating new content- the film is exclusive over-used movie tropes, including but not limited to the alcoholic father looking for redemption; the beyond impossibly smart child who is likewise the moral compass; the generic and recycled terrorist who is very good at knowing what he is doing, but not exactly why he is doing it; the corporate lackey who doesn't know left from right, only there for comedic relief; the scientist who apparently knows everything, even when there is no reasonable assumption that he could have known it; and an army general who doesn't understand the consequences to his actions, and send in the biggest guns first before they know what they're shooting at. The dialogue itself lacks passion and emotion- it is a blend of one-liners that didn't make the final cut from a 1980's Schwarzenegger movie, overused back-and-fourths that you have seen a hundred times before, and empty conversations that lack both substance and direction. For the most part, the actors deliver a mediocre performance (which most likely is the best they could do with the material they were given), with the exception of Charles Dance as he pulls of his best Tywin Lannister impression, and Sally Hawkins who was both underappreciated and underused. The camerawork was decent, and in particular there was one long-cut scene that circles Kyle Chandler with some of the monsters fighting in the background, which was really enjoyable, however there were several cringe-worthy VFX enabled camera effects that reminded you that you're watching an over budgeted screenplay rather than being a part of an immersive story. The movie has an insulting amount of plot holes, to the point of where I considered walking out of the theater from the sheer volume of uninspired and lazy writing. The film often reminded me of a teenager who forgot they had an essay to turn in, and so they copied a couple of Wikipedia pages without reading them and published it as their own work.Devil's Advocate:
""Godzilla: King of Monsters"" has the coolest and most visually impressive adaptation of all the monsters you remember from your childhood. The movie is jam-packed with references to other films and stories, like the base on Skull Island, presumably where the announced 2020 ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" takes place. Finally, the tempo of the movie makes sure that there is just enough evenly spaced action so that you don't fall asleep during the intermissions.Bottom Line:
""Godzilla: King of Monsters"" is a boring and occasionally offensively bad interpretation of a story that has been done and redone endlessly for over a half century. Its only entertainment value is a mindless nostalgia high, and cool visual effects. Overall, the movie is not worth the price of entry, and if the movie was on cable TV (for free) I would probably still elect to take a nap instead of watch.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

And its really sub-par action as well. The script and dialogue is nonsensical and thick.Redeeming moments? Just the glimpses you see in the trailer. The shot of Rodan erupting from the volcano is neat.Should have done everything to bring Gareth Edwards back. I feel the 2014 film is underrated, I really appreciated the pacing of that one, the fleeting glimpses of the creatures, and the pay-off at the end.In the grand pantheon of monster throwdowns I would actually rate Alien vs Predator above this.

They make decisions which make no sense and find themselves in situations rational people wouldn't find themselves in, supposedly for the sake of the plot.For instance, one example of many - the ""bad guys"" find themselves in Antarctica at one of the Monarch facilities. Bad guys storm the place, kill everybody, and the leader and his hostages walk in effortlessly to take command of it.Nevermind they would probably need access keys, things would be locked down, and they would actually need to search the place to find what they need to use it effectively. It would also be much more heavily guarded since it was an outpost with a huge secret.But nope, not here. They immediately know how to use everything and where everything is located. They walk in like they just re-signed an apartment lease. I'm not asking for uber-realism, but this is just lazy, sloppy writing.Another plot device, one of the main characters finds themselves at Fenway Park. The whole city is under martial law, and hundreds of people are being sheeped away by armed soldiers in plain view.But not the main character. Somehow, she just happens to find the area she needs to do something important. Of course, it is unlocked, unguarded, and of course, she knows how to use it right away.Another scene - there was an electronic device that the characters needed to reprogram (for whatever reason, I wasn't interested anymore at this point), and of course, they did it right smack in the middle of a battlefield between two giants in a city. And of course, they just happened to have the tools necessary to fix it. And of course, they were working on a circuit board with parts exposed IN THE RAIN (there is a closeup shot of all of the parts getting soaked), but it works fine anyway. I never knew circuit boards could remain functional after being doused in water.At this point, I was actually yelling at the screen. Come on. If you want to make a movie good, don't insult the audience with unbelievable situations or a lack of basic common sense. And there were many other examples of gaps and incredulous actions taken by the characters. Can't the writers do better than this?The first movie was brilliant, believable, clean. I remember seeing the trailer and getting chills. That feeling persisted throughout the movie.This movie, not so much. The monsters are incredible and look amazing, especially Mothra when she comes into full bloom. But that's about it.The other characters were vapid, annoying, uninteresting ""we're a family after all!"" plot device filler used to expand an hour and a half movie into a 2+ hour feature of Michael Bay mediocrity and Independence Day schlock.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

The writing is just plain awful, the dialogue is cliche-ridden in the exteme with far too many obvious exposition drops and badly its delivered by actors who we know are better than these performances (I understand the lure of taking this sort of job for the pay cheque, though). The plot, such as it is, is riddled with holes big enough that Godzilla could stride through them without touching the sides. A problem with a Godzilla film is making the human characters relevant, the central family with whom we're presumably supposed to feel some level of sympathy and interest are incredibly aggravating. Prior to viewing this film I'd have thought Kyle Chandler's on screen charisma could redeem almost anything that goes on around him, but we appear to have found the breaking point.About the only worthwhile element are the monsters themselves, they're very well realised. We can only wish they were given a better vehicle to feature in. Even they, however, are not immune to writing missteps like the recently awoken one that apparently instinctively knows how to tactically negate the fire of a fighter squadron.I'm rarely actively annoyed that I spent time on a film, but Godzilla: King of the Monsters has me irritated that I didn't tap out early and do something more worthwhile like trim my beard or vacuum the skirting boards.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

The only good thing in this movie is the visual effects and the sound effects. Did these two posts on the budget use up almost all the money so that there was too little left for a descent script?!?!Several lines during the movie was just cringeworthy. Several times there are claims that are argued for with absurd arguments if any at all. I am almost surprised that there was no claims during the movie that the stars are mounted on a dome covering the earth, or that the earth actually are flat. The quasi ""science"" in this movie are mostly on that level, and the arguments used to back it up are also mostly on that level...As in the previous movie there are a couple of examples of amateurs in a field being the ones that solves a problem when the experts freezes up and have no idea of what to do. And of course: When advanced technology that have taken several years to develop and produce is damaged, it takes just seconds do fault finding and repair it at the same time as the electronics are exposed to heavy rain...!!! And even if Titans more or less levels a city to the ground, it is possible for several of the main characters in the movie to survive running between the legs of the same Titans... Titans that glide flight flies faster than jet fighters... Jet fighters with rockets of course flies close enough for the Titans to reach them...

Here he has a sad origin thanks to the bad attitude of the human being towards the environment. In turn, he works as a kind of alpha male and all the titans go to Godzilla as if he were a magnet.

As a huge fan of Godzilla the 2014 movie disappointed me. This movie felt more like a Godzilla movie, it had great characters and the story was a lot more interesting compared to the 2014 version.The story is not as simple as it was in the original ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" but that's fine, Great story makes this movie even better. The story has family drama, kaijus fighting and lots of action. There is this strange machine called ORCA which people use to control the kaijus, not my favorite part of the movie but at least it gives us stunning visuals.The filmography in this movie is beautiful. King Ghidorah in the middle of thunderstorm. Rodan raising from the ashes. This movie was filled with amazing shots of the kaijus and it was amazing, since I was a child I have adored these giants and seeing them looking that beautiful made me so happy.Now to the kaijus. There were lots of kaijus there but only 4 that I liked, those 4 being the main kaijus: Gojira, King Ghidorah, Mothra and Rodan. The rest of the kaijus weren't good. Behemoth and MUTO for example weren't my favorite. First kaiju we saw was Mothra in its Larva form. Mothra looks alright. Much more scarier looking than it used to look. Rodan looked really good. Scary pteranodon looking like it should look. King Ghidorah was the star of the movie. It looked amazing and it sounded cool. Godzilla looked like the 2014 and it's not bad but still not my favorite Godzilla look.Score was really good. The classic music was playing in some parts and when the menacing beginning of the music started to play I got cold shivers all over my body, then the magnificent music started to play and I got tears falling down my cheeks.Acting in this movie was impressive. Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown and Ken Watanbe make this movie much better.If it wasn't for the family drama and stupid ""bad"" people I'd call this movie almost perfect Hollywood Godzilla movie.Overall this movie gave us what we were expecting. Lots of action, lots of Kaijus fighting and beautiful shots. Maybe not for everyone but for a Godzilla fan, it surely gave a Hollywood Godzilla movie woryhy its name.","20 out of 37 found this helpful."

The cinematography was absolutely beautiful and the scale of the kaiju was well-established.
As far as comparing it to all movies ever, it's not Casablanca or Gone With The Wind, nor is it meant to be; in my humble opinion, it's a love letter to established fans and a summer blockbuster in the same vein as Jurassic Park, Independence Day, and Ghostbusters.
This being said, I am looking at it as objectively as possible while still keeping in mind 65 years of well-established film history. I couldn't give it a perfect score, as some of the dialogue came across as a bit hokey and some of the story elements seemed to come out of nowhere. Still, at times, I felt as if the film was self-aware of these perceived weaknesses at times. Still, as a long-time fan, I can see where others less familiar with the franchise wouldn't be as accepting and forgiving of these. Fair enough.
Some critics feel as if there wasn't enough human story, but I feel as if the kaiju and human stories were so intertwined that it may seem like that because of the overwhelming presence of the kaiju throughout it all. I find this to be a positive, but again, I can understand why some may feel this way. Almost every aspect of the story was fleshed-out enough without being bogged down in mundane details and over-explanations.
Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters was a damned fine attempt at pleasing the summer blockbuster crowd, the rabid kaiju nerds, and finding equilibrium overall between the devastation and gravity of a truly apocalyptic scenario and still being nearly a non-stop thrill ride all while looking beautifully horrifying.","24 out of 46 found this helpful."

The obvious lack of logic and scientific explanations, let's put that aside now, because the characters are a disaster. No one attracted me or made me care for him, and that should be the goal, to evoke at least some emotion. The story is also bad, and combined with the weak characters makes the film incredibly boring at times. I would say viciously that this is also an achievement given the amount of destruction and explosions we have in the film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

Story wise you cannot expect it to have a big story. It delivers with a story that can open up for more movies as it follows the concept of a monarch which they are researching and searching for titans and believed that the titans once rule the world.The plot opens up a little more about the world of titans and monarch. The story follows Dr. Emma (Vera Farmiga) who has created a device called the orca which can communicate with the titans. King Ghidorah is awakened which is like a three headed dragon that wakes up other titans around the world. It is up to Dr. Mark (Kyle Chandler) and the monarch group led by Dr. Ishiro (Ken Watanabe) to track Godzilla and aid him as Godzilla battles against King Ghidorah and Rodan. Mark is trying to save his daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) as the world is falling into havoc.The plot does open up with the idea of using an orca device that can communicate with the titans. But if its put on the wrong hands, it can lead into bigger trouble. The first film took its time for the build up with Godzilla while showing brief parts of him at a time until the climatic battle. This sequel does not wait to show him fighting. The film builds up with the first 15 minutes with showing a family struggling emotionally about their past and loss. When King Ghidorah is awakened. The film lets loose with its epic visual effects battle when Godzilla shows up in the first half hour of the movie.Definitely, one of the best action packed films. It is big, loud, and has plenty of action set pieces to keep you on the edge of your seat. With Dr. Mark and the monarch flying from one location to another trying to evacuate cities with the beasts waking up. There is Mothra, which is a beautiful and colorful moth. Then, there is Rodan, which is a demonic bird-looking thing that lives in a volcano. And King Ghidorah is an unstoppable force of a three-headed beast. The visual effects are amazing. The action is spectacular.The cast ensemble is also good as well. Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Millie Bobby Brown were great. Charles Dance playing a villain type of character that believes the world is facing extinction cause of overpopulation and the pollution people are causing. And that the titans are the balance that can help reset the world's balance.The music score is also good as well that helped build up the suspense and thrills from music composer Bear McCreary. The film does set up for another movie which will be exciting to see. Plus there is a post credit scene which may hint towards a sequel.Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an epic awesome film that delivers spectacular action sequences with Godzilla battling with the monsters and the mass destruction. The visual effects, the cast ensemble, and the music score are great. Definitely worth seeing on the biggest screen possible.","23 out of 44 found this helpful."

I've never been a huge fan of monster movies, but I liked the 2014 ""Godzilla"" film. From the moment the first trailer for this film came out, though, I was in awe. The Clair de Lune music juxtaposed with jaw-droppingly gorgeous shots of the monsters ended up being one of the best trailers for a blockbuster in a long time. Throw in a generally strong ensemble including names like Vera Farmiga and Sally Hawkins, who I both love, and this was one of my most anticipated movies of the summer. The film was not just a disappointment, however, but a truly crushing disappointment.While the film has some excellent visuals, it has nothing else redeeming whatsoever. The dialogue is frequently cringe-worthy, and the plot has some of the most glaring plot holes in a movie in recent memory. Most of the plot from the 30-minute mark is simply pointless and does not even make remotely logical sense within the greater narrative given such a plot hole. The cast is generally fine, but they are all not given much to do here. All of the human characters are extremely underdeveloped, and even though the monsters may look interesting, they are just uninteresting as characters. Even the monster action is so boring it gets almost numbing, given that much of it becomes increasingly pointless by the film's end. Setting the action scenes at night was also a poor choice, given that it is truly impossible to follow along well (much less establish geography in relation to the action,) unlike action scenes in, say, Marvel movies. The film also spends too much time setting up for future movies at the expense of trying to tell a good story in the here and now. I was hoping that this could be one of the best movies of the summer after its trailers, but it ended up likely being one of the worst. 3/10Note: I saw this film in IMAX. The sound system and larger screen greatly enhanced the film's visuals and score.","7 out of 18 found this helpful."

An F??? Really?I've never been in a movie with so much cheering and positive audience reactions. People loved it.But why are critics hating it? Are they paid shills? Are they mad that their environmental extremism is painted in a negative light, as the villains in the movie adopt the ""world will end in 12 years"" fanaticism. They decide to awaken all the Titans so they can kill off billions of humans in order to send us back to the stone age and ""save the earth"". I think that might have ruffled some feathers.The effects are amazing. The monster action is amazing and has just the right amount. The acting is fine, the plot is fine.Anyone saying they are a long time fan of Godzilla but they hate this movie really makes me wonder...be honest, the plots and acting in the old movies was ridiculous but we watched them for the cool monster action and came to love the campy acting and plot as well. This isn't campy, it's just right for a modern telling of a classic Godzilla story with the four main monsters from the O.G. series. And they did the characters right, they didn't pull any RJ ""subverting expectations"". They listened to the criticism of the hardcore fans towards the 2014 movie and made the right adjustments. This will easily be my favorite Godzilla movie along side the original movie that started it all.The plot and acting in this movie is A+ compared to the old Godzilla movies, and I love them all.Let's hope the critics joining hands in trying to tank this movie doesn't work. If this had been made by Disney and was an exact remake of an old Godzilla movie, they would be calling it brilliant.Thankfully Godzilla vs Kong is already in post production, so even if their efforts succeed in making this a financial failure, we will still get that movie at least...Rodan was amazing. Mothra was awesome. I could have used more of both.Godzilla and Ghidorah were perfect.If you're a monster movie fan, you'll love this. Plain and simple. People like Stuckman claiming to be a Godzilla fan, yet giving this a poor review are liars. The out of touch critics can't objectively look at this movie and see that it does exactly what it sets out to do. What kind of scale are they using here? They praise Last Jedi while they tank this movie...one alienated a large portion of the long-time fan base, the other gave real fans exactly what they wanted.

Don't get me wrong, the spectacle here is AMAZING. The CGI on the characters is undeniably stunning, everyone looks fantastic. They clearly listened to the complaints of Godzilla 2014 with not showing the big guy enough, and yet somehow they still mess it all up. It's just not a good film because it doesn't know what it wants to be. Does it want to be a compelling piece about global warming ? Or does it want to be a campy fun apocalypse movie with Godzilla? It wants to be both and it just can't pull it off. The entire movie is following human characters you could care less about. Millie Bobby Brown was clearly only casted for her star power, and I never once felt that she can only play that part. As with the rest of the cast, nobody is actually playing anyone outside an archetype and the movie doesn't give me any reason to empathize with them outside the fact that they're all humans like me. I even hated the mother character and had no sympathy for her, her plan made absolutely no sense especially coming off the likes of someone like Thanos in the Marvel films. You could make the argument that you're not there to see the humans anyway but the film constantly cuts away from the fights so we can see the humans running around looking for Millie Bobby Brown , so even then it still fails to give us consistent Godzilla action. None of the scale or sense of stakes feel present from Godzilla 2014 so it all just feels boring to watch. It honestly makes me believe Hollywood still doesn't understand Godzilla or at least can't make a decent script to save their life, Oh why did they write Bradley Whitford such god awful lines?? they had 5 YEARS to make this movie. What happened? I made the same complaints about Kong Skull Island and this movie literally does the exact same things. Kong vs Godzilla is coming up and at this point don't know if it'll be worth it all. If you love Godzilla and just want some decent Kaiju action you'll get it, but you have to sit through some dull human drama to get there. 6/10.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

Almost every scene suffers from poor lighting choices, characters that blend into the background and there's no weight or visual anchor for the viewer to latch onto.The actors did their best with the uninspired writing and contrived plot.

Remember when Pacific Rim came out and we imagined what would a godzilla movie done in the same manner look like?
Well we got it, kind of.
I have been so underwhelmed by the recent movies and certain series that I have not written a review in a while but this right here deserves one.
Godzilla: KOTM is a visually stunning, impactful and thrilling Hollywood remaster of the Showa and heisei era monster movies.
I believe that if it was not for the adoration Pacific rim got from the fans we would not get this movie as we all know Hollywood likes to play it extremely safe.
Godzilla: KOTM delivers on that power fantasy that pacific rim brought to our attention ten folds but falls short on the balance that Rim had between the crazy kaiju battles and the outside world.
It probably was not even the directorial team's focus either and that is fine, movies are not supposed to be following the same recipe all the time anyway.
The Godzilla of the Legendary was not the only American redesign that was done right, this time we get to see more and every single monster is looking great.
My favorite is of course Ghidorah as I always imagined him with much bigger and menacing wings than what Japanese movies showed and here we got that.
The sound effect in this movie is bombastic and complements the action shown on the screen and the music is far better than the reclined back seat annoyance that Godzilla 2014 was.
The best part was the use of original Godzilla and Mothra themes which I felt was a big miss that it was missing from the 2014 movie (Godzilla theme of course).
Among the horrible Disney movies of recent release I am glad that a few movies came out that I could actually enjoy.

There is no time for introductions, the very first minute we are already given a sample of what to expect for the rest of the film.Remember when you had to wait one hour to see godzilla on screen? When they took some time to develop the story, introduce the characters and give you time to immerse yourself into the monster universe? Well, not anymore. I must have blinked during the first 30 seconds and missed the part where they explained who was ""Andrew"" and why was so important, but basically the rest of the film I just couldn't understand why some already lame characters were mentioning this person as the reason why they did everything. We divorced because of Andrew, I push the button because of Andrew, let's save the world because of Andrew.You would think they would go back to Andrew but they never do. Instead, the characters just keep making one dumb decision after another. Sacrifices are made that just are completely innecesary. Doctor chinaman decides to stay behind and trigger the bomb, but didn't they show remote controlled vehicles that could just as well deliver the payload without throwing away any lives? Why not send a soldier without training, or again, JUST USE THE REMOTE CONTROL VEHICLESPlotwise this film fails on so many aspects. There is at least three characters that are pure comic relief, and the jokes are so cheesy that they would embarrass even Big Bang Theory writers.I could keep going on about what I disliked, and why this movie is not worth watching, but I will cut myself short.

To say this film is the embodiment of a summer movie is an understatement: it fits that mold more than any summer blockbuster I've seen in a while. By this ""embodiment,"" I mean a film with cheesy dialogue, amazing special effects, a story that goes backstage in exchange for eye-popping action, discarded and irrelevant characters, and explosions and falling buildings... lots of them. Godzilla: King of the Monsters IS the mold of a summer movie... but is that a good thing here?I wish to address the main defense being thrown at this movie by passionate audience members: ""it does what it's supposed to do and what it was marketed as."" To say this is technically not false, but a disingenuous reason to give a film a high rating. I see 8's, 9's, and 10's being given to this movie on IMDB constantly as of late, and after seeing this film, I have to chime in on this. From a film critique point of view, it is inconsistent to claim that Godzilla films ""always have bad characters and a mediocre story in exchange for action"" and then give the film a high rating.To say this about Godzilla films is once again not untrue, but a mediocre and faulty way of awarding a movie points it does not deserve. Shall we reward a film for having bad characters that we don't care about, a story that has motivations among its characters that are terribly inconsistent with past actions, etc. just because past films in the Godzilla universe suffered these same issues? I am chiming in on this issue because the film has gotten positive review-bombed by audience members to the point where it almost has the same rating on IMDb as Moonlight, a Best Picture winner. I only wish to point out that awarding a film such as Godzilla: King of the Monsters points it does not deserve is an incorrect way to perform film critique. A movie is a project that incorporates several different aspects into a final product: a story, acting, writing, cinematography, editing, music, etc. Disregarding a mediocre story, discarded and forgettable characters, and badly written dialogue simply because past films in the franchise ""have always had these issues"" makes no sense. If you enjoyed this film, that's good! If you liked it because it gave you what you wanted, good for you! But I ask audience members to think and not disregard its many glaring issues by giving it a near perfect score because ""that's how all Godzilla movies are."" A movie is not just action and explosions. Is the action and CGI in this film good? Absolutely. But we cannot award a film more than it deserves simply because its genres happens to be action and sci-fi. There are more aspects that go into a good movie, at least certainly a film that deserves a 6/10 or above.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

The tone is serious but there are several 'jokes' (which barely register as such), the plot is nonsensical but played-straight, and the action is loud and silly but it's all shot at night and in the rain (so it can't really be seen). The end result is just a bit bland and forgettable. It's perfectly serviceable in, essentially, every way and is, therefore, utterly unremarkable. It's just safe and predictable blockbuster filmmaking; it hits every beat you expect it to. It does do something semi-interesting with a few of its human characters, which is manifested in a pseudo-twist that goes some way in making the piece more engaging. There's a decent underlying theme that drives the flick's core dynamic but it should have been focused on more; it feels firmly subtextual and the three players involved feel lost in a mire of expendable scientists, soldiers and plot-points. Still, it's appreciated and goes a long way in making the second act more engaging than it otherwise would have been. Indeed, it's the human stuff that keeps you watching. The monster fighting might be good spectacle when you can see it, but it isn't really done justice within the wider piece; it's, basically, a 'save the world from terrorists' story but with Godzilla and company replacing a bomb. While this could have been intriguing, it isn't done justice; it almost feels like 'Transformers (2007)' with flesh instead of steel. As I mentioned, most of the fights are difficult to see and they're also quite repetitive - most of them end with some sort of 'last minute save'. This makes them difficult to engage with, even if the odd shot shown from ground-level convincingly conveys their scale. I know that most people just want to see Godzilla fighting foes and taking names. So would I, if it were done properly. Here, however, it isn't. The flick isn't terrible, it's just fine. It's entertaining enough when it gets going but it does run out of steam long before it actually, and rather abruptly, ends. Some characters are compelling and have decent dynamics, the visual effects are great and there's a pretty fantastic scene set to the original Toho tune. However, the experience is about as forgettable as they come. It's no 'Pacific Rim (2013)', a film with serviceable characters but stand-out action. Annoyingly, it could have been. 5/10","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

Action, Effects, Music, Sound Design, Cool Worldbuilding, Monster adaptation; it's all there and it's all fantastic. When I'd seen the critic ratings I had somewhat expected the human drama and story to fall flat, but it honestly held up well - The Russell Family's arc, Monarch's Titan study, the new human villains, it all worked and was surprisingly good; not amazing, but around the quality of the first movie. Good dialogue with a bit of wit (the humor is on-the-nose, but I found it charming rather than embarrassing), a tone that never took itself too seriously or too jokingly, and some of the greatest kaiju action of any film ever. This and John Wick 3 have so far been the two best films of the year; critics were wrong and I cannot recommend it enough.LONG LIVE THE KING!","13 out of 23 found this helpful."

And gives all my expectations. It's fun, it's serious, it's so Bada**, it's emotional (don't wanna tell you how, cause major spoilers), and by far the best Godzilla movie to date. The script is amazing, for what a fan has always dreamed of. The characters are great too (Ken Watanabe deserves an Oscar), and the Kaijus are amazing. Mothra shocks me the most with her new design. She looks beautiful than ever. Rodan is like a dive bomb and so amazing, but sadly he has the weakest theme in the film (not as stunning as his classic theme from Akira Ifukube). And King Ghidorah is extremely terrifying. He has never been as scary nor as frightening back then, until now. This is basically my favorite design and incarnation of King Ghidorah (since his Showa Character, and Heisei Design). The fight scenes are incredible. I think this is the movie you should not miss. I won't spoil anything for you guys. I think you should see it for yourselves.","28 out of 57 found this helpful."

If there were going to be any humans in it, they should of focused on Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins characters (with a better script of course) since they are the main Monarch people. Sally Hawkins is super talented and she's my favorite actress, but her role is pretty minor, she's not even in half the movie. Instead these souless actors get more screentime. The family drama seemed highly unnecassary, the acting seemed unconvincing and annoying (actors from the 98 version did a better job), and it was unnecassary to have so many unimportant people (the guy from the Verizon commercial, who the heck is he?) in the movie. Ice Cube's son saying something or someone cracking jokes gives me a migrane. If there's going to be a human element to any movie, especially this one, more consideration should be made to improve the overall quality of the movie. So points taken off for bad acting, and limited screentime for Sally. The monster fights were decent, even though it was dark, so don't hate me too much folks.","6 out of 16 found this helpful."

I actually like the human cast liked O'Shea Jackson Jr aka ice cube son he did a great job in this movie if he was lead it would be another version movie franchise of Pacific Rim Uprising, Independence resurgence. he would been great lead role but he was part of this movie. Kyle Chandler did fine he is a least better lead then to Aaron Taylor Johnson witch i didn't like him in this movie because he was boring as hell him as series actor with boring.story does follow up ending of 2014 Godzilla and it doesn't explain anything of characters from first film that's great i don't want to see them at all and i don't care for them. the start of film takes place from ending of film shows Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) was looking for his daughter Madison Russell
(Millie Bobby Brown) and his wife Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) after the disatar where the fight was over when Godzilla fighting Muto then story continues after 2014 film ended, it has villain (Charles Dance) witch he did good in film as villain, the main characters are more interesting then in first film the family Mark Russell i wish he could been played solider in first Godzilla film but he is a Emma's ex-husband, Madison's father, an animal behavior and communication specialist who formerly worked for Monarch, and co-inventor of ""the Orca"", a machine that enables communication with the Titans but can also ""potentially control them using their bioacoustics on a sonar level. After suffering a loss, Mark has an unfavorable opinion of the Titans, Godzilla in particular. Despite this, he joins a rescue mission along with Dr. Serizawa and Dr. Graham to save Emma and Madison from nefarious forces. his acting is pretty emotional he wants all creatures to die to be destroyed but people say Godzilla is not invasion of world he is their to save world, to kill the another creatures, the wife about her character is a ark's ex-wife, Madison's mother, a paleobiologist working for Monarch with a history of environmental activism, and co-inventor of the Orca. Unlike Mark, Emma believes that humans and Titans can co-exist peacefully. she is forced to do things that aren't her faultbecause she is forced to do a lot of things that are unexpected but she doesn't have choice by Charles Dance character A former British Army colonel and MI-6 agent who defected after becoming disillusioned by humanity during his time in the service but then he becomes a band of accomplice mercenaries. i thought those characters had a interesting thing in movie then in first film with characters that we cared for expect for Bryan Cranston character in first film. but i wished he was lead role for this movie of first film or this sequel but sadly it had to kill him off for no reason. They play a good supporting cast to the main cast you care about The Titans, but in my opinion i loved O Shea Jackson character in this movie the best when he plays a soldier in film.in film it shows entire more then human characters is they show monster verse that leaves you loud at theater and it shows more fighting and a epic cool looking showdown battling each another not just that it has great special effects, cool coloring looking, great CGI looks it was great and better and kicks the crap out of first film. Not totally sure why people are coming out of seeing the film with the 'it's not what I expected' attitude, they loved 2014 Godzilla
75% of rotten tomatoes ???? and it got that higher but this can't ? this got 39%
for no reason ? what was bad about this movie ? it didn't had much story ? it had too much great better CGI, it had full on kicking ass action and it shows Godzilla fully in this movie it shows Godzilla and monsters more then human characters, this is called a REAL GODZILLA movie when he is in it. not like in 2014 Godzilla where it shows Godzilla in 10 seconds and then scene cuts way to kid watching it on TV ? the film didn't saw Godzilla in 45 minutes until the end of film i wanted to see more of Godzilla and this is what i get i loved what i got. i don't know what people want from this movie what ? more characters then to less Godzilla ? that's freaking sad theirs no Godzilla in film, their are no presents in it. It's Godzilla, it's based on the King of monsters fighting to keep the title literally, but not literally, but he does more in this movie a lot more.
If your a Godzilla fan you will love this film more much more then the first film this shown Godzilla a lot more and he does a lot more then first film, give a sequel a try. Where Godzilla 2014 failed this movie and it stil got a succeed this is why you don't listen and pay attention to critics who knows what they want they wanna a Godzilla film they loved 2014 film when theirs no Godzilla and didn't do much in this movie and it doesn't show him until 45 minutes the movie is called Godzilla that's all it's called it should more Godzilla and more of him in it kicking ass nope it shows less Godzilla and more characters got great dumb success. believe me this is more of Godzilla kicking ass, this is more of his movie then to any of it and shows more of monsters more then first Godzilla.make sure Make sure you stay till the VERY end of the credits scene or for a final scene hinting at what ? could be to come. i have Walked out with a smile on my face after watching this movie then to 2014 Godzilla witch made say could of been better.","19 out of 37 found this helpful."

But unlike 2014's Godzilla the characters in king of monsters are more or less caricatures of stereotypical roles with very minimal character development and reason for us as viewers to care and empathize with. Most of this movie was long drawn out scenes that I was bored to death by and give little insight to anything, throwing 'science jargon' that make littles sense and is hardly explained rather than showing us more of Godzilla. In comparison, 2014's Godzilla was a lot more interesting because the character of Aaron Taylor-Johnson was a lot more relatable than Kyle Chandler's 'animal sound analyst?'.In many ways 2014's Godzilla was a lot more grounded, while it did not have larger fight scenes it focused on being more of a disaster movie than a 'monster movie'. Personally that works a lot better for me in many ways. Firstly, as mentioned it gave us characters that were more relatable, seconfly, it makes Godzilla seem like a much larger threat and lastly the way that 2014's GOdzilla was shot gave us various views of parts of his body, with the camera staying close to the ground mst of the time. I really enjoyed that approach as it made Godzilla seem a lot larger and mysterious.Thus, while King of the Monsters certainly brings us the salivating fight scenes it was very weak in the development of the human characters and struggled to maintain the sense of urgency and intensity that the original film did. Instead was rather boring at times and goofy at others, making it lose that uniqueness that I felt the original movie did in comparison to other movies of a similar genre.","4 out of 10 found this helpful."

But it did not disappoint. There is tons of destruction, tons of monsters, and tons of homages to previous Godzilla films. First, the sounds all the kaiju made were spot on, albeit modernized. The visual eye candy is constant. The creature design was truly ah inspiring.
Bear McCreary's score is absolutely incredible!! Full of homages to original themes by Ikufube (probably spelled wrong).
If you go to this movie expecting a kaiju smashfest overflowing with homages and fan service then this is the movie for you!!Now for my critiques: The story IS lacking and a little disjointed. The acting is pretty good, although there are a couple poorly delivered lines. You never quite fully understand the motivations behind characters. My overall feelings about most of the critiques on this page are justified. However, this leads me to my main point. This is a kaiju movie.. what are you honestly expecting ? Are you expecting academy award winning performances ? Are you expecting a Christoffer Nolan masterpiece? No, or at least you shouldn't be. The hard core critics of this film are being critical for the sake of being critical. This is a monster movie, you are going to get lots of monsters, explosions, and creature violence. That is kinda the point.Anyway, long story short, this is a flawed movie from a critical stand point. There are weak points, and strong points. But again I reiterate the point, THIS IS A MONSTER FILM!! if you are going into this film to be entertained and have a smashingly great time, then please go and I think you will have fun. But if you are expecting something more from this film (that no kaiju film in the history of cinema has delivered btw) then I think you should avoid this film.","5 out of 7 found this helpful."

Story wise nothing made sense, no logical sense sigh, it feels as if the script was written by a 6 year old...with social disabilities and mentally deficient. Written for the age of the stupid!All human characters were extremely unrelatable and very shallow in reasoning and choices, it would have been bad even for a bad B movie. How is this possible with such a rich material to work with? With a solid cast? With so much money to spend? Even the lore and links to actual human history were done very poor and none caring. All that was left were the monsters and gloriously battle they did, but that does not fill 90+ minutes and that it didn't save the movie. Shame such garbage even made a profit as the makers should have been punished for it.. But what is scary, is the massive amount of positive reviews on this movie. Did they see a different movie? Or.. nah.. Anyhow, its very scary to think about it.Milly Bobby Brown.. I do not know if it was just due to this movie and what was possible for her, but I found her really bad to even annoying.. which is a shame cause i just love her in Stranger Things. I hope and wish better for her in the future.Aisha Hinds ... Colonel Diane Foster.. Why the heck was she a rampaging Colonel, while half of her sentences she shouted were..not comprehensible?

There is a great balance of story involving the humans, and plenty of screen time for all the kaijus. I will say there were some kaijus I would of liked to have seen more of, but can understand why they weren't shown as much and how the initial focus was on King Ghidorah. The storyline behind this film is great, quite original and relates to real world issues in a sense. The animation is beautiful, and there is good humour dotted in the film.Incredibly impressed, left a huge smile on my face as I left the cinema, have been invited to see it again on the big screen, instant YES!","5 out of 7 found this helpful."

As one of my gifts I was given a VHS copy of the 1965 version Godzilla vs Ghidorah directed by Ishiro Honda. I fell in love with it then and have never turned back. 1998 Godzilla was fun as a kid but looking back was a bit of a let down and then we had the 2014 Hollywood revival of Godzilla vs The Mutos. A controversial view but I think it started the monsterverse off well! As a young kid watching monsters face off against each other is what it truly all about and it still is as a grown up. Who doesn't love a titan battle??For years I have wanted a film of Godzilla facing off against his arch nemesis and now it's here my god does it wow! From the very get go you are thrown into action and unlike the 2014 version they do not beat around the bush, the dialogue between the fantastically picked cast is engaging and informative, they don't shy away from name dropping other Titans either. It is a monster action masterpiece. It's called Godzilla: King of the Monsters, not Godzilla: King of democracy and peace talks. It does exactly what it says on the tin and does not disappoint! If you don't enjoy theses such films then it's not for you, this wasn't made for awards etc, it was made for enjoyment and that's exactly what it provides!The CGI in this film is perfectly balanced, don't read what the pessimists have to say. Why should we not have the best CGI of monsters battling each other? Why should we not see Godzilla running through Boston to tackle Ghidorah? Why should we not these monsters in all their glory. We have screens with such definition these days for reasons and that is for films to shock and awe. It has always been that way and long may it continue. For critics to come out and say that the film uses to much CGI is just rubbish and evidently written by someone who is stuck in their ways... get with the times!A special mention to Ken Watanabe whom reprises his role as Dr Sewizara and is a true hero of this tale, he encompasses everything about an admirer of Godzilla, he brings acting pedigree that does not overshadow all those on screen.If you love the form of escapism that is cinema then go to see this film.","5 out of 7 found this helpful."

This leads to a battle royale scenario where in order to survive, mankind must work with Godzilla to defeat this threat and bring back a natural order to the world.This time around, they seemed to take on board some of the criticism from the previous movie about not using more of the classic monsters Godzilla used to fight in the Toho franchise, so this time they unleash far more titans on to the world. On one side we have Godzilla's partner the great benevolent Mothra showing off her gorgeous wing span and giving us a lot of moments to just be in awe of her beauty. Then on the other we have the destructive King Ghidorah, with his monstrous scale towering over cities raining down destruction from the skies. And when these monster clash it does have some of those epic destructive moments that fans have been asking for and that raise the bar for when Godzilla v Kong comes out in 2020.But unfortunately it retains the rest of the problems from the previous two films in Legendary's Monsterverse, with these remaining problems being magnified this time around. The new cast is led by married couple Mark and Emma Russell, played by Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga, along with their daughter Madison played by Millie Bobby Brown. Normally in a film like this you'd see parents at least try to take their child away from danger, but here Madison's mother has no qualms with letting her child run around with her on battlefield. At the beginning of the film she even brings her to a secret facility containing one of the Kaiju for seemingly no reason.The rest of the overcrowded supporting cast is rounded up by Zhang Ziyi playing a researcher of ancient myths relating to the creatures, some more supporting scientists for comedic relief and a bunch of forgettable soldiers. There's also the leader of the villainous eco-terrorists Charles Dance, who's so badly defined we don't really get a justification for how he got to his position other than he used to be a soldier and therefore hates humanity now.In previous films we had enough human characters like Bryan Cranston, John C Reilly and Samuel L Jackson so the human portions of the movie had at least something to support them. But the only good human character in this film is Ken Watanabe, who has a few good lines scattered throughout the film, but is not given enough prominence in the film to make the human drama work. And when a majority of the film is focused on these human characters, this is a big problem. Especially when there are monsters having an epic battle in the background and instead we're forced to spend our time with these bland personalities we don't actually care about.There's also a lot of logical oversights throughout the film, with the film ignoring anything it needs to in order for our characters to get where they need to get to in the story. Every character seems to inherit the fast travel ability from the last two seasons of Game of Thrones, with characters having the ability to travel across the globe in a matter of minutes to show up wherever they need to, even if the monsters should have been travelling faster than they do. Characters will also change their motivation to suit the needs of the film, going from wanting every Kaiju dead to deciding to work with Godzilla over the course of a scene.But if you're a fan of the old Toho monster movies and want to see what kind of chaos these titans can cause on a 200 million dollar budget, this film definitely has a lot of great moments showing us that. But at the same time this film doesn't offer anything on par with the moment we first see Godzilla use his atomic breath in the previous movie and takes us on a bland ride with these human characters to get to these moments.","3 out of 7 found this helpful."

Of course, like he said... we're biased. Lol. Big time big G fans and have been all our lives. Obvious love of the genre on hand with the filmmakers. Hero shots and cool reveals for all the big guns.

May I please point out Bradley Whitford as an early nominee for the Razzie next year. He really knocked this movie down a few pegs with his cliched nineties blockbuster era quips. I couldn't even believe they let his awful lines make the final cut. I was hoping a monster would dispatch of his character quickly.The last movie was great. It was wonderfully made. Like Game of Thrones, it did a masterful job of not showing every single fight or battle scene. Why do we need to see that? Show the aftermath, show the fight from another person's perspective. Seeing monsters rumble over and over is boring.This movie pretty much was dumbed down to cater to the lowest common denominator. It was tragic, just one giant Power Rangers episode, wham bam wham bam bam bam, over and over again. I literally felt like I was watching a TV show like Ronin Warriors or Transformers.And from what I understand, the next movie will be Godzilla vs. King Kong? For real? King Kong will be like an ant to Godzilla if he has the powers he has in this movie. I'd probably reconsider that...Can't recommend. Will keep my 2014 Godzilla copy close to my heart though.

What a mess!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4905977/?ref_=tt_urv","bill-kannberg","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur49448066/?ref_=tt_urv","2 June 2019","I went in with great expectations of an epic, thinking sci-fi movie. Ugh! Nope. It isn't. If you're expecting it based on the reviews, then you could be really disappointed.This movie is an epic mess. Epic in that thousands of people worked on this movie, which is epic. The fight scenes are at such a big scale that it's hard to imagine the hours involved in just looking into the physics of how these fights might work, then to translate them into software and movement. For that I give the film 10 stars.For the story and the mess of direction and acting (which is at time really bad) it pulls the rating to a 4 for me, and that's me being generous with my ratings.The story is full of scenes that demand you suspend basic understand of physics, explosions, how planes fly, how things explode, how humans are seemingly 100% impervious to anything that happens to them. There are so many (should) instant-kill explosions that occur near humans in this film I lost track -- but the part that makes you shake your head is that the actors are never injured, they either walk away with not even dirt of on their face, no cuts, no injuries, or they die -- this is the binary mess of this film -- and that's just one aspect. Throughout the movies humans face into nuclear explosions (even a flying plane that maintains perfect balance in the wake of a nuclear explosion while flying with the doors open, yep, really), shredding glass explosions, and myriad other substances exploding and they walk and run away without injury. At the end of the movie there is one STUPID scene where one person on the military team has a shred of metal in her leg, which is treated as a big dramatic moment. Are you kidding me? No, you're not, you're asking me to play along with this mess of a movie! This is the only injury in the whole movie. At the end of the movie the teen girl (who saves the world just about, which is another stupid aspect of this movie's storytelling -- another of the endless movies where teenagers save the world) is in a house that is COMPLETELY destroyed by explosions and monsters bigger than skyscrapers. But does she die? Of course not! How does she live? She comes out with just a rain-wet face, no debris on her, no scratches, no cuts. Alive and healthy, because she got into a bathtub and left her hand sticking out so her father could rescue her. Are you f'ing kidding me? She's not breathing when she's rescued, but just placing her on the ground apparently and not doing anything brings her back to life all on her own. Amazing!Then there are the vague religious references to Godzilla as ""God"". Stupid lines referring to Godzilla like ""Long live the king"" and ""Jesus, it's good he's on our side"". But they put a pause after Jesus so it wouldn't be so obviously a religious reference, but play back the line in your head without the pause and it's a reference to Jesus, and stupidly and awkwardly placed near the end of the movie and said by two pretty poor actors, including the lead who is usually brilliant but poorly directed in this movie and comes off looking ridiculous, like the B-list male lead who wouldn't be believable in a deodorant commercial.They certainly couldn't get A-list actors for this movie and went to B and C list. Ben, what are you doing in this mess?So, Jesus, this is is stupid movie that looks like it cost a 100 million to make.No, no no. What a mess!","4 out of 11 found this helpful."

Visually, this is probably one of the best movies ever made. Monsters looked amazing and quite realistic, animation was great, the visual effects were stunning, sound design even though at some point it became a bit repetitive and tiresome because of the non stop ( and some times no reason) explosions it was pretty spot on. And then there is the plot. I swear to god,be prepared ,if you want to watch this movie, you will literary have to turn your brains off. I am not going to get in any spoilers, but this movie makes absolutely no sense or whatsoever. Most of the decisions made are irrational and borderline stupid, the main conflict of the protagonists is just laughable or absolutely insane,depending how much you are going to think about it, the information delivered comes in the most cliched and uninspiring ways with exposition being all over the place...It's quite a shame because honestly this didn't even feel like a movie.You don't have to write an oscar worthy script for every movie, especially for monster movies, but come on, this is like a 6th grader story made as an assignment for school. It felt as if a production company hired the best cgi studios in the world and they delivered a stunning result and when it came to writing the script, they probably used the first draft that they ever made, it's honestly that bad.If this movie had an adequate script it would honestly be like an 8 or even 9 for its genre, what a waste of an opportunity.","4 out of 11 found this helpful."

They simply missed the point of a Godzilla film. Fans of giant monster films don't care about the human characters or the acting (which honestly did suck in this film), they care about the plot bringing the monsters together, and epic fight scenes.First, the things the film does good. All of the monsters look quite good. It's pretty obvious in the film that they are computer generated, but they still look quite genuine and aren't bad enough to take you out of the film. The fan service to previous Godzilla films in the Toho films was well placed, as we got to see Mothra, King Ghidorah, and Rodan on the big screen once again. Out of the monsters they could've chosen to add, they chose fan favorite characters that have occurred throughout multiple Godzilla films, while staying true to the abilities that the monsters possess. There were some other references to the original 1954 film that definitely increased the watching experience. Some of the parts from the musical score were perfect for the film. In a few places towards the end there are different variations on the original Godzilla theme. Kyle Chandler was also far and away the best actor in the film.Now some things I PERSONALLY didn't like. While the texture of Mothra undeniably looked good, I didn't really like the actual model. In this film, Mothra is made to look more like an actual moth, as opposed to looking closer to a butterfly in the Toho interpretations. It's not that bad of a change but I personally was taken out of the film by it.Now for the bad things. Most of the acting was very bad. Most of the ""good"" characters were fine, especially Kyle Chandler's portrayal of his character, but that does not save the film from having other terribly acted characters. The villain characters were terrible. The woman and her daughter were terrible. The Asian woman wasn't that good either, but not as bad as some of the other characters. While the monster models looked good, some of the animations (movements and poses) weren't that good. They were fine in the fight scenes but they were usually bad when you could see a close-up on a monster's face. While some of the score was perfect for the film, other parts were completely unmemorable, and after leaving the theater I had already forgotten what they sounded like. And now the main reason why I gave the film 6/10 and not higher: the plot. The plot is extremely thin, and plot is one of the few things that normally matter that I look for in a monster film. The film felt as if it wanted to find a way to get the monsters to fight each other, but made no attempt past that.Despite these problems I still liked the film. You probably won't enjoy this film if you don't like Godzilla films, in that case I wouldn't recommend the film, but if you have liked other Godzilla films then I don't see why you won't like this one. Sure it's not as good as Godzilla (1954) or Shin Godzilla, or Godzilla vs Biollante, or Godzilla (2014), but it isn't a bad film. Despite the many flaws, I still appreciate everyone who worked on the film for creating a Godzilla that remains somewhat competent, unlike the REALLY bad Godzilla films.PSA: Don't ever watch Godzilla (1998), Godzilla 2000, All Monsters Attack, or Son of Godzilla. These ones are a waste of time that you will NEVER EVER get back.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

This time the story made sense, and the people seemed to be in tune with what was going on. No stupid love story trying to appeal to your emotions.I liked how certain scenes paid homage to the Japanese Godzilla movies by using some of the same references and music. He was pretty bad ass at the final fight scene. It reminded me of the Japanese fight with ""Destroyah"", if you saw that one. For true Godzilla fans, you will hear and recognize many clues and references. Have to say though, Mothra was a bit small if you ask me.
The military were decently portrayed, but some things were a bit off. For example, you won't see a Full Bird Colonel running around like a Sergeant leading a strike team into a hot zone.

The monsters, vehicles, explosions and much of the scenery are all CGI and it looks horrible, give me an actor in a rubber suit stamping on miniature sets anytime!

We get this whole gallery of monsters from the Godzilla universe rising from the ground and these titans battle it out starting early in the film and all the way to the end. It moves at a nice brisk pace because of that. It develops the sense of urgency early on in the film involving the human subplot and then in the first half of the film the monsters are unleashed and destruction begins. As it is a Godzilla movie Godzilla gets in the action at the beginning, middle, and a big fight at thre end of the film. We get to explore him a little bit more as a character. I also appriciated that this film dove into the deep end of mythology of this world with monsters being around for a while, ancient civilisations, MONARCH and all of the many different bases throughout the globe. There's a bunch of things about this film that I really enjoy. We spend a lot of time with our human characters, but they're all played by great actors that can deliver really ridiculus exposition and stupid lies in a way that it sounds kind of convincing, but that leads to our big problem here is that the scrips is not good. There's just so many holes inside of the logic. The characters are all basically a job and a single personality trait. That's all of them. They just got a great actor to try to perform that, but there's just no depth to anyone. Also the monster action, though there's plenty of it, is shot so often in close-up or from the perspective of humans that it doesn't have the right effect that it should. It's not as exciting as it should be even though there's a lot of it. So this is a movie that is very frustrating because of the mistakes it made were, even though it's got a great cast and plenty of monster action, which is what we go to the movies like this to see","5 out of 7 found this helpful."

It grabs you at the start and takes you on a two-hour roller coaster ride of action and family drama, helped along by a solid story line and a strong cast.There's little waiting on Godzilla's appearance this time, as opposed to the previous film. The arrivals of Rodan and Mothra are spectacular, but are overshadowed by Godzilla's when he reaches Boston in the final third of the movie. He lets King Ghidorah know then that he's had enough, and their battle is exceptional.The Titans aren't those of the 1950s and '60s. They're well-designed and believable. King Ghidorah is a threatening opponent for Godzilla, as he was in they hey-day of Japanese science fiction, a dragon that presents three problems in one body. The ending is outstanding. Be sure and stay until the credits are finished for an Easter egg. The film also pays homage to the original Godzilla. No spoilers revealed, but you'll know it when David Strathairn reprises his role as the admiral of the fleet tasked with helping find and fight the Titans.Kyle Chandler gives a fine performance as the father in a broken family. Vera Farmiga complements him well as his scientist wife who has a dark side and makes the decision that carries the movie. The only shortcoming is that the film does not take full advantage of Charles Dance, who brings malice and mayhem as well as any actor going these days.All in all, the best Godzilla ever....","5 out of 7 found this helpful."

Because that's not what you get. This movie focuses more on cg and making a cool action Godzilla movie, leaving story and character out of it.The whole family story-line really didn't catch me, and i didn't feel anything when the characters were in danger. And all the scenes without the monsters were really nothing. The writing was cheesy and lazy, there are multiple scenes only for exposition, there's a lot of cliches, the story is predictable and the characters constantly make small stupid decisions that really add up to be really annoying.However the scenes with the monsters are stunning, and it's more fun then you think just watching monsters destroying things. Now even though the scenes without the monsters were more boring, there was constant tension throughout the entire movie. Sure, it would be more powerful if you cared about the characters but it's clear that's not what they were going for. And that's fine?'
Thats for you to decide. If you want to watch a fun Godzilla movie with non-stop action, i recommend it. But that's not my thing, i like complicated compelling characters with lots of depth, so that's why this is my rating.
But like i said, it's up for you to decide4/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

Before I start, I have been told that my movies reviews are too long and that I put in too many spoilers, so I am going to stick to my opinions and leave out the deep analysis about the plot.
After many years of Godzilla movies, they still haven't been able to get them right, and this movie doesn't help! The lack of character building, and over-exaggerated action scenes, which were hard to watch because of the dark colour palette, made this movie another bad interpretation of Godzilla. The acting wasn't that great, especially from the leading actor, Kyle Chandler (Dr. Mark Russell), who seemed to be over-acting most of the time, and the technical jargon got on my nerves after a while. I know that the storyline was close to the books, but from an entertainment point of view, I thought it was a right mess. None of the characters was interesting, and I'm getting a bit fed up with watching soldiers firing guns at massive monsters, even though they can't harm them. On the plus side, the attention to detail of the monsters was OK, when you were able to see them, but I still think that it was extremely far-fetched and slightly ridiculous in places. I do commend the sound department, who managed to bring some intensity to the film, but they went a bit far with the CGI. In a weird type of way, I thought the whole story about Mothra was sweet, especially when she battled with Godzilla, and the 3-headed titan was a bit nuts, but I just wished that it was shot with a brighter palette, so we could actually see the battle scenes properly. Anyway, it's a watchable movie, but I personally think that it could have been much shorter if they cut out all of the unnecessary technical jargon, and actually gave the characters some depth. Watchable!
Please tell me if you prefer my previous movie review template, or if you prefer them with just my opinions!Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Michael Dougherty, who also brought you Trick 'r Treat in 2008, and Krampus in 2015. Now, I always feel bad about putting a film down after watching the bonus material on the Blu-ray because you really get to see how far they go to produce a film. In this case, Michael is a true die-hard fan of the Godzilla franchise, so he really wanted to stay true to the books, but as I don't know that much about the Japanese classic, I had to take this film from a standalone point of view. As I wasn't a fan of the previous movies, I didn't have high expectations for this film, so I wasn't that disappointed, but there is obviously a big market for this franchise, judging by the box office takings. If they do decide to make another Godzilla film, I hope it has some decent characters, so they don't have to totally rely on CGI.Budget: $170million
Worldwide Gross: $386millionGenre: Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-Fi

Not sure what people were expecting outside of big Kaiju monster action sequences. The Godzilla movies have never been the highlight in terms of the story side of things. I didn't think the Human characters were as godawful as everyone was making them out to be. They had motivations and character arcs. Sure, some of them went into cliche and predictable paths, but I don't think it's weak enough to really hurt the film that much to me. Some characters from the previous 2014 Godzilla movie reappear in this movie, and I feel they do a better job here and are used more effectively. The pacing is also better in this movie and nothing feels too dragged out as far as I'm concerned.All I wanted most were big monster smash action sequences and this Godzilla
delivers that for about 2/3rds of the movie's running time. They are really
well shot and the CGI to me was fantastic, especially in IMAX 3D. The sound was booming and loud, and there's not really much I could fault on the technical side of this movie. It's a popcorn blockbuster action movie, and I think it's a pretty damn good one for what it is. No idea why the critics disliked this one so much compared to that snoozefest Godzilla 2014. My god that movie was so boring and Godzilla was only in it for like what 5 minutes? You get all the missing action everybody wanted here, and these iconic monsters battling such as King Ghidorah, Mothra, Rodan, and Godzilla himself. If you judge it for what it is, a huge modern Godzilla movie, it does a pretty good job at achieving that goal.8/10","18 out of 35 found this helpful."

Sure, but only if it's a well made movie.Most of the monster action of the film is so pompous and busy it's not always fun to look at, although the CGI creatures were pretty cool - so it's what you'd expect. But the action is not what I'm here to talk about. The movie's biggest flaws come with the story and human characters, which I will delve into now.Kyle Chandler plays Mark Russell, a nature photographer who somehow knows a LOT about bombs. His ex-wife Emma (Vera Farmiga) is a scientist bordering on evil, whose plan to 'cleanse' the Earth is Thanos-esque. Their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) is a stereotypical ""kid who goes in the middle of the monster battle and needs saving."" Also along for the ride is Dr. Serizawa, whose seemingly 50 sayings of ""Goochula"" need to stop.So, Dr. Emma uses the Orca (what exactly IS the Orca and how does it work, you ask? Too bad! We don't know!) to wake up the monsters so they can flatten the Red Sox stadium. But things get messy when guys eject out of their plane at the wrong time and make stupid faces for their I.D. photos. Another delightful trope is that every time a monster goes on a rampage and the alarms go off, people announce things like, ""What's wrong?"" and ""Something's wrong."" You don't say?So as you can see, I thought this film was mediocre and a touch comical. I say call the guys at RiffTrax; we've found their newest project. The only thing that would've made it better is if an orange tabby cat ran past Kyle Chandler and dropped off a newspaper that read, ""Godzilla vs. Kong!""","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

The 90's Toho Goodzilla/Mothra movies is where the series gets good.
The 1998 Tristar movie is it's own thing and enjoyable if you are in the mood to have a good time and overlook things.
The Sony cartoon series justifies the movie and did Destroy All Monsters better than the movie, even with original monsters instead of the Toho ones.
Godzilla 2000 through Tokyo SOS is next level amazing.
The Final Wars set leak photos had us all super excited, but then the weird Matrix stuff in the film was weird and unexpected.
Godzilla 2014 was good.
Kong Skull Island was better and easily the best Kong.

Godzilla King Of The Monsters 2019 is by far the best Godzilla ever.I love the rubbersuit effects of the Toho series, but seeing actual money going into amazing effects is awesome!

This movie cuts away from the action so often, despite there being tons of monster-scenes, that it is hard to tell what is going on in any fight, who has the upper-hand and how they gained it. This leads to the outcome of the finale feeling contrived and what action we do see to be meaningless; One moment we see Godzilla has the upper-hand, then we cut to humans, only to cut back to the action to find that Ghidorah is winning for reasons we did not get to see.I will not attempt to pick-apart the plot because plot generally comes second in these types of movies. However I will pick at the tone. The reason fans are so forgiving of dumb, contrived plots of some of the Toho films, but are not forgiving of this plot, is because the cheesy Toho films never took themselves seriously. With Toho, you knew when and to what degree a film had decided to take itself seriously, and could tell their cheesy films from their darker ones. But this film lacks that, by taking itself too seriously, while still wanting to have absolutely ridiculous things happen every five seconds. A tonal change could have helped the plot and fan reception to it.None of this to say this film isn't without value. Rodan is a stand-out presence in this movie, staring in the best action scene in the movie in which he had a large-scale dog-fight against jets and warships. Mothra is another stand-out star who brings to this Hollywood blockbuster a hint of the nostalgia one might feel when watching the older Godzilla films. And, while the CGI could be better and I believe it will not age particularly well, the monster-designs are all incredible and unique. Each monster carries a presence and has a moment of beauty to admire. The score is also surprisingly moving, paying homage to the Toho movies.For long-time Godzilla fans I would recommend this film simply for the experience. But for general viewers I doubt that there will be much enjoyment to be found in this movie. Unless you have kids who want to watch monsters fight, I'd give this movie a skip.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

For those that aren't into reading reviews longer than one paragraph: Did I like the movie? No. I left my seat deflated and disappointed. I hoped for a film for those of us that grew up with Toho, those of us that aren't ten-years-old and don't care for the unnatural pacing and characters of films like Star Wars and Marvel, where it's one unbelievably happenstance thing after the next.Let me say a few things I did like, and I admit, there is not many. I do like that you can now hear some of that iconic Godzilla roar in this mixed in with the new. There are some truly beautiful scenes of Godzilla and Mothra early on - which almost make the price of admission worth it alone. I do like Watanabe's last scene in the film, though to avoid spoilers, cannot go into that. Overall, I do like the monster designs.Now we come to the part of this review that pains me to write...All this talk of the monsters being the focal point of the film is absurd. The true stars here are Watanabe, Chandler, Farmiga, and Eleven from Stranger Things playing Eleven from Stranger Things. In all sincerity, Godzilla and the others are the supporting cast. What this left me with was a plot that was chock full of humans in the worst way; and I mean a very large human cast, where they by and large offer nothing but a skin deep plot to steer the movie forward. With their prominence in this film the only thing they contribute is characters that would fit into any Transformers movie. Simply put, all characters, with the exception of Watanabe's, are no good. We also get the very banal characters from the 2014 film, such as the admiral and Watanbe's generic aide, played by Sally Hawkins - and then some. Filling in for the famous twin Mothra fairies is a woman that adds drivel via her research on what looks like Wikipedia or another online encyclopedia. We also can't forget to mention the Hokey politicians and Monarch soldiers that are there for tired quips that lack wit. The villains in this film rival those of Star Wars' New Order; their story is so little told it could fit into a TV advert - they don't really matter. Charles Dance's character also doesn't matter. So what are we left with? A cast, the true stars of this film, jerking back and forth in character (Chandler), and the rest levying 'witty' comments, having an explanation for everything to handhold the audience, and reacting on a dime to everything at every turn... Literally, they look right just in time and something happens. Then they look left and, again, just in time, something happens. And so on...The hand-holding of the characters and writing is so bad that, for instance, a video conference call between Farmiga and Chandler is accompanied by a short film. I guess the characters in this world create video presentations prior to calling one another. In reality, if your dialog is so weak and can't deliver or stand on its own, and requires the use of visual aids, it just doesn't work.Now on to the monsters. We have been primed going in to believe that they are the true stars of this film. Regardless how well they are designed, they are, as stated above, a supporting cast. For some of you the truth of this will come later once the dust and hype settles, and for others, it will take someone compiling a video of all Godzilla footage out of the two plus hours run time, and uploading it to YouTube - and it will be a small fraction of that two hours (oh, but not that human cast - they are in there for the duration). At every possible moment this large human cast is in the way. Whether it is during fight scenes or not, we are constantly being pulled away and led by the hand to see foot and claw from their perspective. I understand the desire to illustrate scale, but surely this doesn't mean we need to be constantly bludgeoned over the head to be reminded of it. Even when it comes to the final showdown between Godzilla and Ghidorah, the creators felt the need to busy the audience with characters doing dumb things that don't matter - or worse yet, are plot devices of the most worst kind.The final battle also concludes in the worst possible way. It's offending how cheap and contrived it is... And it flies in the face of the Toho film they loosely, and I mean loosely, based this on. The ending and the buildup to it also flies in the face of the King of Monsters - the guardian of the natural world - Godzilla. It's the ultimate cheap shot. And this cheap shot is followed by showing additional titans - most of which have never been seen on any Toho film. There is no Gigan, no Baragon, no Megalon - none of them. And why weren't they there at the end to bend a knee?!? It would have left things off on the highest possible note. Instead we receive another dumb quip from those same uninteresting, worthless characters, where in response to someone that says ""Thank God he's on our side"", they reply ""For now..."" - alluding to Godzilla's shift to bad guy status due to the entrance of a giant ape for the next installment of this franchise. There is enough apes in these movies already - do we really need another that is only bigger and has more hair?Another hit for the attention defected, Marvel-loving, cell phone generation.","5 out of 16 found this helpful."

Movie embraces and realises it's caliber of using the Great Monsters and uses it Awesomely!!Godzilla was Badass (Obviously) And King Ghidhorah!!!
Whenever these two are on screen they are Jaw Dropping...
Rodan was less on-screen but was Coool too
Mothra was OK.Superb and Great Monster Fighting Sequences.
Great Background Score too!..
Plot was good it wasn't as bad as the critics are calling as well as the human characters, they are fine and watchable too..
Don't listen the bad reviews.. movie will work as a Fine Entertainer.. no waste of money here.Some flaws such as it could've been a little short and sometimes the human characters bore you... only sometimes.. and they are trying to be too dramatic.. there was no need of that. They were working out good all over.
Plot was trying to become heavy and complicated sometimes.Overall, if you enjoyed and liked the first one, you'll be greatly entertained and pleased.. a tasty treat to Godzilla Fans..
And a Treat to every person either a fan or not.
Long Live The King!
(And don't miss those Kong Easter Eggs)
Go watch it! You'll definitely Enjoy

"5","/10","Godzilla: King of the Monsters attempts to crush its tedious plot with gorgeous visualised kaiju battles.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4903492/?ref_=tt_urv","TheMovieDiorama","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur67902729/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2019","This one hurts. Godzilla. Mothra. Rodan. King Ghidorah. They all deserved a better sequel. The underappreciated 'Godzilla' that started this ""MonsterVerse"" was the beginning of something brilliant. 'Kong: Skull Island' delivered enjoyable results, which ultimately left this third instalment needing to decimate the competition. Beautiful trailers, consistent marketing and the inner hope for relentless colossal battles somewhat built up expectations for many (including myself!). This was the blockbuster to win the summer season. Alas, sadly, it just was not meant to be. Godzilla went thermonuclear and still was unable to eradicate the terrible pacing of Dougherty's directing/writing. With Monarch nearly shut down by governmental organisations, the awakening of the ""false king"" Ghidorah means that humanity must now rely on Godzilla to protect the world and restore balance.The primary issues that most critics were harking on about, are the underdeveloped plot strands and focus on paper-thin human characters. Unfortunately, they are right to criticise these. Dougherty seemingly focuses all his intentions on this family drama in an attempt to convey it as a microcosm for the destruction it causes. The exploration into humanity's possible extinction and environmental impact, whilst explained heavy-handedly in one infuriating scene of exposition (don't worry, there's plenty of that...), actually had some foundations. The groundwork was solid. Yet the characters Dougherty chose to illustrate were borderline lifeless, and regretfully they take centre stage over the titans. We have a mother, father and daughter. They are splintered as a family after the loss of their son. But for some reason they now involve themselves to try and save the world from these titans that are now released because of one terribly stupid character decision. For the majority of the film's runtime, we follow the father played monotonously by Chandler. He is boring, and whispers nearly every line of dialogue. Farmiga portrays the mother, again, one-dimensional. Brown plays the daughter, but unfortunately does not get enough time to showcase her emerging talent.Dougherty's dull screenplay is the culprit here, and I wished Godzilla would've just used his atomic breath and made his own film. He obtained a stellar cast! Whitford, Dance, Watanabe and my girl Ziyi. Yet instantly made them all forgettable by hammering this unintelligent plot down our throats. He attempts to create some emotion and, until the last twenty minutes, failed to convey any. Heck, Mothra had a more tragic backstory than any of the human characters put together. Long live the queen, I say! The worst offence was the treatment of Hawkins' character. What even was that? Clearly she wanted to jump ship but come on. No emotional resonance whatsoever.Sporadically, the titans come to play. That is when the film truly shines. Sher's cinematography is pushed into the forefront and realising some absolute stunning shots. Whether it be Mothra fluttering its majestic wings or King Ghidorah electrifying the skies with its enormous power surges. The impeccable balance between showing everything, and revealing nothing was sublime. Murky environments often shroud the titans, allowing ingenious use of shadows and lighting to depict these gargantuan battles. The visual effects for the creatures, as well as their primary designs, were nearly faultless. Occasionally the CGI comes across as plastic-looking when in full brightness, particularly Ghidorah's heads, but for the most part look exceptional when in mid-flight. The sound effects though? Damn. My ears were assaulted with breathtaking roars, destructive carnage and McCreary's often splendid score. My seat shook, along with my heart, whenever Godzilla unleashed his epic roar. That's what I want to feel when watching a kaiju film, the deep impact and sudden rush of adrenaline whenever these beasts fight each other. The entire third act was perfect, heck, I would go as far as saying it's the best third act of the year ('Endgame' lovers come at me!).Aside from the various scenes of titanic chaos, there was one notable scene that stuck with me. The moment when Watanabe discovers Godzilla's ancient temple and walks through it in a bid to save humanity. It was truly a work of art in a mainstream blockbuster. No dialogue. Just pure technical bliss that illustrates the talent these artists have. Surprisingly, a poignant moment in the film too. As soon as this scene begins, the film is excels at being a ""MonsterVerse"" chapter. Everything else before it? No thank you. Godzilla may not be ""King of the MonsterVerse"", but it just about redeems itself enough to make me want to watch the next instalment. How the heck Kong will battle Godzilla is beyond me. Steroids, perhaps?","3 out of 8 found this helpful."

"9","/10","A great monster movie (extremely minor spoiler).","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4904362/?ref_=tt_urv","capcanuk","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5636126/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2019","Let's start with some simple ground rules:
1) if you don't like monster movies, do NOT go see this film. You won't like it. It's... a monster movie.
2) if you're looking for subtle drama, interpersonal relationships, depth and realism worthy of an Oscar, do NOT go see this movie. it's not that kind of film, it's a MONSTER MOVIE.
3) If you're a pretentious snob who only likes slow-burn foreign, subtitled films, well, I think you can fill in the rest of what I was going to write.On to the review (I will attempt not to have any spoilers):Despite what some others, who gave the film low ratings, wrote, the performances are solid all the way through. I would even say that they are better than Samuel L. Jackson's scene-chewing in Kong: Skull Island (gotta admit, however, that he was a great ""villain"" in that movie).Storywise, this is very much like all the TOHO Gojira films, in the sense that the stories tend to be a bit convoluted. You go into a Godzilla movie expecting a certain degree of ""cheese"" in the whole affair. But the American versions don't quite go as far with it, which is a nice change of pace. They treat the material with a bit more respect than expected.For those who complained about the paucity of Godzilla in the 2014 film (it actually had more Godzilla screen-time than the 1954 original version), well, this film makes up for it with LOTS of monster time on screen.
It also really helps that these are four of the most iconic monsters from this particular monsterverse.Effects: Both a pro and a con for me. The effects were absolutely breathtaking for the most part. Yes, Mothra is absolutely awe-inspiring. Ghidora is amazingly well rendered. Godzilla is perfect. But for some odd reason, Rodan (by the way, always my favourite monster from the TOHO collection) is less convincing. I don't know what exactly it was about him, but he had that ""man in a rubber suit"" look despite being entirely CGI.Another minor complain has to do with the way the monsters were filmed. Where the 2014 film succeeded like no other by really leaving us with a sense of the MASS of these monsters, In G:KotM there were too many parallel shots, scenes filmed from ""monster head level"" which had the disadvantage of drawing the viewer away from the scale of the monsters. You really had less of a sense of the massive sizes involved because you were too close to them, too removed from a human-scale point of view. At least, it felt this way to me. Not every scene, most were perfect, but a few, and unfortunately, most were in the climactic final battle sequence.Very, very minor spoiler here: two major characters die (it's a monster movie, SOMEONE has to die, right?), and my only complaint is that not enough time was given to the audience to really ingest the impact of those two moments. Had the film tacked on an extra 10-15 minutes, and allowed us a bit more time to ""feel"", at least to me, it would have been better.Bear McCreary's score to the film was fun, and included references to musical themes from a few of the original TOHO movies (Mothra's theme in particular, which has a very emotional impact). And of course, the original Godzilla theme which has tremendous impact and raises the excitement level. It's not as original a score as that for the 2014 film (which SHOULD have been one of the ""Best Score"" Oscar contenders), but I was very impressed that McCreary was able to pull off such a huge, symphonic, and EFFECTIVE score for the film.I saw the film on an IMAX screen, no 3D. And I was blown away. It is definitely meant to be seen on a huge screen.
Somehow, I suspect that the 3D element is probably superfluous, so I would not say ""you have to see it in 3D"".This is a fun film, a huge, loud, exciting film. And for fans of the original TOHO movies, it's loaded with winks and nods and allusions. There's even a major plot point from the 1954 Gojira that becomes an integral part of the action in this film.It's beautifully shot, a BIT on the dark side (and those who complained that the film was too dark MAY have the 3D to blame for that), and the colour palette is a tiny bit too restricted for my taste, but well worth watching anyways, and eventually a definite addition to my Bluray collection.","6 out of 9 found this helpful."

Godzilla King of The Monsters has many references to the excellent film from Toho studios such as music by Akira Ifukube that has been updated by Bear Mccreary and classic Toho kaiju such as Ghidorah, Rodan and Mothra while Mike Dougherty brings a few more surprises as well.
The excellent cast has Ken Watanabe, Bera Farmiga, Bobbie Brown and others. All telling a story about family, consequences and nature while facing a dangerous new foe played by Charles Dance and the monstrous Ghidorah.","6 out of 9 found this helpful."

There isn't much nuance, it basically states its intentions and meaning in the movie itself. But, that isn't the point.
It's a movie made as a love letter for Godzilla fans. A celebration of 65 years of Godzilla.The people giving this movie any less than 5 don't get the appeal of monster movies, this isn't for everyone. We realize it's niche. But the movie wears its heart on its sleeves. It doesn't try to subvert your expectations, it goes in all out, no holds barred, a massive thrill ride, one of the better movies this year, and by far the best Blockbuster in the past 5 years.What it lacks for in substance it makes up with in entertainment. You get what you pay for with this movie. It's a Giant Monster Brawl movie featuring the four biggest monster names in history. If that doesn't tickle your fancy, you're free to go watch something else. But don't force yourself to watch something you won't enjoy just so you can hate on it like the other reviews on this site.If you DO see this, give it at least 3 viewings. It does get better each time you watch it, once you have time to settle your expectations. It's a thrilling Creature feature that feels like it clawed its way out of the 60s Godzilla movies.But, for the love of all things holy, don't watch this if you have no interest in Monster movies. There's no reason to rate this movie any lower than 5 if you're a critic.My review scores are as follows.
10. Masterpiece
9. Epic
8. Great
7. Above Average
6. Slightly Above Average
5. Average
4. Slightly Below Average
3. Below Average
2. Bad
1. AwfulAbove all, this was an epic movie, it doesn't try to be anything other than a movie where monsters fight and humans are just there to move the plot along, and provide theme and context for the movie. A solid entry in the 35+ movie strong Godzilla franchise and one that will stand the test of time, becoming a cult favorite that most will hate until they mature. I see no reason to give it a lower score, as it was exactly what I was hoping for and expecting. Anything I could think of amount to Nitpicks, and do not warrant lowering of the score.","6 out of 9 found this helpful."

However, the peripheral characters often acted too stupid for their job description. Films often cover scientific literacy too tightly, but in this movie there were some things that should have been cut during post-production. Lookout for a few key moments in the film! Secondly, enough with the Hollywood love story entangled in it. Godzilla and the rest of the Titans are the stars, no one watching this wants to star at the chick from Stranger Things almost cry (and then finally scream) for the length of the film. It's super dumb. I'm rating it a 9, but that's being generous cause I'm a big time fan.","6 out of 9 found this helpful."

It wasn't a good idea for dinosaurs in Jurassic Park and guess what, it's not a good idea in this film.I watched the movie primarily because Bradley Whitford was in it. I really like his acting work in past projects but he is terrible in this film.

There performances are OK, specially good from our favorite Stranger Things and Game of Thrones characters.
But that's all you'll get. Story makes no sense. You never truly understand how the ORCA machine works. The kid suddenly becomes an instant expert on Titan genetics and mechanical engineering. And titans are... Aliens???
The previous Godzilla movie was a action-comedy which made it bearable. They tried to makes this film and action-drama and it killed it.
There was 6 of us in the movie theater and 2 fell asleep.

It's a huge improvement on the first one which I thought was just average. There's a lot more action and different monsters which was very entertaining. It has a good story, wasn't too much like some films are.
As well as the big action set pieces it has a very good lead cast and supporting cast. It's over 2 hours long but didn't feel like it, there were no times where the story dragged, it was just right.
It's refreshing to see a blockbuster film that's not superheroes all the time. Godzilla is the new superhero and if watching giant movies on the big screen is your thing then I highly recommend this film.","6 out of 9 found this helpful."

After about 20 minutes I wished they'd stuck with the tried and tested formula.The human characters with the exception of Tanaka are possibly the most dull I've ever experienced on film. This film managed to make Charles Dance dull, that in itself is impressive. With absurdly backwards character motivations, a star lead in Millie Bobby Brown who doesn't actually achieve much and an irritating and downright cringeworthy science group, King of The Monsters becomes a film in which you endure the people for the fights. The first of which is mediocre, and wasn't substantial enough to serve Ghidorah a decent enough reveal as the epic being that he is.
The other two are visually astounding. They are the usual screaming screeching slobberknocker that we expected but will always enjoy. Unfortunately KOTM is let down wholly by the human contingent and should have focused far less on a strange family subplot and more on the big beasties fighting.","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

They espcially have no clue what Mothra is about and missed the 11 appearances over the 65 years, espcially missing the Toho films of the 90's only release in Japan. DO YOUR GODZILLA KAIJU RESEARCH BEFORE GOING TO SEE THE FILM AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE REASON WHY MOTHRA, RODAN, GHIDORAH, AND GODZILLA are of massive significance culturally, spiritually, emotionally, and what they represent socio politcally. From Day One Godzilla has been the creation as a statement against the atom bomb, and moving foward he became a statement against nuclear waste, air polution, polution of the ocean, etc. and how what we as humans do to this planet to destroy it. If such creatures existed today, they SHOULD reclaim the planet because we've doomed it. Mothra IS a spirutal being, Rodan at one point was a serogate to a Mothra egg. Ghidorah was originally a space creature that became a protector when Godzilla was 'off'. To say that this film ""fails"" at it's own canon which IS a blend of antcient beliefs of our being responsible for (mother) earth with the political statement about what we've done to harm it and how it tears us apart as a race is idiotic. It NAILS this, finally, in a US film SOLELY BECAUSE THE FILMMAKERS FINALLY CONSULTED TOHO. These characters were created between 1954 and 1961 with Ghidorah showing up in 1964. If you don't know your Godzilla and Kaiji canon don't go see the film until you do your homework. Walking into Godzilla King of the Monster 2019 with nothing in your pocket other than Godzilla 2014 is the same as try to watch Avengers: Infinity War and Avenger: Engame but having seen NONE of the 10 years worth of MCU films to lock in an emotional and intellectual investment. (It's also why people keep commenting on all the things Captain American would or could have seen or done after he stayed in the 40s - TIME DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY, he's on a new world line). Start with watching Rodan's solo film, then Gojira 1954, Godzlla vs Mothra (aka The Thing) 1961, Ghidora's two back to back films, etc. Or, shut up.","7 out of 11 found this helpful."

Not because I expected it to be a beautifully written, heartfelt story with fully-developed characters who I would immensely care about. I was incredibly excited because it's freaking Godzilla and from the few images that I had seen, it looked absolutely stunning. I didn't need an Oscar-worthy screenplay or amazing performances. I just wanted a decent and logical (this last word is important) narrative with reasonable characters, and tons of monsters fighting to the death against each other. So, my expectations were neither complex or as high as some other people might have.Unfortunately, I left the theater extremely disappointed. I can't deny the impeccable VFX and the infinite amount of wallpaper-worthy images spread across the entire film. Some scenes are filled with jaw-dropping cinematography, astonishingly gorgeous monsters, and the fights feel so real that the sound design alone takes you to the edge of your seat. However, when the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are so far away from even remotely working, there are no technically perfect aspects that can save the film from a disaster. I wrote this exact last sentence a few weeks ago regarding Game Of Thrones, and I will stand by it. I'm always the first guy to praise exceptional filmmaking skills, but if I have to choose between a technically seamless movie, and a film with a fantastic story and fully-developed characters, I have no doubts that the latter is the indisputably right choice.Ultimately, that's the huge problem here. The screenplay is loaded with some of the laziest exposition scenes I've seen in the last few years. Characters continuously have some sort of presentation to explain something in a completely unpredictable conversation randomly. Generally, a movie like this always has some kind of cliche secondary characters who are either a nerdy scientist, a comic-relief guy, a duo of bantering personalities or a military general who always wants to attack something, even though everyone knows it's not the most intelligent decision. King of the Monsters has all of these types and more! More?! Seriously, Michael Dougherty and Zach Shields overstuff the narrative with so many unnecessary, useless, stereotypical characters who stretch the overall runtime and extend the periods between the massive fights, turning them into minutes of complete boredom.I yawned during a Godzilla blockbuster. Yawned. How sad is that?! I really enjoyed Gareth Edwards' 2014's Godzilla. At the time, the most common complaint was that there wasn't enough Godzilla in it. Most of the characters were well-written, despite that some could have been more fleshed out. King of the Monsters is (kind of) the other way around: there are dozens of monsters and bone-crushing, titanic fights, but they literally forgot to write a captivating story with compelling characters. In the first installment, even though I also wanted more Godzilla, when he actually shows up, I was so freaking excited! Since I had to wait for the third act to watch the Titans fight, the build-up that was generated and its payoff actually made the time spent with the human characters worthy.This sequel was doomed from the moment the characters were written. There are a lot of fight sequences, and I wrote above that unnecessary characters extend the periods between these scenes. The dilemma is that those periods need to exist, making the whole thing look like a double-edged sword that the director is trying to avoid. On one hand, you can't have an action set piece after another action set piece consecutively, otherwise, these will lose impact over time and become monotonous, so you need to spend time with the horribly-written human characters. On the other hand, you can't have dumb characters with unclear motivations on-screen for long periods, otherwise, the audience will fall asleep of tediousness or get annoyed, so you have to insert a massive fight sequence again, hence making the audience gradually lose interest in those scenes.King of the Monsters continuously repeats this cycle of going from one situation to the other. No one wants to have back-to-back fights because they'll lose the impactful energy, but no one wants to waste their precious time listening to exposition-heavy PowerPoint presentations from characters no one is going to remember their name. I can't even remember the main characters' names, and I watched the movie yesterday! I can't blame the cast, everyone gives good performances. Millie Bobby Brown (Madison Russell) continues her path to become one of Hollywood's biggest stars (in less than 10 years, she'll have an Oscar in her hands, I guarantee you that). Kyle Chandler (Mark Russell) does more than what was expected of him with such a lousy script, and Ken Watanabe (Dr. Ishiro Serizawa) is the only one who delivered a solid performance AND had a suitable character (fruit of the previous film). Vera Farmiga (Dr. Emma Russell) is connected to the worst character of the movie (atrociously irrational decisions made by Emma), and everyone else is pretty much one of the vast cliche secondary characters.They had five years to write a straightforward narrative with simple characters. No fan neither wanted or needed a brilliant, groundbreaking screenplay. Dougherty and Shields delivered one of the worst scripts of the year, one filled with exposition, cliche characters, and a runtime that turned out to be way too long for someone to tolerate all of the dreadful dialogue. I don't know if it will clearly end up as one of the worst films of 2019, but it's definitely one of the biggest letdowns. All in all, Godzilla: King of the Monsters didn't meet my expectations (and mine were pretty fair), not even close. Visually, it's one of the most striking movies I've seen this year, and that can't be dismissed. From the massive fights with the Titans to the impressive wide shots, Dougherty had a gorgeous diamond that he just needed to polish with a rational and simplistic story, like it was a soft, clean cloth. Instead, he used a hammer...","4 out of 14 found this helpful."

Poorly directed by Michael Dougherty and co-written by Zach Shields and the director, making him a double threat of banality. Their screenplay's sole purpose is to bring together clashes between Mothra, Rodan, Ghidorah, and the king of all these titan monsters, our heavy footed friend, Godzilla. The resulting movie makes absolutely no sense and is unintentionally laughable.The film stars Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Bradley Whitford, and Sally Hawkins, all of which should have known better. Charles Dance plays a evil mercenary and Ken Watanabe is the stoic scientist who will predictably become the martyr for mankind. This film will go down in the annals of Who's Who of Worst Film Performances. It's claim to fame just may be that it contains these talented actors poorest performances ever assembled in one movie, which may be the only accomplishment that this film can claim. Millie Bobby Brown makes her film debut and somehow survives this mess.The CGI is sub-par and the battle sequences are blurry and hard to see. The dialog consists of lots of running away from explosions while looking agape and shouting obscenities. Lacking no thrills or suspense, Godzilla, King of the Monsters is a big budget dud.This is the 35th film in the Godzilla franchise, and hopefully, the last. It is easily one of the worst films in this (or any) year. Avoid this void.","3 out of 10 found this helpful."

I thought about the origins of the Gozilla story. Why did the Japanese create this creature whose size was beyond any previously imagined? Two things came to mind. Firstly, I thought that the Japanese experience with earthquakes and tsunamis was the core inspiration. Secondly, the atomic bombs dropped on Japan caused a never before seen level of instantaneous destruction of human life and human endeavour. I like to think that I 'felt' this inspiration during the watching of this film. It is just big, big, big, and more biggerer.","7 out of 11 found this helpful."

A human organization awakens multiple other monsters after learning of Godzilla's existence, including the evil Ghirodah. As such, they seek the help of Godzilla to save mankind and Earth.I was cautiously optimistic about this film, especially after viewing the trailers, as I believe that there could be some elements in the film that could go very wrong. Now that I've seen it, I was right to go in cautiously.Let's start out with the good. The best parts of the movie are when it focuses on the monsters, specifically Godzilla. They give the audience a sense of mystery, as we generally have no idea where they come from. Unlike the 2014 Godzilla, the focus on them felt very minimal, heck we barely see Godzilla in that movie until the third act. That changes in this one where the focus is almost universally on them. The titular character, even, has significantly more screentime here than its predecessor, which I am super happy about. I also heavily enjoyed the combat sequences between the monsters. They're some of my favorite parts of the movie, as it's where the visual artists shine. We see consistent head-to-head action against Ghirodah, with Godzilla himself, Mothra and Rhodan, and it can get pretty interesting to see what the artists can do with the effects depending on locations. For example, there's a battle between Ghirodah and Godzilla in a snowy landscape. Rhodan and Ghirodah battle close to a civilized island, and they can get very creative depending on the locations.Despite my praise, I have my fair share of problems with the film. First of all, I found the new characters unforgivably bland and even generic. The film presents a family who is going through disagreements regarding the monsters. I really felt like their motivations for their arguments were either not very clear or didn't make sense, which made their sideplot feel unengaging. The human villain is generic and very forgettable, the list goes on. I couldn't engage myself in the human drama and struggles because the human characters were so forgettable this time around. I was hoping for more in the characters because I honestly found the human drama in 2014's Godzilla pretty engaging. The only character I could be engaged in and feel for would be Ken Watanabe's, mainly because he was well-developed, and the audience was already familiar with him.There's also this strange inclusion of environmental themes that felt incredibly out-of-place. There is a scene that discusses some human impacts on the environment and put them into the context of the film, and it comes straight out of nowhere. I have no idea why this movie tried to bring in an environmental message, mainly because I've rarely seen it work, and it doesn't work when it is, in the end, contradicted.I have quite a few other problems with the movie, but it saves itself from disaster with the action scenes and focus on the monsters. If you're willing to ignore the narrative flaws presented here, I think you'll have a great time watching this. For me anyway, I expected more from the story because I thought that its predecessor's story was well told despite being a popcorn flick.5/10","2 out of 6 found this helpful."

Even though this may be enough for most viewers, the film struggles to pull together an actual story, and lacks any true emotional impact to make us care about any characters other than at most the CGI giants themselves. No performances stick out, and every one is almost certainly forgettable. The only one who really seems to provide anything significant, and reprising his role from the last film, is Ken Watanabe who provides the franchise with the fun although repetitive and pointless lines that make the films more enjoyable. Along with other story elements, the film also struggles with pacing and is very predictable, but to be fair, it becomes less so as it goes on (at least somewhat). With all its flaws however, the film does manage to give the audience and mainly viewers in general what they want, and that is to see more of the title star himself in action and on screen. Unlike the previous Godzilla, the film manages to balance the monsters and the stars very well, even with a lack of a true narrative. Godzilla does often prove to be entertaining, if not even interesting to see where these Titans will take us next, and though it may prove to have serious flaws that truly hurt it from being the best it can be, there truly hasn't been an experience quite like this on the big screen in a while.

Bad dialog, inconsistencies in the plot, very bad drama/ tragic scenes.These elements don't necessarily make a bad movie, but when the greater part of the 2h11min you spend in the cinema, consists of bad acting, bad plot, mostly cause by a generally bad script. No amount of monster fighting can make up for it.I know this is short and I having a hard time describing how bad this movie is but maybe this will give an idea of how I feel: If you gave Uwe Boll the same budget... he could have made a movie that was just as BAD or maybe he could even make a movie that was better than this.Maybe this movie would have been better if it were shorter, and most human scenes were removed. Guess we will never know.And just as side note the 2014 Godzilla wasn't good but it was much better than this","2 out of 6 found this helpful."

I found it to be unworthy of the title, focusing on two other terrible monsters while a block of wood runs around. This still suffers from some of its predecessors flaws, but it does make a good step in the right direction.
The characters aren't great. At least most of them. There are two main actors that nailed their roles, a bunch that are entirely unnecessary, and two who never really lived up to their potential. The good are Dr. Chen (Ziyi Zhang) and Dr Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), they both knocked their roles out of the park as Monarch scientists. They fit the plot well, providing much of the exposition and doing so in a way that is believable. In this world of giant monsters and a hollow earth, which is a bit more loaded than they seem to realize, I feel I can trust they know more than me.
Now that they are out of the way, every other person on their team is utter garbage and had no business in the film. This goes especially true for Dr Stanton (Bradley Whitford) and Same Coleman (Thomas Middleditch) who play the exact same role. They are the ""comic relief,"" a phrase I must put in quotes as they are successful at neither of those two words. They never have anything intelligent to add other than to throw out hamfisted lines and be awkward. And to make matters worse, this movie doesn't need such a character. Watanabe and Zhang could have carried this movie even further without their dead weight.
And then there was the unfulfilling characters. The Russel family weren't bad per say, they played their parts well enough but the story didn't feel like it followed through. Emma (Vera Farmiga) played the unenthusiastic villain well and made her daughter's plight more sympathetic. She is ideologically driven but not so lost as to not see the results of what she has done and feel ashamed so you can still empathize for her. Mark (Kyle Chandler) was equally capable as the movie's protagonist. We are learning along side him but he doesn't come across as useless baggage because he provides vital, unorthodox reasoning to any situation. But there should be some emotional weight in Godzilla movies. A character that commits a sacrifice or whose passing should be an emotional low blow, like Daisuke Serizawa's death in the original movie. They try but fail, instead relying on tired Hollywood tropes instead of doing something better with these characters.
Godzilla still needs a slimfast but the main four monsters look great. Mothra is made to look a bit more capable and Rodan, well he never really looked great, but then there is King Ghidorah. He looks like the baddest mother to ever walk the planet. Creating thunderstorms where he stands, hurricanes where he flies, he is a living natural disaster and the greatest threat to everything since Chernobyll. But its even little things about him that make him better, he has personality. Things like the way he glares at people or how his middle head is always picking fights with his left head makes it look like there is much more going on in his head than half the scientists. He is a credit to the special effects team, if only the director had the wherewithal to know where to point the camera in the climactic fight scene. But these are the Japanese monsters, the American originals don't fair all that well. A muto comes back, a spider, a woolly mammoth gorilla hybrid, they don't look so great and probably would have been better off left on the cutting room floor.
In all, I have hope for Godzilla vs King Kong. Maybe they are just needing to make baby steps but the groundwork is there. They just need to know how to swing the bat a little better to knock it out of the park.","7 out of 11 found this helpful."

The most irritating is the daughter and mother. Their relationship during the film´s course changing from good to dead and back to good for NO LOGICAL REASON. in short - vera famiga (this actress is very bad and annoying) are 500% sure what is she doing just only for the most cliche turn over phrase ""i must fix what i´ve caused"" ... daughter (that girl from stranger things i guess is as well annoying and irritating) tells her ""youre the monster"" but in less then hour he loves her as precious mommy again with no explanation.
Film has MANY strange things , i will not bother to name them, just maybe two - 1) dr. serizawa under water can breath ? taking off helmet and suddenly things like PRESSURE or BREATHING dont exist. 2) everybody is talking about godzilla´s growing radiation but people happily run around the monster ? no suits, no protection.. get it ..
Jeez i know hollywood screenwriters are trash and pretty dumb but its sad when audience is buying it..

The action and music are also a really nice touch to this film. The fights were awesome and the music put into the movie makes it feel exciting and tense. The one of the complaints I have with this movie though is that the humans could have been developed a little more. Like I understood the mothers plan but the way she was doing it was just mad. The father was underdeveloped and the daughter was just in situations she should have not survived in. And don't get me wrong I love Millie Bobby Brown and all the actors who gave decent performances in this movie. Although I really liked that one scene with Ken Wannabe, that scene was really great.Overall, Godzilla King of the Monsters is a stunning monsters movie complete with great action and musical scores, but the humans could have more developed and fleshed out.

Kong Skull Island was a masterpiece compared to this disaster. I liked Kong very much and am not averse to seeing monster movies. The plot in Godzilla KOTM is what really really stinks. It starts out seeming interesting but within 30 minutes you just start thinking do I turn this off or hang in there to see where it goes? I finished the movie but only because I was curious as to how much dumber it could get. It got a lot dumber. What a waste of time. This movie was so bad that I don't think I will watch Kong vs Godzilla. The only bright spot in the movie were a handful of good actors doing the best they could with a garbage script.

With the addition of also introducing Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah into an American production for the first time, the movie took notes about what they did wrong with the first movie and corrected 75% of it this time around. This time the movie emphasizes on more of the monster action and less of the character drama, which is honestly what you pay to go see from one of these films. The human characters do a good job and is a step up from the previous family intorduced in 2014's installment. However one of the highlights of the film is King Ghidorah, who's fearsome presence rectified the shallow idea of a planet dominator and cranked it up to 11. A nice new addition to the character involves the concept of each head acting independently, which comes off like brothers fighting amongst one another. Despite critical reception, the movie is wildly astounding and never ceases to skip a beat, especially once the monsters start to rumble (which is surprisingly quick). This is the American film I would have wanted back in 1998 when sour stone Roland Emmerich decided to try his hand at a franchise he had a distain for. All in all, Godzilla King of the Monsters is not worth any G Fan passing up. Just a good old fashioned monster rumble. 2014 did it's job setting up the world, this one did it's job by continuing it with a fun blowout of a film.","12 out of 22 found this helpful."

Building on feedback from the previous installment, director Michael Dougherty delivers a spectacular love letter to the entire 65 year old (as of this year) franchise. It is exciting, it is beautiful, tragic, grand, an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish.We start off in real-time 2019. In the years following Godzilla's battle which leveled San Francisco, the world is divided over the knowledge that more of these so called titans exist and that the organization""MONARCH"" desires to protect them despite the destruction they may cause. Amidst this chaotic backdrop, a MONARCH facility in China is raided by an eco terrorist cell who kidnaps scientist Emma Russell along with her daughter Madison, so as to use her invention called the ""orca""; a machine that is able to record and mimic the titans bioacoustics signals which they use to communicate with each other. Led by the enigmatic renegade Alan Jonah, the eco terrorists plan to use the orca to awaken the hibernating titans in hope that they will restore the earth to its former glory. But there is more to this plot than meets the eye. Meanwhile, MONARCH engages the help of Doctor Mark Russell, Emma's estranged husband, and co-inventor of the orca, to try and locate the stolen device, his kidnapped ex-wife and child.If it starts to sound like a human focused ""angry dad rescuing family"" kind of movie, rest assured it is not. Our giant monsters, the titans, they are not just the backdrop, they feature front and centre from the get go. The prize target of the terrorists plot is to awaken ""Ghidorah"", a three headed dragon who had been the basis of legends like the hydra. They hope for Ghidorah to establish dominance over the other titans and control them. Unfortunately, Ghidorah himself has other plans. With seemingly alien abilities and power beyond measure, the only titan that might stand a chance against the multi headed monstrosity, is Godzilla.From the very first on screen appearance of Mothra, to Ghidorah, to the bird-like Rodan, and of course Godzilla, the whole movie goes full throttle with its plot. There is never a dull moment as we follow Mark and the MONARCH scientists led by Dr Serizawa across the globe trying to prevent an end-of-the-world scenario. You could say that it moves so fast that there is hardly any breathing room. Plot developments and characters development happen simultaneously and it's easily to get lost in the details if you do not pay attention.At our story's core is a tale of a broken individuals dealing with loss at the expense of a loved one. The Russells were victims of the San Francisco Godzilla battle. Their loss drove Mark to drink and become abusive leading to his divorce with Emma who in turn buried herself into her work, all while Madison suffered the fallout. In their journey towards making peace with the past, we see two hurt and bitter individuals choose to put aside their differences for the sake of their child and the world. It is a simple plot thread but with a heartwarming message about family.The cast play their roles perfectly; especially Kyle Chandler as Mark Russell and Serizawa played by veteran actor Ken Watanabe. The latter's role in the story becomes even more poignant if you watch the first movie and read both prequel comics ""Godzilla Awakening"" and ""Godzilla Aftershock"", knowing more about his history and a his connection to both Godzilla and nuclear weapons.However, the ones I found the most memorable were the G-Team led by badass lady Colonel Diane Foster. They are side characters with minimal development but the situations they are called to deal with, suppressing a terrorist attack, evacuating a city, luring an enraged Rodan away from a populated area, they do all that with guts and a strict dedication to their duty. The best part of it all? The human element is sufficient and never overstays it's welcome.Equal focus is given to the star attraction themselves: the giant monsters. All do them, Mothra, Rodan, Ghidorah and Godzilla all feature cool redesigns that pay homage to their original looks while taking it to a whole new level of badass. Moving Pictures Company (MPC) has outdone themselves once again in the CGI department. Special mention goes to the performance capture used for Ghidorah and Godzilla. Their expressions showcase clear human-like emotions and traits. Their body language blending the actor's performance with animalistic like movements. This motion capture is truly the descendant of traditional rubber suit monster performances.And when the titans clash, the visuals and cinematography effectively convey the immense scale of their battles. Thanks to Director Michael Dougherty and cinematographer Lawrence Sher, the movie is spectacularly shot with dark apocalyptic visuals, heightening the surreal spectacle of these massive clashes. We are truly witnessing war among gods!Pulse pounding music by composer Bear McCreary reproduces many of the iconic tunes from past Godzilla movies while giving his own unique spin, with drums and chants, imbuing an almost operatic feel to the movie. This is easily his greatest work to date.From the music to the characters to the monsters themselves, everything! The passion and love of the genre coming from the cast and crew is evident in every minute of this film. It is great for Newcomers to the Godzilla franchise thanks to the simple story, memorable characters, decent actors, and tight script. It's great as a gateway into the Godzilla franchise. For long time fans, there are numerous Easter eggs, references, callbacks, and parallels to past films. See if you can recognise them all. All in all GODZILLA KING OF THE MONSTERS distills everything cool about Godzilla into a single modern movie.","18 out of 36 found this helpful."

First of all,
If you really love monster action movies just ignore those critics crying about this film.
This is a suberb moster action movie only a true fan deserves.
Cinematography, special effects, action scenes, background music everything is out of this world.It is a treat for Godzilla fans.Big moster action needs biggest screens so make sure you watch it in the biggest possible screen, preferably IMAX!!Film's main characters,""the Titans"",are designed so perfectly well! whenever they appear you'll feel intimidated by their jaw dropping sheer size.Make sure you have watched previous two films in this franchise because the Movie is full of ester eggs, references from past and future mosterverse movies,so keep your eyes & ears open.Human characters, their stories are just supplimentary to the main film so you can ignore all the critics whining about it.For me it is 10/10 mostermovie!

She was the biggest and most evil villain imaginable. Yet, the movie tried to present her as a saint/martyr. Shy single highhandedly pushed most of humanity back into middle ages, yet she wasn't punished for it at all. This fact almost completely ruined the movie for me.

It insulted my expectations, my intelligence, and my loyalty to a franchise I've loved for nearly 10 years. This movie may feature four classic monsters from the original Japanese films, but it is not Godzilla. It doesn't have the impact, weight, or spirit of the films that came before. The plot centers around a government strike force of soldiers and top scientists trying to stop an eco-terrorist organization from releasing monsters all around the world to wreak havoc on all civilization. And no, this absolutely ludicrous plot is not where my issues lie. Actually, I liked this kind of direction. It harkens back to the original series, where the sequels immediately became more lighthearted and campy following a dark and moody first installment. Even the constant scenes of human exposition are something I can handle, since the things they have to say are at least interesting. What I take issue with is how it handles elements from the films I grew up with. The monsters are all bland and uninteresting. They don't have the personality or identifiable traits of their Japanese counterparts, leading them to seem more like generic movie monsters. Rodan especially just feels like an afterthought, while Ghidorah and Mothra only have a few brief moments of uniqueness. The film also utilizes some very vital elements of the original films in ways that hold no significance whatsoever, bogging them down to the max in an effort to cram in as much fan service as humanly possible. I found its uses of the Oxygen Destroyer and Burning Godzilla in particular to be very underwhelming. But the average moviegoer wouldn't really notice contrasts with the Japanese films. So how does this one hold up as a movie in its own right? Not very well. Again, most of the human scenes consist of massive barrages of exposition, which lends its way for very little character development. The last film at least had a unique thematic style to make up for this, but since the focus is this time to just make things flashy and simplistic, there's nothing to justify this flaw. Aside from some choice moments, and a very impactful scene centered around the character Dr. Serizawa which I found to be surprisingly poetic, the scenes with these characters are nothing more than excuses to break from the monster action. And while on the subject, I will fully admit that the action scenes are at least a lot of fun. A little clunky sometimes, but enjoyable all the same. The special effects are unbelievably fantastic and the sound design is great (other than the monster roars, which all sound basically the same and REALLY don't help in giving these creatures more of an identity). Though I do have to complain about the overall bland music. The only time anything really stuck out to me is when the original Japanese movie themes were used, and I am very much against them being in this film. I love those tunes, but the music of the last film helped it stand on its own more, while this feels more like mindless fan service. I could go all day about the problems I had with this movie, but I'll just say this: I feel catered to. I feel like someone in a studio watched me enjoy a series of 32 films, and then decided to put random things from said films into this one to gain my approval. And I didn't enjoy this feeling. What I watched in the theater today is what the average person thinks every Godzilla movie is like. This movie has no identity, other than being a pathetic imitation of what came before, and I am insulted to have waited 5 years for this complete waste of a film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

If you went in expecting a series of hardcore monster mashes, then you will have a lot of fun with it. If you are a die hard Godzilla fan like me however, you will get so much more enjoyment out of it. Critics have bashed this movie for not having character development in it, yet they forgot the main characters of the movie are the Monsters. If you have watched literally any Godzilla film you would know that the human protagonists/antagonists were never the spotlight of it. Walking into a Godzilla movie expecting human character development is like walking into a drama and expecting a comedy with well written jokes. It makes no sense. I guess i just wished some critics knew what they were going into before nitpicking things that have no need to exist in a film like this.The movie ain't perfect however. The reason i called this movie a ""popcorn movie"" is because while it is extremely enjoyable (especially if you're a Godzilla fan), it's not really all that special and there's not a whole lot of new things you haven't seen before. The plot is incredibly predictable and the movie played it safe for the most part. But the film didn't need to be masterful or anything, sometimes being simple is the way to go.So overall, i enjoyed King of the Monsters a lot and i personally think it's one of the better films to come out this year so far. I'll gladly buy the blu ray and watch it again and again with a big bowl of buttery popcorn and a drink by my side.","2 out of 2 found this helpful."

The acting is good, with excellent support from Ken Watanabe, Charles Dance, and a surprisingly scene-stealing Bradley Whitford. Whitford steps away from his usual archetype to snark up a character who's half Samuel L. Jackson in Jurassic Park and half ""Johnny"" from 'Airplane!"" Charles Dance plays menace so well, and it's always great to watch him make the audience squirm. I've been a fan since he was ""Numsy"" in ""The Golden Child"".

And with the latest in CGI it gets better each time. Just like PR, there is so much eye-candy to be enjoyed such as the surface detail of the titans and the related choreography of the combatants. I've watched, I believe, nearly every giant monster movie. And given the budgets, era's of production with the available special FX of the times, quite a few are very enjoyable while some are just laughable junk. While this was a great movie, it did suffer a bit from the human drama distractions and plot lines.

I really liked the first one, I admit that there could have been more monster action going on, but on a technical basis it was an awesome movie in my opinion. It had just the right balance of story and action, the acting was great, every appearance of either a MUTO or Godzilla was incredibly thrilling and let's not forget the awesome Hawaii scene. Just a great movie, even the long intro didn't harm it's flow in any way.And now there's ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"".Optically this movie is insane. In a positive way. The CGI is done very well and everything looks incredibly real. But since that's not a big deal anymore, because as soon as there's the budget there's also the CGI, this is all I can say about VFX.Sadly it's a different story when it comes to writing and acting. While the first movie was to be taken seriously (as much as it gets for a monster movie of that kind), this one is just ridiculous. The dialogues are written so bad that it seems like they just copied 90s Power Rangers conversations. It tries to be deep and sad by putting in interpersonal issues, unfortunately they are so weird that you just sit there like ""uhm. what."" And that's really what the dialogues, that try to build a story around the plot, are all about. It goes on with cliche bursting fake heroism, with characters who only have the purpose of throwing in some (un)funny lines once in a while, with kids who are so sophisticated that leading astrophysicists could learn from them, with dying characters that you just don't care about, even though you definitely should, with characters coming to conclusions despite the fact that there's absolutely NO. WAY. they could know that stuff.
Also you see everything coming. There hasn't been one second in which I was wondering about what's coming next. Either because it was just boring and I didn't care, or it was just obvious. The best example was a so-called 'jumpscare', which went so terribly wrong that it's actually kind of embarrassing to think of these people trying to scare the hell out of you in that one second, but you just sit there like ""uhm. what."" again.Let's get to the monster action.
Yes, it is kinda great. Especially the first appearance of King Ghidorah (I went NUTS when I found out that he's going to be part of this movie, I absolutely love him) is just awesome. In fact, it's probably the only actually thrilling scene in the whole movie. The camera, the lighting, the sound effects, it's just all done right. But that formula sadly won't work for the rest of the movie. One scene, in which Rodan appears, could be so intense, especially facing the fact that uninvolved civilians could be in danger - but the way the scene is shot, I, as a viewer, just didn't care at all. I mean it looked great, but besides that there was nothing to care about. Suddenly he was there. And that's it. And that's not even the worst part. There's a bunch of other monsters that are damaging earth in unreal ways, absolutely destroying whole cities. But besides a few scenes in which you see how a few of them ""unleash"" themselves, you don't see anything. They are there, they are damaging stuff, and that's all, and you actually don't even see it.
And one thing pi***d me off in particular: Mothra is supposed to be the queen of monsters - then why is she only an unimportant part of the story?
They tried to put too many kaijus in a movies which is way to short to cover all of them (in a respectful way).In the end 'Godzilla: The King of the Monsters' does not have enough action going on to make your brain shut down, while being written so bad and having a story so stupid that it would require your brain to turn off to actually enjoy the movie. It tries to be full of monsters but it's basically Godzilla vs King Ghidorah in a very Godzilla- and King Ghidorah disliking way. It tries to be smart having a story full of interpersonal problems while just being a cringy failure.
I added one star the VFX artists who really know what they're doing and for Millie Bobby Brown, who indeed is carrying the whole movie on her shoulders and getting as much as possible out of her dumb written role, while everyone around her is failing in the worst way possible way. I was so happy to see the new Godzilla in another movie. Now I'm upset. This is not Godzilla, this is a nightmare.*If there are any spelling- or grammatical mistakes (which I'm sure there are) I'm so sorry! I hope that it's understandable and that my English doesn't suck so much that this review is unreadable. Have a good one and only watch that movie at your own risk.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

The human drama and confused environmental message are also ratcheted up to higher levels of inanity, unfortunately, though. Eco-terrorists whose apparent solution to pollution, climate change and mass extinction is to kill a lot of people. But, gradually, which, oops, doesn't work out.The thing to appreciate is the spectacle, which as in the prior burger is a mix of perspectives: the obscure view of the monsters from the point of view of mankind on the ground and in planes or on ships, the fuller god(zilla)'s eye view above, and reflexive shots of the action through windows or screens--a movie within a movie. The human characters are our on-screen surrogate spectators, and the monsters are abstracted as the monster-as-movie, or the CGI extravaganza that they are. It's all very Transformers-esque, but a bit more interesting for the cinematic self-reference.I noted, too, that Josh Lyman's wacky side character this outing claims to be recording everything, so not only a film-within-film, but filmmaking within it. Meanwhile, the two human sides fight over a computer in order to control the monsters, and that's exactly how these visual effects are really controlled--by computers. I'll be watching to see whether these two threads of meta-narrative become even more integrated when the atomic-bomb of a movie God meets the King captured by colonialist documentary filmmakers in the upcoming ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" (2021).","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

I liked, in general, the 2014 film, and I went to see this film with some interest, believing that finally Godzilla was having a more interesting treatment from the cinema. And I confess that I am not disappointed, as the film is even better than its predecessor in some important points.The film takes the point where the previous one ended and reveals to us the efforts made since then, to create a way of understanding and reproducing the vocalizations of the monsters already awake. It is with this technology that Emma Russell, allied with a group of mercenaries, tries to wake up the sleeping monsters that Monarch monitors. She thinks it will restore a natural balance in the world, perhaps through a massacre. I confess that I found this part of the script somewhat confusing. Against her is ex-husband Mark, who argues that all monsters should simply be killed or left to sleep. It doesn't matter; the fact is that they wake up the only one who should have been left to sleep: the Guidorah hydra, the only one that has the capacity to wake everyone up and control them to slaughter Humanity. It is now up to Godzilla and her fellow humans to contain this threat, even if it means the partial destruction of the world.As in the previous film, there are good and bad things in this story. It's a little hard to believe that creatures like that would spend thousands of years sleeping without being detected by curious humans. On the other hand, the film makes good use of material from classic legends involving monsters (Scylla, Kong, the Loch Ness Monster, Hydra and others). I was not convinced by the supposed alien origins of Hydra, I think it is a little credible detail of the script. There is also a time when everyone seems to stumble over Atlantic civilization, but that is never even mentioned.The cast's work is more enjoyable in this film than in its predecessor. For a start, I felt that there were more possibilities to connect with the characters. This bet made the film gain more interest as we feel more involved in the action and care more about what happens. Godzilla, in this respect, is a character in his own right. Among the human cast I would positively highlight Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga. Both do a good job, even though the character of Farmiga is very difficult to understand and unworthy of our sympathy. Watanabe continues to maintain the good performance that started in the previous film, ending it brilliantly. I don't know if all the merit belongs to the actor or if the screenwriter also reserved better material for the actor, but the truth is that it worked very well. Bradley Whitford, Aisha Hinds, Ziyi Zhang and Sally Hawkins do a good job of support. Millie Bobby Brown is almost left in the film and has little to do but be in danger when the script needs an extra reason for the characters to move faster.The film maintained the good production values of its predecessor. And there is no doubt that there is a lot of money invested. A grandiose and impressive CGI, with scenarios of pure destruction everywhere, the bet on a more luminous environment, which allows the public to better see the destruction of the world and the epic battles that are fought among the human ruins. Now we see better what the first film kept wrapped in dust and shadows. The monstrous creatures also seem to me better worked and realistic. We also have impressive sound and visual effects, good post-production work, with excellent mixing and editing, well-crafted special effects, good sets, costumes and props.Overall, it is a satisfying action and sci-fi film, with a somewhat elaborate story that works well if we don't think about it too much.

You'd say, hey but it's a monster movie what do you expect other than smash smash destruction and battle, I would say great bring on the cinematic display of brilliant clashes of the kings and gods who used to roam this planet in that universe. The problem is that movie dragged on with illogical and embarrassing dialogue like an expert asking ""what do you mean?"" when a character says ""Godzilla is going thermo-nuclear."", or when the male lead naively looks for his daughter in a completely destroyed city expecting her to pop out from under a rock, or the most ridiculous concept of a little girl playing too much of a roll in controlling/communicating with those gigantic beings. Everyone in the movie is completely idiotic and reckless with moments of characters flipping in their ideologies back and forth.Honestly it would've been better off without any humans, just give me a story all about the monsters and their origins and battles for power.

If ""Kaiju"" movies want to start getting Oscar nominations or being more than an obtuse popcorn flick then they need to have better stories.

I went to this flick thinking, ""at least it can't be as bad as Godzilla in 2014,"" and I was totally wrong. It stank even harder than the earlier film, but for the exact same reason: too much focus on the human characters. Any serious fan of kaiju films will tell you that any human interest is always secondary to the awesome spectacle of huge, nonhuman monsters destroying things and each other in horrible, prolonged battles where limbs are ripped off and heads burned to stumps by atomic fire breath.There's a little of that in GKOTM, maybe five minutes total kaiju action, tops. I am NOT exaggerating. The rest was nothing but one hokey, hyped up, would be dramatic scene after another with a bunch of two dimensional characters. I suppose they were doing the best they could with what they had, but the human protagonists, Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga, were positively painful to watch as they loudly attempted to fake parental grief. Charles Dance played the chief human villain, an ""ecological terrorist,"" who suddenly just disappears from the plot toward the end of the film in a glaring continuity gap.The director, Michael Dougherty, also wrote the junk screenplay. He stinks. His direction is typical, current Hollywood shlock, way too long, a loud, throbbing score, constant cross-cutting, and an endless flurry of CGI imagery in a confused, muddy blur of events. This is especially true during the ever so brief battles between Godzilla and King Ghidorah. This was literally the smallest part of the film. I don't know what Michael Dougherty was thinking about when he made this film, but he sure wasn't thinking about me or the legions of other Godzilla fans.GKOTM is an especially punk, lame effort compared to the Japanese film from 2016, Shin Godzilla, a brilliant remaking of the story of Japan's tallest, darkest leading man. Like the first film from 1954 (only with state of the art special effects), Shin Godzilla is a genuinely terrifying experience as the forty story tall monster advances ever onward, grim, implacable, unstoppable, with nothing but death and destruction on his mind. SG is one of the greatest Godzilla movies ever made. The two Hollywood flicks are dreck. Americans are incapable of making a decent Godzilla film. This is a national disgrace. Only the Japanese know how to go about doing it apparently.I have read that both the box office and critical reviews for the film are meh at best and that's completely understandable. For anyone in the movie business reading this, I could do a better Godzilla film than this and what I know about film making you could put in your ear.I recommend this film to absolutely no one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

The story was told via the new fad Transformer-style, that is, get a nice small set of characters, have all hell break loose without rhyme or reason, and just follow the characters. While I struggled with this more towards the beginning I got sucked in as we went along and enjoyed the good acting and also the very good special effects. The Big Guy was looking healthy and King G never more menacing. I thought the 15 year old playing the daughter was very good among several good performances.

Now that was how you do a modern Godzilla film. It had a few silly elements to it but the CGI didn't get too distracting and the tone was very serious and very Japanese. The film was so seeped in satire of Japanese politics that it made the very realistic feeling monster action all the more interesting with everything given respect and weight.With this film, I'm just not sure what the filmmakers were trying to do (well, outside of build up some kind of new Hollywood franchise). The film opens with a lot of promise featuring some fairly fleshed out characters played by some very talented actors (Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga) who seem to take the subject matter very seriously. However, the film stumbles and falters after establishing its main plot as it seems to grow more interested in creating a new monster-verse (much like all the Marvel movies) than focusing on any one monster or any one plot.While there's a couple great scenes of monsters fighting each other and even a brief sequence of Rodan leveling a fictional Mexican city, the narrative gets really goofy really quickly by thrusting our human characters into every match-up in some kind of ridiculous airplane or submersible which the monsters neglect to destroy for some reason. Things become comical once a patterns establishes where every time a monster starts bearing down on the main characters, they get saved by some other monster jumping in at the very last second. Frustratingly, the film never gives us a satisfactory dose of city destruction or battles with the military in favor of these cliche'd close-calls so common in American big-budget blockbusters. It feels more like a Jurassic Park sequel than a proper Godzilla movie.I'd have given it a higher rating, but an abrupt and mishandled character shift toward the end of the film terribly neuters someone who otherwise could have made for a great believable villain. Most egregiously of all though would be the ending, which may be the most unsubtle and on-the-nose finale in history designed only to get teens excited for their future extended universe. Wow, since this film handled things so well, I just can't wait. It's filled with in-jokes only Godzilla fans will get, such as the naming of certain characters and weapons, but all it did was make me miss and appreciate the quaint and original Japanese films that much more.Kudos to the filmmakers for finally bringing Ghidorah and Rodan to mainstream consciousness, but I'll likely be boycotting the rest of these soulless studio wannabe Kaiju films in favor of whatever their Japanese counterparts come up with in the coming years.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Godzilla: King of the Monsters. very much in the genre of Clash of the Titans, we find ourselves watching clash of the monsters. This is very much a film for those who love extreme epic battles fought by the gargantuan. The CGI is something else. Used in most films these days it still has the power to awe. What come from the minds of the writers, directors and producers is brought to life by these keyboard computer magicians. Not the greatest of plots but who needs it when it's visually stimulating.

If you did not like this one you most likely will not like the Godzilla vs King Kong coming out march 13, 2020. I hope they get more licensing from Toho Studios for more of monsters from the past to hopefully continue the MonsterVerse for future movies
and if not I am sure Toho Studios is going to be jumping on the band wagon to make more. For All The Big Godzilla Fans Out There Keep The Positve Reviews Coming So They Will Continue To Make More.","7 out of 12 found this helpful."

The plot is very very naive actually nothing in the movie is good but for the effects. Also the presence of humans and how such great monsters destroying and damaging and at one stupid scene like the ending it's only looking at a person the size of an ant and chasing it not able to get it down. At every Godzilla story you feel the humans presence is only to fill the film like the stupid Kyle Chandler's character and being so much understanding of what's happening and being very expert in a no-expert story.

"9","/10","Fun, Socially Relevant Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5431594/?ref_=tt_urv","Reviews_of_the_Dead","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23318905/?ref_=tt_urv","24 January 2020","Now anyone who knows me and my film tastes knows that I loved Godzilla films growing up. I tended to watch the same ones over and over again, but I ended up seeking all of them out as an adult. I remember seeing the 1998 remake with my father and sister in the theater. I enjoyed the most recent remake and the talk of this universe they were building. When hearing about this film, I had to see it. I thankfully got to see it early as a surprise showing was happening at my theater and then a second viewing of it on DVD. The synopsis is the crypto-zoological agency Monarch faces off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah.This film starts off back in 2014. In San Francisco when Godzilla was on a rampage there. Since then, the organization Monarch has been seeking out the large monsters to keep track of and monitor them. Their goal to keep them from waking up, but the military is considering just exterminating them to prevent the loss of human life. I should point out here that it is an interesting nod to all of the names of monsters that have some kind of monarchy associated with them as well.There is a family that is torn apart. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and his wife Dr. Emma (Vera Farmiga) lose their son in 2014 during the attack. This drives them apart with Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), their daughter, staying with her mother. The two of them are in China monitoring what turns out to be an egg containing the larva of Mothra. Things take a turn when some ecological terrorists attack, freeing Mothra and them taking Emma and Madison.She has created a machine that can stop the monsters with a frequency, but it also can make them angry as well. They use this to free what they are calling Monster Zero, who turns out to be King Ghidorah. This draws Godzilla into battle, but the giant lizard cannot defeat him. The military gets involved and makes things much worse. The terrorist also wake up Rodan from his volcano in Mexico. King Ghidorah wakes up the rest of the known kaijus on the planet, altering the plan of this terrorist group. There is also a secret about the three headed dragon that Dr. Ilene Chen (Ziyi Zhang) thinks she has discovered.Now I wanted to go a bit more vague than usual here. Most of what I recapped is literally within the first 15 minutes of the film. The rest is really at the end of the first act and this really is more about the visuals, than what is happening. That's not to say that we don't get an interesting story surrounding it, at least to me.The first thing I really should talk about is I think a lot of people aren't going to consider this a horror film. I personally don't blame you. I do think that kaiju films are definitely horror adjacent for me. The thought of giant monsters destroying cities and killing all of the people that they do is pretty horrific. Now this film does have some pretty bleak moments, it is no where near as dark as the original Godzilla film was.These films are quite interesting to me, as I think quite a bit of them are fun while they can also be cheesy. This one does have some cheesy lines by some of the characters, especially Dr. Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford) and Chief Warrant Officer Barnes (O'Shea Jackson Jr.). I can really let that slide to be honest. What they really need to do is balance the giant monsters fighting and the humans' story. I think this one does that well.The human story is interesting in this as the reason the terrorist group is doing what they are doing is because humans are ruining the planet and as a race we are pretty much garbage. As bleak as stating this sounds, I am 100% in agreement with this. I really like that aspect, because there is a duality between trying to save us while we destroy the planet or allow natural progression to happen with the monsters doing what they are made to do.Going along this story, I absolutely love the concept of incorporating mythology into the lore of these monsters. There are some really cool images that are used to associate with them that I was a big fan of. As a lover of mythology, this was definitely an aspect that really hit home for me.This film does have some really good fights between the monsters as well. I personally love the realism of how all of these giant creatures look and that really made me happy to see. I will say here that it is definitely CGI heavy, which actually turned out to be just fine for me. It never took me out of it which was surprising. I think that the effects in this film are great to be honest.As I kind of touched on a couple of paragraphs up, the balance of the kaijus and the humans is an interesting balance you need. I think that writer/director Michael Dougherty does an excellent job of that. Now I know him from Trick 'r Treat which was a horror anthology and Krampus, where he had to balance different aspects for each film. I think that experience really shines through. Being this film was just over 2 hours, it didn't feel like and I was on-board the whole way. I still think this is a bit long as there is a stretch late in the second act/beginning of the third that slows down. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it though and I never actually got bored. The ending is even interesting alluding to the next film that is supposed to be coming. There are some things with the story though that are kind of plot-holes, but nothing to completely ruin the movie.Acting for the film I thought was really good as well. There is such an interesting cast with Chandler, Farmiga and Brown as the broken family. They all did great. I was glad to see that they used Ken Watanabe, who is an amazing Japanese actor as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. I thought he was great too. Zhang, Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, Jackson and the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well. I could go on and on here, but I won't.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film. I saw that Bear McCreary did it I was excited. I first saw his name for The Walking Dead. What I really like about this film though, he incorporated music from the original film and other ones in the series while also doing his own thing as well. It really fit and definitely helped enhance the scenes.Now with that said, I might be running off the high of the film, but I really did enjoy it. I liked how they incorporated a solid social message into this film while giving us what we really want. This was brought to life by great acting and writing for sure. There was a bit of cheesiness to it, but I come to expect that. I think the editing of the film keeps the balance, keeps it interesting and the ending was solid. It is CGI heavy, but it looked. The soundtrack of the film was also helped to enhance the scenes as well. I would have liked to know more about some of the monsters that I didn't recognize, but if these films keep having the success I think they will, they definitely could later. I would definitely recommend giving this film a viewing. I thought it was really good.","7 out of 12 found this helpful."

I predict it will be used in film schools as a prime example of how not to make a movie. The ""human"" dialog is reminiscent of Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode I, The Phantom Menace. It's not that there should be humans with a dialog. It's that it shouldn't insult the intelligence of the audience. As with other recent movies in the super-hero realm, the use of CGI is completely over the top. Scene framing is abysmal. Film editing is atrocious in the action scenes, particularly with repeated quick cuts, producing a chaotic, incomprehensible frenzy. Instead of rubber suit monsters beating each other up, it's CGI monsters bashing each other. Welcome to the monster version of the WWE with orchestrated, choreographed fights, in which none of them will ever die, so they can go on to fight again in the next movie, and the next, and the next, and the next one after that. It's an attempt to create a Godzilla Monster Universe patterned after the Marvel Cinematic and DC Extended Universes, the goals of which are mostly CGI characters thrashing each other for two hours, to wash, rinse, and repeat ever year, more often if possible. With the monsters, forget about humans in fancy super-hero suits, just use CGI. Check your brain at the door. It's better if you're brain-dead when watching this human waste landfill fire excuse of a movie. Last, but not least, wear hearing protection if you value your long-term hearing. The damage is a cumulative effect emerging later in life. I'm going to start taking a sound meter to record the sound levels. I'm tired of leaving theaters deafened for several days afterward.","2 out of 7 found this helpful."
"3","/10","A crushing disappointment.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4918942/?ref_=tt_urv","rustonreviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur78526769/?ref_=tt_urv","7 June 2019","In this third instalment in Legendary Pictures' Monsterverse, Michael Dougherty takes over the reins from Gareth Edwards (director of 2014's Godzilla reboot), who departed the project due to creative differences and ongoing scheduling conflicts. Edwards' reboot received a mixed critical consensus upon release, with many film goers criticising Godzilla's lack of screen time. Contrary to the complaints, I thought Godzilla was a brilliant reboot and an otherwise great start to the proposed Monsterverse that continued with the somewhat less brilliant Kong: Skull Island (2017). It appears that Dougherty and co. have listened to the criticisms Edwards' film received, as Godzilla: King of the Monsters is overloaded with heavy, riotous action with no shortage of monsters.It's a crushing disappointment to report that King of the Monsters is an over bloated, extravagant mess from beginning to end, abandoning just about everything that made the previous film so great. King of the Monsters packs a ridiculous, unengaging storyline and an abundance of action sequences that struck me as painfully underwhelming. Not once did I ever feel awestruck by the chaotic battles between the iconic titans, largely due to the ferocious over usage of shaky cam that made it difficult work distinguishing just what was happening onscreen. Many classic characters from the original franchise return, including Mothra, Roden and Ghidorah. Admittedly, they all look fantastic (especially Mothra), and there are some instances of incredibly beautiful cinematography displayed here. Unfortunately, it's only when the often incomprehensible action begins when the majestic titans lose their epic grandeur.Dougherty and Shields screenplay is an absolute mess that lacks a coherent structure. Character motivations are muddled, and the overall storyline is largely convoluted and uninteresting. What's most frustrating is the talent involved. Dougherty has made some really good films in the past, most notably the brilliant horror anthology film Trick R Treat (2007). Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown and Charles Dance are all excellent in other projects, but here it appears as though enthusiasm was falling short. Then again, it wasn't as though anybody had anything truly interesting to work with. As a clear love letter to the original franchise (of which Dougherty is a huge fan), King of the Monsters unfortunately falls flat. Overlong, loud and all over the place, this third instalment in the Monsterverse fails to stick the landing. Hardly awe-inspiring, just disappointing.","2 out of 7 found this helpful."

The monster designs, the visual effects/CGI, and the cinematography warrant praise. The dysfunctional-family dynamic plays out terribly and the major antagonist turns out to be such a generic, one-note baddie.

I loved the 2014 version and it had set things up so nicely for a sequel.
The effects in this effort were OK - certainly CGI-tastic, but the writing, acting (some exceptions) and script were just shockingly bad.
Millie Bobby Brown's character was particularly annoying and the fact that all the grown-ups simply allowed her to be in the position to do all the stupid things she does, just show how divorced they are from reality.
I'm sure the writers wanted to set her up as the hero, but I just wanted bad things to happen to her throughout the movie.
I like her in Stranger Things, but I'm horrified that she's been cast in the upcoming sequel.
I gave the film a generous 3/10 because of the reasonable effects.

I got pretty worried and honestly disappointed when I heard that the reviews were fairly negative, yet then I went to go and see it and I'm simply dumbfounded as to how someone would sit and applaud the marvel movies yet dump on this. Many of the same faults that follow marvel movies are found in here, some poor writing in places, kind of dumb and just generally annoying one-liners, some uninteresting human characters, but as far as I remember the movie's name is Godzilla: King of the Monsters not The Russell's Family Reunion or Dr. Serizawa's Descent into Hell. I mean for Gods sake, critics are praising the social commentary of Endgame because they managed to shoehorn in all the female heros into one scene, yet the fairly clear environmental message portrayed throughout KoTM is considered weak, admittedly it's not done perfectly, but in terms of social commentary in a giant monster movie, nothing will beat the original Gojira, but it seems fairly naive to expect that same level of care in this movie considering they have vastly different reasonings for being created, Gojira being made to speak against the use of nuclear weapons and KoTM being made almost solely for the purpose of entertaining.

The reason why a movie like Dark Knight worked is because they took their time getting to know anyone so by the time something happened to them we had an emotional connection/investment in them. Same goes for other huge blockbusters over the last 50 years, like the Exorcist, Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Superman, Aliens, Terminator, and the list goes on. In fact, you can still make high grossing films that do that, like the Revenant.This is just a joke.The woke cast didn't help. Most Hollywood films these days are cast NOT based in reality but how Hollywood WANTS reality to be. Don't force race and gender in a film that doesn't require or warrants it. Especially since it is never equally applied.We see this cast in pretty much every Hollywood film. The white nerdy computer geek. The ""strong"" white female lead. The precocious teen. The concerned Asian side kick. The strong black female in position of power. And don't forget the Hispanic female co-stars as pilots etc, you know, never a reflection of reality. And of course, the tumultuous relationship between the two leads. which always ends in reconciliation, and last, the ""madman"" who wants to create havoc based on his own political incorrect rhetoric.All lazy and contrived writing. And this formula is repeated over and over and over again.You can SKIP THIS.","4 out of 20 found this helpful."

Dolby Atmosphere experience is the best way to see an action movie and really blows your mind with Godzilla KOM. The story drove along at a nice pace and delves into aspects of the different monsters (Titans). They also connect and lay out ground work for secret organizations. I actually look forward to some human character development in future installments. Many true Godzilla fans will love how they actually develop this Titanverse and connect it to stories and cannon they have grown to cherish. The action and sound is amazing so I really recommend a high end audio choice for home when you buy this. Theatres ATMOS is well worth the ticket $.

This new addition to the Hollywood franchise is devoid of what made Edwards' movie so gripping and atmospheric.King of the monsters feels like a rushed sequel more than anything, as it somehow manages to botch a terrific formula set by Edwards' and comes off as a B-movie attempt to recapture lightning in a bottle as was the case in 2014.What made the first movie so enjoyable was the pacing, and constant atmosphere of dread surrounding the protagonists, the situation felt like it was untenable. The way that the angles played into the illusion of these massive monsters gave the movie its plausibility and helped to solidify the monsters presence even more.In this sequal, the cinematography devolves into cartoon territory with close ups and flying panning shots of the various monsters fighting it out. The realistic, slow and methodical movements of the monsters in the first movie (2014) are completely absent here with monsters moving about like they weigh nothing and as if gravity doesn't apply to them. It takes away the illusion that these creatures are real and massive, in some shots they look more miniature than hulking.The human characters are also overstaying their welcome here, because they are solely put in the movie to dump exposition but do not have the conviction of a masterclass actor like Cranston (2014) to carry the movie's plot.Once the monsters are shown (very early on in the movie), we get bored by their presence. The monster fights as fast and frantic as they may be look cheap and badly cut, so that we rarely get a good wide shot of the action as was the case Edwards' movie.Not even Hawkins and Watanabe who return to reprise their roles can bring enough emotional weight to the table and they are in the end completely wasted here, because the movie doesn't have time for them to mature enough for us ultimately care. Funnily the screen-time they had in the original (2014) was better spent to flesh out their characters more than it is here, even though they seem to have more screen-time this time around.The CGI also seems to have been degraded, looks like the budget could not accommodate the bold vision of this movie. Ultimately there are too many set-pieces and too many badly shot fights which become numbing to the point that they lose any impact.Godzilla (2014) knew how to string events together and build up the tension and then release it with great action set pieces that never overstayed their welcome, this is simply not the case in the case here, and the movie somehow manages to bore more than it entertains which I never would have thought I would say about a big budget Godzilla movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

It's a sad thing that trailers these days give away so much of the story. They should tease us to go watch it, not show half the movie to make us go watch the other half.So there's that. The movie itself? Na-ah. It contains a typical modern-day story with a predictable plot and so many last-second rescues it got boring. After a while I was hoping some main character got ripped apart, just for surprise's sake.
So many times throughout the movie things happened that don't make any sense at all. For example the main male character goes along with Monarch in the beginning of the movie because of the dissapearence of his wife and daughter. Eventually they are found, but he keeps attending these meetings with generals of the United freaking States and nobody wonders what the hell this guy is doing there?? He got some serious VIP-acces along the way it seems. Even harder to believe is that he even gives orders, and tells the colonel what to do or not to do, and nobody wonders who this guy is?
Furthermore it's only slightly hilarious that the ORCA-system (just a high budget soundsystem to communicate with the titans) falls on the ground and a giant 1000-ton heavy monster stands on it, and there's like only a small crack and it sputters a little bit. But hey, the system is completely fine!I'm gonna keep this as short as possible about the rest: lots of noise, lots of flashy lights and explosions (just a bunch of high budget show-off to compensate the lack of story and good acting), no standout perfomance by an actor (even though good actors where on set, with the likes of Charles Dance for example). Overall it is okay to watch it if you manage to turn of your brain for a little over 2 hours.At some point I just started laughing. Not because it was funny, but I was genuinly laughing my ass of about how silly and predictable this movie is. It was either that or crying, and this movie sure as hell doesn't deserve my tears.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

This kind of movie (monsters battling, destroying big cities, epic CGI battles and all) would have flied 10 years ago. People who go to movies nowadays expect more than just CGI thrown up on the big screen. All the characters were pretty inconsequential and suffered from what I call BadDecisionForNoReasonitis. A movie without a properly built plot line that the audience wants to follow just becomes inconsequential no matter what happens. In order for the audience to follow the story, you have to make the characters interesting. This was not the case for any of the leads. In fact, why they thought that a cliche storyline would just suffice on the sidelines of monster battles in beyond me. The CGI was pretty amazing and the battles were pretty epic.

The human side of the plot was biggest downside of the film, but it wasn't terrible, just alright. That being said, nobody who is going to give this movie a genuine chance is watching it for the human side of the story. They want to see the monsters in action in this movie delivers. I've been a giant monster fan since I was a kid and I have yet to see monsters battling with such spectacle and scale.
The film is accompanied by an incredible musical score, that has many similarities to original Godzilla music.
Long time Godzilla fans will be very pleased that there are a plethora of references and Easter eggs for them. For me, that was the cherry on top that made the movie all the better.
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and recommend it to anyone that loves monsters, spectacle, a good musical score, and of course, Godzilla.","6 out of 10 found this helpful."
"8","/10","Not as Godlike as I had hoped, but it is a Monster Step in the Right Direction","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4901680/?ref_=tt_urv","totalovrdose","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52795042/?ref_=tt_urv","31 May 2019","I was not a huge fan of the 2014 Godzilla, and I know there are many who share my thoughts on that - nuff said. I have been a fan of the franchise since I was a child, owning copies of the original 1954 and 1956 films, alongside having collected copies of multiple sequels throughout the years. To top it off, I still own the figurines my parents used to buy me as a child. In short, my expectations for monster movies are set at a high bar. To get the important stuff out of the way first, Godzilla looks amazing! The special effects in this film are incredible; everything from the movement to the sheer immensity of these creatures being impressive, the bombastic theme, not to mention the outstanding sound effects of the creatures themselves, really bringing them to life, and laying the groundwork for the epic confrontations. Unlike the 2014 film, these are, thankfully, not hidden behind television screens; we are thrust into the conflict, sometimes nose to nose with these behemoths, and you can really feel their proximity.The central conflict is, of course, Godzilla, versus the hydra, Ghidorah, who is an especially vicious antagonist. There are some small, yet great interactions between Godzilla and humanity, that show perhaps a softer side to this humongous brute, as he comes to understand the tiny animals he inhabits the world with, the use of facial motion capture being especially wonderful here; these moments are completely lacking with the unsympathetic Ghidorah, that seems hellbent on world domination - typical bad guy - but what a bad guy he is! Rodan is equally impressive, though it is Mothra who is the most beautiful of all - the musical score accompanying her, not to mention the awe on the faces of those who glimpse her, really accentuates her femininity, which brings about a sense of melancholy whenever she is present. The screen time of these two titans is underwhelming at best...as for the other titans that are present - their screen time is woeful at best - they were merely there for slight window dressing, which is disappointing. Addendum; I felt the tension during the confrontations could have been increased to really hit home the incredible danger that Godzilla faces.The feature opens similarly to the events of Dawn of Justice; we see the climatic battle of the previous film, from the perspective of another; a family who have just lost their son during the preceding struggle. Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) appears to have buried herself in her work since the tragedy, and though she is meant to be attached to her surviving daughter, Maddie (Millie Bobby Brown), who is established as an independent young lady with her own ideas, their relationship is not provided significant depth. If anything, Farmiga's character is a walking, talking inciting incident, used to propel the plot forward. Her husband, Mark (Kyle Chandler) is a far more interesting character. He appears passionate and knowledgeable about nature, which becomes quintessential to the narrative, and though he and Farmiga are meant to be kindred spirits on this topic, the film merely tells us her values, but illustrates his. Unlike his wife, he still appears to be genuinely reeling from the loss of his son, this inner conflict making it hard for him to empathise with Dr. Serizawa's (Ken Watanabe) plan to use Godzilla as humanity's last ditch effort for survival, making for an interesting sub-plot.Monarch again makes an appearance, though the image of it as a conglomerate on the verge of a hostile take-over, as the opening would have you believe, is hardly justified by the story. Dr. Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford) and Sam Coleman (Thomas Middledicth) bring some light hearted humour to the film - occasionally these jokes don't land, but it does not detract from their characters, who we do get the chance to see as intelligent professionals. The always lovely Ziyi Zhang, as Dr. Ilene Chen, brings a good dose of wonder about the creatures, being as equally passionate as Dr. Serizawa, though her relationship with doppelganger, Dr. Ling, is never explored. Aisha Hinds, as the colonel of the operation, is continuously calm and collected, making for a believable female protagonist, and even David Strathairn has a cameo, though all of these characters really go to the wayside in contrast with the Russel family. Considering many characters are meant to be scientists, not talking about their areas of study; interests, motivations, and eventual hiring by Monarch, is a wasted opportunity. We are, quintessentially, surrounded by likable strangers for much of the two hour run time.The always entertaining Charles Dance, as Jonah Alan, has a history that is merely glossed over, and though his motivations are revealed, much like his character, they are hardly given significant screen time (and are borderline contradictory). I really wish we could have seen more of him, to get a better understanding of the operation he is launching. By the end of the movie, the place where we leave the humans on is anti-climatic at best - the same, thankfully, cannot be said for the 'monsters'.The movie occasionally suffers from Man of Steel syndrome - we see so much carnage, yet little consideration for the loss of human life. During conflicts involving soldiers, often, protagonists just leave them behind, seemingly unperturbed by their noble sacrifice. The movie also appears to be trying to make an argument about the effects of pollution and the need to save the environment, though considering the number of bombs that go off in this movie - that is hard to swallow.All in all, if you are like me, you will come to see Godzilla, and you will not be disappointed. There are some powerful human moments, one involving Dr. Serizawa and the monster he has been studying all this time is especially a standout. Another is a heated debate between Mark and Emma, where you can literally feel the tension. The movie, of course, like all franchises today, leaves it open for another - and if you wait until the very final end credits scene - what a universe they plan on creating.","6 out of 10 found this helpful."

It is also the third entry in Warner Bros. & Legendary Pictures' Monster-verse, after Godzilla(2014) & Kong: Skull Island(2017). Monarch the agency that takes care of a wide spectrum of living creatures, do battle with a gang of monsters. These monsters include Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan & the three-headed Ghidorah.Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an awesome movie. Director Michael Dougherty has given us a movie that surpasses its 2014 predecessor & is on par with Kong: Skull Island(2017). The battles among all the various monsters aka Titans, are the highlights of the film. Towards the end though, these battles tend to get a tad bit repetitive. The visual effects are awe-inspiring. The cast makes this movie more relatable to the audience but, I wish they were given a bit more importance. Kyle Chandler is brilliant as Mark Russell. Vera Farmiga is spectacular as Dr. Emma Russell. Millie Bobby Brown is mind-blowing as Madison Russell. Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds & O'Shea Jackson Jr. are fantastic as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, Dr. Ilene Chen, Dr. Rick Stanton, Dr. Vivienne Graham, Jonah Alan, Sam Coleman, Colonel Diane Foster & Chief Warrant Officer Barnes, respectively. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a must watch, especially on the big screen. Just watch it with the right expectations. Go, have a monstrously good time!","6 out of 10 found this helpful."

But that doesn't stop Michael Dougherty and his crew from continuing the MonsterVerse with 2019's 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters.' After the series launched with 2014's 'Godzilla,' we experienced 'Kong: Skull Island' in 2017 and are going to have more chances to see our favorite big bad monster buddies. But by that point, will we still be wanting more?'Monsters' really tries hard. It's not any film that can bring together the likes of Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah, so props are deserved for this, along with the generally well down CGI. But nearly everything else about this film is subpar to downright bad. The acting is embarrassing, considering the caliber of the cast assembled here (including Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Kyle Chandler, Charles Dance, etc.). Farmgia is probably the biggest letdown, as we know she especially can do so much better.The plot is a complete mess, and the zig-zagging all over the globe is enough to make our collective heads spin out of control. Sure, it's cool from a setting standpoint, but it's just way too much for one movie. And while it's nice to see Boston used as a backdrop for one of the most important scenes in 'Monsters,' poor Fenway Park deserves much better. There's also a number of ""WTF?"" moments - too many to count - that are even too much for this kind of sci-fi monsterfest.Despite lackluster box office performance of 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters,' we'll continue to see new entries in the MonsterVerse universe.

Here are the negatives. The script for this film is absolute garbage. The dialogue is so forced and unnatural that it makes you roll your eyes everytime someone talks which obviously is a large portion of the film. The characters are also a huge detriment to the film. They don't have any personality and are defined by their ""one character trait"" which is a running problem in Warner Brothers Monsterverse. Unfortunately, this one character trait robs the audience for feeling an emotion towards character deaths in the film. Some of the action scenes aren't amazing also. For some of the action scenes, I can't tell what is going on or who is who because the camera is shaking around a lot. One final thing is that I feel Millie Bobby Brown wasn't great in this film. I like her in Stranger Things but I felt like she just wasn't trying. Here are the positives of the film. One major thing is that the sound design, sound editing, and musical score are phenomenal. The film sounds amazing. I believe that this film could be an early contender for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing at the Oscars. The musical score is just outstanding to listen to. Most of the actors do a pretty good job even though they were given a terrible script. Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Ken Watanabe were standouts from the film. The other half of the action scenes are pretty good and it's awesome to see huge monsters fighting each other. Most of the visual effects are really good especially the character designs. Godzilla, Ghidorah, Mothra, and Rhodan look incredibly lifelike. The cinematography is good but it's nothing special. The tone throughout the film remains consistent and the film is paced pretty well. It starts fast and moves from each scene quickly. Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters has some amazing sound editing, editing, and score with great visual effects but lacks a good script or compelling characters.

The same goes for this film. Edit out most of the scenes of the people, and their pathetic dialog (most of which are a mess of cliches) and pointless subplots, and concentrate on the monsters fighting.Granted the film would only be 15 minutes long then, but it would be a massive improvement over the mess foisted upon the unsuspecting world that is ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters""","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

The script, if you can even call it that is totally unacceptable from any angle. Zero character development, zero logic, zero interest, equals maximum indifference and boredom for the suffering audience. Characters we know nothing about in a cartoon like script that makes no sense. This movie is a perfect example of self indulgent mayhem that goes on and on and is meaningless. Unrealistic everything, with a truly annoying performance from fourteen year old Millie Bobby Brown. In short, this is well over two hours of punishment to watch a half hour of actual monster battles. A real zero of a film. -

It made the 2014 version seem like not the raging dumpster fire it was.The story (and I'm using that word generously) is barely coherent. We are seemingly thrown into the second act of a movie with zero build up and even less character development. And of course the movie must have the now mandatory Chinese character speaking incomprehensible Engrish in order to attract Chinese investors as well as securing a slice of the sweet box office from the brutal dictatorship.But if you thought we knew little about the characters, just wait until we get to the monsters. If you thought you were going to get an explanation of their relationship to each other (which I guess is supposed to matter in this movie) or even something so basic as an explanation of their powers, you are out of luck.Everything is dark and most of it is brown.

The symbolism and connection to ancient Mythology was really the best part of the film.
The Action of the monsters fighting was beautiful and very fun to watch, minus the Bloody Moth, and yet it seems that we hardly get any of that, also I couldn't help but wish for more blood.
The action involving the humans was unrealistic and non threatening; every main character has more plot armour than I can recall seeing in any other movie. The acting was lacking (Steve from ""Blues clues"" had me more convinced), Charles Dances character is the ONLY performance and the only character that I liked, real shame he was wasted and we didn't get more from him; and the writing surrounding the movie was as if it was written by a Fifth grade elementary student.
Kyle Chandler has the most plot armour in the film, I don't even think Chuck Norris could survive as much: Vera Famiga, while her motives paint a better light, was still a rotten character; I wanted her and Millie Bobby Brown dead from the very start of the film and that desire only was amplified as the movie went on. Thomas Middleditch was some gay and annoying character, always telling lousy sex jokes that failed to land a laugh in the cinema. Aisha Hinds character is a good example of whats wrong with current Hollywood, she is basically a one woman army full of plot armour, she can and does do it all.
If they had more monster battles, the people wouldn't have bothered me, but they try hard to make you care about people that you know will be okay.
Very few white people were in the military and most women of power were black and it takes it further to shove even more Liberal crud down our throats.
They Keep the Same design for Godzilla, which the 1998 version still looks much better!
I guess there was a post credit scene, but I couldn't wait to get out of there so I didn't watch it.
It's movies like this that want me to start writing scripts for free, just so studios can make good entertainment.
Instead it's like the joke is on the audience.
How dare I pay to see this movie...
I would still watch it before another MCU Film.
Maybe when it finally enters the $5 bin, then I'll buy it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

There are some new monsters, too.There's a good dynamic and tension, with the humans. They are very much driving the plot, and are not superfluous to the plot to fill screen time, until the monsters can fight it out.The effects, music, and production value are top notch.Only quibble is I'd rather have seen more of monsters battling, at the end, than humans running for safety.

Unlike the previous movie, there are more monsters in this film as well as more screen time for Godzilla. This was most likely done to appease fans of the previous movie who were somewhat disappointed with the lack of screen time Godzilla had. The special effects on monsters such as Godzilla and Mothra are quite decent. They're by no means spectacular, but they're adequate. The sound design for all the creatures and fight scenes are also satisfactory. And although there are MANY problems with the final fight scene, I can at least appreciate the scale of the fight between the human characters and the monsters. The final fight choreography is all right, but it gets the job done and delivers some satisfying punches. Now that that's out of the way, we can start off with ALL the negatives.If I had to pinpoint the overall worst aspect of this film, it would have to be the abundance of foolish human characters. Although Godzilla does take up more screen time in this movie, this film is filled to the brim with the most idiotic and unlikable characters who make the most ridiculous decisions and come up with the most absurd ideas. Top it all off with some some superb actors given an awful and laughable script cluttered with miserable exposition and you'll have some of the most boring and dreadful moments in the theater. This film also feels the need to include pointless Godzilla lore at all times in a pathetic way to keep die hard Godzilla fans entertained.Now let's say you're the type of person that only sees these movies for the action. Well, you'll be dissatisfied as well. A majority of these fights take place either underwater, at night, in fire and smoke, or in a location with a lack of light. While I can understand that they did this in an attempt to create a more realistic atmosphere (going back to the scale of monsters to humans), this ends up obscuring the fight to almost everyone in the theater. Another downside to these fight scenes is that they're way too loud at points The inclusion of shaky cam is also an issue as it attempts to create fake tension which only makes the viewing experience even worse.Although I am personally not a diehard Godzilla fan, I don't see how anyone can look past a lousy script, appalling acting and characters, inclusions of effects and sound that worsen what could've been good action scenes, and a lamentable final act which is dommed by everything before it failing. Warnerbros's Monsterverse is just a shoddy ripoff of the trend that Marvel did way better. It's no wonder why this flopped at the box office.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

The action and cinematography are completely synchronized to present epic moments of combat in gigantic proportions. I think in a movie of this kind it's not much about talking about the characters or the script, since what we really want is to see giant monsters fighting, and admit it, we love to see that.Godzilla 2 does it completely, the scenes are fantastic, apocalyptic and full of emotion, above all, is a complete satisfaction for the most veteran fans, the design of each kaiju is incredible and fully respects the originals, using its main structure and sounds, giving us a full ticket to reimagine our childhood once again.I love kaijus, and if you love them too, you will love this movie, because the roar of the king is back, and this time to stay.

I was munching on my popcorn like a little kid every time something big happened, and that may sound vague but I'm sure you can guess what I mean.This movie is basically at 130 minute light show, a blast of cinematic spectacle with dozens of mouth-watering shots that could easily be your next computer wallpaper. Most the performances work, especially Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler, but let's face it, we're here for monumental destruction and titan smackdowns, and boy do you get those!Godzilla is fully-realised, with character and presence, and he roars about 15 times here and it made me cheer with giddy abandon, I turn into a wide-eyed kid watching monster movies and this one had me jaw dropped and blown away consistently with the phenomenal battles involving the menacing Ghidorah, the deadly Rodan and the beautiful Mothra, plus other briefly seen titans that each have a distinct look and threat about them.The set design is so cool, it reminded me of Roland Emmerich's 2012, in that these governments and giant companies own groovy high tech facilities, epic ships, complete with expensive monitors and satellites, it's all very cheesy and B-movie but it made the movie even more entertaining in that there's thought put into every scene and environment, and the aesthetics and mood of Godzilla's hidden home in hollow earth added some much-needed atmospherics to the film.The finale of this film almost rivals the awe and chaos of the 2014 Godzilla flick, and I absolutely loved the relatively lengthy unbroken shots of the humans running through destroyed Boston as Ghidorah and Godzilla beat each other up whilst Rodan and Mothra go at it! It's explosion and action movie heaven, my ears were ringing by the end of this movie and I left exhausted in the best possible way.Now it's the wait for Godzilla vs Kong, this franchise needs to keep going this good!","5 out of 8 found this helpful."

SUMMARY:Big budget films about monsters require a lot of things to appeal to the mass audiences and much of it has to with special effects and action. The King Of The Monsters manages to focus much on this, becoming a special effects extravaganza that did not yield to the limitations of speakers and screens. The animation is on point, and many of the creatures look stellar in their design, throwing away the prosthetics and papier Mache for stellar high definition CGI graphics. Smooth monster animation that looks to stick to anatomical movements are beautifully unleashed and it helps bring these monsters one step closer to being real. Eventually the monsters start battling and the action scenes have a number of special effects in both sound effects and visual styles to unleash Armageddon on the big screen. Those who love seeing chaos unleashed with little else binding them, and getting a little more human involvement as well, should be pleased with the destruction at hand in that fastest way possible. This is especially true in the final battle, where the behemoths battlegrounds hold much to be destroyed, assisted by theater shaking sound editing, an epic symphony score to add edge, flashy blasts from the atomic driven beasts, and plenty artificially generated beasts to fill your eyes. It's climactic and satisfying, and something I was hoping to see since the trailers showed.
With special effects focus though, the movie sort of stumbles on other categories that still need some work for this reviewer. The opening of the film is rather boring, a jumbled mess of convoluted introductions, explanations about what is going on and the human focus that will lead to all the mess. For a movie about monsters, much of the screen time still focuses on the terrors of humanity, focusing on how much we suck in our attempts to control everything. Unlike Kong, Godzilla's second arc still has trouble grounding its size to a deeper plot, that involves interacting with these creatures more than from the safeties of the bunkers. Even if you don't care about the story, the action scenes are also in need of some work, even the climactic ending. For one thing, many of the fights are very short lived, over in mere minutes after buildups of more talking from humans. The Fight with Rodan might have been my favorite, having the most integration of human and beast combination that brought me into the zone, but other times it was a jumbled mess of quick shots of stuff blowing up before panning back to humans. Other times, there were shaky bouts of camera work of close up monsters and falling buildings. This improved at the end, but it took a long time to discover something other films have already mastered. Finally, the number of monsters represented was not awful, but again trying to put too many in for them doing very little is a component that annoys me. Mothra and Rodon were kind of there, hitting there moments at the right times, but not maximized. Other creatures we get to see passing shots of, but they were unnecessary when we could have had more epic monster battles.
As you can see, the King Of Monsters is certainly going to hold the special effect event of the summer, or at least pretty close to it. It's problem is, that it's imbalance issues continue to mix the movie up in a messy sorts that some will love and others won't. The monster aspect gets points for chaos, destruction, and special effects that these movies thrive on so monster fans should be stoked by these aspects. The action again is mixed for me, part awesome with the special effects and yet part disappointing because of the fast pace, focus on humans more than monsters, and shaky camera work that could have been expanded upon. Perhaps the next installment can figure out the chemistry to the monster movie balance and bring back the magic of the dying genre. Still with all the special effects and monsters in this film, despite how imbalanced they are, the movie is worth the visit to the theater. So check it out when you can.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 6.5","5 out of 8 found this helpful."

Am I the only Godzilla fan who sees the problem here? Again, I find myself asking this question, just like we all did in 2016 with Paul Feig's Ghostbusters: WHY make a movie reboot if you actively dislike the subject matter?The monster/Kaiju genre lends itself well to meaningless ""turn your brain off"" action, and I stress that it is absolutely optional to include metaphor, allegory, or any deeper level of meaning as a reward for audience members willing to pay the film more attention than it seems to deserve. Not all Godzilla films from Toho have opted to do this either, of course. However, Godzilla: King of The Monsters opts to take what little political messaging the previous movies may have communicated and literally drop a nuclear bomb on it.It's a well known fact that Ishiro Honda's 1954 Godzilla film is an unshrouded and frankly rather polite metaphor about the use of nuclear warheads on Japan in 1945, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It can be argued that there are no innocents in war, and you can evidence this from the Pearl Harbor attack, the horrendous treatment POWs recieved at the hands of the Japanese Empire, and the awful acts that the Empire committed in China before and during WWII. However, Honda posits, there are innocents AFTER war. In the months and years that followed, the deathtoll which the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs acrued on that day of impact actually doubled, from approx. 200,000 people to approx. 400,000 as the many horrifying effects of radiation exposure set in.Research is still being performed to this day on the children of those survivors and in all cases has noted an uptick in physical and learning disorders in those children. Thus, Godzilla was born - a hulking and indescribable monster who would not be believed by the international community unless seen with their own eyes. It's not easy to see the effects of radiation poisoning (and the research on generational impact of this new technology did not exist), however it is easy to see a gigantic Gorilla-Whale stomping over Japan. Godzilla was a cry-out to the world for help, an escape from the confusing nuance of reality in post-war Japan and an utterly exciting and entertaining piece of cinema to boot. In Godzilla: King of the Monsters though, the nuclear bomb finally gets its redemption arc. About time!Later in Godzilla's life came a film called Godzilla vs. Hedorah (1972) aka Godzilla vs. The Smog Monster, and it was Roger Ebert's favourite entry into the series. It's a much more overt political statement where the corporate world's use of plastics, oil and gas result in a living creature emerging from the sea that toxifies everything it touches and devours any land resources it finds, adding to its destructive power. It's an obvious message, and one that was portrayed so strongly and unapologetically that the director, Yoshimitsu Banno, was fired immediately from Toho despite it being his first foray into the Godzilla franchise.So that brings us back to the plot here in this film where the army uses a nuclear bomb to defeat an environmental group. Admittedly the group's goal is to fix pollution by destroying the world (???), but the writers could have easily, I don't know, not written this subplot at all? Particularly because it is so contrived and poorly justified, that it seems like a lot of effort has gone into thinking up this scenario of Military Industrial Complex vs. Civilian environmentalist group, while also making sure the good ol' MIC is well and truly the benevolent victim here.When you attempt to dig deeper into this film, which isn't really necessary, what you find there is so cynical, nasty and vindictive that a more intelligent screenwriter would have omitted it completely, and the situation is made all the more insulting by the fact that they dedicated this film, for some insane reason, to the memory of Godzilla vs. Hedorah director Yoshimitsu Banno (d. 2017).It gets a 5/10 from me because lots of monster do big monster smash thing and I like big monster smash thing. The CGI is good, there's some really fulfilling, nicely set-up visuals for which they've cranked up the brightness, unlike Gareth Edwards' 2014 Godzilla, where you couldn't see a darn thing. Hate the writers though. It's a movie that seems to be the product of a nationalistic tantrum, which is embarrassing for them, and it spits on everything that came before it as well as everyone who dedicated their whole careers in some cases to handcrafting those movies between the years of 1954-1995.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

It's really incredible how these kind of special effects are even possible, it really makes you wonder how much farther can they get? The human story wasn't bad, it was fairly easy to follow and it really needs a story or what's the point? And the story made sense, there's plenty of monster action, each battle better than the last. I'm definitely going to see it again..I think you have to see it on the big screen with sound to get the full awesomeness of this picture.

This movie has way more action than Godzilla 2014, and brings in the classic monsters for the Tojo movies, Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah. The human characters are a significantly better than in 2014, where we follow this BORING piece of wood human that hogs the movie after the first thirty minutes where the best character gets killed off. In this movie at least the characters emote and the actors do their very best to make the script work and their acting is pretty good. Though they are still the weakest part of the film I will take many humans that have emotions over a BORING piece of wood human any day. As far as the plot being convoluted or confusing, that's simply wrong, Avengers Endgame had a more convoluted and confusing plot thanks to its time travel and raised too many questions to the point that fans and producers of the film had to save it in order to make some sort of sense (Though I still think Endgame is a pretty good film.) Even though the twist villain is flawed and her goals are insane, so is thanos, we see his plan has some noticeable flaws such as the population of each planet would go back to its normal population every couple of years and he would have to back and do it again every fore years and even with the snap he would have to do that every few years to keep the population of the universe halved. NO ONE IS PERFECT! Now the best parts of the movie are all the monsters Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and the menacing King Ghidorah. All the monsters show some expression, personality, and EMOTION!!! Unlike a certain live action Disney remake that came out in July whose name I will never speak of. Every time the monsters are onscreen you can the beauty of this film and it is just stunning. The fights are incredible plain and simple, their beautiful, DO NOT HAVE SHAKY CAM, and bring in the best of the film and each monster gets their highlight scene. Even though their is still cutting away from the fight it is not as done nearly as much as in 2014 and the human characters, again, are better than in the 2014 film. In summary, the monsters are the best part of the film with the fights being a spectacle to look at, the human characters show some emotion and are a massive improvement from 2014 to point that I actually cared for them in the end, and in general the movie is popcorn fun and I'd full of entertainment. I love this movie more than any other movie from this year. If your a Godzilla fan your going to love it, if your someone who is looking for some good actions you are going to like it, if you are looking for a super complex movie that has something like the meaning of life you are not going to get it. This movie is simply fun and it also has great pacing getting to the monsters rather quickly between each human segment. Overall this movie is underrated, but hey it's just my opinion, 9/10 I loved it.","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

The common criticism about this film is that there isn't enough plot, and too much fighting between the monsters.
I do agree the fight are FAR too long, but I think this film has more plot than critics are giving it credit for. It isn't very strong or good, but it is there. Everyone in the film are really dull, even Millie Bobby Brown, who does her usual shtick of have a mental breakdown.
My main complaint about these sorts of films, is that the big action set pieces that everyone, people that one could call simpletons, are hyping up, are total messes. The overload on CGI detracts from any sense of realism, and the shakey camera whenever the focus is on the humans never lets the scene breathe, or let us take in the utter chaos.
I wasn't let down, but that still doesn't mean it's good.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

All of them are now included in the mysterious MonsterVerse franchise, and all are united by the Monarch Corporation - which explores mysterious, huge monsters all over the planet. The long-awaited film, which ""lured"" not only with its videos, but also with its ""name"" - was released, and ... I must say, if you put everything together - it turned out quite well, and much better than the famous concept of ""summer blockbuster.""Five years have passed since the disaster, as a result of which giant monsters destroyed San Francisco. The Russell family did not survive these trials: Mark left the wife of Emma and daughter Madison. Now he spends time in the state of Colorado, studying the habits of wolves. And Emma continues to work with the company ""Monarch"", which is trying to track the movement of Godzilla, and at the same time is engaged in the cultivation of new monsters. Emma improved the device Mark created to study the language of whales, and learned to pacify the underground titans. The film tells about the confrontation between Godzilla, Motra, Rodan and the three-headed monster King Ghidorah.From an explosive birth in 1954 to an epic comeback in 2014, Godzilla has always been more than just a monster. Destroyer, Savior, Legend, King. For many decades, it has changed and developed along with social, political and environmental processes, going from a ""natural disaster"" to a ""last samurai"". ""Yes, these are blockbusters,"" says director Michael Dougherty, ""but they are full of metaphors. Although different topics came to the fore in different years, one remained the leitmotif of the entire franchise: if you put too much pressure on nature, it ""will give change"". ""Our cinema is the polyphony of crazy ancient super beings. Spectators will immerse themselves in action and adventure, feel the adrenaline rush, ""adds actress Vera Farmiga. ""But it was important for us to tell a story that will resonate in our hearts, and I think we succeeded."" That is why Godzilla is still a cult character. It brightens many aspects of the real world. How not to love a radioactive monster that weighs under one hundred thousand tons and makes us think of humanity? ""And in the end, we can agree with them.The main characters of the film, along with the monsters are actors, and here all the actors created, perhaps, the very images that were expected of them: Kyle Chandler in the role of a caring father who is forced to become a ""savior""; Vera Farmiga - her typical - elegant and calm manner creates an ambiguous image of the hero - who turns out to be a complete ""follower"" of her profession, and whose ""actions"" - cost thousands of lives; Millie Bobby Brown - finally ""lit up"" in a large, Hollywood film - which became her ""debut"" in her career, not counting the series; good on their ""parties"" - Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Ziyi Zhang and Elizabeth Faith Ludlow from Walking Dead TV series.Before us is a film that looks like a lot of destructive ""action apocalypse"" that is simple and deep in its ideas. The creators managed not to ""choke"" creating a large and large-scale picture - a sort of ""colossus"" that could ""fall"" under its weight, expectations, and hopes - but still did not.

Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened. Putting together such a predictable plot with such boring and unsympathetic characters can't lead to something good I'm afraid. Although it seems to have potential, especially judging by the sheer number of enormous creatures depicted, it manages to be simply dull and boring. As you don't get to care about the characters, it becomes quite difficult to be involved in the action and actually enjoy it. Although some actors try to make a good impression, it becomes obvious that they're effort is doomed to fail judging by the plot which simply isn't capable of delivering a good experience.In terms of upsides, there's little to say. The visuals are great, detailed and pleasant to watch, thanks to some great CGI, the chosen scenery is also very well picked and you do get a bit of excitement in terms of action, but due to the above mentioned, drama, emotion or other feelings which may derive from a movie are quite scarce or not present at all.As a conclusion, it's a movie you can easily skip or forget, definitely not worth your cash, even if the 3D effects from the cinema might help it a bit in terms of overall experience. It does way too little things good as opposed to the many that it does wrong.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

This was the film I was most looking forward to this year, even more than Endgame. Now, I'm not a big fan of Godzilla 2014 for reasons I will state below. I think it's a grossly overrated film. On the other end of the spectrum, I really enjoy Kong Skull Island, and think it's a highly underrated flick. At first I thought it was just okay, but upon repeat viewings I grew to really appreciate the film much more. Between that and the fantastic trailers for this film I was really hyped for this. Did it deliver? Unfortunately, not enough.I've been a fan of Godzilla for close to ten years, though I'm more on the casual side. I'm not a diehard fan whose has seen every single Godzilla film. In fact, I haven't seen any of the old movies other than the original Godzilla as of yet. Most of my knowledge extends to the more modern versions, from Godzilla 1998 onward.I'm one of the few who enjoys Godzilla 1998. I grew up on it, and it was the very first Godzilla movie I ever saw. It's a guilty pleasure to be sure. The animated series based off the film is also a fun watch. The original film is a classic I highly respect, though it's not my personal favorite. I also like Shin Godzilla and Godzilla 2000 alright. I love the Netflix animated Godzilla trilogy, which everyone else seems to hate. It's my personal favorite version of Godzilla thus far.Like I said, I was pretty disappointed with Godzilla 2014. While it is one of the best looking Godzilla movies yet, it was all hype but almost no payoff. Godzilla was barely in the film. The monster action is always in the background and shot very sloppily. They killed off the best character before even the halfway point, and we're left with a boring block of wood known as Aaron Taylor Johnson for the rest of it. The side characters aren't any better either. So, we're left with a movie with no compelling characters and no Godzilla; in other words, a pretty but hollow experience.Unfortunately, I had a fairly similar experience watching this film. This movie does have more monster action than the previous film. The makers did listen to the criticism of that film to a point. There's a lot more monsters in this one, where before there were only two types of creatures. Godzilla has a bit more to do here than in the 2014 movie, though not by much. The film looks gorgeous; easily the best looking Godzilla film thus far. There's some absolutely spectacular imagery on display here. The score is great as well. It's a shame the story and characters don't measure up to that. Because of all of that, I'll say this film is better than Godzilla 2014, but not by much.This film has many of the same flaws Godzilla 2014 did. It's pretty boring in places. It felt as long as Peter Jackson's King Kong, which is forty-five minutes longer. While there are more monster battles in this, they're still mostly in the background. Most of the film is still focused around the humans in the foreground, which nobody cares about, including me. The humans in this are about as uninteresting as the ones in the previous movie. Kyle Chambers's character is a better lead than Aaron Tailor Johnson, but that's not saying much.You could say the same thing about movies like Shin Godzilla and the Planet Godzilla Trilogy. I'm sorry; I think those movies have more interesting characters that actually contribute to the plot. Plus, those films actually have interesting stories and themes they tackle. Godzilla does more in those films. He does a bit more here, but is still sidelined for most of it. They still make him look like a wimp compared to most other versions. I think the Godzilla from the 1998 film could beat this version.People complained about the characters in Kong Skull Island. Those characters aren't the deepest or most well written, but they're fun, have actual personality, and are backed by a great cast. Kong does more in that film than Godzilla in these movies. Peter Jackson's King Kong has better monster action than King of Monsters.It's a shame, because you can tell the makers genuinely care for the material given how beautiful the film is and how many callbacks to the first movie were included. Rumor has it that early versions of the film have longer and uninterrupted monster battles that were cut down and edited out of the final product after test screenings. It's sad that we were cheated out of the grand epic monster mash we all wanted because the studios wanted to appease narrow-minded critics with a long outdated notion that in order for people to be invested we need human characters front and center no matter what. Ironically, critics still ended up slamming the film anyway.Overall, Godzilla King of Monsters is an okay monster movie, but also a disappointing one. Maybe my opinion will change on future viewing, like with Skull Island, but as of now I felt underwhelmed by this movie. It's certainly not bad, but it could have been so much more. Because of this my hype for Godzilla vs. King Kong has gone down some. Hopefully they take the reception for this film to heart next time.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

On a wet afternoon for some reason I thought I would give it a go. My expectations were low, but the 'geek sphere' had made positive reports about this since it's release so I thought 'what the heck'. These type of films are so often disappointing, and I nearly switched it off during the first 20 minutes, but man am I glad I stayed with it. Yes, there is some generic stuff in here, but it is delivered with enough panache to keep you interested. This film builds the tension and the second and third acts build to a really great showdown. It is actually very restrained, in that it doesn't kick in with monsters from the word go and then just have a bunch of loosely connected fight scenes. No, it keeps you waiting, but it's a fun weight. When it does pay off you are treated to some stunningly atmospheric usual treats which make this movie a solid 8/10. As I said, these films are so often terrible, but this one is worth your time. Even if you just 'look' at it there is something to enjoy and real care has bern taken over the are of this film.

The first clue is a nod to the genesis of Godzilla in the naming of Monarch's primary base Castle Bravo - that fateful and disastrous nuclear weapons test from 1954. Godzilla was, indeed, born in the shadow of nuclear fire. As Dr. Serizawa says: ""Sometimes, the only way to heal our wounds is to make peace with the demons who created them."" That line right there is worth the wait.But it takes the movie a minute to get there. The first act is convoluted, confusing and disjointed with an over-accelerated pace of plot development that may leave you adrift at first. But once it gets on point, the story unfolds to reveal the classic Japanese tale of heroic sacrifice that is Godzilla.Brutal and poignant, I found the King of Monsters to be the most heartfelt of the modern big-budget Godzilla movies. Even if they mis-stepped on the front end and you have to side-step a few OTN references to the evils of mankind, the crew behind this movie pull it together once Godzilla shows up. It ends much stronger than it begins, and I think it's worth hanging in there to get the powerful payoff. Dr. Serizawa is your spiritual guide in this episode, with an almost fourth-wall breaking acknowledgement of skepticism and cynicism by several other members of the cast. The writers lampshade the incredulity of Godzilla's spiritual prowess a bit too much, but still give the spiritual story behind the monster everything they've got. Almost as if to say, ""We know some of you think this is trite. We don't care. We're going to do it anyway."" You have to approach this movie (like any Godzilla movie) with the spirit of attending a magic show. It only works if you let it.

This follow-up effort, from Krampus (2015) director Michael Dougherty, sets out to redress that balance, although like the earlier film, seems to be easily distracted from that motive by the plethora of secondary monsters he's also expected to showcase, along with a series of turgid and un-involving subplots focused on the human supporting cast, and has trouble balancing the desire to tell it's own story whilst also fulfilling the necessities of corporate franchise-building.From the opening frames it's obvious that this is a made-to-order commercial blockbuster, with both Millie Bobby Brown duplicating her look and mannerisms from Stranger Things (2018) and Vera Farmiga giving a curiously deadpan reading of her earnest leading lady perfromance from The Conjuring (2013-2019) series. Their encounter with a cartoonishly rendered CGI caterpillar -the first of the film's ultimately bloated creature lineup - is violently interrupted by a scowling Charles Dance, likewise channelling his own portrayal of Tywin Lannister from Game of Thrones (2011-2019) into a psychopathic ""eco-terrorist"" apparently intended as a sneery clapback at the likes of Extinction Rebellion.Kyle Chandler, meanwhile, is given the thankless role of a perma-scowling monster expert (and ex-Farmiga squeeze, natch), morosely stomping about in the background shouting ""you can't do this, it'll never work!"" at the apparently vast, widely publicly known yet totally off-the-books organisation - known as ""Monarch"", which is indicative of the film's general level of subtlety - that wants to try and control the beasts, now known as Titans (I guess Kaiju was trademarked), which seem to be surfacing all over the globe.Despite the haste with which we are introduced to all the various monsters that make up this mash, the film seems strangely impatient with much of the action that should, in fact, be it's main animating purpose. Where Godzilla (2014) was noted for repeatedly, and frustratingly, cutting away from the titanic fisticuffs just as they got going, this picture hurriedly shoves those sequences into the foreground, but is clearly so over-burdened with creature personalities and the requirement to feature each one individually before seguing into successive face-offs between them, that it swiftly drops each confrontation and swerves hard towards the next, seemingly racing to keep up with the audience's (presumably miniscule) attention span. The effect is one of permanently fraught and artificially emotive chaos, where no one aspect is given enough clear focus to fully develop, and the major emotional and story beats fail to land because of a lack of proper buildup.Glimpses of the film that could have been are provided in the few moments that actually manage to resonate, such as the fate of Ken Watanbe's holdover character from the first picture, or the atmospheric underwater sequence that provides the first appearance of the titular hero (outside stock cuts from the Edwards film). Unfortunately, the choppy, rushed narrative and general tone of earnest, humourless grandeur distances the audience from much of what unfolds, and supposedly epic or climactic moments are drowned in a parade of monotonous, noisy spectacle. The flailing attempts at emotional significance are not helped by laboured, 2-dimensional characterisations, nor by the wildly uneven CGI; serious deficiencies of rendering and inconsistencies of scale are added to clumsy and often cartoony-looking creature design, as if the animators were deliberately trying to emulate the creaky, stiff perambulations of the original wire-and-sock-puppet depictions of the film's varied creature cast, as opposed to developing realistic - or at least interesting - original designs.The end result is a film visibly labouring under it's own competing imperatives, crushed by the resulting internal contradictions and finally collapsing under the weight of it's own preposterous, self-serious pretensions; one that, much like many of its genre ilk, is reasonably diverting when the monsters are onscreen, mildly irritating when they are not, and leaves little impression once it has concluded beyond the colourful nature of its design and execution.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

With movies like John Wick and Rocketman playing on cinemas, I'd recommend you don't waste your time or money watching Godzilla, believe me you're not missing out on much. I went to see this movie with really low expectations, however, I did think I'd maybe get to see some pretty cool battle scenes - these were actually the silver lining of the movie, and yet they could've been so much better than they were. The plot and characters were a mess. The movie had scenes that were so ridiculous and incoherent they were out right laughable. The acting of Millie Bobby Brown, Vera Farmings, Ken Watanabe and the like was as good as can be. In conclusion, it was not all bad, no one can argue the effects were amazing but with poor characters and a messy plot it's still a film that leaves nothing to remember.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

It was much better than I expected but yet not too much (it got close with a long fight by the end but even that was saved by adding interesting and exciting elements).The film builds nicely, explains how things have changed since the last film and delivers awesome spectacle (beautiful imagery) and great moments that genuinely took me back to the excitement I had as a kid watching the old black and white original Godzilla film re-runs. I actually cared for the outcome of the monster fights, loved the development of can monsters and humans co-exist and liked the underlying theme of 'alphas' across monsters, people and both.Also really enjoyed the monster angles in this film.

They do this because it is cheap and easy for the graphic artists, but as a piece of cinema it's rubbish. There is no sense of scale, or the majority of detail is occluded.
The casting is bad. Vera Farmiga is especially annoying; insincere as she always is. The movie cowtows to China by having one of the main scientists Chinese and she's such a bad actor, everything she says is spoken like it's some kind of ancient wisdom. The rest of the casting is typically social justice with a black woman running the senate (yawn), and another running the army.
Then there is the gaia worship ideology that the movie tries to stuff down your throat. ""The earth is overpopulated"" (false), ""humans are the disease"", and the solution is radioactive energy in the form of these ""titans"" (symbolic for nukes) to restore balance to the planet because only by killing 90% of the people can we assure the continuity of human life on earth. Can anyone else see some kind of insidious brainwashing/forshadowing here?

What I expected was a popcorn flick with monster battles galore.The monster battles were there, the CGI team on this movie deserves some credit.
The story though... was almost cringeworthy. I am normally very tolerant of the story not being all that, if I'm entertained. But at some point, there is a limit to how bad the story and lines of the characters can be, before you can't stop ignoring it.There is absolutely no soul in this movie, the characters are doing so many things that would be highly irrational behaviour in the situation they are in. I do not want to spoil anything, so if you do watch it, I'm sure you can see what I mean.Just a few things I noticed was the following.
Climate is a big topic around the world these days, and what do you know... The climate is a topic in this movie, which it wasn't in the first one from 2014 at all...You would expect some serious ground tremors many hundred feet away if two monsters the size of a skyscraper were fighting, there was very minimal.The characters do not draw you in, you don't care about them. This is the fundemental flaw with most movies nowadays. The directors think that if we just make it look nice, we do not need any substance... WRONG!!! If you don't care about what happens to the people in the movie, you couldn't care less about how good it looks...You walk away thinking... How the hell did WB authorize this? Did they even read the script...?","1 out of 6 found this helpful."

And yet, without somewhat of a decent story, spectacle has no substance. Like it's predecessor, this version of Godzilla suffers from lack of story and engaging chatacters. Cliches are abundant and the monster battles and appearelances are not mich better than what you may find in video game cut scenes. Godzilla's powerset is inconsistent. In one moment he is weak, in the next 20 minutes he is strong, then blue and weak, then red and strong- it's all over the place with no explanation. The geography of the fight is lacking as well. All these movies need to take a page from John Wick's book on how to do great spectacle while still maintaining semblamce of story.","1 out of 7 found this helpful."

I'm under the impression that you don't need to be a diehard Godzilla fan to enjoy every Godzilla movie. Most people like these movies for the cool monster battles anyway, it's not like there's a whole lot of story there. Now, I've seen a lot of people say they really liked this movie, which is something I just don't understand. I would put this movie right next to the Transformers franchise. It has awful human characters that it focuses way too much on, and when you actually get a cool monster fight, it's hard to see anything that's going on. There are a few bright spots though. Some of the shots with the monsters look cool, and the final action sequence is decent. Millie Bobbie Brown gives a pretty good preformance with what shes given and so does Ken Watanabe, who knows exactly what movie he's in. When it comes to the humor, it's awful. I laughed like twice, but one of those times was at this guy who pushed a kid and his mother to the ground so he could get to safety(no, I'm not a terrible person, it was just unintentionally funny). That's all I have on this movie. See it if you want to see some mediocre monster battles, but I would just save my money.","1 out of 7 found this helpful."

But even they're not so great. Case in point - Rodan looks/acts just as stiff as he did back in old days.The plot was written by grade-school wanna-be's - tossing in some AVENGERS/Thanos ideas and a touch of Lord of the Rings. As the story moves along, the plots changes every 15 minutes, and every character changes their mind/focus as well.The CGI graphics, which are touted as being so good, aren't impressive as they claim to be. Want to know if you're getting some bland and basic CGI in a movie? If EVERY CGI dominated scene is plastered in rain, smoke and haze - it means they were covering up just how poor it really was. The movie does get an A- on its CGI rain, smoke and haze, which is in EVERY friggin' scene! Really top-end graphics will be crystal clear, in focus and look almost 3D, even in 2D (Avatar, Gravity, Marvel & DC...)
.
About the only note worthy portion of this film is Godzilla's scream. Unfortunately, the scenes with him included, are so cluttered with every other background noise added, they had to turn up the sound so loud, it becomes uncomfortable.Seeing this on the big screen doesn't help at all. Wait till it comes on Network television, that way you can leave during all the commercials, which gets you prepared for the next plot change and lame dialog to come in.","1 out of 7 found this helpful."

However, as the plot plods along it becomes harrowingly clear to the audience clawing at the bit for the epic monster madness they've paid for, that they'll have to wait for the film to conclude before they can go home and pop on their copy of 'Pacific Rim'.The premise of 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters' is one you've heard a thousand times before. Giant monsters rise from the oceans, some with the intent to harm, some to protect, and these titans battle it out behind the backdrop of a boring human storyline which steals the majority of screen time. When it comes to Kaiju movies such as these there really is a clear expectation for what we as an audience expect. The conventions are clear cut: Grand scale, satisfying and creative creature design, an underlying theme of the self-destructive nature of mankind and most importantly colossal battles that make us feel small and the issues in our own lives inconsequential. However, Godzilla inherently fails at 3/4th's of these expectations through distorted and unclear lighting design highlighting a lack of control over the grandiose scale of such a film, which as a knock-on effect makes the battles we have paid to see barely intelligible 80% of the time.The flaws in the script, initially, don't seem all that problematic, yet that may be as a result of the cast trying their very best to work with the weak material which initially at least holds the attention for some time. However, as the film develops it becomes the victim of what I would refer to as ""Dramatic one-lineritus"" in which it appears the crux of the film relies upon a dimly lit character looking just right of the camera and uttering something intended to be dramatic and daunting, yet in the context of the cheesy dialogue comes off as simply laughable. Unfortunately, these moments outshine the intended comedic moments as the funniest of the film. You don't care about any of the characters or dramatic stakes of the narrative by the long drawn out conclusion of the film as nothing here feels natural, it all feels like cliché melodramatic nonsense.There is certainly a childish joy elicited from the image of forces superior in stature to ourselves throwing their weight to each other while the insect-like humans look on, yet even this often times just appears as unclear mass throwing itself together: there were too many times I couldn't even distinguish Godzilla from King Ghidora, giving me eerie flashbacks to Michael Bay's 'Transformers'. The looking on is the real problem with 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters' as it feels as if the conflict, we have paid to see takes a backseat to the drama we've seen thousands of times before. Here's hoping Kong Vs. Godzilla rights the wrongs.","1 out of 8 found this helpful."

As a Godzilla fan, this was everything I ever dreamed of. I felt like a kid again, discovering this character for the first time. The human narrative isn't anything original, but I really enjoyed it. The performances were solid across the board. The human narrative, if nothing else, does a great job of giving us a rest from the action. And the action, my goodness... It was spectacular. There are so many scenes that I'd love to talk about in detail, but I would hate to spoil anything for anyone. The climactic battle between Ghidorah and Godzilla is incredible, as is the resolution that follows. I was grinning from ear to ear. There are some easter eggs from the Toho films that will be lost on casual viewers, but I don't really think it takes away from the film. It's no different than referencing Thor at the end of Iron Man 2. The hardcore fans get it, and the casual viewers are given hints at what's to come. Overall, it was everything I wanted it to be.

We watched it on IMAX and she held my left hand throughout the film. She had several scares and tightened her grip. She had just as much FUN as I did. This movie is an all out wrestling match of giant beasts. Actor Ken Watanabe, just like the last movie, had the best lines. The real villain of this film surprised me. But it is the battles scenes that are truly fantastic. Hearing the original Godzilla theme music from 1954 brought happy chills up my spine. Cheering on the King of the Monsters in the final battle scenes, I felt like I was rooting for Rocky Balboa. I know this is not a film for everyone but I don't see how lifetime fans of the Godzilla universe cannot enjoy this film. My wife and I give it 5 stars.

Whoever did the special effects brought the A-game here, with all the destruction and giant brawls, it's nice to see that no one appears to be running away from a digital creation. However, I will have to take away a point for the story, while I actually thought it was well executed, it is where the movie tends to have its slower paced portions and still feels secondary compared to the larger narrative of ""let's get Godzilla to earn the King of the Monsters title.""

Then again, that's not exactly a high bar to cross. Still, this film does have a lot of really cool monster scenes. There's plenty of Godzilla, but also plenty of other monsters, rendered to the screen with some pretty impressive CGI. I almost believed they were there, which is more than I can say about a lot of these recent monster films.Unfortunately, yet again it's the human element that ruins the film. And I get it, these monsters have no personalities, they cannot speak, they can barely even emote. As such the film has to have humans in it in order for it to be a cohesive story. I just wish the human characters could be more interesting. Now they're very basic cardboard cutouts. There are some good twists, here and there, but for the most part I was not invested at all in their eventual fate.The film is also in a bit of a rush. They clearly wanted more movies under the belt before bringing them all together. A Monsters Cinematic Universe, if you will. Unfortunately the original Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island didn't sell as well as they would have hoped, so the studio clearly wanted to cut their losses and go out with a bang. Can't really blame them, but it does mean that most of the monsters in this film don't really connect with us. They're cool and all, but that's about it.That being said, if you've ever wanted to watch enormous kaiju monsters duking it out, then this is definitely a movie for you. Well, if you've already seen Pacific Rim, that is. Whenever two monsters fight in this film, it's indeed the stuff a twelve-year-old boy's dreams are made out of, and then some.Not a perfect film by any means, but it has its definite upsides. A perfectly serviceable popcorn film and almost a must-see for all monster fans.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

In fact like allot of action CGI films released today if you don't have a headache going into it, you probably will have, by the time you have finished watching it. The plot, characters, behaviours, dialogs are extremely thin. The philosophical thinking behind the films drive ... is not great, theres allot of ... over the top - feminist female strong characters, playing as gung-ho male characters, not sure there is an actually feminine character in this film anywhere? As is the current modern hollywood agenda, women as men roles etc. The film is way too exaggerated in every way, very much like the proliferative comic book franchise films that currently flood cinemas and screens and rely on action on CGI to compensate for their deep lacking. Meh - you can miss this film, unless your a monster fight and godzilla obsessive & in that case i think this film probably does allot of fan service, as regards mothra and godzilla. Acting wise Im guessing theres allot of acting to green screens in this film? Meaning most of the performances revolve around over emotive expressing, to make up for dire dialog, towards scenes the actors are just told to imagine.

I won't belabor the negative. The films biggest problems are a weak story, and too many stereotypical, unlikable, and inherently stupid characters; especially irksome was the Emma Russe, Rick Stanton, and Allan Jonah characters but most of the characters were annoying at some point even those acted by players that I like. I don't find Vera Farminga appealing in any film so it's hardly a surprise she really was functionally brain dead and unlikable in this film. What happens to her is richly deserved and far too easy.The whole mess is all rather unfortunate considering the cool 2014 film. Trying to develop an entire franchise wasn't the film's biggest problem, but it nevertheless proved an insurmountable one. The introduction of the other monsters was not very interesting, using 'mercs' as the movie's bad guys derivative, and the 'hollow Earth' fiction only slighly less riduculous then the insistance at the film's beginning that the US military and or Monarch could kill the creatures or even bother them positively dumb (watching soldiers shooting one of the 300+ ft monsters with assault rifles was arguably the silliest scene in a pretty silly film, and rather like watching Japanese Self Defense Forces shooting the original Godzilla with machine guns 60 years ago). The film is a big letdown from 2014 but honestly anyone who enjoyed Showa Era Godzilla films and the cool giant turtle films from the same period will enjoy this film's silliness. Just don't expect a serious storyline or adult character development. It's all CGI overload and if that's your interest this film will be to your liking. CGI is fine when used properly (LOTR for example); it's only tolerable here but I happen to love Godzilla in all of his reincarnations even in an imperfect film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

It's a continuation of the Monsterverse, a shared universe of kaiju consisting of ""Godzilla"" (2014), ""Kong: Skull Island"" and several prequel comics, and is helmed by Michael Dougherty (Trick o' Treat, Krampus). This one promised to show more of the monster action many people craved from the previous film. Does it achieve this? In short, yes.Plot: Five years after Godzilla's battle in San Francisco, the world now knows of the existence of giant prehistoric ""Titans"" and the organization Monarch is doing everything it can to manage it. However, thanks to an eco-terrorist group, Godzilla's most hated enemy, the 3-headed dragon Ghidorah, is freed from his icy prison and threatens global extinction, reigniting their ancient grudge match. Joining this clash of titans are divine insect Mothra and speedy pterosaur Rodan. What can man do but LET THEM FIGHT!I heard complaints about the humans, but if you ask me they're fine. I grew like the new faces as they, though simplistic, offer both amusing and thoughtful banter with returning actor Ken Watanabe giving the best performance. I also found the conflict of the divorced couple (Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler) and their daughter (Milly Bobbie Brown) interesting with their opposing ideals and character arcs. The eco-terrorists, led by Charles Dance, while not given much screen time, are serviceable as villains and emphasize how the darkness of man overshadows the chaos of beasts, making them a dark foil to Monarch. All in their own ways serve the film's central theme of man needing to maintain balance with nature. I do think one or two characters that could've been cut out, though.Of course, the real stars are the monsters and, boy, are they wonderful. Their relationships, powers, designs, and personalities are true to their Japanese incarnations and the effects that bring them to life are stunningly detailed. There are tons of references to both classic films and the previous Monsterverse entries that eagle-eyed fans will easily spot. Furthermore, the established lore is expanded upon to fascinating areas such as the titans' history with man and mythology while offering room for more exploration. The action scenes up the ante with the monsters literally ripping each other apart in savage fights and worldwide destruction (refreshing locations like Mexico and Boston included), sometimes seen from the humans' POV to truly showcase their size and power. Compared to 2014's darker lighting, the titans' glow and distinct colors make the fights easier to see. The music is a spine-chilling blast, classic themes from past films (particularly Godzilla's and Mothra's) updated and combined with a tribal-style choir chanting the monsters' names to give a sense of awe, wonder, and dread for these giants (about time since previous U.S. adaptations neglected to do this) as well a remake of Blue Oyster Cult's ""Go Go Godzilla"".The humor is really the one thing to me that's hit-or-miss with some jokes being ""meh"" while others did make me chuckle.The team behind this film are true fans who went out of their way to make this a dedicated tribute to the franchise. It made my inner child giddy and I can't wait to see ""Godzilla vs Kong"". By all means, this MUST be seen on the big screen. All hail the King of the Monsters!","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

A group of Titans are awake, including Ghidorah and Rodan, and it's up to Godzilla to affront these monsters.2014's Godzilla, directed by Gareth Edwards, was pretty good at what it shows, with a human-focused story, good acting performances, good action sequences, and a good original score by Desplat. Although, some people was not convinced by this film because of the lacking of action sequences and it's comprensible. With 2019's Godzilla: King of the Monsters, there's a new director, Dougherty, and with that, a completly new vision.In fact, something changed in comparison of the first installment: the visuals. The colors, the monsters, the way the camera is placed, the way it moves... everything's made to see these Titans as gods. Sometimes you will see some beautiful imagery, like the Mothra revealing sequences, absolutely magnificent by the lighting, the predominant blue color (which, BTW, depends on how the monsters are portayed; if it's a monster in a good side, it's blue, and if it's a evil one, it's more of a warm color), and the CGI. But sometimes, we got some actions sequences that are not convincing. It's not bad, but it's not good either. You will not have the same impact, the same weight as Pacific Rim did.... well at least, KOTM is better than Uprising... (complete garbage this film). But, with the monsters, with the visual grandeur that this film shows us, I wanted something more grounded action-wise that I don't get here.But it is not the problem here. The real one is... the story. It's basic. Don't expect some great things here. The character developements are meh. The intrigue involving the parents is not strong enough.
The actors do their jobs. The eco-terrorists are useless... There here, somewhere, sometimes, bim boom and finish. And then Vera Farmiga's character... holy moly. I don't understand the motivations behind her actions. Story-wise, KOTM is almost a fail.In other points, the original score is pretty good. Utilising the original 1954 Godzilla theme as a moment of bravoura is a good idea. Bear McCreary has a good discography, and KOTM is one of them. The VFX is pretty good in some sequences.Final verdict : KOTM can be satisfying. The latter has the Kaiju fights that some fans wanted, plus some beautiful images, but this can't save an under-the-radar plot. It's an average Hollywood blockbuster. Pacific Rim did it better. 2014's Godzilla was more balanced.4/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

This tendency is the exact opposite of what you want in a monster movie. For a film coming out in 2019, when CGI is so prevalent and widely acceptable, a movie with just monsters fighting should be pretty awesome.But if there's great monster fights and bad human interactions, then the movie can't be all bad, just don't pay attention to the human parts, right? RIGHT?Wrong. Everytime an instance occurs where the monsters are about to clash, the camera keeps cutting back to some people on an airplane, or some people on a boat, or some people firing nukes. The only people I wanna see when the monsters are fighting are the ones holding on for dear life or being squished by giant feet and falling debris. I don't wanna see an American soldier saving some teenager, yelling, ""Hold on, kid!"" while an American flag waves in the back and the Star-Spangled Banner plays.The monster fights were cool, but for the few frames that we're actually the flippin' monsters.

I thought that it was a good Kaiju flick, a good Godzilla flick and much more on target than the 2014 entry. There is a lot to like here, the appearance of the popular Toho classic monsters, more monster battles, the score (with familiar Toho classic strains) and a number of Easter eggs and references (Like referring to King Ghidrah as ""Monster Zero""). All in all, a satisfying experience for any Godzilla and Kaiju fan. I would give it 3 out of 4 stars.
My biggest gripe was with the way they shot and cut the monster sequences. It seems like the filmmakers went out of their way to cloak the monsters and the battles with darkness, night sequences, storms, rain and fast cutting between dizzying camera moves and close ups. I like to see the monsters clearly, see the action clearly and not be confused or have to guess and not savor what is going on. Part of the reason that my heart will always belong to the Showa era of Godzilla and Kaiju films (1954-1975). It seems like there is a Hollywood mindset that if you show less of the monsters and hide them in dark sequences, they will somehow be more believable to the audience (Much like getting rid of the bright colors and making superhero costumes darker and more drab). This stuff was never created to be BELIEVABLE!...But to be enjoyed! In the 50's monster movies, they didn't spend 30 minutes of screen time, trying to explain the believability of a 50 foot tarantula crawling down the street. Just a ""Must be the product of radiation from A bomb tests"" pretty much covered it!
As a side note, I watched 7 trailers before the movie began and all the action and fights looked the same and the CGI action looked very cartoony!","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

First of all, I love giant monster films, I really do. I wouldn't call myself a hardcore fan, but a fan who simply enjoys films. I have seen both King Kong and Godzilla when I was a kid and I am talking about the old, original versions, which were basically the trademark of high entertainment and upgraded standards on films. I have seen others as well. But, let's focus now on this one. Godzilla - King of Monsters is an average film. It's not terrible in my opinion, but it's not that good, also.The director/writer Michael Dougherty replaced Gareth Edwards (probably because of some obvious reasons) and as I heard, Dougherty is a Kaiju fan. Well, I kind of doubt it. He also seems like a decent writer, but in this film, his writing and directing were really bland - which goes to story and characters. The story is just bland. I think it was just a build up for the last film ""Godzilla VS Kong"". Even the build up towards monsters was kind of weak. I barely felt any excitement when monsters were first introduced in the film. Ghidorah, for example. It's build up was just flat. I mean, come on... Haven't these people, or Dougherty himself ever saw a good story about slowly, but surely building up to a bigger excitement. For example - Aliens (1986), or Jurassic Park (1993). These are films with a nice, reasonable build up. In the first act, they give us a small amount of aliens, or dinosaurs and in exciting and magical way. They did the same here, but there was no magic and no thrill. The story also has some ridiculous points, but I don't want to spoil it. The characters were also bland and they were played by some of the great actors and actresses. Vera Farmiga is a great actress, she tried her best to work something with her character, but her character was just bland at first, later, the most hated one and finally - unredeemable. Really? This character could have a decent story arc, but they decided to ruin it all by giving her a weak motivation based on silly environment fragility, how world population is ruining the planet. OK, I am not going to spoil more here. Yes, I know, it's a monster film, but if you want to put some human characters in it, then make them at least somewhat interesting, relating or likeable. But, we get none of that here. Kyle Chandler is a decent actor, but here, he was nothing special, even his character is one dimensional. Millie Bobby Brown? The teenager kid that was here to connect younger audiences with the film. How? By spewing out names of the monsters and giving exposition to the audiences? I am not sure about Brown's acting abilities, I haven't seen much of her work, but here she was bland, even in the scenes which requires a specific emotion, she could not achieve it. Or, maybe Dougherty doesn't know how to direct his actors. Ken Watanabe, for example (one of the greatest actors of this bunch), his character was interesting and he had an interesting arc, so to say. Ziyi Zhang? Great actress, but she was just there, also to spew out the names and lore of movie monsters. What a waste of a great actress. Maybe they just took her to show that good new diversity in Hollywood. Bradley Whitford? An annoying character, doing nothing but expelling the forced jokes which are not funny. Sally Hawkins? Another great actress, completely wasted here in the mess. Charles Dance? The already established veteran actor, who was typecast as a villain of a sort... but, unfortunately they didn't give him anything to work with. He was casted because of his ""Game of Thrones"" fame. So, in short - dull, uninteresting, annoying characters and utter waste of talent of actors.But, let's focus now on the important stuff - the monsters. CGI is decent in this film, I'll give a point there... The design is really good. Sound effects are good and consistent to monsters. So, Godzilla... he looks awesome. It is basically the 2014 Legendary pictures design, but here he is a bit taller and heavier... I think it was a penis measuring because of the Shin Gojira which was released in 2016 and that one was taller than 2014 US version... so they decided to give him a little bit of ""movie ego Viagra"". The only thing I did not like is his roar. In some places they used a standard Toho Godzilla roar, while in some they used 2014 version roar. Why? Stick to the 2014 roar, it is consistent. Ghidorah looks pretty amazing, I am not gonna lie. The scale of this monster is just overwhelming. The scenes with it are good, they are some of the great visuals in the film. The only thing I did not like with Ghidorah is head design. It really looks like the head of Smaug the dragon... come on, man... There could have been something far more different in shape and looks. And when it comes to the design and scenes of Mothra and Rodan, I don't have complaints. I think that both of them were represented beautifully and faithfully. To be honest, personally I love Rodan's (""Radon"" in Japanese version) appearance in the film. It has a nice build up and it is followed with great music score. So, his appearance did not disappoint. Now, when it comes to the fighting scenes... I think that is one of the biggest weaknesses of the film. In most of them, just when the monsters started their battle, camera cuts to human characters. Why?! It is just preposterous! Now, THAT was the moment where I highly doubted Dougherty's directing. Did he really saw any of the old Godzilla movies? When there is a fight - it is a fight between two monsters! Humans are rarely there. But, here they decided to shove them in. For no apparent reason. Why?! I don't care about them. Just give me a monster fight and I am a happy guy. And not just that... Some of the fights had a different weather conditions, like snow, or heavy rain... which made it difficult to follow the battle. Why ruining the visuals? Stop using snow or rain as a dramatic effect. It's not working anymore and it looks like a cliché. And the colors in the film... sometimes, most often there are two colors - blue and yellow. Is that a symbolism for something? Just give me decent colors, please. This is just pretentious. And there was a shaky cam in couple of scenes... Jesus...The music score was OK, but I am wondering why using Godzilla's original theme composed by Ifukube Akira? Why didn't music composer Bear McCreary created and used his own theme? Wouldn't that be more appropriate? Yes, I understand that is the Godzilla theme, but it's not the US one, it's the Japanese one, from Toho studio. That was a clear fan service, but I think that was fan service with manipulation. Just to assure the fans that they are watching Godzilla. Yes, you are watching it - but if you are already adapting something that comes from the entirely different studio, country and culture, why not adapt it differently? Legendary already had a good, scary theme from 2014 version composed by Alexandre Desplat. Why not using that with some modifications? They could have used opening theme from 2014 and make it sound more heroic. You just cannot deny that original Godzilla theme has some kind of heroic rhythm and vibe to it. The score was OK, but I think, when it comes to the main theme, they were lazy. They used original for blinded fans... Come on, man! Don't be manipulated by that. Cinematography, editing, production design were decent in it's own way....So, overall... I'd say that this film could have been a lot better. If only human characters were not that bland and wasted and if monster fights could have been better visually and not cutting to human characters. If you like it, that's fine with me. I just think that this was a missed opportunity. Or, maybe they just wanted to get that out of the way so that they can give more attention to Godzilla VS Kong? We'll see... If that fails... then... what's the point, Hollywood?","0 out of 5 found this helpful."

And to me, the little, and not so little, Easter eggs were the best part. From G's classic dorsal plates and roar to Mothra's theme. The only missing part was Rodan's theme which I've always been a fan of. Anyhoo, loved the movie and I'd imagine that most Godzilla fans will too.","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

It's just about trying to achieve this image, or that SFX animation.The SFX were pretty decent, but it looked computer-gamey, with 3D models seeming fairly weightless, like the hollow polygon surfaces they actually are.And, besides, the effects are not so interesting when one is disengaged from the action.

I have read briefly of the critiques, this film either lacked human character developments or the human story elements get in the way of the monsters. I didn't think both are true, the human story worked well with the titans'. I think without the 2014's human drama development I would not have appreciated King of Monsters. Simply put, if it's just monsters fighting without depth of story of the human struggles with the monsters, it would make it a flat and boring film. John Wick chapter 3 was in danger of that, it became boring as we were bombarded countless action scenes with less character drama. Godzilla 2 worked IMHO due to it's previous development and continued elements of human story weaved with the monsters' story. Though, the human elements can be confusing at times as I gathered it was time limitation issue to hash out the characters' backdrop a bit more, ie. twin mythologists played by Zhang Ze Yi. In the movie family photo showed twins but in the film there was no introduction to the twin sisters in a coherent way. Apart from few other flaws, Godzilla and the other titans were well made / animated, the CG production and environment were seamless, pacing was good, and great big roaring ending. Soundtrack was great too. What more could we ask for, for a Godzilla movie :).","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

Great for the ""Creature Feature"" spectacle !!Co-written and directed by Michael Dougherty, who has also helmed the spook-fests Trick 'r Treat and Krampus, Godzilla: King of the Monsters stars Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown.There's no such thing as too much Godzilla!Apart from Gojira and Shin Gojira, none of the movies that make up the source material are particularly 'deep' . It needs big, pretty-looking action. It needs a handful of things to look at (for the awe of the Kaiju/Titans is half the fun) this film does it in spades! I got just what I payed for !! An epic Kaiju Battle Royale . Godzilla King of the Monsters was fabulous especially for fans of the original Toho Kaiju genre.It delivers far more satisfying thrills and terrific spectacle when it comes to what fans expect from these kinds of films. Indulges in all the kaiju fights ! 8/10
Godzilla aka Monster Zero.How many of the original Godzilla suits have been preserved?Yes, some of the original Godzilla and kaiju suits do still exist. The majority of the suits used in the Toho Studios productions of the Godzilla series were made of latex, rubber, and foam rubber, and were designed to be used in multiple films. However, due to the nature of these materials and the wear and tear from filming, many of the suits have been either repurposed, destroyed, or worn out over time. There are a few original suits that have been preserved and are on display at museums and special exhibitions, such as the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City and the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Tokyo.The oldest Godzilla suit Toho still has is the 1994 suit used in the Heisi era film Godzilla vs Space Godzilla. All other suits before that have either rotted or been destroyed to the point where they are not recognizable anymore. These are rubber suits and they do rot over time no matter preserved they are kept. They mostly have suits from the millennium era.Now if they had the original 1954 suit above that would be priceless and be kept in a glass container with tight security. But its been 65 years since the original film and the suit does not exist anymore. So Toho decided to make a replica suit from the 1954 film and they did a great job.The oldest suit that still exists is the one from 1994's Godzilla vs Space Godzilla. I have never seen this film I need to add it to my list !","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

The cast is good, but the clichéd dialogue makes for bad acting that it seems forced at times.

The family played by Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Milly Bobby Brown, are now facing a world of monsters, where they have the powers to awaken the biggest and deadliest of titans, which brings out our hero Godzilla to defend humanity one more time from titans that 'Toho Godzilla' fans will absolutely love seeing on the big screen.Now I need to preface this review because it's important to be transparent to the die-hard fans of properties such as Godzilla. I do not have a big knowledge, if not anything but visual references of the Toho Godzilla films. I recall watching the Matthew Broderick 'Godzilla' but as a kid, you kind of just think everything's great that has monsters in them. What also should be said is I really could not connect to the 2014 Godzilla film. I felt it was far too slow, never really fulfilled on the expectations you got from the trailers, however, the visual effects and the overall scope and scale of the big lizard was absolutely mind-blowing (and though it happened far too late, I of course also cheered at the final battle sequence). Frankly, I know I am the outlier here and completely respect why people love this property, I hope you take that into consideration with my review.With 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters' I feel they attempt to overcorrect on the complaints general audiences had with the 2014 version. The action in this film is much more apparent and spread out pretty evenly throughout the film. You get a lot of POV destruction shots, and I felt the pacing of 'KOTM' was much more tuned to keep the audience engaged. The actors do fine in their roles, although they don't really have the best story arcs to expand on mainly due to the effort to steer more towards the fights and explosions. I really don't have anything bad to say on the performances the standout to me was Ken Wantanabe, he gets a really great moment with 'Godzilla' that was the heart of the film for sure.The visual effects were absolutely astounding when it comes to creature design. Looking at the original 'Toho' series it's incredible what they're able to do. This sequel gets to use more characters from the 'Toho' universe such as King Ghidora, Mothra, and perhaps a few surprises for the die-hard fans. The Mothra reveal for me was just jaw-dropping effects wise. they still kept with the epic scale of the fights, where everything feels slowed down but you realize it's because it's two monsters the size of mountains fighting each other. But where it is good, there is bad, and the fighting, it's bad.I had a really hard time following along with some of the fights, where the CGI effects around the monsters (fog, rain, etc) sometimes completely obstructed the view of the fight. I found myself getting really frustrated during the fights because they really never seemed to be choreographed or that there was any attention to how the fights would go down. You get a big moment much like the 2014 film, but the difference to me here is while the 2014 end fight built to the moment, 'KOTM' rushes from fight to fight, and when the emotional final battle arrives, I just felt numb and didn't feel the impact as much as I wanted to in the ending.Also, I cannot WAIT to move past this new trope for villains to always be eco-terrorists. We've seen it with Thanos, and so many other iterations of the same idea that ""humans are the problem, and that's why I can do this crazy thing"". The plot revolves around this and another plot point similar to the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" series, however, in this case, they really didn't know how to incorporate it with Godzilla and just didn't work for me.It's a shame because they don't do much with the story, and what they do with the action often felt sloppy and unrehearsed and while maybe some people enjoy that, I still felt pretty let down leaving the theater. Don't know if I'm ready to be put back into the finger for the upcoming 'Godzilla vs Kong', but for 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters' I would say if you are a die-hard fan definitely check it out, I'm sure you'll love it!","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

The frame size doesn't catch monster as the deserve and the legth doesn't allow a viewer to fully explore what is happening. Feels like some scenes were cut by a machine, because they are so equally spaced.
The fights on the other hand are extremely short for a movie that long. By that I mean a proper monster fight and not just laying around vulnerable waiting for something to distract the opponend, or taking time to get up like in wrestling entertainment. Overall the monsters get beaten up pretty easily. Some should not even be in the movie if all that laying around was only to get destroyed with a single strike.
I believe the slight backlash from this movie will be a lessons learned and the upcoming Godzilla Kong tag team will be presented much better. And again after dissapointing finale I was pleased to learn the first upcoming vilain. I believe he deserves better than Monster 0 in this movie ;).
As a summary: you can't enjoy a movie where a teenager is a lot smarter than high tech scientists.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

I don't understand the praise. I honestly don't. I LOVE GODZILLA, The fights are amazing and the movie is full of fan service, and that is 100% fine, but that does not make anything a good movie, far from it. It is possible to make a good movie with a lot of over the top fan service. This film falls short of the mark for me.Positives: the music was amazing and I'm so happy they got the rights to the originals, special Effects were beautiful, cinematography/screenplay also great and occasionally beautiful. Action great but sometimes very repetitive, also hard to see some things because it's almost always dark, but it delivers nonetheless. The acting is passable, nothing special, some characters shine, but barely and when they do it gets overshadowed by the terrible script.Negative: script was bad. I could not get past it, no matter how good the acting was I couldn't get into it and I tried TWICE. I watched this film the first time extremely irritated at the writing. It had some moments in it that I liked here and there but overall it drags this film down completely. The dialogue is another thing that doesn't work, it manages to do it fairly better than the script, but if the script doesn't then most of the time the dialogue won't. Dialogue did have its moments with characters but overall it was not passable. Plot was by far one of the biggest issues. The characters are already boring and bland. I honestly wanted to FEEL the impact of the death of a chraracter in the movie, who sacrificed himself, because he is my one of favorite characters in this new MONSTER-VERSE, right after Bryan Cranston, who's death had much more meaning than his unfortunately, also going off the fact he was in both films. He was written so boringly, the only best scene he has is the deep scene he has to a character that I forgot the name of, then he goes. I can honestly ramble on but I'm done with the negatives I'll tear this film apartIn the end guys, this movie definitely has it. I CANNOT DENY IT, it has the kick ass brass , it has the grit, it's missing the bronze and the gold. Movie has the badass scenes of action but the buildup to it was not worth it, or impactful. Once the moments that are supposed to happen take place, they mean nothing because of how the shape of this hollow movie is. It doesn't know what shape it wants to be, and when it finds a shape it goes to another shape then another and another, until it's a bunch of shapes overshadowing everything to stand out. Then on top of it all a big ass sticker with monsters over it. Boom, Godzilla: King of the Monsters.5/10 (It's awesomely bad) I'm sorry please don't hate my opinion.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

Amazing action, and a lot of it.This movie avoids two pet peeves I have about blockbuster movies
1. when the protagonists are too strong, and it's not even a challenge or struggle to win.
2. The final battle is too short.This movie definitely avoids those two issues. Godzilla is a lot weaker than gidora, so it's fun to cheer him on. The fights spare no expenses, and they last for a satisfying amount of time.The human characters were passable. The story was honestly fine, not noticeably worse than any other blockbuster movie story line. There are a few questionable decisions, and some motivations for one character that flips back and forth are not entirely fleshed out but that's my only real gripe. Also there are just so many side characters. Many of the side characters could have easily been combined into one.
It has its flaws in terms of the humans story, but its honestly no worse than any other blockbuster.
I have no idea why the critics are so harsh, when something like the mission impossible storylines are just as average, yet it gets 90%+ on RottenTomatoes.Definitely go see it if youre a fan of the first, fan of godzilla, or a fan of giant monsters fighting each other. And the story is honestly not as bad as the critics make out to be.","4 out of 6 found this helpful."
"4","/10","The Most Boring Monster Movie In Recent Memory","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4955698/?ref_=tt_urv","bwilliams-70176","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104758631/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2019","It's been five years since Godzilla - the debut film of Legendary's new Monsterverse - returned the atomic giant to our cinema screens. Taking into account our criticisms of the first film (the main one being that it focused too much on the human characters), writers made it a mission to make the sequel more of an ensemble piece: blending a more balanced mix of monsters and humans into the story. Being the 35th film in the Japanese Godzilla franchise and despite bearing such a grabbing title, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, is as disappointing as its monsters are visually grand.As the story begins, we meet Madison Russell, played by Millie Bobby Brown, who almost anyone with a Netflix account will know as Eleven in Stranger Things. Her mother, Dr. Emma Russel, is a leader of a group of scientists who for some reason think it's a good idea to release more giant monsters upon the world, despite Madison's brother losing his life in the chaos of the first film. Once events inevitably go out of control, it's up to Dr. Mark Russel (Madison's father) and Dr Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), heading their own group of annoying soldiers and Godzilla-friendly scientists to get everything back in order.Cinema-goers may be wondering how a seemingly action-heavy monster movie could possibly be so boring. After all, long shots of certain various monsters, Godzilla included, are a feast for the eyes. Combined with life-giving visual effects, pre-production even involved performance capture for some of Godzilla's monstrous foes, creating immersive movements and lavish shots that could serve as at least ten high quality desktop wallpapers. However, even with these impressive-looking monsters, ""mundane"" sadly still comes to mind far too often, mostly because of the terribly-written human characters.As with any big action set piece, a script often requires a scene or two of downtime before the next one, letting characters breathe and allowing for personal development and stakes to sink in. In Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the bridges between the monster fights are all irritating babbles of exposition in war rooms by one-dimensional personalities. With some fantastic actors in front of the camera, it's a tragedy to see them work with a lazy script ridden with awful dialogue and character arcs that are nonsensical. It's the irritating kind that involves scenes brimming with weak and tired jokes every five minutes, despite being in intense life-or-death situations, only existing to stretch the runtime, whilst merely feigning any hints of sincerity.Ken Watanabe as the Godzilla-loving Doctor is a welcome return from the first film, leading the only genuine, heartwarming scene in this tired sequel. Charles Dance, best known as Game of Throne's Tywin Lannister, is an unfortunate waste of talent as the film's closest thing to a human villain, acting out an arc that struggles to make sense the further it goes along.Even though the monster action scenes are the impressive draws, these are too few and far between given the runtime and the monotonous writing. As much of a relief it is to be thrown into a monster fight after what feels like an eternity, the camera work often takes the thrill away. Heavy with too many zooms and shaky cam shots along with constant cuts away to the human's perspective, the feelings of exhilaration when seeing Godzilla clash with a three-headed dragon only stay for half as long as you expect them to.Thanks to the hard work of talented visual effects artists and film score composers, this is easily the best-looking Godzilla film to date. However, the aesthetics are as far as the quality as Godzilla: King of the Monsters goes. Obsessed with furthering an entire franchise dedicated to the Legendary Monsterverse, it seems the writers and director put together a storyboard of monster fights and wrote down the bare minimum of a story to connect it together. Like looking at the destruction of a Godzilla-torn city, it is a disheartening catastrophe to see a monster movie that's so dull.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

I mean yeah, of course a giant monster is cool as hell but that doesn't take away from the fact that they didn't really go into detail of why the fights were happening besides ""to protect"". I came into this movie not wanting two plots of family and a mix of monster fighting, but something glued together. I want a way for Godzilla to be fighting not just ""for dominance"".

There were two moments that gave me legit goosebumps and few easter eggs that even though I'm not a huge Godzilla fan made me smile.For me Godzilla:King of Monsters is a great example of how Godzilla film can be done right and makes me very impatient to see what is coming in the Monster Universe in the future.Solid 8/10 for me and I recommend it to any monster/Godzilla fans out there.... You will NOT be disappointed :)","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

I can't believe Godzilla KOTM is struggling so much... It's breaking my heart.My personal favorites when talking about past movies was of course the original 1954 Godzilla, 1995's Godzilla Vs. Destoroyah and 1991's Godzilla Vs. King Ghidorah.I saw Godzilla KOTM last Saturday in IMAX and absolutely loved it! The incredible visuals, beautiful yet terrifying design of the monsters, the epic movie sound track and yes, even the characters/plot made for one EPIC ride! I will definitely see it again this coming Saturday and have already pre-ordered the BluRay/4K steel book so I'llget it right when it's released. It was without a doubt better than 2014 Godzilla. Yes it had it's faults but it was an EPIC monster movie regardless.The fact that it's doing nearly as poorly in the box office as the obscenity that is the 98 Zilla is utterly sickening... I blame ROTTEN TOMATOES and SO CALLED CRITICS for the poor box office numbers. You can't trust them because they're not Godzilla fans so they don't understand how the movies are supposed to be. They complain about too much Godzilla in the movie... Really?!? They complain about weak story line and characters... Monster movies are about what???... You guessed it! THE MONSTERS. That's what we want to see and that's exactly what we got!Most Godzilla movies have had a goofy plot and somewhat weak characters but that's what makes them fun! Some have the underlying message like 1954 being about the atomic bomb, 2016 Shin Godzilla being about the government failing to act quickly when it came to Tsunami relief. This one os no different! It has an underlying message in it as well...Personally I don't think the characters/plot in KOTM is bad when compared to past Godzilla movies. If anything, they have improved upon it.This was a movie made for Godzilla lovers, directed and written by a true fan (Michael Dougherty) of the Godzilla series ranging all the way back to the original 1954 Godzilla and it shows through with all of the small nods to past films.Thank you to the cast and crew for making such an amazing film for us Godzilla lovers out there!","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

And IMO, they nailed bullseye with it! Two things quickly become obvious: it's a love letter for all Godzilla (and kaiju fans in general), and they struck gold with director Michael Dougherty. It doesn't take long to realize Dougherty is a Godzilla fan, and he respects the genre with KOTM. This time, he puts more of the focus on the monsters, and a bit less on the human element. It's a nice touch he adds, that even when the monsters aren't on screen the humans are talking about them. It helps to keep some of the focus on the characters that really matter in movies like this.I do think there were a few times where they tried to cram more easter eggs in than what they should have. While it does become a tad stale after a bit, it's not near enough to ruin the film. The SPFX are spot on, the monsters looked as beautiful as ever. Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and especially Ghidorah all look gorgeous, and easily stand next to their Toho originals.For a ""middle of the road"" film (because we're ALL waiting for next year's Godzilla vs Kong remake/sequel), I think KOTM fires on all cylinders. It delivers a great sequel to G'2014, giving fans a spectacular buffet of giant monster battles that showcases their 'bad-assery'. If you set aside your ""realism"" expectations (these ARE sci-fi / fantasy films for a reason), you'll find a film that is true Godzilla in heart and spirit, and a sequel that flew under the radar as underrated (in comparison to ""That Marvel Movie"" that was Godzilla's true opponent), but just as worthy of a summer movie contender.I fully recommend this for all Godzilla/kaiju fans. As my step-daughter said: ""now THAT'S how you make a Godzilla sequel!""","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

I skipped this one in theatres to watch Toy Story 4 and after hearing all the praise this was getting from fans, I obviously was interested.Halfway through the movie though, I ended up throwing in the towel.What I loved about the 2014 Godzilla was the realistic and apocalyptic atmosphere it had. Sure, it didn't have enough Godzilla, but at least, the human characters were INTERESTING. They weren't given comedic traits, the film surprisingly, had a really dark and serious tone, and at the end, I actually enjoyed it.People were complaining a lot about not enough human interactions when in actual fact, it was all about the monsters this entire time. That being said though, I actually felt the opposite and felt like there was too much human interaction in the film, which kind of soured the experience for me. To make matters even worse, there were some jokes in the film that did not work for me.The VFX were good and the monster fights that I came for were exciting. The music is good as well. But sadly, that's about it.King of the monsters was somewhat interesting and fun at first but near the very end, became forgettable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

I am not sure, but this film achieves it.Let's start with the cinematography; it's really bad. The lighting for most of the movie is dark with patches of blue light. It aims for moody, but simply makes everything look flat and the action hard to follow. The camera angles for the monster fights are all wrong - they are all up at monster height or above. This makes the monsters look little better than people in rubber suits standing among model buildings. It completely fails to convey the awe of creatures larger than skyscrapers. Oh, and Godzilla does not appear to have a consistent size throughout the movie (he's as big as a mountain is much larger than his head is 20 foot tall).Then there is the plot, which is effectively non-existent. It makes no sense most of the time. The characters are one dimensional with nonsensical motivations. The disregard for physics is breathtaking. Setting off a nuclear bomb next to Godzilla heals him because he feeds on radiation (let's ignore the heat, blast, etc)? The effect of radiation on ordinary people is utterly ignored.The acting - the less said on this topic the better.In a number of places, the movie attempts a big emotional scene (a character sacrifices themselves), but it consistently falls flat.In short, I would not be surprised if this movie was written and directed by a committee of 12 year-olds. Not worth your time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

This is because a) the human characters can't see what is meant to be going on and actors are actually nowhere near as good at acting against stuff that they can't see as they are acting against things that are visibly present to them. Also b) I want the human characters to die if possible.....in order to relieve the tedium imposed on my patience with this film by their utter awfulness as characterised, motivated and internally consistent ""people""......... and the inability of our super powered monsters to kill off these cretins (even just by the process of collateral damage.) really diminishes their status and the potency of their combat.Once the entirety of the human interest is dispensed with from my consideration of merit (because there never is any...not in the leading protagonists nor in the ""most boring cinematic uber organisation ever fictionalised"" 'Monarch)And once the monsters are similarly degraded by placing us, the audience, into a perspective centred through these useless human characters...Then the main interest is storyline succession: good old fashioned plot, story, ""twists and turns"" if you will; World building sophistication and special effects design.In all these areas barring the sci fi cgi design of two scenes: the Antarctica sequences and Godzilla's configuration for the final battle climax....... 'Godzilla king of the monsters' does nothing impressive in it's sum payoff considering the financial budget, resources and filmmaking know-how invested.As a result I have to give my own rating of a disappointed 3/10 where the extra point over a baseline 2/10 score is for the design work achieved in the two above mentioned sequences....in my opinion they earn a star extra.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

There are no Oscar winning performances here, no deep character development, and a few illogical scenes and reactions. The actors they had could have been written better, but I don't really care. I'm glad there -are- people in it, but only to highlight the Kaiju further.So on what I think the film was aiming to deliver, does it? Yes! In 2014 when they released Godzilla (for the zillionth time) it was met with very mixed reactions. Luckily I went with a packed audience of fans so there was much cheering and fanfare which really brought up the excitement of the movie for me. But it had glaring flaws. Again, not a great cast or acting, but the 2014 film seemed to try and make it more about the people. Appreciable but again I just wanted to see more scenes with giant creatures causing destruction. And then they fumbled with Godzilla himself by making almost every scene super dark and hard to tell what you're looking at at times.That's been fixed this time around. The battles are crisp and clear, the audio is on point if maybe a little funny at times. The sense of power these creatures have is more apparent than ever and the beefy CGI (the few reviews that said the CG was bad I think are straight up trolling) is a delight to watch as a guy who likes to see things get destroyed. :DIn summary, if you like giant monsters or Godzilla you should like this. But if you are overly critical about Old Godzilla vs. New Godzilla, or movies in general, you should probably not watch it. What you see in the trailers is pretty much what you get, though. I hope this review helps some people!","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

Alot of weird critic reviews have given this a blast however I find it's what a sequal should be, has a little bit of fill in the details for the monsters and human stories incase you're new to the monsterverse but it really doesn't treat previous movie viewers like idiots.
All the mentions of the past two movies are well placed for people that listen.
And the apparent lack of human drama? Nope, as you watch 2014 godzilla, you'll find out the human side of the story. You see the cast coming to grips with all this destruction. And it changes them.
This new movie shows that change. It shows how the humans in this movie adapted to the monsters.
So many are ranting about the lose of a human connection in this. But it's baseless as this isn't what the movie is for. You build that connection in the first movie. And I can see that same method being used in kong vs godzilla. We know the cast, we don't want to see the exact same screen time given to story and drama when it was already shown in spades in the previous movie. AnywaysAbsolute blast of a movie as it doesn't try to wedge everything in. I just loved that there were so many fights. Very very refreshing to see a movie that doesn't just have a single scene for all the action.
It keeps amazing you with fights, let's you relax and then comes back with even more violence.
This is how fights in entertainment should be. The wwe of monster fights.","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

You know it's processed and unhealthy, like junk food, but it at least provides some stimulus and fills in a gap. I wonder how many actually left the multiplexes after seeing this feeling like they'd seen a really great picture or something of merit or whether the population just stumbled blindly out, incensed and numbed by it all? Feeling out of pure conformity that they'd had a good time and got their money's worth. Could we all be so lame and anaethetised as to support this dross as worthy entertainment still today or has the child in me just become obscured by mature age and general crankiness? Like a virtual re-write of the earlier product (for those who merely want to see the movie again but in a slightly different form), its like sitting in one of those interactive arcade games, except you're having to play it through a huge smokescreen. I watched this, outside of it's theatrical release of course, to see whether anything entertaining could come from it or whether it could possibly be totally devoid of any entertainment level whatsoever. Well, the young actress playing Madison was sharp (although she did recover a little too rapidly after the assumed termination of her mother to feel comfortable with). The Action Movie clones and the warm humanity on display about the rescuing of the human race were all in place of course but wasn't 'quite as stifling or insufferable as one may have anticipated. Watching Emma's character I kept drifting off into thinking I was watching a continuation of The Conjuring franchise, what with all the evil pyrotechnics bombarding the screen. Towards the three quarter mark however, I was wanting and willing the movie to end. I'd had enough and was frankly bored. Might I have been the only one...?","0 out of 4 found this helpful."

If you're reading the critical reviews and questioning whether you should see this in theaters you need only ask one simple question. Do you like Godzilla? Then you'll love this movie, flat out. People are criticizing the film for poor character development, boneheaded human decision making or bad acting. Really? REALLY? A film series literally born of a man in a rubber dinosaur costume trampling toys cars, trains and cardboard skyscrapers and you want Emmy award winning acting? NO ! You're here for one reason. To see larger than life creatures in amazing CGI destroy anything and everything in their paths.Much like the Marvel Cinematic universe takes heroes out of their Underoos, spandex and pajamas and make them into believable modern gifted humans so too does Godzilla get the main out of the underoos and to scale with great special effects. I grew up watching all of the old Toho films and I've shared them with my kids. They were on the edge of their seats and wanted to watch this movie again and again if they could.If you want riveting plot lines and award winning acting save up for the Cannes Film Festival. If you want incredible special effects, nonstop action, love monsters particularly Godzilla you will not be disappointed.No strings attached. No subtitles or lips that don't sync to the words. As others have said....it's the Godzilla film we've all wanted to see as only a big budget American blockbuster could do. Goodbye Matchbox cars, Lionel trains, model airplanes, Kenmore refrigerator skyscrapers and Matthew Broderick iguanas....this is the King in all his glory taking on all comers in the ultimate Godzilla film !!!","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

Clear unobscured shots of creatures last for a mere few seconds, before the camera starts shaking and lights blind you. It's an obvious and tropey technique.The dialog however, is abysmal. It has clearly been crafted with all the love of writer that was handcuffed and told they've got 10 minutes to write 100 lines of dialog or they'll be shot, but they finished in 5 minutes. The most obvious thing is always said. With no twists, no surprises.The cast are completely wasted. Millie Bobby brown hasn't really proven herself yet. We've seen one decent performance from her. But even a proven actress couldn't carry her script. At one point in the film she declares ""she's scared"" in one of the most unconvincing declarations I have ever seen on film. The fact that her few actions in the film are completely devoid of any self preservation or fear, completely undermine her words.The action isn't anything special either. There's perhaps one moment in the entire film that gives us something new, in the franchise at least. And even then, it's nothing original or interesting.As a casual viewer that thought the first film was enjoyable enough that I was excited to see the sequal, I was thrilled that I could leave the cinema when the film finished. It wasn't interesting, it wasn't enjoyable.My girlfriend, who has a film degree, slept for an hour and a half in the cinema. Say no more.","0 out of 6 found this helpful."

Now that the sequel to 2014's Godzilla has been released, I can happily say it did not disappoint.Usually Godzilla films are seen as ""dumb"" and while I agree that a lot of them are bad, some of them can impress me. With that said, this film shows me a new world where these ""Titans"" are put into the real world. I liked all the performances in here, the action was breathtaking, the CGI was great and so were the sets. Unfortunately this film feels like it's trying to shove in winks and nods to the upcoming Godzilla vs. Kong crossover which can stop the movie and advertise the next one. Also even though Ghidorah is awesome, it feels like he doesn't live up to what we were promised, he does SOME cool stuff and then gets other monsters to do stuff for him. Still I can't say the movie made me mad and I will gladly watch it again.","4 out of 7 found this helpful."

The script is bad, I mean cliche ridden bad; both the plot and the dialogue needed a good rewrite to create anything even vaguely satisfactory. Or, if that wasn't going to be possible, large chunks needed removing to include more monster mash action. Too much of the film involves recognisable faces, but very few decent characters, standing around saying bad dialogue. If the dialogue had been good or the characters well crafted, this wouldn't have been so bad. But you're left just twiddling your thumbs for too long waiting for the monsters to come back on screen as they are far more entertaining to watch. And when they do finally appear, they stay around for far too brief a time. Considering this is supposed to be a grand brawl of a movie, the much anticipated CGI smackdowns barely last long enough to enjoy. All that remains are a few striking visuals (every monster likes to pose dramatically) and a sense that things should have been so much better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

With his kaiju buddies there's a lot of jaws for your buck. These Titans once dominated the Earth, and Monarch Sciences, the Agency that seeks to protect them, believes that they are the solution to stabilise it again, after we humans have tried to destroy it. Maybe they will eat our litter? The more nuclear the better. But the US Government isn't too fond of the Titans since they destroyed San Francisco, specifically Godzilla, in 2014, and want Monarch shut down. I normally find eco disaster movies worthy but too po faced, eg Disney's Tomorrowland and Downsizing, but give me giant monsters and the eco disaster is all about the fun, with plenty of money shots.While Sally Hawkins as one of the Monarch team is pleading the Titans case to the US Senate, they hear Vera Farmiga's Dr. Emma Russell and daughter Madison, played by Millie Bobby Brown, have been kidnapped by Charles Dance's ex British military crazy and his eco terrorists, from one of the Monarch labs. The delegation needs to regroup, and they need help.The Russells used to live in San Francisco and both worked for Monarch, husband Mark played by Kyle Chandler now lives off grid as the Alpha photographing a wolf pack. He no longer has any interest in the Monarch organisation and blames Godzilla for his son's death when San Francisco was flattened by him. But with new skin in the game he agrees to help.I thought Michael Dougherty was very clever to introduce Emma and Madison living their seemingly innocuous new life at home, until they go outside. And we find Emma is chief monster whisperer with the 'Orca' a frequency machine that her and Mark created to talk to the Titans. And she was very successful with a new hatchling, named Mothra. Up close Mothra has potential to be very beautiful when she re-emerges from her chrysalis. If we don't know which of the Titans will be on our side, I'm guessing Mothra will be.But it turns out that Emma, far from being kidnapped is not on our side, and is instead part of the eco terrorists plan to reintroduce the kaiju into the world. But their plan surely seems a little excessive in trying to rebalance our fragile ecosystem by introducing 17 potential monsters. I assume Monarch's plan was toothless kaiju? But in Antarctica, where Mark and the team have followed her, Emma tells them what her reasons for it are. I don't buy that it is for her dead son though. Seems a tad over egging the grief pudding. And then she releases Ghidorah, a fire breathing three headed alien dragon, as the lab crashes down among her Monarch rescuers. And Mark, as Madison watches in horror. Ghidorah or Monster Zero as Monarch have labelled him, is Godzilla's former foe from eons ago, explains Zhang Ziyi's Dr. Ling Chen. Did Monarch grow him or find her, I cannot remember to be honest and don't know enough about the Godzilla history. But he is calling the kaiju to him, as mankind struggles to save itself. Take that global warming. How'd you like it now.If anyone could challenge Ghidorah it's Godzilla, who rather than being dead after his 2014 exploits, is very much alive. And him and Mothra have got a thing going on. It's sweet, it's like a mythical love story for all ages; the moth and the monster. She just batters those wings at him when she calls and he answers. In attempting to kill off Ghidorah, the military detonate a bomb, with Godzilla eating a chunk of nuclear energy. With terrific CGI, Monarch staff are seen flying refugees out of Mexico and straight into the plane, now that was impressive flying, if it was real, just in time to see Godzilla take the hit. Of course Ghidorah just grows a new head, after the big man took a bite out of one of the three in their epic battle.What hope for mankind now with Godzilla dead? He's like Rexy in Jurassic World, more teeth when you need them most, but also has a penchant for trampling on things. When he takes on King Kong who am I supposed to root for? Kong does have a fine line in protecting women, after he's grabbed them first of course. I guess Kong is just too un woke for today.Of course Godzilla isn't dead, he's just nursing a big hangover. When the Monarch submarine attempt to find him I missed him at first in the gloomy shadows. He's the big green lizardy type thing and looks a bit like Pete's Dragon. Invisible! With heroics from Ken Watanabe under the sea, and Millie Bobby Brown taking the fight topside to Fenway Park, one for the Red Sox fans. There is a storm coming to Boston, and it's not the English.There is an after credit Easter egg and god knows what he's going to do with it. Is Jurassic Park still open?I thought Godzilla was a double popcorn blast, hugely entertaining and CGI's to within an inch of its life, but where are today's monsters without it. The men in lizard suits of the 70s Doctor Who. I saw Michael Dougherty's Krampus in 2015, a fun Christmas horror, and I wouldn't mind seeing him helm Godzilla v Kong on Skull Island. I enjoyed Bradley Whitford's humour as Dr. Rick Stanton, and hope he's in it too.","4 out of 7 found this helpful."

Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah, to be specific, with a whole slew of freshly-concocted secondary beasts stomping around in the backdrop.These fresh takes on a familiar trio are bold and beautiful, magnificent updates on a classic set of character designs. Matched with an impressive elemental tone-setter or two - Ghidorah enveloped by a swirling thunderstorm, Rodan birthed from the belly of a volcano, Mothra hibernating beneath the veil of a misty waterfall - the monster effects are breathtaking; forboding, painterly and mythical in their execution. Those expertly-directed promo posters that preceded the film's release were no ruse. The entire movie looks that good. A shame, then, that the story couldn't have been better.Even by old-school Godzilla standards, this one's a stinker. It shouldn't take much effort to shift the scene from one preposterous slice of movie mayhem to another, but King of the Monsters makes the job look awfully tough. From flimsy talking points to one-dimensional characters, plot cartwheels to scientific hand-waves, it's a universal phone-in. If the assumption is that nobody's come to watch the little people run around and stress over the monsters, that's correct. That doesn't mean we won't notice when their motivations stop making sense and their master plan is strung together with scotch tape and twine. I wanted to love it, and when I managed to stop thinking and gape at the big guys, I did. But that was only true about fifty percent of the time. Hence, half-credit.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

There are many, defined by location in a multivariate monster space (MVMS) with dimensions of geography and culture (Japan versus US franchises and viewers), physical implementation (suitmation, cartoon, or CGI/motion capture), priority of monster versus message, his motivations (hero, anti-hero, victim or villain), and cinematographic tone (goofy to darkly atmospheric). These variables are not all independent.Over 65 years and 35 movies, mostly Japanese, Godzilla's trajectory in this space has been influenced by geopolitical, sociological and commercial events, including war, atomic bombs, nuclear bomb testing, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, nationalism, economic depression and recovery, and television's inroads on movie viewership.The basic plot of GKOM is a quasi-Noah's ark scenario: Ruthless echo-terrorists who place everyone else in the planet-poisoning deplorables bucket (they've probably seen the piles of garbage in Central Park after Earth Day celebration), plan controlled release of previously sleeping, gestating, and/or frozen titans to achieve near-extinction of humanity while holed up in subterranean ark equivalents, on-call for a global do-over. They work with a rogue cryptozoologist and conflicted fellow-traveler, who has developed a bio-acoustical device known as Orca, that is reminiscent of my first oscilloscope in middle school physics lab, but importantly allows control of Titan behavior. What could possibly go wrong?For starters, controlled release might be an overly ambitious (not to mention somewhat oxymoronic) goal, especially since one of the titans known as Monster Zero or Gidorah, arguably the biggest and baddest, has its own agenda that doesn't accommodate power sharing. Enter Godzilla as protector and restorer of equilibrium.GKOM is primarily a titan ground & pound film, the polar opposite of Gareth Edward's inaugural 2014 film, whose deft, tension building restraint was wrongly criticized. Pay close attention because the action in GKOM flits around the world like a James Bond movie. At one point I thought the scene was an underground cave in China but then emerges in view of downtown Boston. The human drama and characters are rather secondary/rudimentary and I was disappointed on the transient or gratuitous roles of some wonderful actors like Sally Hawkins who are just hard to not watch. Unlike the first film, GKOM incorporates a bit of comic dialogue and character development, most or all of it intentional, which I found an enjoyable tension breaker.There is an overarching don't mess with mother nature (or let sleeping titans lie)/human arrogance thread in GKOM. While I was not surprised by the absence of post-movie audience chatter about the relationship between man, technology and environment, Jean-Jacque Rousseau's influence on environmentalism, or whether to vote for a Green New Deal, I perceived some interesting nuances. With the caveat that distinguishing intended versus retro fitted movie messages is not hard science, the evil antagonist titan generates hurricane like weather around it, begging the question if it is the postal titan for climate change but then it was the ecoterrorists who caused it, which is not a perfect fit with current headlines. I also discerned a novel benefit-risk thematic element-specifically that radiation, like any other form of energy is natural, not all bad, and that other novel deployment of presumably non-nuclear and non-fossil fuel-based energy can be misused to great human detriment too. In fact, GKOM answered the question raised in the original 1954 film about the dangers of any novel weapons, by botching things with the oxygen destroyer, which to my knowledge is not based on nuclear energy (though even with a degree in chemistry I am still scratching my head about how this device, whose only documented field testing was in a table top fish tank in the 1954 original, might work).It's easy to go off the interpretative rails, especially during politically turbulent times: How about Godzilla as an open borders, globalist titan swimming around the world, oblivious to national boundaries helping everyone (a likely ""nay"" voter on Brexit?) while King Kong (who makes the briefest return cameo and will face off with Godzilla in 2020's Godzilla versus Kong), is the Donald Trump of the MonsterVerse (i.e. ""SkulI island First"", ""Make Skull island Great Again"") since he prioritizes his own titan turf (i.e. the aforementioned Skull Island). Better move on.Visually it offers glorious spectacles, but its' often dark and murky palette sometimes limits visible Titan surface detail, making some moments in Kaiju clashes a bit hard to follow and less realistic. I don't know how much was intended to lower the computational burden of the CGI versus an apt atmospheric choice, which worked well at times.The titans often have beautiful, intricate details and expressive faces. Kaiju model master Yuj Sakai, declared the current Godzilla appears ""more combative, dignified and cool"". To me his relatively brachycephalic head, larger arms and torso also makes him appear quite cute, and somewhat reminiscent of my French bulldog from some angles. Visibly festooned with lush bio-ornamentation in the form of osteoderms, scutes, and most notably, his signature glowing stalactite-like dorsal plates, he is a commanding and exuberant biological presence. There is good but not perfect Godzilla ""version control"" but this may be noticeable only to Kaiju cognescenta.Mothra is beautifully and luminously rendered in a novel way, a benevolent, endearing, and plucky titan, possibly most heroic of them all. I now pledge to never harm a moth if I don't have to (full disclosure: I was already a capture-and-release type of guy). The details of Gidorah's heads and their individual personalities ""has many elements to display formative beauty"", to again quote Sakai, but otherwise its' torso is relatively monolithic between the wings and below the necks (Gidorah has 3 heads). I wouldn't describe Rodan as beautiful, but he is eye-catching with his massive pterosaur cranium, intense avian eyes, and perpetually ember-emitting body A plethora of other interesting titans get cameos, undoubtedly on call for next year's Godzilla versus Kong.The titan fight choreography can be stunning, but sometimes choppy. The human-titan fight choreography is minimal. It is signature feature of these films that conventional weapons are useless against titans, but at least in the Japanese franchise you see clearly how hard the JDF is trying. Here the presumably US forces are the only ones involved (where is NATO, Israeli, Chinese, or Russia military?) but just seem to be sailing and flying around. Except for a thrilling and fantastic aerial fight sequence between the air force and Rodan.I am not too picky about scientific coherence and grade on a curve. I only bring it up because some reviews mocked story elements about restorative environmental effects of radiation as unscientific rubbish. I am not sure why particular scientific gaps get my attention, while numerous thermodynamic and biomechanical implausibilities don't, but it seems to occur with garden variety violations of basic Newtonian mechanics, and there are a few, not to mention an all too fast head titan head regeneration. But so what? Did the roar of Tai fighters in the near vacuum of space debase Star Wars? In a crude sense, the aforementioned radiation effects were not problematic for me. Perhaps the concept of radiation hormesis is not covered in film school critic curricula.Bear McCreary scoring is a triumph. Godzilla and Mothra's themes were enhanced orchestrations of legacy movie music while Rodan and Gidorah get entirely new scores. For Godzilla's theme he enhanced the original score from the composer Akira Ifukube with Taiku drum groups, transforming originally nationalistic pro-JDF music into stirring Godzilla-to-the rescue music. Bear wrote that when he first played the completed score for director Michael Dougherty while watching footage of a reanimated Godzilla rising Lazarus-like from the sea on his way to fight round two with Gidorah, he saw a tear in the director's eye. I believe it, because I was choked up too.I give GKOM one-and-a-half opposable thumbs-up. I 'm middle aged, relatively high functioning and ""approximately normal"" and cheered and teared during GKOM. I have spoken with many people about Godzilla, read many articles, and watched many Youtube vides beyond the trailers (much to my wife's dissatisfaction). Both the intensity and the quantitative and qualitative variability in people's feelings and reactions is quite fascinating. A colleague of mine who went to see GKOM en masse with friends and families, reported adults wearing costume dorsal plates and crying during the movie, one man even openly weeping into his martini (Note: the information is insufficient to exclude reverse causality in the latter case, which was observed in a theater with full meal and bar service during this PG-13 film). In numerous interviews director Michael Dougherty' verbalized feelings uncannily similar to mine, confirming that it was a labor of love. My hypothesis is that a combination of residua from our childhood insecurities or powerlessness in combination with a mouth-agape sense of wonder at nature's cabinet of living curiosities, are risk factors for being enamored with the character. In any event Godzilla has thrown his weight around with great impact.","4 out of 7 found this helpful."

I've been watching the movies ever since I was a kid. I watched the 98 version when I was 10 and continued to watch the cartoon. I liked the 2014 version but wasn't to crazy about the ""Jaws"" approach they took for showing Godzilla. I liked this movie a lot more than that one. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a blast! The monster fights were made very well. They can get a bit chaotic sometimes but it adds to intensity of it all. Godzilla is needed in this movie to face off with King Ghidorah, Mothra, and Rodan to become King of the Monsters. The humans are more tolerable this time around. I didn't care for their story but the actors playing them made up for it. Millie Bobby Brown in her big screen debut was a delight. She was a fun character to follow throughout the movie. Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler were great new additions as well. The special effects were amazing! I remember back in the old days we would go see disaster films because the special effects were so cool. This movie reminds me of that. The monsters looked awesome.

I tended to watch the same ones over and over again, but I ended up seeking all of them out as an adult. I remember seeing the 1998 remake with my father and sister in the theater. I enjoyed the most recent remake and the talk of this universe they were building. When hearing about this film, I had to see it. I thankfully got to see it early as a surprise showing was happening at my theater. The synopsis is the crypto-zoological agency Monarch faces off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah.This film starts off back in 2014. In San Francisco when Godzilla was on a rampage there. Since then, the organization Monarch has been seeking out the large monsters to keep track of and monitor them. Their goal to keep them from waking up, but the military is considering just exterminating them to prevent the loss of human life. I should point out here that it is an interesting nod to all of the names of monsters that have some kind of monarchy associated with them as well.There is a family that is torn apart. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and his wife Dr. Emma (Vera Farmiga) lose their son in 2014 during the attack. This drives them apart with Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), their daughter, staying with her mother. The two of them are in China monitoring what turns out to be an egg containing the larva of Mothra. Things take a turn when some ecological terrorist attack, freeing Mothra and the them taking Emma and Madison.She has created a machine that can stop the monsters with a frequency, but it also can make them angry as well. They use this to free what they are calling Monster Zero, who turns out to be King Ghidorah. This draws Godzilla into battle, but the giant lizard cannot defeat him. The military gets involved and makes things much worse. The terrorist also wake up Rodan from his volcano in Mexico. King Ghidorah wakes up the rest of the known kaijus on the planet. There is also a secret about the three headed dragon that Dr. Ilene Chen (Ziyi Zhang) thinks she has discovered.Now I wanted to go a bit more vague than usual here. Most of what I recapped is literally within the first 15 minutes of the film. The rest is really at the end of the first act of the film. Being this film officially hasn't had any official showings as of the time of writing this, I wanted to make sure that if anyone read this, the film wouldn't be ruined for you.The first thing I really should talk about is I think a lot of people aren't going to consider this a horror film. I personally don't blame you. I do think that kaiju films are definitely horror adjacent for me. The thought of giant monsters destroying cities and killing all of the people that they do is pretty horrific. Now this film does have some pretty bleak moments, it is no where near as dark as the original Godzilla film was.These films are quite interesting to me, as I think quite a bit of them are fun while they can also be cheesy. This one does have some cheesy lines by some of the characters, especially Dr. Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford). I can really let that slide to be honest. What they really need to do is balance the giant monsters fighting and the humans' story. I think this one does that well.The human story is interesting in this as the reason the terrorist group is doing what they are doing is because humans are ruining the planet and as a race we are pretty much garbage. As bleak as stating this sounds, I am 100% in agreement with this. I really like that aspect, because there is a duality between trying to save us while we destroy the planet or allow natural progression to happen with the monsters doing what they are made to do.Going along this story, I absolutely love the concept of incorporating mythology into the lore of these monsters. There are some really cool images that are used to associate with them that I was a big fan of. As a lover of mythology, this was definitely an aspect that really hit home for me.This film does have some really good fights between the monsters as well. I personally love the realism of how all of these giant creatures look and that really made me happy to see. I will say here that it is definitely CGI heavy, which actually turned out to be just fine for me. It never took me out of it which was surprising. I think that the effects in this film are great to be honest.As I kind of touched on a couple of paragraphs up, the balance of the kaijus and the humans is an interesting balance you need. I think that writer/director Michael Dougherty does an excellent job of that. Now I know him from Trick 'r Treat which was a horror anthology and Krampus, where he had to balance different aspects for each film. I think that experience really shines through. Being this film was just over 2 hours, it didn't feel like and I was on-board the whole way. The ending is even interesting alluding to the next film that is supposed to be coming.Acting for the film I thought was really good as well. There is such an interesting cast with Chandler, Farmiga and Brown as the broken family. They all did great. I was glad to see that they used Ken Watanabe, who is an amazing Japanese actor as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. I thought he was great too. Zhang, Whitford and the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well. I could go on and on here, but I won't.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film. I saw that Bear McCreary did it I was excited. I first saw his name for The Walking Dead. What I really like about this film though, he incorporated music from the original film and other ones in the series while also doing his own thing as well. It really fit and definitely helped enhance the scenes.Now with that said, I might be running off the high of the film, but I really did enjoy it. I liked how they incorporated a solid social message into this film while giving us what we really want. This was brought to life by great acting and writing for sure. There was a bit of cheesiness to it, but I come to expect that. I think the editing of the film keeps the balance, keeps it interesting and the ending was solid. It is CGI heavy, but it looked. The soundtrack of the film was also helped to enhance the scenes as well. I would have liked to know more about some of the monsters that I didn't recognize, but if these films keep having the success I think they will, they definitely could later. I would definitely recommend giving this film a viewing. I thought it was really good.","3 out of 5 found this helpful."

And the few moments of that were perfect, almost all were in the trailer tho, the photography at some points was incredible, looked like illustrations, and the sound was quite good. But we should establish we don't care about the plot nor the human characters as we don't care about the movie trying to explain the technology or how the monsters work, doesn't make sense, perfectly alright.
This is the one movie I don't care about cameras flying unrealistically or almost-satellite shots of the battle, so why cut non-stop the monster battle after less than 5 seconds of fighting with shots of people being chased or other uninteresting stuff.
I don't care about the human characters in this movie, in fact I was hoping they died and stopped interrupting the monster fights. I thought it was clear what we all wanted to see.
The sense of scale was ok but most of the monster scenes were in darkness, that and the cutting of the battles looked like they were trying to save budget, which I don't understand as Shin Gozilla accomplished the same sense of huge scale, destruction and great 3D and in daylight with a minimal budget in comparison.
And I understand mainstream audiences used to blockbuster effects would see the monster in Shin Godzilla as goofy and the movie boring because they talk a lot, but when the monsters appeared technically it looked great and they didn't cut every 3 seconds with something completely different, if they had taken that cue for KOTM it would have been an amazing monster movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

The film spans 2 hours and 12 minutes, with only 30 minutes at most showcasing Godzilla. The film's plot is incredibly boring and dragged out. Outside of the Kaiju plotline, there's not much to this story. The human characters serve as dialogue devices, in which they just regurgitate information about Godzilla. The story revolving around the human characters is incredibly forced and melodramatic. The character motivations are completely stupid and contradictory. The film is held back severely by the human characters. The Kaiju fights are incredible. Godzilla and the other Titans look realistic. The CGI and Visual Effects are amazing. The action is everything you'd expect from a Kaiju movie. The cinematography is textbook. The film poorly, dragging from the end of Act 2 until the end of the movie. The acting is pretty bland (but they weren't given good material to work with). Despite this being a sequel, the events of the first film serves no purpose other than being a vague flashback. Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a boring, melodramatic Western interpretation on a Kaiju film; placing the Kaiju in the background as mere scenery.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

Godzilla 1998, from Roland Emmerich, squandered the potential of the King of the Monsters being introduced proper to western audiences. Then, the 2014 film, from Gareth Edwards, came around, and I felt that film was proof that Hollywood had learned from its mistakes by actually portraying Godzilla as the mighty super-beast that he always was. So, there was a lot of potential for a sequel to not only introduce other iconic Toho monsters, such as Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah (who are the ones that did end up appearing in said sequel), and do them justice much like Godzilla himself, but also expand the franchise to wider audiences. Thus, Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019), directed by Michael Dougherty, came to be. I must say that Godzilla: King of the Monsters is not only the best Godzilla film ever (as bold as such a statement may be, and I'll elaborate on why) but also such an amazing monster film in its own right and even one that I've wanted to see my whole life. Now, with all that said, let's take a look at why this film is as great and vastly-underappreciated as it is.The plot of the movie deals with Monarch, the organization behind tracking and studying giant monsters, or ""Titans"" as known by the public, trying to stop the three-headed dragon-like monster King Ghidorah from destroying the world as well as relying on Godzilla to fight the new threat for the title of alpha Titan. Seems like a basic type of plot that one would come to expect from a Godzilla film, right? Well, that's the beauty of it. It's a straightforward plot that's easy to follow and understand, and it gives us a cast of characters worth caring about to boot as well as properly carry over the themes from the previous 2014 film about nature and man's place in it all.
The film expands on the themes that Godzilla 2014 touched upon, with regards to nature being such a powerful force that cannot be contained or meddled with by mankind should the world and its inhabitants be able to thrive. While the human antagonists have ecological reasons for doing what they're doing, even that turns out going against their favor because of Ghidorah being a much greater threat, leaving it all up to Monarch and Godzilla to set things right once again and restore balance to the natural order of things.
The characters, at least when it comes to the main characters, while not the most complex, are still compelling in their own right; they serve the plot in a meaningful way and they all have understandable motivations for doing what they do. Even the monsters themselves are given personalities, and just by their expressions and body language one can tell what they're thinking without any dialogue or commentary needed; Ghidorah especially is given much more personality for each of his three heads than he did in any of his previous incarnations.The cast all-around does a great job. Kyle Chandler plays Mark Russell, and he is incredible; he very much conveys the desperation that his character is feeling during the world-threatening situation that he is in and that his ex-wife and daughter are in. Vera Farmiga also does a great job as Dr. Emma Russell; she given a lot to work with, conveying the emotional drama of a woman who's doing what she thinks is the best for all despite the grave consequences that would come of it. Millie Bobby Brown, who plays Madison, is given a good amount of drama to chew on and she nails her role. Ken Watanabe reprises his role from Godzilla 2014 as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa and he does such a great job in the role especially considering how much more he and his characters are given to do this time around; granted, Ken Watanabe is great in anything, but that doesn't change how well he does in this film. Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn, who also carry over from the 2014 film, do good despite their limited roles. Charles Dance also does a great job as the human antagonist. Bradley Whitford and Thomas Middleditch work well as comic-relief characters, and Zhang Ziyi does a very good job as well despite her limited role; Zhang Ziyi's character is also given an Easter egg which I very much appreciated.When it comes to the direction of the film on the visual side of things, Michael Dougherty, considering his smaller film background prior, has proven himself to be such an immense talent when it comes to making a film look great, because Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an absolute feast for the eyes. The monsters, particularly the main ones (Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, and Ghidorah) who are each given such a proper update. The action sequences are done with such finesse and intensity that they immerse you into the experience, and are also shot in a way that is consistent with what Gareth Edwards did for the 2014 film; while the film still does cut from the monsters doing their thing to the human characters caught in the middle, the scenes with the humans are still done in a way where the intensity of the situations they're in is still prominent throughout and really gives the viewer such a sense of scale as humans are running around and/or terrorized during monster battles of godlike proportions. It helps just how glorious it is to see Godzilla and Ghidorah clashing being done in such spectacular fashion, and they have quite a few bouts throughout the film so that makes for an extra plus for the film. The sequence centering on Rodan is also such an intense one that will leave one on the edge of their seat. Even Mothra has some great, memorable moments that showcase how no-nonsense of a creature she is. The film also provides scenes of wonder even during moments that don't involve absolute monster carnage, such as a moment of Godzilla blasting his atomic breath into the sky which will stick out as such an iconic visual moment in not just the Godzilla franchise but in monster cinema in general.The score by Bear McCreary is beyond epic. Not only does he do such amazing renditions of the classic Godzilla theme as well as Mothra's theme, but even the original music he composes, including new themes for Ghidorah and Rodan, is incredible. His score compliments the film perfectly throughout, whether it's during the monster action or during the quieter moments revolving around the humans. And, of course, there's the cover of Blue Oyster Cult's ""Godzilla,"" that features Serj Tankian from System of a Down doing the lyrical work, which is such an adrenaline-pumping track.While it is such a shame that its box office numbers weren't as strong as one could've hoped thus resulting in the effort in expanding the Godzilla franchise to wider audiences to be not as fruitful as it could've been, none of those downsides change how absolutely magnificent Godzilla: King of the Monsters is. From the great performances from the overall cast and the spectacular set pieces, to the monsters themselves being done so much justice and the incredible soundtrack, this film took me back to the days when I would watch Godzilla movies on VHS and reenacts the fight scenes with my toys while also imagining what it could possibly look like with modern technology and a massive budget. The film was everything to me and, as both a Godzilla fan and a fan of movies, I can't thank Michael Dougherty enough for going above and beyond with making such an incredible piece. No matter what underwhelming box office numbers or what bad reviews may indicate as far as the MonsterVerse as a whole is concerned, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is without any doubt the best Godzilla movie ever as well as one of my favorite monster movies ever, and it is a film that is truly worthy of its namesake; none of those statements are based on any hype, they're based on the honest feelings of a Godzilla (and monster movie) fan.

The acting was far better this time around than in the 2014 film.I took my wife and kids to see it tonight and I was fearful at first because of all the bad reviews I've seen, but man did we ever enjoy it!

Sorry to the reviewers who are upset with the background buildings looking bad...Really? That's a negative? Get a life. I figure that most of the critics are not fans of the environment, that's the only conclusion I can come up with. There is a strong environmental message in the movie and maybe that just rubs some people the wrong way.Anyway, go see Godzilla, you will have a blast! This is the kind of movie you should see on the big screen I'm sure glad I did!

This made up for it tenfold! If you're going in looking for plot, you won't find it, but if you're going in just to turn off your brain for a couple hours and watch monsters duke it out for superiority, this is the film for you! It's like a robotless ""Pacific Rim."" Other critics complained about this one having too much action, (which is weird, since they complained about the 2014 one not having enough action), but I didn't think so. For me, monster movies can never have too much action. I was smiling and internally cheering practically the whole time. This is what movies were made for! Fun escapism. (For the most part, anyway. There was some of that seemingly mandatory ""Mankind is bad and screws everything up"" garbage that seems to be in most films like this nowadays. I rolled my eyes and could have done without that, because it took me out of the movie, but other than that, it was fantastic!)

And the cinematography and special effects grew better over the decades. I haven't seen the Warner 2014 Godzilla but I have seen Shin Godzilla, and its hardly surprising it won best picture in Japan.Here's the thing folks: one is either a fan of kaiju films or one isn't. A true fan overlooks the the monster silliness...what can I say, we go with the story and buy into it fully. Godzilla king of the monsters was definitely not silly. 'Zilla was as big and nasty as I've ever seen him but he also displayed traits I'd expect to see in higher mammilians not dinosaur-like kaiju. Godzilla was a surprise but this made it easy to cheer for him. The film has hissable villians.

The film simultaneously has many great elements and ideas but is nonetheless heavily flawed in its execution. Of course the whole discourse on human characters and story has become tiresome, especially when fans want to throw the whole series under the bus to defend this film. I find this to be especially disingenuous given Michael Dougherty's comments and approach leading up to the film.He wanted the story to matter, to be grand epic and mythical. The only problem is that he's trying to do way too much. It has the superficial façade of a classic Godzilla film, but not enough of the substance and culture that made them memorable. The thing that made the original Godzilla films (the early 60s films in particular) special was their approach. While they were made as entertainment films, the filmmakers to care to occasionally add a message and a touch of humanism. They were not always successful, but they had an earnest soul that endeared them to fans what is sill makes them enjoyable all these decades later. Even Martin Scorsese is a fan of those early films, which he described as, ""pictures that haunted the imaginations of young moviegoers like myself"".You can tell Dougherty's imagination is haunted by Godzilla, he loves the character and understands that the iconography of Godzilla can be used to tell a meaningful story. But he seems to be a tad too preoccupied with fan-service and botches a lot of the themes he sets out to explore, particularly the environmental ones. Of course even in terms of entertainment value the film ends up lacking, as the monsters are obscured by particular effects and the battles aren't choreographed well. Its frustrating because I really wanted to like this movie since it had the potential. And that's my biggest issue with this, and most Godzilla films post the 1970s. I don't want so-called ""love-letters"" to the old films. Rather I want to see these modern films improve and build on previous ones by using all the recourses at their disposal that originals never ever had. But instead the film it settles for superficiality. On a more positive note, the soundtrack from Bear McCreary is excellent, skillfully blending classic themes with new ones.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

The three drawbacks to me were a poorly realized human story, all of the monster battles were either in the dark or obstructed view, and my biggest complaint was the extreme overuse of the Teal/Orange color filters.
I realize the story was just an unfortunate reality and I've read the original cut was around three hours so maybe crucial parts of the story were left on the cutting room floor. The lighting and color filters were both intentional decisions. While I disliked the dark monster battles in the 2014 movie and didn't care for them in this one, the garishly bright color filters kept breaking immersion for me.
I'll give an example, in one of the first scenes, a mother and daughter are talking in a kitchen, camera on mother, her skin is unnatural orange and so are the walls behind her, camera switches perspective to her daughter, her daughters face has a teal tint and the large window behind her is florescent teal and the entire movie continues on doing the same for literally every scene.
I understand that the whole Teal/Orange color filter is a big thing with those fresh out of film school and I always find gimmicks like that annoying, but I've never seen it so over used or applied so brightly.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

While the American version of Godzilla (1999) had too many flaws to be noteworthy, the recent reboot of Godzilla (2014) into its own cinematic universe with King Kong is something I look forward to, if for no other reason than huge monsters dueling it out on the big screen. I'd be over the moon if it ever combined with the Pacific Rim (2013) franchise, but that's probably asking for too much. As it stands, though, Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) is a great sequel that amps up the action.When I go to see a Godzilla movie, one thing I want to see is large monsters. King of the Monsters has these in spades. Even if you have a passing knowledge of Godzilla monsters, you'll likely recognize names like Rodan, Ghidorah, and Mothra. While the plot is a little lacking in why these monsters are fighting, the result is satisfying. The scale of these battles is entertaining, if for no other reason than to view the mayhem these titans create when they clash.While I'd love nothing more than watching these monsters battle it out, I felt that this movie's human aspect was a bit overdramatic. It's almost cliché with the divorced parents trying to keep their child safe while skyscraper-high lizards destroy the entire world. Sure, it's a vehicle for advancing the ""Monarch"" thread that links all these movies together, but it probably could have had a little more polish to focus on the monsters instead of the people who (for whatever reason) want to release them all at once. At the very least, I look forward to the upcoming Godzilla vs. Kong (2021) that was heavily hinted at throughout.Entertaining monster mayhem, I give Godzilla: King of the Monsters 4.0 stars out of 5.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

Japan's Shin Godzilla shines in this department by comparison. It understands that people don't star in Godzilla movies; Godzilla does. The focus is never shifted from the titular creature, even when off-screen. Meanwhile King of the Monsters thinks we need a domestic sob story in the middle of our big monster movie.There's a magical McGuffin (the Orca) that allows basic communication with the monsters. It's never clearly explained how it works, presumably so it could do that exact specific thing it needed to at precisely the right moment and we wouldn't be able to question how.One of the characters joins the bad guys and helps release the bad monsters. When they explain their motive for doing this, I burst out laughing. The writing was so surprisingly stupid it caught me off guard.Another time I laughed out loud was the shot of Ghidorah that ends with a large crucifix prominently featured in the foreground. Hmm...okay. Is that supposed to be a cringeworthy reference to the three men on the cross, since Ghidorah has three heads? Oh, no. Could it possibly get any dumber? Why yes, it absolutely does. In the very next shot there are Monarch researchers watching a live camera feed FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. That's right, at some point Monarch installed a surveillance camera on a remote hillside and insisted that a big crucifix take up 60% of the frame.Even people only interested in the monster battles will be let down. It's the same CGI we've seen on repeat for the last 15 years; nothing new or remarkable here.The score sounds like it was composed by an A.I. being force-fed Marvel movie soundtracks.The dialogue is comically generic. If you had a bingo card full of cliché lines such as ""We need more time!"" or ""Get outta there, its gonna blow!"" you'd win multiple times. I don't think either of those lines are in the movie, but the dialogue is so forgettable no one knows for certain.They even snuck in product placement - during one of the battles Ghidorah smashes through a perfectly-framed Dunkin' Donuts billboard. At this point I reasoned the Godzilla cinematic universe must be crossing over with the Adam Sandler cinematic universe. Fitting, since King of the Monsters can be described much like an Adam Sandler film; you squeeze a couple cheap laughs out of it, then forget it exists.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

The fight scenes, the monsters etc. With all the fights that happen had paid of in the end. My only complain were the humans except for Ken Wantabe's character were so annoying in my opinion. The family were annoying, the army idc. But that's it. So far Godzilla king of the monsters was so better than the 2014. It's a 10/10 for me.

I'm a life long fan of Godzilla and all of the old school cheesy films. I saw Godzilla (2014) three times in theater. I have never seen another movie that many times in theaters. So I've essentially waited my entire life for an American made, Godzilla movie with Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and the almighty King Ghidorah to be in and to duke it out with American visual effects to just make it as epic as possible.With all of that being said, for me, this was the single greatest Godzilla movie that I've ever seen. It blew my mind, it was huge, beautiful, and just perfectly made. The Monsters were everything I hoped for and more. This was the ultimate Godzilla movie. The characters were great, the fights were nothing short of epic. The movie I waited forever for, delivered to the highest degree. If you're a fan of Godzilla obviously this is a must see. But if you're just a fan of great, action packed, thrilling blockbuster movies, with a great cast and great Monsters? Then give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.This is also the longest and most detailed movie review I've ever done. If that's any inkling of how I feel about this movie and Godzilla himself! 10/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

"5","/10","Only ""less human stuff"" in terms of quality; monsters on their own get old","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4925105/?ref_=tt_urv","TheVictoriousV","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tt_urv","9 June 2019","First, we had the 2014 Godzilla, where many complained that too much of the giant monster action was seen solely from the vantage point of boring humans. With its sequel, King of the Monsters, viewers instead complain that the movie lacks humanity and is too heavy on the big action spectacle. Can't people just be happy?Well, let me humor the idea that balance cannot exist and explain it thusly: the problem with the first movie is that the most prominent characters were somewhat uninteresting and didn't justify the lack of Godzilla screentime, whereas this movie doesn't give us enough time to get to know anyone or understand why we should be invested when the action comes. I hear that it isn't that kind of movie (although the first one arguably was). Instead, this is basically one of the old Toho movies with better effects, complete with appearances from Mothra, Rodan, and King Gidorah - the three-headed dragon.The problem is that the film also tries to pull a Snyder and attempt depth and seriousness in spite of the nature of the material. If you can't make something deep and contemplative out of ""Batman vs. Superman"", then ""Godzilla vs. Gidorah"" won't make it either (I don't think many attendees will care that the original Gojira meant to critique man's carelessness with nuclear weapons). Granted, the primary defense of King of the Monsters isn't the DCEU fanboy favorite ""you're not smart enough to get it"". Instead we get the ""it's SUPPOSED to be bad"" routine, as part of its callback to the more campy Toho era, but of course the fans are reticent to outright call it bad.Furthermore, I don't know that there's less human stuff in this film than the last in terms of quantity. In fact, it might have more characters to keep track of than its predecessor and, again, there isn't much to them besides the exposition they spout and the fact that some of them are baddies while some are goodies.Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga play a divorced couple, both of them involved in the government organization Monarch, last mentioned in Kong: Skull Island, which serves to monitor kaiju - or ""Titans"" as this franchise names them. Millie Bobby Brown of Stranger Things does a good job as the couple's responsible daughter. Charles Dance sides with the kaiju, in the sense that he believes their ascension is man's destined punishment for ruining the Earth. Ken Watanabe, like last time, portrays one of the more interesting characters, with a sympathetic, albeit more nuanced, view on the Titans.There's also Thomas Middleditch as your comic relief for the evening, Bradley Whitford as a character who seems like a mix between Scorsese and Rick Sanchez, Sally Hawkins as a woman who says words, and Zhang Ziyi gets a dual part as a Monarch scientist and her twin sister. What a gig.It isn't just the fact that Godzilla 2 has too many characters, few of them truly gripping, that make me bored with them. It is also the fact that very little of the monster action - the stuff we actually came for - actually seems to affect them in any meaningful, whether it's nearby lava rivers, nearby nuclear breath, or ginormous explosions brought on by a three-headed dragon. When the characters do get harmed, it is usually instant death whenever the film needs some instant death. There's not any lasting damage to raise the stakes or remind us of the danger these Titans ostensibly pose. As for the kaiju fights on their own, I enjoyed the pretty pictures and fanservice bits. For a while.It's too bad we didn't get anything more, because we really could've used something to keep the kids on the row behind me entertained, as they were busy chatting, snickering and throwing popcorn about. The depressing part was the realization that they apparently had adult company (I really do wish observable reality was consistent with the people who think I'm wrong for not wanting children). I don't feel bad about leaving the auditorium to play with my phone on the crapper for a while.Random thought: What exactly do you tease people with after next year's Godzilla vs. Kong? What other giant monsters are famous enough that people would want to see them battle Godzilla or Kong, provided the MonsterVerse is to survive past that showdown? The 50-Foot Woman? Gamera? Cloverf- actually, no.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

They have four major monsters in the film, + several more shown briefly. There's about 6-7 main characters with several other supporting characters with mini sub plots. This all equals a convoluted mess of a film. There's a lot of big monster fights throughout the film but every single one of them they have to include the human characters stuck in the middle of it and cut to them narrowly missing danger and explosions. This leads to a mixture of CGI ranging from top notch to really bad. Most of the scenes are too dark, then too blinding bright, there's loads of cloud, mist, smoke etc trying to cover up poor CGI, don't get me wrong some parts are really well done but it's not enough to save it. They haven't learnt from other movies of this scale (eg. Transformers)that they need to give the monsters their own space & screen time when big action scenes unravel. Every big sequence I was trying to absorb they kept cutting away to the pointless actions of the humans, yelling, flying, running or being just useless in general, sometimes just staring at what's going on... I don't want to see 5 of the main characters faces reacting to Godzilla throwing Ghidorah through a building, I want to see it myself. Hopefully they can keep it more simple for the next one, cut the characters down a bit, keep the plot simple and just let people enjoy Godzilla vs Kong without cutting away to family drama that no one cares about.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

They are probably not fans and know nothing of the folklore and cannon. To watch Godzilla in the 60s and to see how the movies have changed and come so far up until this Godzilla movie, its like a dream come true. The director was a fan, you can see the love all over this movie, atleast the fans can. There is no point to watch this movie and nit pick because of some shady human dialogue, which honestly wasn´t even that bad. Who cares, its not a friggin Tarantino picture. This is one of the most visually appealing movie I have had the pleasure of wacthing in a movie theatre (big screen) that I can remeber.
This is a hard movie to pull off, and most people or ´´critics´´ fail to see that, and have no empathy for all thehard work that went into it by all the film crew.(these arent spoilers but have just a few details about the monsters so you decide)The monsters were epic, grandiose and beatiful. I had chills when Ghidorah was slowly coming up out of the ice. The way wherever he goes its like a F5 hurricane storm to show just how massively powerful he is was brilliant. Mothra was beautifully tragic, the underdog, and the martyr, the friend and the queen .Rodan was badass, like the anarchist of them all, his introduction scene was brutal.
I only rolled my eyes at Vera Farmigas reasoning to like be the ''bad guy´´ but she got her redemtion at the end.

I watched ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" during opening week at the cinema and felt tremendously let down. Oh sure, the monster action hit my adrenal glands in just the right way, but the story itself seemed a tremendously underwritten, overblown thing. Previous entries in Legendary's MonsterVerse - 2014's excellent ""Godzilla"" and 2017's great ""Kong: Skull Island"" - gave the impression that the series would follow a somewhat grown-up direction. Three films in, we're suddenly presented with underdeveloped character beats, a hi-tech scientific operation with nigh-bottomless technical and monetary resources, and hackneyed family drama. It took a marathon re-watch of all three films in sequence, along with 1969's classic ""Destroy All Monsters,"" for me to realize that I'd been wrong...... ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" is a perfectly fine film for what it is, and I'd been unduly harsh towards it.As with Peter Jackson's epic-length ""King Kong"" remake, it's hard to stay mad at a film so clearly in love with its subject matter - giddily so, even. Sure, the writing's on the heavy end of clichéd and the dialogue's functional, at best. Yet the film compensates with energy, verve, and visual inventiveness. For every loopy character motivation, there's a scene of genuine splendor. For every unexplored plot point that betrays a lack of storytelling focus, there's at least a sense of rollicking forward momentum and a feeling that this film is going somewhere. For every lightweight character and inexplicably whispered line reading, there's a lovingly orchestrated kaiju fight with weight, grandeur, and meticulous scene composition that triggers real awe and wonder.Bear McCreary's propulsive, reverent music score is an absolute achievement, working in tandem with the stunning special effects to trigger real emotional reactions.Watching this film again on a smaller screen emphasizes what had remained hidden beneath the spectacle shown on the big screen - mainly, that none of this is meant to be taken seriously.

That's just not true. These films were just bad. Take this movie: I was looking forward to see it but was completely turned off by the dreadful screenplay and direction. Since Robert McKee's seminal book on screenwriting 'Story' hit the shelves in 1999 I would have assumed that at least the writers hired in Hollywood have read it - boy, was I wrong! One of the key principles noted there is 'show, don't tell' - yet, all the characters in this shoddy screenplay deliver exposition in dialogue! You can pick any Marvel movie and see how exposition is done properly. Characters: one moment the kid is scared (she also says this in her dialogue), the next she shows the middle finger to the villain. Dear director: pick one! Either she is scared, or she is defiant. She can't be both in the span of 30 seconds! Direction: I have rarely seen more static direction outside European arthouse cinema. A locked-down camera in between superbly fluid VFX-shots make for a bumpy and unattractive ride. My sympathies are with the cast who tries hard to survive in these amateurish scenes and with such embarrassing lines. My three stars are for the excellent VFX work and all the state-of-the-art work in most other departments.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

My favorite aspect of this movie was easily the music, my God Bear McCreary is one hell of a composer.
The only complaint I have is the overall human story. It was a little too messy, way to much exposition. Highlights were Kyle Chandler, Ken Watanabe and Millie Bobby Brown. Other than those three I found all the others forgettable.

Half way through I was praying for one of the monsters to step on him. Couple that with a poor, never engaging story line with characters I really couldn't care less about. There are really talented actors in this film. Unfortunately for them, they're given material better suited for some second rate community theatre.Of course the monster battles were well staged with world class special effects as you might expect in a $170M film. That is, when you could make out what's going on through the incessant rain and cover of night. All in all it was more depressing than exciting.The previous films in this series (including King Kong) were much better.

Everyone is just going along with that? I found so many aspects of the plot not unbelievable but simply without respect.I saw it on a regular ol' movie screen which wasn't enough.

Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah, to be specific, with a whole slew of freshly-concocted secondary beasts stomping around in the backdrop. These fresh takes on a familiar trio are bold and beautiful, magnificent updates on a classic set of character designs. Matched with an impressive elemental tone-setter or two - Ghidorah enveloped by a swirling thunderstorm, Rodan birthed from the belly of a volcano, Mothra hibernating beneath the veil of a misty waterfall - the monster effects are breathtaking; forboding, painterly and mythical in their execution. Those expertly-directed promo posters that preceded the film's release were no ruse. The entire movie looks that good. A shame, then, that the story couldn't have been better. Even by old-school Godzilla standards, this one's a stinker. It shouldn't take much effort to shift the scene from one preposterous slice of movie mayhem to another, but King of the Monsters makes the job look awfully tough. From flimsy talking points to one-dimensional characters, plot cartwheels to scientific hand-waves, it's a universal phone-in. If the assumption is that nobody's come to watch the little people run around and stress over the monsters, that's correct. That doesn't mean we won't notice when their motivations stop making sense and their master plan is strung together with scotch tape and twine. I wanted to love it, and when I managed to stop thinking and gape at the big guys, I did. But that was only true about fifty percent of the time. Hence, half-credit.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

A lot of the movie is made for TRUE fans of Godzilla. Not those who think it's goofy or charming. There's nice nods to the movies and lots of things and ideas fans will recognize. That being said a general audiance would have no idea what some things might mean.On top of that the average American might think the world and ideas are dumb. Like I said it's not dumb, just not intelligent. The characters are okay and at times can be fun. The world is a lot of fun and really cool at times. The monarch base May not make any sense, but I loved the design of it all the same.There's a few great character moments, but the story never goes beyond what you'd expect. The monsters are great fun and the special effects are fantastic. Very well shot with a beautiful soundtrack mixed in. The movie as a whole was really fun to watch.Now I must say the movie is not for everyone and many might not like it.

One another good adaption I can think of would be Alita the Battleangel that also has an origin in Japan. I, as a beloved fan of this franchise, can assure you, that this movie was made for you. However, yes, there are moments that you wish they weren't there in the first place, human drama, for instance. We could live through without that but only the humans that have a connection to the monsters that give us, the audience some decent explanation regarding it. All in all, as a moviegoer you will be satisfied with that what you will see on screen, monster fights. That's what counts in the first place. The Kaijus were adapted excellently in this movie, in various scenes, you feel for them and just wish that nothing happens to them. That's how breathtaking this movie actually is. The movie has its down and upsides, but the upsides are the actual reason why this movie is good.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

It was a very well-though out and well-scripted and exciting monster movie. So, I had hopes for this movie, though I made sure that I went into this movie with low expectations so as not be too disappointed if it turned out to be trash.
Well, I was still somewhat disappointed.
The plot was a great idea, but a bit over-the-top and out there when you think about it, and this movie GENERALLY realizes that fact. Though, the first half was boring and tedious to get through. I get it - they want build-up, flesh out and such (I'm an author, I do that, too), but I found in this movie that all that build-up was just boring, to put it bluntly. Once it actually got into it, it was fun and exciting, but there were times that I felt it went too fast and thought that they could have fleshed out some parts a bit more. But I could just be being picky, I'm not sure.
The climax was awesome and exciting - frankly, it was the best part of the whole movie, where we got what we came for: the huge, epic Battle of the Monsters.
The acting was fine. The most memorable, in my humble opinion, where the actresses who played the mother and daughter. ESPECIALLY the one who plays the daughter. Her performance, for some reason, felt the most authentic out of everyone's (though everyone was good in their respective roles) and she shined in every scene that she was in. I can see a bright future for her in the film industry.
The guy who played the father, however, he was...okay. He was just doing what he was told, but he mostly felt out of place, and his character felt underdeveloped and I wish we could have had more in-depth look at him and a more fleshing-out with his character development. I'm sure the actor who played the father is a great actor, but in this movie, there was something lacking in his character. His character just felt like an unnecessary prop.
This movie had some great mythology and some...interesting Biblical parodies. For those who like that sort of thing, I strongly recommend this movie to you.
The visuals were just amazing and looked extremely realistic, which is something that I loved. Made it more tense for me seeing these CGI creatures that looked so much like they were really there.
Overall, an enjoyable sequel that doesn't quite live up to the awe of the first movie, but still manages to pass.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

That's a GREAT thing. I actually can't even recall a few of them that made me cringe watching that final trailer. The fact that Godzilla seems to need our help just as much as we need him in more subtle in the first, more artistic film from 2014 but this one dials in a more powerful Godzilla after being helped in the more obvious way compared to the first film. A serious question I impose is, ""Can the areas of battle even be livable once Godzilla unleashes thermo-nuclear power and destruction?"" The destruction in this film reminds me more of a complete disaster film and is almost ID4 territory but the story is solid enough it doesn't feel cliché somehow. I think based on how great and colorful the CGI is you can't help but be amazed how great it looks compared to lesser films however Godzilla 2014 had some more interesting sound design with the MOTU elements in my opinion. Godzilla does look better and has more expression in this film but either version for me is completely acceptable. The IMAX theater I saw this in lacked any good low end bass sadly. It was blasting loud indeed but I felt no punch in the chest bass which is how the 2014 feels in my home theater. During the MOTU train scene the walls rattle. I can't think of any scene that impressed me in the 2019 version bass-wise so I blame the theater. People say the movie was too heavy on the Titans but I disagree. There was plenty of runtime of characters trying to figure out what the heck they were going to do after hell was unleashed. How did the Titans awaken is the question you will find out. There is a twist so I will not put spoilers. Unless you have a proper good theater you'd be better off watching this at home on a $5000 stereo system, which includes speakers and everything. Even two cheaper SVS subwoofers will sound better than almost any theater in my area let alone the SB/PB 3000/4000. They pretty much all lack proper low end bass response which is a shame.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

I felt the monster-action/human-subplot ratio was done extremely well this time around (as compared to Godzilla 2014). I have been a fan of Godzilla for over 30 years. I've seen them all, and I've enjoyed. . . most of them.The movie was pretty non-stop. From the beginning of the movie until the end, it keeps you entertained. The effects didn't seem cheap and stale like so many other CGI movies and at times, it's hard to tell if the effects are CGI or something more practical.Charles Dance ALWAYS does a great job. He's an incredible actor and yet again proves why he's one of Hollywood's best. The other actors are equally on par with him in this movie. But, the movie wasn't about the actors. It's about the monsters.The monsters were well done. The new look (as compared to the old Japanese versions) closely resembled their Japanese counterpart and anyone that's a fan of the old films would've easily been able to tell who was who. The action and fight sequences seemed much more physical and creative this time around. It truly was a spectacle.The second I heard the original Godzilla theme (and this includes Mothra's theme) I knew it would be a great movie. The director and crew clearly did their homework and knew to keep the story-line similar to the original. Everything from Ghidorah's origin to Mothra's birth, so-on and so-forth was done well and done in the same tune as the original story.I recommend watching this movie (if you are a fan of giant monster action, a great sub-plot. I was sort of shocked to hear a couple F-bombs and several other instances of foul language, so I would recommend putting that into thought before taking any really small children. This is definitely more of a movie for teenagers and up.Great film. I really enjoyed it.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

The Monarchs were off their seats, stunned and terrified and so were the audience. That scene was probably a representation of the reaction of the audience throughout the whole movie.Cool fight scenes. Rodan's introduction in Mexico was probably the most intense part of the movie. From cool jet manuvers, giant futuristic flying motherships, city chaos, even a david stathairn cameo. The bomb probably struck the audience because we were all holding our breathe until ghidora made his awesome mountain stance.The king vs king rivalry starts far before that so what we're having here is a fast burner movie, compared to the mellow first movie staring quick silver and scarlet witch.So many characters involved but none of them wasted. Interesting dialog (not at all stupid, if you want to know what stupid dialog sounds like, watch a transformer movie).Charles Dance making deep voice Tywin speciality speeches. Vera Farmiga touching as always. Kyle Chandler helming the action. We all missed Ziyi Zhang, and here she is now (speaking english).Milly Bobby Brown, I never heard of her before but now I'm all aware. Sally Hawkins and Ken Watanabe re-introduced to welcome new characters. Thomas Middleditch from Silicon Valley, throwing worthless comic relief we probably needed more than we knew. Bradley Whitford delivering scientific speech from all kinds of departement (I can't imagine all the degrees his character has).Aisha Hinds from 9-1-1 and Oshea Jackson Jr. (a.k.a. Ice Cube Jr.) Also introducing Elizabeth ludlow in the mayhem and artilary section.So many aspects. I appreciate Director Michael Dougherty (Krampus) at least blending all these together with right balance without any of them disrupting the other. Mothra was probably the loose canon here, but you can judge by yourself.Can't wait for another giant monster showdown. King Kong? Gamera? Bathra? Mechagodzilla? Ultraman? Bring them on and let them fight!!!","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

Godzilla: King of the Monsters is exactly what I wanted it to be. Its a movie for Godzilla fans, by Godzilla fans. And I'd hate to see the Monsterverse brought down by a bunch of critics who didn't like it in the first place because its simply not their cup of tea.
That being said, is it perfect? No, nothing is. And that's fine. Sure, the human plot isn't groundbreaking, but not every movie has to be. The plot is of the kind you would find in monster B-movies of the past, and that's fine. Sure the climate change plot has been done to death, but such is the time we live in and I'd be lying if I said that it wasn't a real issue (but that's a different conversation for a different time/place). Regardless, it serves as a suitable vehicle for what I feel most people really came to see: HUGE MONSTER ACTION! And let me say, this movie delivers on that front.
The thing that I feel some movie critics seem to forget is that there is this thing called FUN. This is a fun movie. Not everything has to be a depressing drama with more layers of symbolism than you could shake a Titan-sized stick at. They have their place, but so do movies that are pure entertainment. Isn't that why we watch movies? For entertainment?
In conclusion, if you are a fan of Godzilla and monster movies in general and are able to sit back, have fun, and not take everything so seriously, then you will enjoy Godzilla: King of the Monsters.","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

The special effects are fantastic, keeping up with the quality of the 2014 film. It's an awesome feeling to see so many classic kaiju brought together on the big screen with the amazing, digital effects. (I mean no disrespect to the guys in rubber suits in the past.)A great story and lots of excellent giant monster action. The film gives us a huge scene -- with a huge monster! -- within its first few minutes. This Godzilla movie is wall-to-wall with the monsters. They include the classic Godzilla players Mothra, Rodan, and the very nasty King Ghidorah, all with designs that call back to their Toho origins while also looking fresh and, basically, fantastic. As for Godzilla, as we saw at the end of the 2014 film, he is firmly on the side of good, ready to battle these creatures alongside humanity. The battles are some of the best done of ANY monster vs monster battle.Godzilla: King of the Monsters, is a big, expensive action movie, lots of skyscraper-sized creatures beating each other up. All you need to know is that when the big boys come out to play, things get destroyed, they blow up. People die in large numbers. The monsters fight each other. They go nuclear. What more do you need to know?I have seen the movie twice. Once in 3-D, once in 2-D. I preferred the 2-D version.

My favorite monster movies are Jaws, Jurassic Park, Peter Jackson's King Kong and Godzilla 2014. I love the original Godzilla and king kong movies but they don't hold up for me anymore in terms of sound, CGI and in some places acting.Literally every monster movie I go to, my expectation is clear. I want to watch monster destroy humans and everything they own or they fight other monster. I don't care about what the humans are doing, maybe crack a few jokes or get eaten, that's all I need. This movie has it all.We live in a time where Godzilla is as cool for this generation as it was for is back in 80s. We are seeing these epic battle of titans in 3D or Dolby Vision and Atmos n all that. This movie takes advantage of all that to give a spectacular battle laced, heart thumping action of not two but four monsters with humans mixed in it.Godzilla 2014 was visually stunning and final battle was nothing like I've ever seen, and King of monsters is a love letter and bonanza for Godzilla's true fans.It's a solid 8/10 and something I am going to show to my kids in future.

Directed by: Michael DoughertyGodzilla KOTM is the third film in the Monsterverse following 2014's Godzilla and 2017's Kong: Skull Island. However previous viewing of those isn't required as the film opens with a flashback that tells you everything you need to know.The story follows a scientist and her daughter who have found a way to communicate with the titans, however they are then captured by a group of eco-terrorists. The story then takes some predictable twists and turns. However the characters are mostly one dimensional and fairly generic. But that's not the reason you watch a Godzilla movie.This movie absolutely delivers on all the titan action you want it too. The action is present throughout the whole film and is created stunningly well. There is a very good variety of titans then just the headliner Godzilla himself which leads for multiple different and unique sequences. You really feel the size and strength of the titans as they go at it throughout the film.The creature design is very well crafted for all the titans as they all have their own unique properties. The CGI is done quite well and makes everything look realistic. The movie is also shot very well as some particular shots are still burned into my memory as they were that spectacular.The sound design here is also top notch as you here the sheer power of the titans in every sequence. Godzillas first major reveal is truly astonishing and his deafening roar is executed to perfection.Overall this is a very enjoyable monster flick. While it is hindered by some lackluster characters and writing, the movie absolutely delivers on the promised action and lives up to the King of the Monsters. Definitely check this one out","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

One of them used false information about the film to hurt it's credibility by saying it defied science thinking that it suggested Godzilla was created by nuclear bombs ( this was their main problem with the film and harped on it very much) No, he wasn't created that way according to this movie. He was always in hollow earth and fed on radiation. Once he found the gateway to enter our world Japan dropped nuclear bombs on him that only made him stronger. His ability to produce nuclear blasts from his mouth is a result from feeding on our use of radiation. And we use it in abundance, especially trying to destroy him, at first.The film is a love letter to classic Godzilla films and it shows us spectacular special effects. The story is just good enough to carry it along. I loved it. My main reason wanting to write this review wasn't to tell you how great it is; it was to inform curious readers that certain reviewers bashing this film, unable to pay attention enough to know how Godzilla exists and why he has his power, shouldn't write such negative reviews.","2 out of 6 found this helpful."

No one does. This is a very entertaining action movie, with absolutely breathtaking visual effects. In terms of sheer entertainment, this film is certainly worth the 5 year gap between the last one. All the complaints that fans had about the previous movie, is ironed out in King of Monsters, as Godzilla is pretty much a main character. And I enjoyed how much they gave the monster a personality - he isn't just a mindless beast that wants destruction. Which makes us root for him against his amazing battles against King Ghidorah.There are other monsters in the movie, but they don't have that much screen time, other than Rodan, who has one of the coolest battles scenes I've seen this year. Mothra is also great, and has this whole mythological feel to it.The human characters are all good as well, and like I said, no one goes into a movie like this to see if these characters have some Schindler's List type stories. They are good in terms of progressing the story forwards.But one of the best things about this movie, is its soundtrack. Bear Mccreary goes a fantastic job with his music in this film, and hopefully after this, he gets the recognition that he deserves.The direction, cinematography, action scenes, visual effects and soundtrack are all what carry this movie forwards. It has a ton of faults, sure, but it is a great and fun watch.7.5/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

I have been a lifelong fan of cinema(especially monster movies), and am an avid fan of all things Godzilla. Dougherty has done what many attempts of adapting international global phenomenons could not.The screenplay(written by Michael Dougherty, Max Borenstein, and Zach Shields) while not perfect, still has the touch of someone who has involved themselves with the lore, and delved into the deepest parts of the Zillaverse, being consistent with the prophetic undertones of their and our universe. And while focusing on the moral aspect of each character and monster, they also managed to balance the action without losing sight of its goal.Kyle Chandler(who gives one of his finer performances since The Wolf of Wall Street), Vera Farmiga, and Millie Bobby Brown lead the human ensemble, alongside some notable performances from the likes of Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, and an always incredible performance by Ken Watanabe, makes this is by far the most emotional and human Godzilla film I've seen.I have always been a practical person, especially a fan of practical effects, but the CG in KotM had me stunned during several scenes, from the greatest titan duels to the smallest meticulous expressions of sadness and anger on Godzilla, to the other monsters(mostly designed from the original 60s monsters, even down to their cries), to the immensely rendered landscapes. I especially liked the bits of loving detail near the end.Without giving spoilers, all I can really say is the whole thing is a wild ride from beginning to end, and to all Godzilla and monster movies fans alike, you shouldn't miss it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

I will admit that is the only other Godzilla film before this one and I haven't seen any of the previous many Japanese films that have been around for many decades now. Anyway, I went into this film with some pretty high expectations, but I was immensely satisfied with what I saw. The CGI of the monsters aswell as the cinematography was all top notch with the action sequences all shot clearly and beautifully with such vast cinematic scale of what was going on. I did see this on an IMAX screening so my experience of the film in terms of size may differer from other people's reviews of the same movie.I did find the plot a bit hard to follow at the start, but about 40 minutes in it became much easier from then on, but that might just be me. That was about the only problem I had with the film since I found the overall visuals and action sequences to be awesome in breathtaking in the overall cinematic scale of it all as I previously mention, aswell as being so clearly shot.
Most of the cast did a great job aswell, with Millie Bobbie Brown from Stranger Things being in the movie aswell which was a nice surprise, since she has slowly began to grow on me as a great upcoming actor who seems to be good at anything she is in.
Anyway definitely see this movie if you are a Godzilla fan, or overall just love big awesome movies with monsters fighting and smashing cities apart because this is exactly that movie that delivers on it's promises","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

Could've been a 9/10 if it weren't for the constant cut-away's from the monsters to the humans who I barely cared about aside from Watanabe's character, to the point of frustration. It will show X monster throw a punch or bite against Y only for the camera to pull to some humans on the ground running and screaming. Repeat every 5-10 seconds. As cool as the monster fights were, they were so disjointed and interrupted.There was some semblance of a story, and I was interested in the background info of all the titans awakening, the ""alien"" muto, the underwater civilization, and how humans are just insects to these monsters to be their pets. I just didn't care for the human characters no matter how often the camera cuts to them.

Could've been a bit better in my opinion if they stopped cutting away from the monster fights and focusing on the human drama. Also wanted them to take some time to introduce the newer monsters instead of jumping straight to the main plot though I guess they'll leave that for later movies. Apart from that it was everything I'd wanted and expected from a Godzilla movie. The visuals and the monsters themselves were breath taking, the CGI was amazing, wasn't too corny, and Rhodan and mothra really stole the show. It was lacking a little in the plot department but I feel it made up for that with everything else that it got right. Overall, it was good entertainment which is all that one should expect from a Godzilla movie. If you want it to pose deep philosophical questions or raise environmental concerns then you'd be better off watching the trilogy available on Netflix. Really wish the critics would cut it some slack and stop trying to bring down any movie that aims to establish a cinematic universe other than the MCU. Because while this movie wasn't perfect it was still an amazing experience. And this is coming from someone who hasn't exactly been a long-time fan so I hold no intrinsic bias towards it. Well worth the watch and really looking forward to Godzilla vs Kong after this.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

But I won't lie.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4950899/?ref_=tt_urv","bobsplatters","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104672948/?ref_=tt_urv","22 June 2019","Let me start by saying I LOVED this movie. In my own opinion, this movie was fantastic and I can't lie and say that it was bad. There is plenty of coverage as to why it was good but I will not deny that there were some flaws and in addressing these issues I'm hoping that Legendary will work to fix these issues in the future. Now to begin with, in King of the Monsters you will definitely notice that there is much more screen time with Godzilla and the rest of the monsters. The actions scenes and CGI were phenomenal; but one of the main issues I had was the quality of the fights between the monsters. For example, the camera angles and delivery of each scene was definitely noticeable compared to the Godzilla movie in 2014. I wish the scenes could have been panned out a lot more so we can get a better view of the monsters fighting. Also, compared to the Godzilla movie in 2014 I feel that the delivery of each scene could have been timed much better. One of the main criticisms of Godzilla 2014 was the lackluster action and screen time of Godzilla and the MUTO's. To this day, I prefer quality over quantity so that is why I consider a flaw. Furthermore, I would also add that the first movie's structure alongside the human story is noticeably much more thorough; but the actors are still good. Although the script is not bad and certainly not the terrible, it could have been a tad bit better but that is okay. In addition, I wish Rodan could have gotten more screen-time but seeing him in a new movie was sufficient enough for me. Moreover, rather than introducing new monsters that boasted themselves as generic to me I wish we could have had the opportunity to see a cameo of Anguirus or any of the other original monsters instead. Another thing to add, is that the fighting scenes were constantly going flickering BACK and FORTH between the humans and the monsters; whereas in Godzilla 2014, when it was time for the monsters to fight it was showtime. This is a big flaw for me because although there was enough action to make up for the absence of it in the first one, it was just as much of a nuisance as the fight teasers in Godzilla 2014. Lastly, my own personal major issue with this movie was the wise guy approach. You see it all the time in Marvel movies and while many people like it (including myself) it just doesn't fit this type of movie and detracts the seriousness and terror of ""BIG HUGE ENORMOUS"" monsters destroying our planet! The worst part about this is the scientist (guy with the white hair) isn't even funny! It is a different sense of humor, but to me he's just an annoying smartass who makes me enjoy the movie that much more whenever he is not on screen. Now, as for the monsters, I could not expect them to be portrayed any better than you would expect in any modern Godzilla that is trying it's best to make these things feel like a reality! They were absolutely fantastic! On the other hand, I do feel that King Ghidorah could have sounded a lot more like himself and so could Rodan. One of the cool things I did notice though, was that you can actually here the sound effects of each monsters roar that they are originally known for if you listen closely enough. I thought it was pretty cool because it is a cool mixture of old and new and I think that's what will make these modern Godzilla movies unique in their own way. Now for the good news! There is so much more action in this one compared to the first one that it absolutely stands out and you cannot be disappointed whether you take all these factors into consideration or not. If you're a Godzilla fan like me, you will love this movie not because it is perfect but because it is filled with a lot more Godzilla and lore. In this movie they bring back the original music which is always a plus for me and they refer to King Ghidorah as Monster Zero which I do appreciate. Also, all the monsters besides their screeches(which are still pretty cool) are great interpretations of the monsters! Mothra was probably the best representation and I absolutely loved her! I also loved how each scene looked distinguished from one another because they were constantly moving locations. For me this is something that most movies should be doing because it makes the movie that much more rememberable and easier to recall. Godzilla's fire blast definitely looks a lot more original this time around and even though I enjoyed the first one's too, I respect that they are paying tribute to the lore that most Godzilla fans love and know. It will be nice to see where they go with this universe so I hope to see it continue on the path to Destroy All Monsters. Hopefully we will get to see Anguirus, King Kong, MechaGodzilla, Destroyah, Gigan, Megalon, Mecha-King Ghidorah, and Baragon. Ultimately, I loved this movie because It feels like a Godzilla movie despite its flaws and was still tons of fun! I give this movie a 8/10 because I was definitely still satisfied and I know that most critics are in it for business, so I'm giving it a fair rating and be honest about my review, especially because Godzilla is my childhood. I know that Avengers: Endgame is stealing the show right now so don't believe most reviews when they say this movie sucks because I can tell you that it most definitely does not.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

That's not to say there are no laughs, just that there are lines that I found cringe inducing. HOWEVER, that's a small part of the movie. The rest of it I adore! The monsters are great as always! I even liked the main family and their story. I found them significantly more interesting than the human plot in the 2014 film. I found it to be a perfect balance between monsters and humans. Godzilla appears throughout the film, from beginning to end, unlike the 2014 film (which I liked, mind you, just not as much as this one). Overall, if you love summer popcorn action films that don't take themselves too seriously, and are just a plain ole' good time, GO SEE THIS FILM.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

Bradley Whitford got on my nerves as the ""comedy"" element and ruined every scene he was in, Aisha hinds voice hurt my ears to the point where I felt like stabbing them, she was awful. Vera Farmiga who I usually like seemed like she couldn't be bothered, Kyle Chandler was unusually poor and Millie Bobbie Brown isn't a good actress anyway and in this, it showed.
Charles Dance is the same in everything he's in and what a way to waste a talent like David Strathairn.
The only actor who did well was Ken Watanabe who I thought was excellent.
I gave this film 9 out of 10 purely because I love monster films and I've loved Godzilla since I was little and the monster battles were brilliant.....soooo I'm happy... Ish.

Proverbs half german half english, made no friggin sense at all.
Whoever translated the script should be fired and never be hired again.However, from a pure Movie point of view, this Movie was awesome.
It was almost everything i expected and predictes also, but it was a fun ride from start to finish anyways.
For sure its not a 10/10 Masterpiece, people who cant reflect and analyze the good and bad parts and rate everything 10/10 or 01/10 are nuts.Its for sure better as Godzilla I and the best Godzilla Interpretation of the western world.
Lots of Kaijus Fans of the Godzilla or Monstermovies Genre can recognize, and alot of times friendly to the established canon of this universe.
So that it feels familiar but also not boring because the cgi and effects where almost on point everytime.The Human interactions where pretty anoying from time to time, but hey we cant expect a movie with 120minutes of pure monster bashs monster action without any spoken words for the plot lol...If this would be the beginning of a lot more Movies to follow i would say, Hell yeah give me more!","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

"8","/10","They captured the gargantuan sizes of the titans in this film perfectly...a shame that the sequels fall flat","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9815604/?ref_=tt_urv","DarkWandererAU","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62079366/?ref_=tt_urv","29 May 2024","This is the best monster mash film you will ever see. The CGI was used perfectly in this film. The size of the titans was captured beautifully, and you feel their awesomeness in the literal sense of the word.When viewing the titans from the perspective of the humans on the ground, they have a slight slowness to them that helps convey their sheer size & makes the audience feel immersed and much like ants the way the characters do. The way that alone can draw the audience in makes for a heck of a fun ride! But then when you need to see some action from Godzilla's perspective, they still keep it at a pace that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Its just such a shame that the sequels weren't like this at all. Once Kong came into it, they sacrificed the awesomeness of the titans, literally made them smaller, in order to try and convey faster moving fight scenes which weren't even that good. The pyramids should maybe reach the top of Godzilla's ankle, but in the later Kong movies he is only slightly bigger than the entire pyramid it self, and it just leaves you with a dissatisfied ""why should I care"" sort of feeling.The scenes with the humans in most of these films gets pretty dumped on, lots of people saying they wished the film spent less time focused on them and on the monsters....but I don't think that is the case with this film.The way the governments of the world are trying to find humanity's place amongst the titans is really interesting, and Ken Watanabe played a great part as the advocate for the titans. The technology shown in the film is interesting to behold as well - the underwater bases a long with the one's in the air are believable, and watching them track Godzilla's movements in a desperate attempt for control portrays the situation from a human perspective quite well. While the human parts of the film are less interesting than the titans clashing, it still forms a glue that keeps the film together nicely. However, I did not care for Charles Dance's character and his whole terrorism group - it just seemed a bit sloppily put together.Oh and did I mention how beautiful Mothra is? As someone who was new to the whole Godzilla story line, it was cool to learn that she is the Queen of the Monsters next to Godzilla, and she portrayed this beautiful, awe inspiring, feminine energy that matched really well with Godzilla's ""its good to be King"" masculine energy. The CGI for her was perfect, and the way they portrayed her colours was a feast for the eyes.I dare say this movie uses modern day CGI better than any movie to date, its not over or under done....it just fits.The sequels left me dissatisfied and uninspired, King of the Monsters however will leave you feeling entertained, inspired but also insignificant next to the titans!Some of the human dialogue may be a bit cheesy, and certain points of the plot might not need to be there, but this film is still a fantastic ride and I envy anyone seeing it for the first time.Enjoy!","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Others love it and others think it was constant battle without breaks (which was true).From a ""fan"" perspective it was just a golden, they listened to us. I don't remember when I left the theater as stoked like this. It was just so enjoyable from start to finish, the intro to each titan was chilling, and they were amazingly detailed to the eyes. As a ""fan"" I couldn't be happier that they make movies like this with big budget, just to appeal to small portion of people. If you rationalize it too much you take all the fun out of a movie like this and you shouldn't be heard. Sorry.From a non fan perspective (my friends) it was just goofy to listen. ""I couldn't identify with the human characters"". (They are there just as a filler for ""normal"" people) The human characters were there because the large portion of people couldn't even watch it if it was just monsters hitting themselves. Just think about it, the reason they are able to make a movie like this is that they need to get even or make profit so appeal to many audiences, to fans with monster action, to normal females with the family drama, to normal men with ??? (the period of equality and female domination in high movie roles). It had to appeal to different groups because they need revenue, so be objective. The movie was well thought, not perfect but don't judge it too hard.The only reason I wanted to make this review was because it makes me sad that the ""movie critics"" have a voice in here and apparently can't see the pov of others. I want us fans to stick together haha.6.7 shouldn't be the real rating of this movie at all, meaning, people won't go see it (even though it was fun). This was alot better than the first movie.The movie needs more support. In the future maybe they will listen more to the general public and the series will start to go downhill from there.

The plot was decent, but let's remember the cardinal rule for Godzilla movies; one does NOT go to these to see Godzilla in a love triangle with a perky, but socially awkward, young aspiring actress and a prostitute dying of consumption, one goes to see these movies to watch a bunch of giant monsters beating the crap out of each other, and this movie did NOT disappoint!

But the second time i went, i liked this movie a lot more and was the best movie of this monsterverse so far.The monster scenes in this movie are incredible, the first time Godzilla showed up against Ghidorah it was amazing. When Rodan appeared out the volcano and started causing destruction it was an awesome scene, and Mothra appearing at the start was also amazing. The end fight with all the monsters was probably one of the best fights out of the whole franchise.The soundtrack to this movie was amazing, the original Akira Ifukube theme was remastered and it sounded so nostalgic, it made the whole cinema shake throughout the whole film.The cinematography and special effects to this movie are really good, the shots of the monsters are really well done and never cease to amaze. The CGI on the monsters was flawless and looked really good.The characters are a mixed bag, the acting was really good for a lot of the cast. Dr Serizawa played by Ken Watanabe is back and he is better than he was than the first Godzilla movie back in 2014. Charles Dance who plays Jonah Alan was a good human villain. Millie Bobby Brown, Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler, Zhang Ziyi acted really well.Overall, this movie is an awesome movie for Godzilla fans, monster fans and the general audience as well, but if you want to see a movie for a really good story with a lot interesting characters and intriguing dialogue, then maybe give it a pass.Overall","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

The action is ramped up to unseen levels in the franchise, although this has similar problems as Godzilla's previous outing when it comes to the human characters, they are a little underdeveloped and bland.I'm all in on the Titan action though which sees several other monsters from Toho's roster make appearances to face off with each other in a myriad of combinations. These fights manage to stay fresh and inventive, but most of all are epic in scale. The cinematography and score have taken a massive leap ahead in this movie and really shine through to make you feel for these titanic beasts.There are some interesting themes about the impact of humanity on the world plus some religious undertones if you're looking for them, but this is all background to the foreground action.The plot can be a little hand wavy, and having the human ""bad guys"" be eco-terrorists is a little cliché and problematic given the situation our world finds itself in. However if what you really want is epic monster action then this movie delivers and then some, and I loved it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

I've been a fan of the big behemoth for years. One of my favorite sub-genres of films is monsters movies. I lump a lot of films into that category. But out of all the on-screen monsters outside of Frankenstein, Godzilla is my favorite. I was a huge fan of the 2014 remake. It was a film that made me shed tears of joy by the end of it. I know many fans weren't happy with the films. The complaints stemmed from too much human drama and not enough Godzilla on screen. I really liked how the director Gareth Edwards hide Godzilla for most of the film, letting the film play out like an old school monster film in the vein of Jaws. And that final battle was epic and fun. The film as a whole worked so well for me. So, I was thoroughly excited about this epic sequel.Godzilla: King of the Monster takes place five years later in the present, the global monster surveillance Monarch is not facing scrutiny from the US government. But they are keeping an eye on these titans around the world. But when an unforeseen human factor awakes many of the titans on earth, it's up to the people of Monarch (including Kyle Chandler, Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, O'Shea Jackson Jr.) to help aid Godzilla in a fight for the planet. Also in the cast is Charles Dance who plays a former British soldier with ulterior motives for the world, aided by a scientist Vera Farmiga who has her daughter played by Millie Bobby Brown in tow. David Strathairn is the other cast member that reprises his role from the original film.Now I know issues with this big summer blockbuster that rely upon a lot of fx always have issues with the human story. I won't lie that when the humans are on screen the film is not as much fun. But there are some decent performances from Whitford, Middleditch, and Watanabe. With Watanabe getting one of the best moments in the film and probably the most emotional human moment. I really like what they did with his arc in the film. It definitely seems like everyone is giving their all, well outside of Dance, who does seem like he sleeping walking through an updated version of Tywin Lannister. Whitford and Middleditch get the best lines and most of the comedic moments. Chandler does his thing as the lead and father of the film. Millie goes full emotional daughter which she can do well. It would have been nice to see her get to stretch a bit like she does in Stranger Things.But what most people will be coming to see in this film is the monster action. Director Michael Dougherty does not disappoint. From the start of the film, it pulls focus from the humans to the titans, who I have forgotten to mention outside of Godzilla in this film are Mothra, Rodan, and nemesis to all the three-headed King Ghidorah. They give Ghidorah an excellent origin that explains most of the story between the rivalry it has with Godzilla. The action is huge. The spectacle is on a massive scale. It's fun, entertaining and at many times will keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. The battles are so beautiful and well shot I wouldn't be surprised if the film is up for not only a special fx oscar but even a cinematography award. Dougherty doesn't skimp on the chaos. It only escalates from the opening to the wild battle of the finale.This is the type of big monster film that all of us fans have been waiting for. Just to see these film titans on the big screen is one thing. But when they fight it's a thing of beauty. I love that it seems Dougherty is a fanboy for the Godzilla and Kaiju universe. He lays a lot of easter eggs in the film. So many that I'm going to be picking them out in multiple rewatches. This is a film you see on the biggest screen you can find. I can only imagine what the IMAX experience was like. Thankfully, the film plays out on its own as it's own contained story. It's not a major setup for Kong vs. Godzilla but they lay the groundwork for that huge matchup we will see next year.I am thoroughly happy with Godzilla: King of the Monsters. One of my favorite characters in the series gets an excellent moment, the film is funny when it wants to be, and the monster action is beautiful on an epic scale. I could have done with less of the human factor, more monsters and maybe less plot that retreads ideas we've seen before. But for what was on screen, I'm super happy with the final product that definitely seems like director Michael Dougherty shot with love for Godzilla, it's fans and history. For the fans of the big behemoth, this is run out and see. For action fans, I would see this on the biggest loudest screen that there is. It's a huge fun adventure that really never stops.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

What misses is pretty much everything with human character, with maybe the exception of any scene with Dr. Ishiro Serizawa.
This film really does have some terrible dialogue. None of the characters are really fleshed out, they're just really boring and only spit out exposition and cheesy one liners. Even some shots can be hard to watch with fast cuts and shaky cam, making those scenes unwatchable and incoherent.
But, that being said, the cinematography (for the most part) and visuals are just stunning. There's a handful of shots in this film that make your jaw drop like when Ghidorah seemingly recreates William Blake's ""The Great Red Dragon"".
All of the monsters are also hefty in this film, taking such a large scale in their environment, plus they're in the story more than in the 2014 Godzilla which is automatically a good thing. And the action scenes, good god they're impactful, heavy, and exactly what you'd want to see from a Godzilla film.
If you want to see Godzilla and other monsters mess some stuff up - this is the film. But if you're looking for anything else like a good story and decent human characters to attach to, you're definitely in the wrong place.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, never gets boring, never the same sets, wonderful split-tones. The VFX clearly left me speechless, i believe this has been the only live-action movie i have ever watched, so heavily stylized yet so realistic, it really drives you into the monster world. And from here on it's all a mess. The story, though it has immense potential in keeping the action and vfx up and running throughout the show, feels ""drafty"", as if the scriptwriters were too lazy to rework it once more and actually provide us with a gripping experience (and they were really close). Things happened that made you wonder why on earth they didn't do this or that to justify this sequence, this or that being even one more line in the script. Moving on to the directing, what can i say except it was terrible, the pacing was off, numerous flow blunders, and a poor coverage selection. The editing couldn't but take no risks with this sort of material, so it ended up conventional and uninspiring, yet kind of ok. The other horrible part of the movie where the characters. Boring, with irrational personalities yet so predictable, they were just a blank sheet of paper we were supposed to empathize with. They could have completely skipped the human characters, since the monsters themselves were more intriguing, yet they made the audience sit through a bunch of pointless sequences describing people nobody cares about. Despite the (many) errors however, the positive aspects of this movie still offer it a place in the top-notch productions in the industry.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

Their battles are intense and fully satisfying.On the other hand the human characters are in the main just background noise, occasionally I found myself thinking please move away from the humans I want to see more Kaiju, particularly with the final battle scene which I won't spoil here.Overall I found this to be a great movie for any Kaiju lovers as well as those seeking action, as I say ignore the critics and go see this film, you won't be dissapointed","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

The actors/actresses that have to act these scenes in front of green screens should be commended! Very interesting in how Kong will be incorporated to the movie. Can't wait to see that spectacle!!!!

The sequel, for me, is a vast improvement. Clocking in at over 2 hours it zips along. The visuals are excellent. The battles just as mammoth as you'd expect. There's even an emotional arc for Godzilla which really works. The main problem is that the humans in the film are, again, the weakest link. There is too much focus on the human story and the central family, and I was never really invested in any of the human characters. I know box office takings are not where the studio expected them but this sequel has definitely left me wanting to see Kong take on the king.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

But Ken Watanabe is good, so was Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga, they can't help but be good, and Bradley Whitford has some good moments.

The release was not the success it was hoped to be, and the critics, as they often do, gave it a hard time. In 2014, Legendry Entertainment made a far better-received version. In 2019 came the sequel, which proves the old adage 'third time lucky' to be quite true.This is a true celebration of audience memories of Godzilla films, whichever ones they may be. Triumphant echoes to the past include purist-pleasing mentions of Godzilla 'lore' (if we are to call it that), none more so than vast slabs of music from the original films including, of course, Akira Ifukube's monumental original theme. Bear McCreary 's music sometimes strays into unmemorable bombast, but also has moments of greatness, particularly Ghidorah's sing-song call to his titanic minions.I found the human characters - rarely anyone's reason for seeing such a film - incredibly bland in 2014's 'Godzilla': square-jawed vacuums racing around the carnage trying to save their insignificant family trophies from probable death thanks to Big G and his city-snuffing ways. There is an element of that here, particularly towards the end, but the human characters are a lot more real, a lot better acted and therefore much easier to care about. Debonair Charles Dance lends his steely-eyed insidiousness to the much less virtuous Jonah Alan. (If, like me, you wondered what happened to him towards the end, stick around after the credits have rolled.) Sally Hawkins is also very good as the PJ Harvey-esque Dr, Vivienne Graham, and Millie Bobby Brown not only makes sure her character, young Madison, steers clear of the brattish tendencies that sometimes afflicts heroic film juveniles, but that she is also very real and appealing.And yet the monsters are who we really come to see. And 'King of the Monsters' does not disappoint. We see plenty of them, and this time, the camera doesn't cut away every time a fight breaks out. Ghidorah is one heck of a nasty piece of work, albeit with a nifty, icky way of regenerating on of his three heads if need be. Rodan is great fun, all beak and swooping wings. Mothra is genuinely beautiful, and possesses a sense of the ethereal that earlier films often strove for, but didn't always achieve (there's even a brief mention of her guiding human twins, although mercifully we're speared actually seeing them).As for the main man, the big lad, the star performer, Godzilla - he's been battered in fights before, but always come back fighting. Here, he requires a little help. Does this undermine him as The King? Not really. His regenerative powers are revealed, but if left to the natural cause of things, the world might have come to an end. So he is given a push (albeit one requiring a massive cost), no more than that. And there is something air-punchingly great about his returns from the brink. Such moments have been great in the past but here, with some extraordinary effects at play and with such a horrible and seemingly unstoppable opponent, it is difficult not to feel elated. Watching this on the big screen with a bunch of strangers, I felt like cheering. And when the sparingly used atomic breath makes an appearance, it's impossible not to feel elated.My score for this is 9 out of 10. 'King of Monsters' hardly puts a step wrong. We're not waiting 45 minutes for the first bout of monster action, and after the fights are over, we don't have tedious minutes of sickly human 'bonding' to sit through. Looking through the rolling ends credits, you can understand why it has taken five years to plan and make this meticulous masterpiece. You'd need an atomic heart not to enjoy it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

All of the characters, other than a few, play a specific stereotype that we usually see in these type of movies. The hard headed character may have a change of heart later on and the villains will usually be the mustache twirling villains. I thought everyone here did a decent job, but they weren't provided with anything to do other than to be a certain role. The film did have some potential of providing plenty of depth to the main leads so that they can justify their actions a bit more, but in the end, they are underdeveloped and other than a scene with exposition, we won't be able to fully connect with and understand the characters. These characters do make decisions that you will not like and the film will have plenty of loopholes that will end up damaging the film. Some of the logic that you see is outrageous and there were things that happened just for the plot. This didn't bother me too much as I thought each character was necessary and they didn't annoy me as other characters have in the previous Godzilla movies; especially with the other negative things that I have mentioned.There are few things that did bother me such as Ziyi Zhang's character having a sister who appears in one scene, but was not shot well and I thought I was watching this particular scene with the same character we were following throughout the film, only to find out that it wasn't the main sister that was shown. After the movie, I was told about it and it made me not like how that scene was edited. Another one will have to be the soundtrack, which is both awesome and cheesy. They use the iconic song from the original Japanese film and added a few additions such as people chanting the name of Godzilla and adding a bit of chants that you here at a Japanese festival. It's so cheesy and I cringed a bit just because I thought that it didn't work well.The main attraction for this movie are the monsters and this movie did more with the monsters than its predecessor and it brought more than I expected to see. I have a huge soft spot for watching the classic Godzilla films, even enjoying watching the people in those suits fighting one another. Ever since the first film, I wanted to see Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidora in CG and this movie did not disappoint. I loved the look of these creatures and all of the action scenes are very exciting, which put a huge smile on my face. With more action scenes and providing more of a spectacle, this film did something that the predecessor introduced briefly and tried to expand the universe that was created here. Some may disagree and that is understandable, but I just love these kaiju movies and I'm totally excited for the next film with King Kong.One of the main reasons that I think Michael Dougherty was hired to make this film was that he is very good of providing a certain feel and being able to focus well on what is popular, which in this case is the kaiju. Sure, the human characters are dumb and they do some pretty dumb things, but I am able to look past that due to other ""Godzilla"" films doing something more stupid and I just loved every single moment with the kaijus.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Godzilla: King of the MonstersDisclaimer: I am a life long fan of Kaiju (Japanese for 'strange beast') movies. I have seen almost all of them and generally liked them. There is no high standard in the genre, most were barely 'B-grade' movies, with cult followings. There are certain rules in most movies that don't apply to this genre.The 3 main Kaiju expected in the story, re-branded as ""titans"" in this movie:
Mothra appears early with a key story element involving sound.
Gidhora, aka Monster Zero - traditionally has been an ET
Rodan - formerly a kind of pterosaur, now more of a phoenixThe movie is ambitious in a number of ways, telling a big story, very fast, about big monsters and the devastation they cause, because human hubris is even bigger and more dangerous. And that is quite a challenge most movies fail at, especially remakes/re-boots... but not this one.
It works, and is a worthy Kaiju movie, which means it will not have broad appeal or a big box office take. That is the way Genre Movies are.
The battles are visual intense and serves the story well.
The tech borders on fantasy levels which is expected for this kind of film.
The dialogue although slightly predictable is adequate to keep the story movie along a near obvious line and conclusion, which doesn't really make the move any less fun. It is the one reassurance given to us that allows the viewer to enjoy it, much like a safer bar on a roller coaster.Charles Dance - as a bad guy. Excellent casting choice and even makes lame lines work effectively.Vera Farmiga - meh, completely forgettable to the point of almost being superfluous, despite being a central character. Her central motivation is grief and self-delusion. Pretty cliché as characters go.Ken Watanabe - as a veteran of the genre, he knows and delivers.Ziyi Zhang - not a lot of lines but a critical anchor character, and she is perfect.Kyle Chandler - heavy handed and over the top, bordering on Shatner'ing. He does manage to drive the story which wouldn't work with more traditional acting. Kaiju is one place it works and is almost expected.Thomas Middleditch - Corporate type you instantly expect to die in a gristly way. Kind of his niche, so no points for or against him.David Strathairn - back as the admiral, provides perfect continuity to the 2014 movie.Writing - Better than average for the genre and at some points good by broader standards.Director - He is very fond of fast camera moves & cuts as a substitute for actual drama or tension. Not enough establishment shots to anchor the action and mood so it gets helter-skelter and disorienting, and it can be a good tactic on a technical level but over used and most audiences are not going handle it well...Special recognition is deserved for showing the military as diverse as it actually is.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Godzilla 2:King of the Monsters was made for Imax, all my expectations were blown away by just how good the sound effects in this movie were.....every foot stomping, chaos inducing, building smashing, titans roaring moment was captured perfectlyOne of the complaints about the last Godzilla movie in 2014 was that the star of the movie, Godzilla himself hardly got any screen time.....well don't be scared people because Godzilla gets heaps more screen time in this latest movie, and the same for the other Titans.
This truly is an epic, popcorn munching movie where you go and see a world where these gigantic Titans are unleashed and realize how humans are totally insignificant and tiny in the scheme of things.

The film's score by Bear McCreary is also incredible, and it helps to create a sense of epicness and scale throughout the film.The story of Godzilla: King of the Monsters is both epic and intimate. The film explores themes of family, nature, and the power of the human spirit in a way that is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant. The film's ending is also ambiguous, which leaves the viewer to ponder the film's themes long after the credits have rolled.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

The main reason that I went to see it was because Millie Bobby Brown was in it. But, after watching this, I am a fan of Godzilla now too. I'm going to have to go back and watch other movies.The monsters were awesome and the fight scenes were epic. I would have liked to see more of some of the other monsters, but that is understandable that they weren't in it as much, because it is a movie about Godzilla primarily.I have seen some reviews complaining about the human element. I don't think it was bad. The humans were acting like humans, and I don't think that distracted from the story.This was a great movie for me to see as my first Godzilla movie. I look forward to watching others!","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

The scale of this movie is colossal, big ships, big subs, big mountains, big monsters - everything's colossal! The pace is fast and engaging. The main problem with this particular story is the ""MY family comes first, and you must all help me save them!"" aspect of this. Thus, our protag, Dr Mark Russell, bosses around military officers and anyone within his orbit to achieve that end. At least we have Bradley Whitford as Dr Rick Stanton who attempts to bring a comedic ""who do you think are"" balance to the party. But overall, it's the best modern-era G'zilla movie I've seen, with great/expensive production values that calls for your best popcorn while watching :-)","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

However Godzilla gives us a good mix of characters and well versed actors, a intwined plot, and more action then we could ask for.So why should you spend your money to watch it easy if you have watched the previous 2 films you owe it to your self if not movie plus a great cast should help to sit you down in a seat. Adding some well done cinematography, cgi and a dash of flair. So the final point will you like the film? That a personal opinion but as the old saying goes we always want moreSo sit back grab a soda, some popcorn and an icecream","0 out of 0 found this helpful."
"9","/10","Monsters universe at its best","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7892132/?ref_=tt_urv","meabak360","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57486468/?ref_=tt_urv","23 February 2022","Well following the Monsters universe, I watched 'Godzilla: the king of Monsters'. To be honest, I was really surprised that how good it is. I never would have imagined that it would be such an improvement to Godzilla (2014) and kong: skull island. Starting with the story, the US government wants to shut down the MONARCH and wants to eliminate all monsters that have been discovered. Meanwhile, a scientist (Vera Farmiga) builds a device that can be used to make contact with monsters using sounds but she get abducted by a terrorist group and now the device is in the wrong hands. The plot follows a sensible path and reaches a thrilling peak in the middle of the movie. I believe that the writers wanted to show the true potential of the universe in this movie playing all their cards, and I believe they were successful doing this. Choice of the cast is truly epic and expensive with some of the cast from the last movies and adding a few known actors and actresses like Vera Farmiga (from conjuring movies) and Charles Dance (from Game of Thrones). Sound effects are at their best and the film is full of them. Music and soundtracks are very good too and used at the very best moments. CG and graphic visuals are another important part and I couldn't find any problems regarding that matter.Overall, this movie is really good and I recommend it if you are a fan of sci-fi movies. It has done all the elements with only a few mistakes that can be ignored.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

I'm looking forward to Kong vs Godzilla in 2020 which I'm sure still be just as kick ass. The perfect summer action popcorn flick. This nerd was not disappointed.

Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, and other behemoths crash about devastating whole cities, fighting for ultimate supremacy. The only complaint stems from the very limited glimpses we get of some of the lesser-known creatures, some of which are very cool looking. However, this is a small quibble. And the final showdown is definitely worth waiting for.The human characters are also quite good, with Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler playing the estranged Emma and Mark Russell, and Millie Bobby Brown as their precocious daughter, Madison.A highly entertaining, worthy entry in the kaiju movie genre...","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

It takes about an hour for us to see the monsters, this movie has the same problems as the 2014 movie, except that had better over all story, don't get me wrong this movie is still awesome, but there is room for improvement. The only character that's actually interesting is Watanabe's character, but that's all. I think that's about it. It's essentially the 1980s movie with modern effects, it's fun but it's not a masterpiece. If you're looking for a movie where monsters fight and less screentime for the humans i would suggest Godzilla vs hong or skull island.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

I didn't even closely expect this movie to be this good and most of the movie is all about the cinematics which are beyond anything ive ever seen in my life in any movie. The first half of the movie was ok but when it was the end and the climax it was insane and the fight scenes where incredible and i can not even explain how good this was. I watched this at my house but it felt like i was at the theaters because of how loud i had the tv and the noises were good and all the monsters were so cool and i love how they included the old school Godzilla music in there sometimes even during the fight scenes. I also like the different phases of Godzilla especially the fire Godzilla at the end and the end was very cool and spectacular. I also like how old school they did when they included all the old monsters from the old ones so its like a remake of all monsters attack. My parents loved it and so did i, cant wait for Godzilla vs king Kong, watch this now.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

Hibernating monsters, or ""Titans"" have been discovered throughout the world sparking debate and controversy about what to do with them, or if they can co-exist with humans. Big, bombastic monster movie follows a fairly straightforward pattern: pile on hordes of city-leveling destruction and chaos...stop for some exposition, preaching, and ineffectual human drama...throw out more action and destruction--then do it all over again. Despite the redundancy it goes on for quite some time, likely so you never get a chance to breathe or ask legitimate questions about the stability of the plot. Even with some good actors in the cast, after a while it's simply boring and headache-inducing, and doesn't create much anticipation for the future despite how hard it tries. Director must be a fan of disaster specialists (e.g. Roland Emmerich, Michael Bay) as this echoes their works in more ways than one. **","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

While there is no denying that this sequel is bigger than Gareth Edwards' film, whether it's better or not is one hotly debatable topic.The tweaks in Godzilla's design is a welcome aspect, plus the new kaijus to inhabit the MonsterVerse are expertly designed, detailed & rendered but the same level of commitment is missing when it comes to human counterparts, for all of them are instantly forgettable. VFX team does all it can to give this picture the level of grandeur it aspires for but shortcomings in the storytelling department prevents it from soaring to new heights.Michael Dougherty certainly removes the shackles and gives these larger-than-life Titans their fair share of screen time. Mothra, Rodan & Ghidorah are all impressive to look at and the three-headed monster even lives up to the hype for the most part. But no amount of fleeting imagery & CGI spectacle can make up for what it lacks in the narrative section. King of the Monsters is loud, epic & visually imposing but it is also silly, stupid & hollow from within. And it lets the viewers decide for themselves which side they are going to settle for & embrace.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."
