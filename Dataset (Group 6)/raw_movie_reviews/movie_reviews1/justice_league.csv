I mean, it's kinda fun, but forgettable, cause too mich of its gits were removed. Whereas, the newer director's cut by the original director, Zack Snyder, is the lengthy, epic extravaganza the story needs!","43 out of 53 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Justice League is, unfortunately, plagued with post-production issues.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4073865/?ref_=tt_urv","TheMovieDiorama","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur67902729/?ref_=tt_urv","25 February 2018","Here we are. The Justice League. DC's greatest superheroes come together to save the world...and what is the first scene you ask? Henry Cavill's CGI'd shaved face. Ohhh dear...yup...we're in for quite a ride. So with Superman dead, Batman and Wonder Woman must arrange a team of gifted individuals to stop the world destroyer Steppenwolf from, you guessed it, destroying the world. Sighhhh...I kinda just want to hug this film and repeatedly whisper ""there, there...it'll all be alright."". Apprehensively, I went into this unmotivated and expecting the worst superhero film since Suicide Squad. Fortunately, this isn't that bad. But, it's not great either. The film's greatest achievement is the coalition of the Justice League members. Their interactions, mannerisms and even their physicality was pretty much on point. Aquaman, although absolutely useless in this, had the physical prowess of a beastly underwater warrior. The Flash was quirky and provided several comedic moments. Cyborg was essentially the technological logistics manager. Wonder Woman and Batman were the parents who lead their children into battle. Heck, she even refers to them as children! Yet it all worked so well. Remember, this is a comic book adaptation, so the humour and light hearted nature of its source material does show. The human CGI for the most part was actually executed well (far better than ""Thor Ragnarok"") and the slow motion scenes with The Flash were gorgeous to watch. Snyder is typically style over substance, which is apparent here. The story is so boringly uninspired that it defines the word ""lazy"". I cannot be dealing with another 'save the world' situation. I'm also becoming irritated with underused, bland and weak villains who are supposed to be absurdly powerful. Steppenwolf was wasted potential. Constant use of green screen, hit and miss script, rushed third act...just too many flaws I'm afraid. Was it too soon for a Justice League film considering no origins for Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg yet? Personally, I think so.","191 out of 258 found this helpful.

It's not a bad movie per se, it's just extremely dull. Of course there's nothing new in the photo department but that's to be expected, it's kind of an identity for the whole DCEU. I don't like it but hey, that's an artistic choice I won't criticize here, at least it's coherent. But some flaws are more crippling than that. Every single characterization was a bit off and some of them felt like they were forced, especially Barry Allen. Still, the actors do the best they can with the material so it's not unbearable. Every situation (and even the chain of events) is so predictable (clich√© even) that it gets you out of the movie. This level of ""nothing new"" is damaging to the story as it stops you from caring about anything. And it seems like the producers knew this cause they threw in the mandatory helpless family so that you could sense the danger a bit more. After all, it's just the end of the world, how could you care if there was no kid in immediate danger ? Oh wait... Still, even that falls flat as their scenes (and they're not the only ones) are filled with incoherent behaviors that were put there just so that the plot can go forward. I attended a screening where the only bursts of joy (or emotions at all) occurred when a new character appeared. Kind of a ""fanboy effect"" that fills you with hope at the sight of one of your beloved comics characters. But the rest of the time, everyone was quite bored and numerous sighs were heard. In a sense, it reassured me as I understood I was not the only one who was disappointed in the movie.*****The following paragraph might contain a minor SPOILER (depending on what you consider a spoiler)***** Plus, something else bothered me. But I know everyone won't agree on this one cause it's kind of a speculation. All the points above still stand even if I'm wrong about it. So here it is : Justice League felt like it was a failed attempt to adapt the Avengers in the DCEU. And I'm not talking about the strangely similar theme. Nor am I referring to the tension inside the team before they reconcile that felt like a watered-down version of what we saw in the 2012 movie by Whedon. But the characters are bent so that they match their Marvel counterparts. The Flash takes the place of the slightly weaker and wisecracking Hawkeye, Aquaman clearly corresponds to Thor with his royal and out-of-place persona, Wonder Woman goes through the same soldier- leader dilemma as Cap did and even Batman is slightly changed so that he's closer to Tony Stark (making decisions that make absolutely no sense for the world's best detective that we all know and love). That's a shame cause DC characters are interesting and have a lot more to offer than a mere copy. *****END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER*****As of 11/16/2017, this movie has an 8.1 score here on IMDb. Now I'm not a hater and won't say it's the worst movie in history but more than 8 ? Seriously ? It barely does the job so it's a 5 out of 10 for me.","337 out of 493 found this helpful.

He seeks out Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), but their combined power may not be enough, and they realize the one missing factor that could turn the tide of battle: the recently deceased Superman (Henry Cavill).This was another tortured production, with director Zack Snyder leaving the project either due to a death in the family or by the studio's insistence, depending on the source. Joss Whedon was brought on to finish the movie and ended up reshooting some earlier scenes. The final product seems rushed, under cooked, and dreadfully overloaded with too much unnecessary CGI effects. The common weakness in many of these superhero movies is the villain, and this is yet another example of that. The character is fully CGI and looks it, and it's difficult to feel menace from a cartoon in a non-animated movie. And the worst part is, it wasn't even needed, as the character was a normal human-looking person in the comic books, and the actor hired to basically just provide the voice, Ciaran Hinds, is a very good actor and would have been fine without the CGI embellishment. Another glaring visual flaw lies in Superman's mouth. Since the shoot ran over, Superman actor Henry Cavill was contractually obligated to start his filming on the upcoming Mission: Impossible film, a role that requires him to grow a bushy mustache. When he had to come back for reshoots on Justice League, the producers decided to just CGI out his mustache, with the end result a laughable, often deformed upper lip.On the plus side, Ezra Miller is amusing as The Flash, Gal Gadot continues to look great as Wonder Woman, and Momoa makes for an interesting twist on Aquaman, who is nothing like his comic book counterpart. Many of the acting heavy-hitters, including Amy Adams, Diane Lane, and Jeremy Irons, are just cameo window dressing.","19 out of 23 found this helpful.

Let me say it straight, i'm not reviewing a Great film, i'm talking about Average film so if you see any soft corner about any field then that means Average one not even Good.Justice League starts very slowly, looks like a bore flick for first 35-40 minutes and then picks up smartly. Later it continues the flow but after every explosive and entertaining scene there're 1 or 2 minutes loo breaks followed. Don't know why it happens, why film gets slow for few moments when screenplay was in top form? Then enough explosion at the end and later one surprising factor after end credits saves this Average flick to look an Above Average stuff. We've seen Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman in prequel and i'm glad to welcome 3 new guys in the team, Aquaman is Good, Flash is too good, Cyborg is decent. Some musical scenes feels irritating. Runtime is shorter than 2 hours and thanks to the editor for that but how could he trim that Superman's re-entry scene from Trailer (Alfraid says, Let's Hope you're not too late) ? Superman's Returning is slightly curved towards emotional bonding but it doesn't work at all. Villain is powerful but a fairy tale and retro look doesn't impress much. Visual Effects are Brilliant, could have been better for 3D viewing. Direction is messy, Snyder either needs to improve or needs to be removed from DCEU. We're waiting for One Good film from him and we're still waiting. Thanks to Jenskine for that one good film Wonder Woman otherwise Snyder has almost finished DCEU. Why he always go for a Dark film, why can't he just go for some fun and light moments like Marvel? Overall, Justice League is an Above Average film, obviously not that bad as critics said. Chuck the critics and go for it, those who liked BvS will surely like this and those who did not like BvS will also find it an Average One Time Watch. Enough Explosion and action in middle and at the End makes this one to worth your ticket Purchase. Talking about Box Office this one should do decent business in the range of previous 2 DCEU films or might even struggle to reach there while $1 Billion club is out of reach. I'm going with 6/10* and hoping for better a sequel which will have a League of Villains (This might be a spoiler).","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

Differently, from the edgy tone of Suicide Squad or Batman vs Superman, this movie is just like a real-life version of the old justice league animated series. The movie has its moment, maybe too long with too much detail just in case for newcomers, and I am OK with that. What I'm trying to say is, don't expect an Oscar worthy movie or a deeply underrated masterpiece like Watchmen, the movie is fun to watch, it has its tone, one of the closest live action of the old justice league animated series. 9/10 because there is no green lantern, there cant be any justice league without Hal Jordan or John Steward","24 out of 43 found this helpful.

JL is certainly not perfect, it does not do character development on the scales of the Dark Knight or some such..but it is definitely entertaining, fast-paced, positive and relatively lighthearted, and the characters are mostly placed correctly (at least along the lines of the animation episodes), as individuals and as part of the League.. this is certainly comparable to Wonder Woman in terms of how hopeful it feels overall.. and in some (inexplicable!) sense Synder's take on the previous movies also makes a bit more sense now, within this universe..at some level..

The trailer, particularly, with it's sacrilegious abomination cover of the Beatles' Come Together, gave me mixed feelings about it.DC have been playing catch-up with Marvel for ages, and it really shows. Half of the Justice League have already been introduced from previous films. The others (Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg) are given their proper debut here (no, I'm not counting their brief cameos in the other films) and the film does its best to integrate them into the story. The film is your standard 'evil overlord tries to take over the world' plot, with Batfleck trying to assemble the Justice League. The team have some funny lines occasionally, which I feel is thanks to Joss Whedon being one of the screenwriters, but once again, the Zack Snyder tropes come to the surface with numerous sped up/slo-mo action scenes. There were also a few lines of dialogue that made me cringe.The film overall is enjoyable but there are pacing issues. The villain of the piece is particularly forgettable. They try to build this sense of scale that looks grand and epic but ultimately it doesn't quite live up to the hype, in my opinion.If we're talking about wasted potential, how about JK Simmons as Commissioner Gordon? I really hope he has more time to shine in future films because he had no reason to be in this film other than establishing his presence in the DC Universe. Also, speaking of wasted talent/useless characters, Amy Adams as Lois Lane... I swear to God, her character development is halted in its tracks beyond simply 'I love Superman'. It's ridiculous.That aside, the main heroes perform well here. I particularly enjoyed Ezra Miller's interpretation of the Flash. Jason Momoa is just awesome in everything. Gal Gadot is great as Wonder Woman, yet again, Ray Fisher makes a good Cyborg (I found it ironic that his Dad was the actor who played Miles Dyson in Terminator 2) and Ben Affleck continues to be great as Bruce Wayne.Not terrible, not fantastic, but it's in the healthy middle ground for me.","35 out of 68 found this helpful.

It works at least as far as mitigating the damage, stopping the bleeding and keeping this ugly-looking spectacle alive, but it's not exactly the miracle cure for the mountains of ills currently plaguing the DCEU that fans were hoping for. What exactly does that make Suicide Squad; I don't know, probably the gangrene? Seemingly only a couple of weeks since the death of Superman, Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince aka Batman and Wonder Woman preemptively team-up to protect the world from external threat. To help them, they recruit young upstarts Barry Allen and Victor Stone aka The Flash and Cyborg; as well as marine demigod Arthur Curry aka Aquaman. This is so they can face down the eventual threat of the sinister Steppenwolf and his army of fear-fueled creatures from places unknown aka some inter-dimensional/space traveling hypno-beam (the film is not clear on this point).Starting with the good, the films as-of-yet introduced superheroes are interesting enough characters handled with the best of care by their actors. Miller especially does an excellent job keeping the mirth coming while staying true to the spirit and tone of The Flash and movie respectively. Momoa straight up shows up as Momoa sans the dreads but the rock star bravado he's known for works and works well all things considered. Fisher pulls double duty as a near constant fountain of exposition as well as a living breathing character worth investing in. It doesn't always work given the paragraphs worth of beans he needs to spill but at least no one is calling him the professor yet.The brightest star however is Gadot whose stunning beauty and otherworldly accent perfectly encapsulates every superficial thing we love about Wonder Woman. On a deeper level, Diana's naivet√© from the fondly revered Wonder Woman movie is gone, but what's still there is an inner strength that both serves to ground this movie, while being an understandable progression of a character now centuries old.The fact that Wonder Woman is the only character worth not just caring for but believing in should be an indication of what's the biggest problem with this movie. Even with the Batman in the mix, the stitched-together cadre feels less like the world's mightiest heroes and more like a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. They're given just enough time to go over their skill set and motivations but its all bullet points and untrimmed fat that at times derails the film's pacing. Take a scene transition early on where Bruce Wayne is buttering up Aquaman. This scene is then set against Wonder Woman's action-packed introduction, an edit that arguably works on a narrative level but feels jammed in there like a Janis Joplin tune played just after a cover of ""Come Together"".What's worse, Justice League always seems to be in a rush to get somewhere guaranteeing moments of depth and exposition stick out harshly against the action. Bruce Wayne jets here and there, Steppenwolf picks a fight with the Amazons and the Atlantians, Wonder Woman comes swooping through a terrorist plot etc. It's all action-packed in its own bruising, unremarkable way, but none of it is good at conveying information, establishing stakes or forwarding the plot.Luckily the plot is so simple as to ensure the slow bits are over quickly. Evil-because-he's-evil Steppenwolf wants all the shiny cubes and our protagonists are doing everything in their power to stop him. That's basically it, a first draft good versus evil macguffin hunt that seems to be avoiding themes from the other films until a certain subplot makes it impossible. It doesn't add anything to the genre that they're fighting the third DC villain in five movies with a horned helmet on some power trip about world destruction but at least it makes sense this time around.And before you go huffing and puffing about how the complex mythology behind Superman, Darkseid and the infinite Earth crisis is justification for the repetitiveness; you need to first read the forthcoming sentence aloud and slowly. Movies do not require homework! Knowing the larger purpose and machinations of a motherbox is no more an indication of this movies quality than reading The Dark Knight Returns retroactively makes BvS not a pile of garbage. Enough makes sense this time around but it's still repetitive.And can we take a moment to talk about Batfleck again? I was very loudly not a fan of his older, reactionary Batman in BvS but since that movie was such a dumpster fire, I was willing to give everyone involved a mulligan so long as this one was at least passable. It is, but the poor man still looks like a bewildered stepfather who won the part in a raffle and continues wearing the cowl because his stepson finally thinks he's cool. It's just not a good use of your Affleck. Affleck is good for two things: being an a**hole and being a quiet blank slate a la his character in Argo. Batman is neither of those things but thanks to Affleck he comes across as both. Not something you want for the founder of the Justice League.A reported $25 million worth of reshoots, the unexpected absence of director Zack Snyder due to personal reasons and a shaky foundation built upon the most hated franchise movie to come out since Batman & Robin; it's actually kind of impressive this thing didn't turn out worse. It's not up to the level of another team-up movie that shall remain nameless but at least with Justice League, DC and Warner Bros. prove they're slowly learning from their mistakes. I admire this movie, I really do, but to the extent that I'd admire a fat guy running a marathon. It's trying; it's just too ill-prepared and bloated to do the job efficiently.","30 out of 58 found this helpful.

When going forward with the fifth film (the all-important one that ties everything together and launches it into the stratosphere), do you stick with what you know? Or do you try to learn from the outpouring of love and acclaim that greeted Wonder Woman, the outlying fourth film? Do you add more humour and a dash of fun to the generally dark, dour proceedings? Do you refine your script to focus a little more on character and less on bombastic spectacle? In the case of Justice League, the answers ‚Äì and corresponding results ‚Äì are mixed. (Kinda, kinda, yes, kinda, by the way.) Justice League opens in the wake of Superman's (Cavill) death. The world ‚Äì and his erstwhile frenemy Bruce Wayne/Batman (Affleck) ‚Äì are in a dark depression. But cataclysmic sieges on a planetary scale wait for no man (or woman). Steppenwolf (played by Hinds via motion-capture), an ancient, alien evil that once tried to claim Earth as his own, has returned with an army of fear-fuelled parademons. Bruce realises that, without Superman as the first and best line of defense, he needs to assemble a team (a 'justice league', as it were) to save the world.Consequently, the first half of the film is rather exposition-heavy, as it busily sets up its characters, relationships and stakes. Bruce reunites with Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gadot), just as she's begun to step out from beneath the shadow of grief. We also get to know the other potential League members that we've only glimpsed in passing ‚Äì snarky speedster Barry Allen/Flash (Miller); sassy fish-whisperer Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Momoa); and surly human machine Victor Stone/Cyborg (Fisher).Thankfully, Justice League isn't as relentlessly dark and joy-free as director Zack Snyder's previous entries in the DCEU. While there's nothing wrong with going full grim when putting superheroes on screen (Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy proved that you could do so with depth, flair and intelligence to burn), Snyder's Man Of Steel and Batman Vs. Superman were curiously bleak pictures. Stuffed with bombastic spectacle and testosterone- charged face-offs, both films were more or less dreadful, displaying a fundamental misunderstanding of their main characters. (Cavill's broody Superman, in particular, is a painfully misguided interpretation of DC Comics' most iconic superhero, a literal and figurative beacon of light.) In contrast, there's a brighter vein of hope and humour threaded throughout Justice League, though it's unclear just how much of that can be credited directly to Snyder. The main reason for that is the involvement of Joss Whedon, who wrote and directed Marvel's two enormously successful and largely acclaimed Avengers films. Initially brought on to doctor the script, Whedon wound up overseeing post- production on the film (including significant reshoots), after Snyder chose to take some time off for very sad personal reasons.Without question, the final film benefits from the injection of Whedon's signature banter and his ability to effectively juggle multiple character narratives. Whether it's Barry and Victor bonding in a graveyard or Arthur's big speech before the final battle, Whedon contributes some of the most purely fun ‚Äì and funny ‚Äì moments in the DCEU to date.Characters and relationships, though more sketched than fleshed out, work well enough. As the film progresses, each member of the fledgling League works out who they want to be, as people and as the earth's self-appointed defenders. The newcomers are all decent, though not quite the breakout successes the studio is no doubt hoping for. Miller's Flash starts out adorable but ends up annoying. Momoa is underserved by the script, but nails the swagger. With just half his face to work with, Fisher amps up the angst while buried beneath some oddly ugly character design.As for DC's Big Three, it can be tough to buy into Diana's decades-long descent into grief following the character-defining climax of Wonder Woman. But, given that her arc is necessarily dictated by earlier narrative decisions, Gadot finds some lovely emotional beats to play as Diana chooses to lead and share her light with the world. The film also nudges the hitherto badly-botched relationship between the late Superman and Lois Lane (Amy Adams, still criminally underused) in a better direction.The biggest surprise of Justice League is how Affleck's Batman ‚Äì almost rabidly xenophobic in Batman Vs. Superman ‚Äì grounds both the film and the team. There's something hauntingly poetic about watching this taciturn loner, who could so easily hide himself away in a fortress of wealth and power, trying to atone for the world's loss of Superman. Embracing the fact that he's by far the most mortal member of the League, the film finds the heroism in Batman's humanity.For all that it gets right, though, Justice League suffers for being what it largely still is: a Snyder blockbuster. He tends to favour overblown spectacle and one-dimensional villains, both of which culminate in the peculiarly unmenacing Steppenwolf ‚Äì a CGI-drenched creation that manages to be hammy and fake all at once. The plot is, somehow, stupidly convoluted and insultingly simple at the same time. ('Mother Boxes' must be another way of spelling 'MacGuffin'.) And, while absolutely everything about this film is better than what Snyder has produced before, it still never quite grabs the heart.Nonetheless, Justice League is a step in the right direction. It doesn't reach the glorious heights of Wonder Woman, but it doesn't regress to the murky depths of Batman Vs. Superman either. With its story and characters turned firmly towards the light, there might be hope for this franchise yet.","42 out of 85 found this helpful.

Contrary to the constant critic bashing, which to be perfectly honest has gotten out of control and extremely annoying fast for a while now, critics get a good deal of respect from me. Even when my opinions differ to theirs, which has happened a fair number of times, their appraisals and criticisms are very understandable and it is easy to see where they are coming from. 'Justice League' is a case of the film being much better than anticipated, considering the word of mouth and 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' being so disappointing. Is 'Justice League' better than that film? Yes, by quite a bit.'Justice League' does have its problems. Although the CGI is pretty good on the whole, there is an over-reliance of it and it doesn't always add to some of the scenes. The story has its fun and excitingly compelling moments, but a lot of it does feel rushed, which does see too many abrupt tonal and storytelling shifts, and some of the first half has a cobbled together and rambling quality. Am usually not one to carp about plot holes, much of the time it is a lazy criticism to me, but one can fit the Grand Canyon through some of them and some border on the ridiculous.The rushed pacing does come at the expense of character development, which tends to be rather flimsy. Particularly true to this is the villain, there is nothing menacing or remotely interesting about him, he's basically a very dull just there sort of character. Ciaran Hinds is completely wasted, while Ray Fisher is somewhat dull. Not all the jokes work, some feel out of place, while the final battle could have had more excitement and Danny Elfman's music score is uninspired and forgettable.On the other hand, most of the acting is very good. Ben Affleck brings a brooding intensity to Batman and he didn't seem that bored to me. Other bright spots in the cast are Jeremy Irons' very amusing Alfred, Amy Adams' feisty if somewhat underused Lois Lane, Jason Momoa's beautifully judged Aquaman and particularly Gal Gadot's positively show-stopping Wonder Woman. Ezra Miller is amusing, if at times slightly too introverted, as Flash and Henry Cavill looks much more comfortable here than he did in 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'. Diane Lane and JK Simmons are also welcome presences.Visually, 'Justice League' is beautifully shot, far more cohesively edited and its boldly dark and gritty look fits very well within the story. The script is less clunky and dreary and lightened by some nice quirky humour and some jokes are amusing, especially the absolute hoot that involves the magic lasso. The action is mostly nicely choreographed and fun to watch, some of the characters are interesting and the chemistry is great.In summary, could have been much better but to me it wasn't that bad. 5.5-6/10 Bethany Cox","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

Not offensively bad like Batman V Superman, but certainly not good either. Everything came across as shallow and the CGI bad guy is the absolute worst. Why on earth did they need to go all CGI and not use an actor? I do totally agree with studio execs that forced them to keep the run time under two hours. Since everyone NOT Wonder Woman in this cinematic universe is terribly one dimensional, adding thirty minutes or more of mindless prattle would have been a terrible idea. Basically, there is no developing characters this shallow to start with... might as well go all video game cut scene action. As for Wonder Woman, THAT is the true ace the WB has going for them. Not the character so much as the actress they stumbled upon to play her. Talk about finding absolute gold. Gal Gadot hypnotizes and captivates on screen no matter what she is doing. Add action to her natural beauty and charm and you literally can't get enough of her in to the story. I'm sure they realize that the focus should be on her from here forward. Of the new characters, only Cyborg has any hint of depth at all. Both Flash and Aquaman are cardboard wastes so far. So, the DCEU is truly stuck in the shallow end of the pool but maybe Wonder Woman can single-handedly tow the universe to deeper and more interesting waters.Best overall quote I've read: ""Justice League was the cinematic equivalent of watching a classmate give a presentation they totally forgot about""","38 out of 71 found this helpful.

She is gorgeous and she looks amazing as Wonder Woman. The movie is scripted well but viewers need something good/worthy for all these superheros to go for a war all together.Jason Momoa as Aquaman appears cool and his appearance will go trendsetter styling now, specially Tattoos and the long haired and beard. The performances are average but Batman and Superman characters will be again loved by kids. Cyborg and Flash have played with heart and dedication.The slo-mo combat sequence between Superman versus Cyborg, Flash, Aquaman, Wonder Woman have been cinematographed excellently.The movie is worth a watch in theaters near you.

The movie brings together what we all hoped for, a team. its fun, bright and energetic with a balance of seriousness.A piece of advice don't go into this movie expecting to watch a movie on the level of the dark knight. In my opinion the only film to ever get close to that was the dark knight rises. As for the DC cinematic universe expect an array of bright movies the next possible dark movie you'll get is probably THE BATMAN.","312 out of 659 found this helpful.

The elephant-in-the-room and main selling point is the resurrection of Superman (Cavill), an open secret the film intractably refuses to divulge in its numerous trailers and posters, which comes about in the mid-point and temporarily instigates a mini-internecine scuffle, just to show who is the boss, before getting lovey-dovey and melancholic with Lois Lane (Adams), who is too poised to give away even a smidgen of incredulity (which says a lot about the comic book culture itself). As the inauguratory piece, JUSTICE LEAGUE's chief task is to assemble the cohort, thus the premise is set up by the resurgence of Steppenwolf (CGI-generated and voiced by Hinds), to reign the universe in darkness, the film's strongest visual input is surprisingly in the the first half, when Steppenwolf tentatively assaults the empyrean Themyscira (Amazons' homeland) and underwater Atlantis to snatch the almighty ""mother boxes"", and the fleeting flashback of how Steppenwolf is subdued for the first time, it has an epic whiff of panache and otherness, which diminishes when the war relocates on human's turf (a remote Russian village is circumspectly chosen for the climax after learning the lesson from the aftermath of laying waste to a highly-populated metropolis), with a bathetic revelation that perhaps, Steppenwolf's power is vastly overestimated, because he is categorically no rival of Superman, the quintet might just as well finish him off sans the film's obvious deus ex-machina. It is expected to pull punches in the league's first official sortie, but by enervating the villain who is introduced as an omnipotent monster in the beginning is a lame move (THOR: RAGNAROK on the contrary, fabricates a more plausible finale). For all the quibbles, there are several plus points too, firstly, it is a sage move to accentuate Batman's mortality, which begins to tell when fighting side by side with those superpower endowed, and he is considerably relegated to combat with the minions called Parademons in the showdown, a cross to bear for a mortal, and let's hope Bruce Wayne will take the hint and step down from the front-line in the next chapter, not because an elderly Alfred (Irons) does need a replacement to stay in front of all the consoles and screens, but also due to the fact that Diane Prince (Gadot) is ready to take the rein as a true leader for all mankind, it is time, right? Secondly, in a less solemn note, Ezra Miller's Flash jovially assumes the role as the comic purveyor because humor is what is wanting in DC's previous critically-panned tent-poles, because the delicate balance between levity and gravity is always the sticking point which does make a difference in audience's reception and the film's own worth. All in all, JUSTICE LEAGUE is not an enterprising innovator but a formulaic stepping stone to tantalize us that the next offering will be more toothsome, more grand and more arousing, but patience is dangerously wearing thin and interest will dry out someday, speaking for the reviewer himself, that day is beckoning.","14 out of 25 found this helpful.

I've just watched Justice League and have to admit, I don't know if it's my incredibly low - or virtually nonexistent - expectations, or the fact, that I'm a little sick right now, or the low price of admission, but this movie is the first one in the DC extended Universe, after Man of steel, that genuinely surprised me! (Wonder Woman was a film that was more needed for women in the movie industry, than a phenomenon which everybody seems to be calling) I can't seem to think of anything that would greatly bother me here. The movie isn't boring at all, there's plenty of action, the heroes all work together, they fight together, make good use of their abilities, they banter a lot between each other, got their backs when it's needed, nobody is exaggerated, the power level of individual character is true to the scenario (Batman is still just a strong human and Superman is an invincible alien)... I don't know, it all just clicked like two pieces of Legos. Interactions between them are funny when they should be, and where they shouldn't, there is some intrigue and a little drama. Flash isn't infantile or annoying (trailers marketed him that way). Aquaman isn't some big jock (similar). Cyborg... OK, Cyborg is there to push the plot forward, but even that works somehow. What's even more appreciated, there are moments, which make the heroes tonally appropriate. For instance, the scene where Superman shows up and does what he does, the moment with flash and later with Batman are instant gold. This one scene more than makes up for whole BvS movie. Right now I'm fresh from the viewing, so I'm seeing through pink glasses and I won't complain about one dimensional antagonist, or constant jumping from location to location without any coherent time frame or other flaws, which the film definitely has. Also, I won't compare it to Avengers, because I feel that's kind of a different movie overall, but my impressions after I left the Justice League are definitely on the good side, not the other way around, so for me it's a very pleasant feeling after all of the previous DCEU movies experienced on the big screen. But hey, what do I know? I'm the guy who didn't like Thor 3 AT ALL and thought that X-men: Apocalypse wasn't as bad as everybody thinks.","23 out of 45 found this helpful.

The terms 'fun' and 'dark' are the two that get tossed around the most when comparing these two franchises, and while many people are wrong to like a movie based on its tone, I can gladly say that not much complaining can be done about the tone of Justice League. Meshing light and dark to form a solid mixture of the two, due to some unfortunate circumstances behind the scenes, may have actually made this a better film than it originally was, but who really knows. As I said, the tone of this film is great in my opinion, but the movie itself is quite the mixed bag. There is a lot of fun to be had with Justice League, but here is a weighing of the pros and cons of this highly anticipated addition to the DC Universe of films.The premise is quite simple. An evil force in Steppenwolf has arrived and needs to find three so-called mother boxes in order to take over the world. Using what little backstory that Bruce Wayne has on many super-powered people, he, along with the help of Diana, form a team to take him down. With the hope that Superman may also return, this team must do everything they can to hopefully save the day. Although these characters are all a joy to see interacting with each other, herein lies the biggest issues with the film as a whole.There isn't much to say about the villain here because his storyline is almost too simple to even want to describe. He's a generic bad guy that wants to take over the world, who really only exists in order to make this team feel the need to band together and save the world. When a villain is just a tool for a team to exist, the overall impact of your movie won't ever reach a high point. That being said, even though the villain ruins the entire film for me every time he's on-screen, the characters surrounding him and how they all come together was really the highlight of the movie, making the price of admission worth it.No, characters like Cyborg, Aquaman, and The Flash aren't given quite enough backstory to really feel for them, but the casting of them is terrific and the little screen time they're given is fantastic. Their interaction with one another was great and I can't wait to see more of them in the future. There's honestly nowhere to go but up from this messy installation.Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot once again bring everything they have to the table and they sure seem to be making these characters their own, so I really hope they stick with this franchise for at least a few more years, because I feel as though there are some entertaining stories to be told if the post-credits sequences have anything to say about it.Many people will be going into this film hoping for some exciting Superman action, and although I won't give anything away for fans, I'll simply state that his small presence is more than worth the wait. Like in Man of Steel, his character, along with Lois Lane and his mother Martha definitely adds some great emotion to certain elements of the film. In terms of entertainment, this movie held my interest from start to finish and I'm actually looking forward to seeing the future progression of these characters after these first rocky few films. I like these characters a lot. They just deserve better films.In the end, comic book fans will have their share of shrieks throughout the film, from cameos to world-building, but it really just comes down to whether or not this is a good movie for the majority of audiences to flock out and see. Upon reflection, I enjoyed much more about this film than I disliked, so I would warrant a recommendation, but only to those who've followed each installment since Man of Steel, because not knowing who certain characters are would be a detriment to your experience.The movie feels very rushed, but there are great character moments to make up for that. Even though there is some very obvious CGI work throughout the film, the action is exciting and a joy to see on the big screen. Even though the villain is terrible, the team is a blast to see interacting on-screen. I seem to be finding a pro for every con, but it just comes down to whether or not I had a good time, and that's a pretty definitive yes. Justice League is a mess, but it's a mess I had fun with and that shows promise for the future. I enjoyed myself for the most part.","22 out of 43 found this helpful.

I think the characters and their interactions with each other are the best thing about this movie, but the characters are failed by a terrible script and choppy editing. This movie also has a villain so boring that even Marvel would be jealous.

The right things include hiring Joss Whedon to work over matters, because not everyone spends every second of every day being a miserable meanie, and that different things motivate different people. Some of the things they have learned that are wrong include 1: a dorky, brilliant teenager makes a great character, so let's make the Flash Spiderman; 2: the relationship between Paranoid Batman and everyone else doesn't work, so let's just.... gloss that over awkwardly, by having him behave awkwardly over it.That's fine, because these are all people who do not Play Well with Others. On the plus side, one thing DC figured out was how to deal with the Rock-em-Sock-em Robots battle, by putting in grades of robots, and noticing that there are actually civilians on the battlefield, and assigning some people to actually getting them out of the way of the FREAKING HOLOCAUST THAT'S APPEARING RIGHT AROUND THEM! On the other hand, the second third of the movie turns into Waiting for Superman, since once the Man of Steel shows up, neither G*d nor wombat can stand against his might.Mind you, I stopped reading comic books in 1969, and hadn't bothered with DC for half a decade before then. Still, it was more amusing and a better story than BATMAN VS SUPERMAN. They're still pinning their hopes on Gal Gadot, though.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Steppenwolf is a laughably bad villain, ripped straight out of a 90ies direct-to-DVD film. He is just a big bland CGI character with absolutely no personality whatsoever. He has no motivation other than being the generic evil guy trying to destroy the world. Apparently it's not even h√≠s plan. If I understood correctly, he's the henchman for some other character that we never learn anything about. His entire design was just uninspired, and he looked and sounded more like a weaker version of the Beast from the live action Beauty and the Beast than one of the strongest characters in the world, hellbend on creating destruction. Then there are the problems with the entire way that DC is approaching these movies. Making this an ensemble movie, just like with Batman v Superman, feels entirely unearned and a cynical attempt to cash in on the widespread brand recognition of Batman and Superman, and to a slightly lesser degree Wonder Woman, and of course the success of Marvel. It's really hard to look at this film and not conclude that this is DC's failed attempt at creating their version of The Avengers. However, whereas The Avengers' meetup felt natural, having been build up throughout its previous 5 movies, Justice League decides to introduce half of the entire league in just this movie. This makes most of the first half of the movie an uneven and boring bunch of random character introductions. Only Wonder Woman and the segments on Themyscira felt natural, because we were already introduced to their culture before and therefore had some connection to them.The rest of the Justice League itself is also lackluster. Jason Momoa's Aquaman was kinda interesting, but it once again feels incredibly cynical that they would introduce the character in this movie instead of in his own one, just because they knew that it would be hard to get people excited for an Aquaman standalone movie without an introduction to the character first. They don't care that it's to the detriment of the quality of this movie, it's just a way too get people to buy into a future film, exactly as they did with Wonder Woman. In this case they actually would have done well to look at Marvel, as they were able to introduce obscure and silly looking/sounding characters like Ant-Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy in standalone movies, and make it a critical and commercial success.Cyborg was just boring and uninteresting. He has no personality, there's nothing to his character, because there was not enough time for a proper introduction. Even his suit is making the decisions for him sometimes. The CGI was also quite distracting, as his face looks rather fake.And of course while The Flash has been around for a long time, I find it hard to believe that they would have introduced his character the way they did without the success of Spider-Man in 2016's Civil War. He's pretty much an exact copy of Spider-Man, playing the teenage boy that is overenthuastic about being a superhero, and deriving humor from that.They even found a way to make Batman look uncool. He's pretty much just collecting the team for most of the movie, and does very little on his own. What is most disappointing is that Ben Affleck is never really Bruce Wayne. Whenever you see him dressed normally on screen, it's just him doing Batman stuff without his suit on. Even Wonder Woman has a scene of her being Diana Prince, but it's all only Batman throughout. Then there's Superman, whose return was very poorly done. First of all, if you have a character that is supposedly dead, don't make the actor's name the second one to pop up on the opening credits. That's a surefire way to ruin any potential surprise about his return. Of course that return was inevitable and obvious, but at least put in a little bit of effort to hide that fact. I don't even have to put in spoiler tags in here because DC doesn't even consider his return a spoiler.Secondly, because his return was so quickly - halfway through the chronological follow up to the movie in which he died - there is absolutely no relief or emotional climax to his arc, or any sense of urgency, really. You never really care that Superman's death has supposedly thrown the world in disarray, because his death barely has had any time to have resonated with the viewers. Hell, his supposed death didn't even make it through the end of the previous movie without some hint of his upcoming return. If they had some patience and balls, they would have had him stay dead for a few films, preferably those in which the rest of the Justice League got introduced, and in which the threats get increasingly challenging and hard to overcome due to Superman's absence. This way when he finally does return after the rest of the League is facing a truly frightening and unstoppable enemy, his come-back would feel earned.Overall, there's so much wrong with this movie that although I wrote so much, there are still many flaws left untouched (like Zach Snyder being Zach Snyder doing too many Zach Snyder things, or the nonsensical process of resurrecting Superman that actually put them in more danger than before). It's amazing that after the disaster that was Batman v Superman, they went pretty much the exact same route for its follow-up, setting up an illogical and unearned conflict and resolving it in a cliched and nonsensical manner.At least Batman v Superman had some really cool action scenes instead of the uninteresting CGI fest that was Justice League. And while Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor was a terrible villain, I'd take him over the soulless CGI monstrosity that is Steppenwolf any day of the week. Justice League is a terrible movie in every regard, and really does not bode well for the future of DC's cinematic universe.","283 out of 444 found this helpful.

Literally at the same things at the same time.If you're going to watch a DC movie, I'd recommend never watching the trailers again before going. They wasted so much good material on the trailers. At least 1/3 of it I was like, ""yup, seen that. yup, got that"". The movie was almost set up to fail despite amazing casting and performances. I wasn't keen on the way Aquaman spoke and Cycborg's look and the fact that he was in the movie but damn was I wrong, they both nailed it! All of them did. I literally can't find anything wrong with the actors and how well the did.(you should stop reading here if you don't want to go in with a tainted perception)Why was this movie set up to fail? It was a number of things combined.1. Expectation - As a DC fan going back to growing up to Keaton's Batman, this movie has been hyped for most of my life. Even more so since Marvel phase 1 started. Just the thought of, wow can't wait for DC to do this! So regardless of how well it turns out, it will still somewhat fall short in your head.2. Trailers - as mentioned earlier, lots of material, plot and such was given away in them. I actually told my friend exactly what would happen down to the time frame and he'd just turn to me in the cinema every now and again and be like hey! you said that. You could literally piece the whole movie from the trailers. Now, I remember watching Guardians of the Galaxy 2 trailers and not knowing anything about the movie.3. A bloody mess - it was all just a big mess that was rushed into nothing really. The flow was just bad but could have been worse I'll admit. There were major disappointments in some parts of the story. For someone who feels the music is just as important, the score was a real mess. I was really excited for the music because I didn't hear a Justice League theme song in the trailers and I was excited for a specific score from the last trailer. It was a mess. Horrible plot holes that I might be wrong about I'll concede that much. There are a few things I'd give it credit for where I feel there were criticisms. 1. Villain - I've been reading about how generic and thinly plotted it was. Well, firstly the voice acting was great. Secondly, you'll be distracted from the mess of the overall movie to pay attention to flaws specific to him. Thirdly, I thought it was going to be another Ares, but he stood on his own despite looking somewhat similar. 2. CGI - the graphics were amazing, everything was very well done. The parademons looked great! way better than the Chitauri. Fight scenes were well done. On this end, everything was on point.3. It can only get better - the movie is shaky and seems to be finding its feet which it doesn't really end up doing. From the looks of things it can only get better. It set up a good starting point and should be more polished second time around. Final thoughts - everyone here has to and will watch it regardless of what I say. Just try your best to keep an open mind especially if you're not a layman. Look at it as a first bet rather than an all-in scenario. Even though I wasn't happy with it, I sure hope it is successful because they have a great cast. They just need someone better in-charge to paint a better picture.","26 out of 54 found this helpful.

Of the new cast Miller is a fine addition as the awkward Allen, Jason Momoa gives fans hope that his standalone Aquaman will be a lot of fun, while it's surprising just how affecting Ray Fisher is as Cyborg even if his character doesn't seem cut out to get his own standalone feature.It's a shame then that we don't ever feel like this team is given the scenarios they needed to really gel together. There's chemistry to be found here, even Cavill and Affleck benefit from the likes of Gadot and the new additions, their rather tiresome portrayals enlivened by the fresh, energetic nature of their co-stars but overall the film lacks an energy or pizazz that would've been the kicker to elevate this genuine middle of the road experience to something else entirely.Final Say ‚Äì All in all huge fans of DC will be kept happy with this sometimes enjoyable, sometimes downright bad big screen culmination of hero's and one badly CGI'd and generic villain.Devoid of anything of true note and without a memorable set-piece, Justice League is unquestionably the poor cousin of The Avenger's but with the talented cast involved, there is enough hope here to suggest that this band of hero's have some room to grow into something special if all the stars align.2 1/2 terrorised Russian families out of 5","81 out of 121 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Decently made despite some sloppy execution.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3859347/?ref_=tt_urv","drawlife","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14294603/?ref_=tt_urv","16 November 2017","After all this time, the Justice League finally assembles in the big screen. For what it's worth, it's an entertaining time and worth the admission. Despite that, the film does have a good amount of issues. But the cast for the most part is great. Their banter and their performance is what really puts the whole film a float. I've been a fan of the Ben Affleck casting since he was announced. I think he's the best cinematic version of Batman we've got on screen, certainly more comic accurate and more of a brute. Bruce Wayne here goes through a big change in his character and I liked seeing this whole new side of him. He's learning to work together with the other members and his dynamic with Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is nicely handled. Gadot, is great and her performance carries through since her solo film debut, but I still found some her line deliveries kinda weak. The reports are true though, she is used for some downgrading comedy regarding her attractive appearance and the Amazons do wear more revealing armor as opposed to the practical look Patty Jenkins and her design team helped shape. I'm not gonna go too deep in this, but I can definitely see why this would turn off a lot of fans and some general going audience members, especially since Wonder Woman was big step forward. The new players are good for the most part. Ezra Miller's Flash for me was a tad too quippy. I found it kind of annoying and most of his jokes did not land. That's not to say I didn't chuckle here and there, but I know certain liberties should be taken when it comes to adapting source material, but I couldn't get on board with this Barry Allen. Maybe he'll grow into the Barry Allen I want to see someday. However his display of powers are quite cool to look at. Jason Momoa's Aquaman worried me in the trailers. I was hoping he wouldn't be another quippy, tough guy/surfer dude character, but he turned out not to be. Well not entirely. Ray Fisher's Cyborg is a bit dry, but he's integral to the plot of the film. I think there's a lot of potential with him.Now on to Superman. I think people who weren't happy about Cavill's Superman in the past will be happy now. For me, I was already a fan of Cavill's Superman, but it took them three tries and now he is the Superman I think everyone wanted to see. His return elevates the film just a bit more. He is the highlight for me and I'm really intrigued what they do with him next.Now their villain Steppenwolf, it's not just a weak villain, it's a bad one. A really bad one. Super one-noted, and incredibly forgettable. I'd compare him to Malekieth from Thor: The Dark World. To be fair he wasn't complex in the comics either but, Snyder and his team had the opportunity to really bring something cool to the table. It is very much similar to Marvel's villain problem, and to be honest, DC villains have been extremely weak aside from General Zod. Also the Parademons are fodder. Since Avengers and Age of Ultron, it can get pretty redundant at this point to see a team take out mindless creatures. The movie is brisk. It's just about two hours, and the banter between the heroes are fun. However you can probably tell that a good chunk of the film is missing in the cutting room floor. There are a lot of scenes where the scene is abrupt and the editing is very choppy. Sometimes whenever something interesting happens it just keeps cutting away instead of letting the scene play out. Corporate meddling definitely took place, which is a shame cause I would have loved to soak up the scenes a bit more. I will admit the tone shift from BvS made this film feel a little Marvel-ish, not in a bad way. For me I never had a problem of the darker tone. BvS had a lot of good ideas, but it was all just sloppy execution(The Ultimate Cut is a little better). I would rank this third on the list of all the DC films that have been release. Man of Steel and Wonder Woman are better, but Justice League is a step up from BvS, and leaps and bounds better than Suicide Squad. Despite some problems I'm happy Snyder pulled it off, and I wish him well especially since the family tragedy we went through. At times the film looks and feels like a Snyder film, but there are moments where you can absolutely tell Joss Whedon had his fingerprints here and there. For better or worse I thought it worked at times, and at times it didn't, most of it came from Flash, so take that for what it is. I'm not one who's really picky about CGI but there are times in the film where it's so obvious that everything is CGI. To cap it off, Justice League is a flawed, but solid entry to the franchise. I'm excited now and more hopeful. Whether or not this film gets praise or negative reception, the excuse of ""it's made for the fans,"" cannot be a way to dismiss bad reviews, that goes for ANY movie. So to end this review, I hope all the fanboys are just at peace with each other, whether you're Marvel or DC. In the end all we need, at the very least is a decent and entertaining film. Just cause someone else has one opinion doesn't mean it's the end all be all. 6.7/10","20 out of 40 found this helpful.

I don't know if I've ever been this pumped for a movie before. Then the director changed, then the runtime shortened, and I was still excited, albeit cautiously.Once I saw this film the first time, I liked it, though I may have just been blinded by my excitement for the film, and the IMAX presentation.But once I saw it twice more, it's flaws began to stare me in the face, the reshoots became considerably more noticable, the effects & the colour grading became worse, and the awful attempts at humour annoyed me.While still a mildly enjoyable film in it's own right, it is nowhere near the scale and weight that the trailers and the original word of mouth toted about. It was no-longer this huge sci-fi epic with genuine character growth, it was a tone-deaf attempt at making a Marvel movie with these beloved DC characters.Unlike 'Batman v Superman', a movie I love the more I watch & disect it, this was a movie I disliked the more I watched & dissected it. It leaves a huge dark mark on my memories, and I wish that the full Director's Cut of this film could be released one day so that dark mark can finally be washed away.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Both have some great and some not so great characters, but Marvel just seems to do it better. Perhaps because it had TV shows bolsetering it and animated movies as well, but DC had those things too. In general The Marvel Universe has just been portrayed with a better cast and perhaps a better budget and had the amazing Joss Whedon (who had to step in and help finisht Justice League for Zack Snyder. I would love to know how much affect Joss had on this project. Had he not ultimately been involved, would this movie have suffered? Joss is great all the way back to Firefly and Serenity but his crowning achievement was the first Avengers movie. I think DC got lucky with Whedon because it was hard tying in all those storylines and making a convincing villain. And Steppenwolf was LAME! Perhaps Joss couln't fix the entire movie but it had an script that was made before he stepped in. I guess you can only polish something so much when its not your own!","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Going into Justice League was first of all dream come true, as big fan of characters and what they stand for. Just imagine this movie 57 years in the making since first Justice League appearance. Yeah, yeah but what about quality of the film, be honest it's a mixed bag even i enjoyed a lot, so let's start with goods. I love characters and every actor did a good job, stand out for me was Superman, in preparation for this movie a watched every Superman movie since 1978 and see character done so right was awesome. Flash was great comic relief and Ezra Miller bring his own to the role very well. Wonder Woman, Batman, Aquaman and even Cyborg who i tough by trailers will be a weak link, they all was best part of the movie. I love a lot of moments and scenes from film, for example opening Batman scene, Aquaman going to the Atlantis with Icky Thump playing, return of Superman, Danny Elfman soundtrack, final shots of the film, they all was amazing and bring my score so high and tear to my eye. Unfortunate movie has problems, villain, some plot elements, final battle location where you don't care and don't feel stakes. It's all there, but for me so many good stuff for sure beats not so good. For overall this is the Justice League and now road to the future look really good and full of potential, even movie not was perfect, so many positive stuff in there, that i don't even mention deserve a praise. I would love to write and talk about this a lot more and this movie for sure deserve a examine and would love to be just fly on set on this thing. To get to the end i really, really like film and hope you can enjoyed as well, movie is fun, exciting and special, come on, what other time you will be seeing Superman 1978, Batman 1989, Dark Knight, Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, first JUSTICE LEAGUE on big screen of your favorite movie theater. So go out there and have good time. By the way can't wait for ultimate edition of this movie. Thank you for reading review, what year we have for comic book movies Logan, Lego Batman, Guardians, Spider- Man, Thor, Wonder Woman and Justice League, what a time to be alive! :)","22 out of 40 found this helpful.

'Justice League' brings our favorite heroes together, but does the film come together as well as the team does?1. When an intergalactic foe (Steppenwolf) threatens all life on Earth, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) reunites with Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) to assemble heroes from every corner to defend the world. With 'Justice League' being the 5th installment in the DC Universe, this movie undeniably feels a little rushed although it does have the appearance of a stand-alone film. It is quite obvious that DC and Warner Bros. are trying their hand at reverse engineering these characters by introducing them in one big ensemble and then gradually branching them off into their respective films. Is this DC's best movie? Not at all, but it's far from their worst.2. One the positive side, Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) is the most prominent character in the film more so than anyone else. If there's one person that gives life to this film.....it's her. The quiet moments between Gadot and Affleck (Batman) are by far the most interesting. There is a conflict between them in a sense of a love/hate relationship which hints at a possible budding romance. The other standout character was surprisingly Ray Fisher as Victor Stone/Cyborg. Maybe it's just me, but characters struggling to regain humanity that was stripped of them always resonates with me and Cyborg is just that. The least interesting member of the league however, is Ezra Miller as Barry Allen/The Flash. He clearly serves as the comic relief but he had more misses than hits. Most of his one-liners fall flat and the ones that do get nothing more than a chuckle.3. The one person I wanted and expected more of was Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman. Momoa obviously has fun with the role but never quite proves himself to be the badass we know him as from the comics. For someone with super-strength and command of the seas, his range is limited mainly because of the script. I'm certain 'justice' will be done to his character in his upcoming solo film, but I was disappointed that he wasn't as engaged as he should be. Not to spoil anything or explain what takes place, but the brief moments we get of Henry Cavill in the film, he finally proves himself as the Superman fans love. Probably the best set-piece in the film involves him about half-way into the movie. That sequence in particular was far more exciting and thrilling than the climax.4. Every moment in which all the league members communicate and talk amongst each other is where the movie succeeds. Despite being the only human of the team, Ben Affleck holds his own and works best in every scene he has with Gal Gadot. Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf is about as underwhelming as they come. Never is his ultimate plan thoroughly fleshed out nor his objective justified. All he serves as is just a plot device and a reason for there to be a 'Justice League'. The film drops Easter-eggs every so often including two post-credit scenes. If you can manage to be patient, the scene at the very end (not spoiling anything) hints at the possibility of the solo 'Batman' film (starring Ben Affleck) that everyone has been waiting for.The scenes directed by Snyder, opposed to the re-shoots by Joss Whedon, are as knight and day. Not saying that's a bad thing, but the film feels very choppy without a proper flow. I wasn't bored but nether was I even mildly entertained. 'Justice League' is by far better than 'Suicide Squad', but until it establishes a stronger script, pacing and less over-the-top CGI action, it will not succeed at matching the standard of MARVEL.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I'm not going to tell you any spoilers so don't worry, it's spoiler free. First let's see whats good in this movie. The tone of the movie, action sequences and the parts which they included only because to make a fan happy is appreciative. The tone of the movie is lighter than Batman V Superman with jokes which you won't laugh because you would have seen them in the trailers. The fight scenes are really good and in that you can clearly see Zack Snyder's idea. Let's see whats not good. First of all after seeing this movie u won't get connected with the heroes unlike in Avengers u will connect with everyone and get to know about them, even though movie have some unique time for individuals.The connection is missing even in scenes, some scenes which are not needed too are included without which movie would be same. You can actually get to know while seeing the movie that two directors made this movie, because some scenes Zack wont take in that way. Second of all there is no background music in fights which make me sit and watch the action in silence. In trailer he kept the bgm, but not in the movie which didn't make ppl feel excited. Plot is not that blent, but is OK to have easy plot than the plot like BVS. Finally I didn't connect with the movie and enjoyed bcs of all this reason and think that I enjoyed Batman V Superman more. That's all you want to know before seeing this movie. My advice is go see the movie it's not that bad. Enjoy guys it's still superheroes with all the action. Have a good time.Don't miss 2 post credit scenes. One is mid credits and another is end credits. Unc","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Aquaman is not the train wreck that I thought he would be. He takes Arthur in a completely different direction, but it works. Cyborg is way more interesting than he was in the Wolfman/Perez Titans books from the 80s. Flash continues to be portrayed in a way that is different than anything that I've ever read in a DC book but he provides comic relief and is quite entertaining.

Since its announcement in 2016, we have been waiting for watching this movie and here it is!! Justice League is an amazing league. We watch an entertaining superhero movie, a sexy Aquaman, beautiful Wonder Woman, super rich Batman, houmurous Flash, serious Cyborg, and of course the handsome Superman is back! The plot is simple; that is about how to make the former League unity again with the combination of the special persons of Gotham, Atlantis, Amazon, Earth, and Krypton to defeat the enemy from dark side. The scenes of battles are ordinary because you can know the ending easily and there are many effects of CGI. The tense is also so low, so that you can turn back from doing other jobs and while you are coming back, you can still follow the scenario (The best tense in Batman Trilogy that make you can not blink your eye for just one second). Also the one is making this Justice League movie so fresh is the laughable actions or words from the Flash. Moreover, we appreciate the Director that make this movie is so compact and familiar for those who never read the real Justice League in comics. For me, the movie is the summary how each of the League coming from, what makes them special, how they know each other, and why they have the same purpose. More insightful of this; is that each League member had ever failed for a mission, and had lost their loved one, either family, spouse, or losing their own identity, so that to defeat the enemy does not mean the winner of the League, but the winner of the truth itself. One scene so questionable is that why this Justice League movie have Russian civilians involved. Maybe this is hypercritical but I critic the appearance of nuclear technology as part of environmental disaster in this movie and I do not know maybe this movie sponsors are also coming from companies who do worse wasting management. Well, let it go, grab your popcorn and do not forget to watch the movie until post-credit, because it is shown the next figure of DC Comics and hopefully the next movie is League versus League! :)","11 out of 24 found this helpful.

That is a question that many would like to know the answer to, and I'm happy to say that the answer is yes.Justice League is the fifth movie in the DC Extended Universe and the third directed by Zack Snyder, with some reshoots done by previous Marvel movie director, Joss Whedon. The story takes place right after the events of ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" where Batman, aka Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), inspired by Superman's selfless sacrifice to save the world (spoilers to those who have not seen BvS), runs into trouble with an unknown enemy and decides to form a group of people with superpowers to save the world from evil forces. Already having Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) on his side due to already fighting alongside her before, they must confront Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller), Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher) to convince them to fight alongside them. But they soon learn that this is not such an easy task. They don't know these people, and these people don't know them. So, predictably, there's problems and tension at first, except with Barry Allen who instantly decides to join because he claims he needs ""friends"". But they all eventually come to their senses and unite to form the Justice League, aiming to stop the evil Steppenwolf from destroying the world.What's great about Justice League is its heroes. They are all great and likable, and it helps that they are brilliantly casted and have great chemistry with one another. Affleck and Gadot reprise their roles as Batman and Wonder Woman, respectively, and they're both very good. But it's the newcomers who are the most interesting, and they don't disappoint. Momoa is a natural fit for this Aquaman, Fisher brings heart to the role of Cyborg, but the true standout here is Ezra Miller as The Flash. He is what you call a ""scene stealer"". Miller has a knack for cracking jokes and his comedic timing is dead on in every scene he's in. Good times indeed. The film's runtime is 2 hours, which is surprisingly short for a superhero movie these days. As a result, the movie's plot is constantly moving and there's not much down time, which keeps things entertaining. There's never really a dull moment. When there's not much action, there's interesting interaction between the heroes, and when there's no interaction, there's action. And the action scenes are well done, with each one showing what each hero's powers can do while at the same time being engaging and exciting. Not to mention the action scenes are visually thrilling, particularly the final battle.Although Justice League gets a lot right, it does have its flaws. The movie has a good amount of jokes, and even though they are mostly funny, they get in the way of the movie's dramatic moments far too often. And this is the movie's main problem, it's unsure of itself. DC clearly tried to take a page from Marvel's book in terms of adding comedy to the movie, but there's such a thing as too much. There's just too many jokes that interrupt the dramatic moments in the film, and as a result these dramatic moments feel cheap. The movie doesn't really know what it wants to be, a comedic superhero movie or a more serious one. DC is known for its darker, more serious tone, and they mistakenly strayed away from that here.Even though its 2 hour runtime is a good thing in some aspects, it is also a bad thing. The movie's plot constantly moves, but it almost moves a little too fast. Proper introductions to the Flash, Aquaman,and Cyborg are seemingly skipped over or are rushed and the movie as a whole feels rushed. It feels like the movie should have been a half hour longer to fully flesh out these characters. Granted there will be solo films about these heroes, but still.I haven't really talked about the movie's villain much, and that's because there's not much to say about him. His name is Steppenwolf and he wants to obtain the three ""motherboxes"" so he can ultimately destroy the world. Boring.All in all, Justice League is a fun, yet flawed superhero team-up movie. It gets a lot right, its heroes most importantly, but its flaws keep it from achieving greatness. And even though it's not quite as good as ""Wonder Woman"", it gets enough right to surely thrill DC diehards and casual fans alike. Booyah!","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

My review doesn't comes out as a pure hate machine but rather due to the epic disappointment of one might feel after waiting for so long to witness the most epic team up quite possibly of this century to turn into a mediocre generic film.This should've been the most epic saga in DCEU's continuity but alas rushing to compete with Disney finally took a toll on this franchise. The characters are well enough on their own but their development as individuals are rather paltry. The cinematography is awkward at times as evident from multiple re shoots done by Joss Whedon.The CGI in some parts are terribly glaring to avoid and it feels too much green screen effect that makes your head hurt while watching in a dark room. Some are too bright while some are too dark. The color grading is very inconsistent with the background. As you all know Superman returns from the dead (which is kinda given at this point) but his resurrection isn't handled well enough. What should've been the rekindling of the hope people lost like the Rebirth of a Phoenix is marred by botched character interactions and idiotic dialogues. The supporting characters such as Mera, Martha Kent and Alfred are wasted even further. One of the most highlighting parts of BVS was the interactions between Alfred and Bruce engaging in both morally and logical decisions. Sadly it's been reduced to banal banter between them and others. I'm not going to highlight the humor since it's overdone and doesn't fit organically in this film narrative. Humor is good and should be present but not forced and overstuffed like Disney films recently have become. The villain is generic along with musical score by Danny Elfman which is just rehashing of the same old stuff. Wait for the 4K or bluray release to see edited scenes as consistent with DC's film which might be better.","183 out of 341 found this helpful.

The plot is simple and predictable in good ways with surprises in the end. I enjoying every second of this movie and that is the most important.. On my opinion, Justice League is second best after the Dark Knight Trilogy and the best among DCU movies. DC, you must keep Joss Weldon for the sequel.

It's not one that's going to make you think, but it is a nice way to just escape for a couple of hours, and to me, that's the purpose of film. I think all of the actors portrayed their characters well, I especially enjoyed Jason Momoa and Ben Affleck. The CGI on the villain made him look more than a little bit like a video game character.

But so far, the DCEU has yet to fully win me over. Man Of Steel was decent, BvS was average and Suicide Squad was laughable. Luckily, Wonder Woman was lot's of fun and enjoyable, so my expectations were high for Justice League. So, how is it? Well....First of all, I didn't like the plot that much. It was messy, disjointed and at times incoherent. I don't know if the shortened run-time hurt the plot since a lot of the sub plots went missing or half way through were just cut off (if there's an extended version, I might be keen to get it). Steppenwolf just felt misused. He was a simple generic villain, that could've worked, but so many missed opportunities with him that it was disappointingly handled. The CGI also needed a bit of work. These things definitely hurt the movie, and had more time gone into reworking these negatives instead of re- shoots, it could've been better. But...I loved the Justice League! Ben Affleck's Batman was once again a great showcase. Gal's Wonder Woman felt fully developed after her stint in BvS and solo outing. Momoa's Aquaman was fun and larger than life. Ezra's Flash was witty, entertaining and exciting to watch and newcomer Ray Fisher's portrayal of Cyborg was nuanced, but believable. The way they bicker, argue, interact and work together felt magical. It was very reminiscent of the first Avengers movie when they team up at the end. It was a blast! Their chemistry is what elevated the movie, and they were far better than they had to be. If anything, THEY are why you go see the movie, if for anything else. The second and third act of the movie is also very good. If you complained that MoS, BvS, SS and WW had terrible 3rd acts, I'm pleased to say that JL fixes that, immensely. It was fun, lighthearted, interesting and a bright direction on where the next slate of DCEU movies head. All in all, while the villain was generic, plot was messy and CGI was pretty bad in certain scenes, the Justice League's chemistry and a strong closing act help elevate JL to be a at times messy, wholly fun and very entertaining viewing. I plan on seeing it again and hope there's an extended version.7.4/10","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

As a father of two young boys who has spent countless hours watching Justice League animated features, this was a pretty faithful rendering of that world as live action.It is by no means perfect. The CGI is ropey at times, which was surprising and there is no getting past the mustache unfortunately. However it's not as distracting as some people think and as portrayed by some of the photoshopped versions spread by hate-mongers. The music score, if you can call it that, is very weak indeed and is just a bunch of generic orchestral incidental sounds interspersed with Elfman's Batman theme and a single moment where we hear John William's Superman theme. There actually isn't anywhere near as much action as in previous DC films, which is a shame, as this is one movie where the characters deserved to show off more, especially Flash and Cyborg. The villain is weak and we didn't get any sense of his motivation.The cast is excellent, chemistry and dialogue between them is charged and fun. Whedon's reworking of the script clearly shows. What action we do get is well choreographed and photographed. The movie starts in darkness and ends in hope, leaving you feeling quite positive about the future of JL and future additions to its ranks. One hopes they can keep the cast together for further stories and that the studio has the sense to give the next instalment to Whedon from the beginning.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

The last thing that comes to mind is any DC movie that has come out in recent years. Many people thought that after the end of the Dark Knight Trilogy that we would see a resurgence in the DC nostalgia that made the company bigger than Marvel at one point. Those hopes were dashed when Man of Steel turned out to be a dark, gritty CGI mess that tried way too hard to be relevant. The moody and drab undertone of the film made us feel to glum to remember the old Saturday morning cartoons that were filled with fun, adventure, and action all rolled into one brilliantly performed show. Next was Batman v Superman which had been hyped for three years, and all we got was eight minutes of fighting and over two hours of talking and exposition that we just didn't care about. Suicide Squad was lacking in the department of character development. Instead the producers wanted big names and flashy effects to sell the movie. That didn't work. Finally, we have this: take all the previous DC movies mentioned (Except the Dark Knight Trilogy, the only films DC got right), put it in a blender while adding aqua man, flash, and cyborg, blend it all together, then turn off the lights. The resulting disaster is Justice League. This is what you don't do with superhero films. It would be like Joss Whedon making the Avengers in 2005 with Iron man being made eight years later.The movie does not follow any of the source material, instead relying on Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot to carry the weight of the film. Everyone else just seems to be along for the ride with none of the other characters getting their own movie yet, so we have no idea what their motivations for joining the Justice League are. The film once again goes into dark and gritty territory with everything happening at once with little to no previously known information about half the main characters. Anyone who isn't a comic book junkie was asking ""Why is there a robot and a fireman in this scene?"" Just another too serious flick that betrays the source material and hopes that big Hollywood names will save it (Spoiler alert: they don't).","162 out of 312 found this helpful.

Why did DC have more success with their movies than Marvel.The main hooks for DC were Superman and Batman. Although Warner Brothers tended to be careless with some of the the sequels.Nowadays it is not even an argument. Marvel wins hands down. Even a secondary character such as Black Panther knocked bells out of Justice League at the box office.With Superman dead, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) senses a brooding darkness on the horizon and he wants to assemble a team of people with special powers.Batman already has Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot.) He and Alfred seek out the quick as lightning Flash (Ezra Miller) Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and the Cyborg, Victor Stone (Ray Fisher.) After some bickering they become part of the Justice League.They do battle with the alien Steppenwolf who is looking to reclaim three hidden mother boxes that will give him untold powers.One of the boxes is in the human world and Cyborg calculates that the power in the box could re-awaken Superman.In Justice League, you would had expected a film with six superheroes would be more exhilarating. The problem might be that the finished movie is a compromise of two directors work.Joss Whedon who was brought in to finish the film, instead decided to do a lot of reshoots. Then Whedon had to cut down the running time. Deleting scenes and some scenes looked rushed.The film lacks the fun factor. Steppenwolf joins a long line of dull CGI villains.Both Victor Stone and Aquaman were flat with only Flash having a spark.When it came to the fight scenes everyone is flying around. I heard one critic remark, they were really falling with style as in the original Toy Story.At least the film brings back a bit of the John Williams Superman theme as well as Michael Keaton's Batman theme.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Watch his Snyder Cut of Justice League if you want to be satisfied. I hate 2017 Justice League with all my heart.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

What's remarkable is that it's such a bad experience that it turns out to be the ultimate pallet cleanser. What I mean, all other movies you see after having to endure this awful film will seem less bad by comparison. I realized this while walking out of the ""Justice League"" showing. It's a terrible movie in its own right but I found myself saying, ""At least it wasn't as awful as BvS."" That's not a joke or an over-exaggeration in any way. Walking out of BvS was like getting punched in the gut. With this mess, all you'll feel is let down. Maybe a bit cheated, disappointed and even a bit lost but not really angry.Judging by the ratings here and a few critics that I read, I was expecting at least a decent film. These are all blind fanboy reviews or fake as CNN journalism.I want to thank the creators of this film. It single handedly sets up better experiences for the rest of the year because nothing could possibly be worse then this movie.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

Justice League is one long high, cinematically speaking. The film has all the best hallmarks of Zack Snyder -- the cinematography, the symbolism, the action, but it's been tidied up with some of Joss Whedon's little humor moments, and although I'm not at all a Joss fanboy, I think the marriage of the two filmmakers' styles does the film...justice. The ensemble comes together a little hastily in this story, which has been DC's main weak link until now, but considering how Warner Bros. has not allowed the series the time to flesh each character out before joining up, they newcomers (Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg) get introduced rather quickly, but it's OK because their backstories are hinted at enough to be interesting to casual filmgoers, but comic fans already know what they are about. Steppenwolf is your typical comic movie villain -- except with Ciaran Hind's voice acting lends him a kind of stage-play gravitas that works well for the character. A few other points: Wonder Woman continues to be a highlight of the series both visually and narratively, Snyder's Superman is ultimately badass (sorry Donner fans), Jason Momoa nails it as Aquaman, I had a hard time letting go of the CW Flash but Ezra Miller made me forget it. To summarize, Justice League was an awesome superhero film -- one that is as good as anything Marvel has done. I only hope there will be an extended version because I suspect it would be even better than it already is.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Nope! There are some things I would've wanted done differently, but I could say that about a lot of movies, so I am trying to judge this by the content we got and not the content I wanted. So I gave it 8 stars, and that seems pretty high considering all the hate the movie is getting. It definitely doesn't deserve higher in my opinion, but I don't really see it deserving less than a 5 either. My favorite thing about this movie was the cast, by far. Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot are fantastic. Ben Affleck is really good too. I've always been kind of on the edge with his portrayal of Batman. It is not always my cup of tea, but I enjoyed him in this movie. Ray Fisher did okay as Cyborg. I'll expand on my opinion of Cyborg later in the review. Jason Momoa as Aquaman was interesting (he will also come up again later in the review). And lastly Ezra Miller was fine as the Flash. I did have a hard time adjusting to Miller's version of the Flash, as I am a very bug fan of Grant Gustin's version in the CW TV show. That being said, he did a good job! It just took some adjusting since his character seems particularly socially awkward compared to Gustin's portrayal which seems very extroverted by comparison. So Miller did not do bad at all, and I did like it! So for anyone who hasn't guessed, I have severely limited comic knowledge. My full knowledge is based on the CW shows (which I understand is not a good source for comic relevance) and some of the post-New 52 Batman comics. As such, I know basically nothing about Aquaman or Cyborg coming into this movie. I know that Aquaman is from Atlantis and that he can survive underwater, and that is the extent of my knowledge. Cyborg...I have absolutely no knowledge of ahead of time, aside from his appearance in the original Teen Titans animated series. Characters such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are easy to follow because (for the men at least) their stories are iconic, and everyone has some inkling of an idea of who they are, what happened to them, and what they can do (and for Wonder Woman, her standalone movie obviously does a fantastic job informing everyone of her story). I felt the same with the Flash, since I have knowledge from the CW show, which seems to share a vaguely similar origin story with the version seen in the movie. This leaves us with Aquaman and Cyborg as our outliers. I enjoyed their portrayals, and I was interested in their characters, but I had no real attachment to either of them. That is one of my biggest complaints. As much as the public seems to be against superhero origin movies anymore, I feel like these two deserved to have one. Their histories are not widely known by people who are not faithful comic readers, and as such, some more information regarding them would have been nice going into this movie. Just something extra so that I have more reason to care about what happens to them.My other main gripe with Justice League is the main villain. And lets be clear, I actually liked Steppenwolf as the villain, I found him kind of interesting overall. However, he was, overall, forgettable. He did not receive enough screen time for me to really get to understand or care about his motivations. I feel like the best kind of villain is one that is either coherent enough that I understand why they are doing what they are doing (maybe I'm even rooting for them in a way), or crazy enough that they are frightening and need to be taken down. Steppenwolf wasn't crazy really, nor did I really follow his plan too well. But he was kind of scary, so I was alright with him overall. What I did not like was his disposable army. But, I feel anyone who complains about it in this movie and not in Marvel's The Avengers is hypocritical. Both movies have the same fault that there is this army helping the main villain, yet they are not helpful to him in the least, and our heroes pretty much don't even really struggle against them. This is something that many movies like this do, so I'm trying not to be too harsh on it. The CGI isn't top notch either, but it did end up being better than I expected.All things considered - this movie is fun. For the most part, the jokes land well, the characters are interesting, and the story is still enjoyable. Aside from one or two odd lines of dialogue and two extremely goofy Batman reactions to something happening, I think the movie was great. It had a decent plot and a fun cast. It wasn't perfect, but it set up the future of DC movies pretty well, and I left the theatre pleasantly surprised. I don't mean to compare it to Marvel, as it is indeed different, but I'd say it was *at least* as good Avengers: Age of Ultron. Probably a little better. So, in that comparison: there was a lot that could be improved, but in no way would I ever say this movie was bad. It was good, and even though it didn't completely blow me away, I still feel comfortable saying that I 100% recommend it, because it was still fun, different, and a positive direction for the DCEU.","19 out of 36 found this helpful.

The characters had little if at all development, lots of scenes felt awkward , without any chemistry. On addition, because of that, it's hard for the audience to connect with the characters and really develop some kind of an attachment which is crucial in actually really caring about what's happening.2) The CGI was awful. I can't really understand why, since the budget wasn't low, but some scenes felt very fake.3) The villain was a joke. At no point in the movie did he feel threatening. Quite boring and a poor selection by the writers. Generally the plot was very bad and the main reason the movie never shined. 4) The acting was ok, nothing outstanding. 5) Liked the balance between ''serious conversations'' and jokes told. Felt very natural and entertaining. Hoping for something better in the future.

Going into the movie I was very nervous, but now that i have watched the movie, I can say its worth the watch.Due to the two hour time limit imposed by Warner Bros., the movie definitely seems quite rushed. Because of that, the introduction to the characters seems a little off. Since, I already knew how these characters became who they are, I could make sense of what was going. But for casual movie watchers, its not going to be that great but definitely a entertainment flick for sure.The great side of the movie was the characters and the chemistry between them. Watching them on the big screen is a dream come true. I thought Ezra Miller as Flash was awesome and very funny. I can say the same about the other characters: Aquaman was bad-ass although he had less screen-time, Cyborg was definitely cool and Wonder Woman is as always charming. The other best parts of the movie would be Superman. I would say Superman stole the show. The CGI mustache wasn't that noticeable. But overall he did great. I can say the same about Batfleck. Ben Affleck as Batman is awesome.Now the bad parts of the movie. The main issue was with the villain. Steppenwolf didn't seem so strong. Whenever he was out of the screen, I didn't really care about him. Also rushing is also an issue here because of the two hour limit. The CGI could be even better, but it was pleasing.As a comic book fan, to see the references made in the movie was totally great. And there are two end-credit scenes. You definitely don't want two miss them. I had a great time watching the movie. And I am very hopeful for the upcoming DC movies.","49 out of 107 found this helpful.

So, I watched JL again and realised there was more depth to it than I previously thought. My favorite character was the villain, Steppenwolf because of his great lines he had, that should def be featured more in the Quotes section. I recommend seeing it at least once, if you're a fan (as I am) of superhero movies.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Much of it fell in the water, thanks to the fairly predictable, ""me-too"" guarantees of using clich√©, generic plots, generic henchmen, a bad-ass looking but even more generic villain, way too much CGI - even in places where it should have been done more practically and CGI added for highlights or effect (like make-up on a face). Where did that 300 million dollar budget go? And what silly person came up with the idea to replace all of Hans Zimmer's music with the old theme songs? Lost most of the epic feel of the movie right there...Now, if certain actor's acting skills are not up to snuff... then it's up to the director to make sure the camera work, edits, and lighting, carry and cover that. That wasn't done well at all. Gal Gadot's acting needs work, and Jason Momoa the same; even if the lines they gave him were plain silly, a good actor finds a way to make it sound interesting.Have the people in Hollywood learned nothing of Logan (2017), with Hugh Jackman? More realism in comics is what sells. Correct screen adaptations are what sells. The people buying comic books, paraphernalia, collector's's items, etc, have money to spend - they are not children. And stop trying so hard to inject jokes or silly behavior into almost every other scene or line... the characters come across as immature and sometimes a bit retarded.Anyway, the story was weak. In itself that is not a problem, but the way it was portrayed... was well, weak. It's not possible to drown it in colorful CGI with fast cuts, and hope the audience doesn't catch on. Warner Brothers should penalize the person who insisted that the whole story needed to fit inside two hours - the pacing was too fast, detracting from the whole what-was-supposed-to-be-epic feel; which was already deeply in trouble thanks to the weak soundtrack.It is very clear that DC needs to stop worrying about Marvel; whatever Marvel is doing, is not DC's concern. DC needs to focus on doing their own thing.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The trailers made this movie look as if it was going to follow the Marvel route of action/comedy and it doesn't, this is still a rather dark movie; what they have done though is give sense of humours to the characters, giving them more likeability and making them much easier to route for than before. Ben Affleck, of course, returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne and although I was in the minority who thoroughly disliked his portrayal in the previous film, I actually didn't mind him here. Not only did they give his character a sense of humour, but they also made him a lot more human; in this film, Bruce Wayne knows that he is just a normal person with human limitations; he acknowledges this, bringing a vulnerability to his character and making him a lot more identifiable. Gal Gadot again fits perfectly into the role of Wonder Woman, her action scenes are great and her character is sexy as hell, more than that though, from the get-go she is an intricate part of the team; Black Widow has always been part of The Avengers, but her character has always been interchangeable, eye candy that could basically be killed off at any second without any major repercussions to the plot: that is definitely not the case here. The new characters are of course Barry Allen/The Flash, Arthur Curry/Aquaman and Victor Stone/Cyborg; Barry Allen is the comic relief character in this movie, and for the most part, it works fine; most his lines are jokes, sure, but that's how his character is written and it fits fine, even during the battle scenes, when he does throw a comical one-liner, it never takes you out of the scene, because you can actually believe that that is something that character would say in that situation. Then looking at Aquaman: Jason Mamoa is awesome! This is probably the best role I've ever seen him in, his character is likeable, tough as hell and Jason Mamoa just seems to be having the time of his career; I could maybe have done with a few less ""yo bro"" or other slang terms that got increasingly more as his character progressed, but that's a nitpick. Then we get to Cyborg...I, unfortunately, did not like Cyborg. Not only is this character a wet blanket, but his character has zero likeability, zero personality and every line he speaks is basically just him explaining the plot, another character I REALLY hated was the villain, Steppenwolf; this character is what kept this movie from being good, everything is wrong with him: the CGI is awful, every line he has is cliched supervillain talk, his motives have nothing new...Ivan Ooze from the 1993 Power Rangers movie: better villain than this guy. Finally getting past the characters and looking at the movie itself though, I will say that even though we spend the majority of the first act being introduced to new characters, this movie was still a lot more focused than the previous installments, and therefore was able to hold my attention for the whole of its two hour running time. The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed, easy to follow and fun to watch; the heart of this movie is the team though; I will go so far as to say, even though this was DC's first official team-up movie, there is already a stronger feeling of unity between the team than Marvel has been able to create since starting the MCU; every character has his place, every character has a purpose and what's more is they work together as a team, there are no power struggles, sure there are inner conflicts, but never do they let that cloud their judgement from what their joint goal is...these are superheroes actng the way superheroes should act, putting the needs of the many before their own. Final thoughts, as I said in the beginning, there are still problems with this film, the villain was a huge letdown, some of the CGI is really bad, some line delivery is rather cringe-worthy...but even with that taken into account, I still fully recommend you see this movie, because I get a feeling that there are actually great things yet to come from the DCU after all...watch your back, Marvel.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I fully appreciate the intricacies involved in bringing something this huge to the screen and I realize there are weaknesses in every movie. That being said ¬ÖIt's as if the writers have attempted to cram the entire DC universe into two hours with little consideration for what that does to the plot or the viewer's brain as they try to comprehend this hot mess. On top of that, The villain is the most generic brand of threat-to-the-planet bad guy imaginable and it takes way more energy than I have to take him seriously enough to even care.But that's's okay right? When the writing is bad we can always keep the audience entertained by blowing things up, you know, like in Superman - Man of Steel (in fact, just like in Superman - Man of Steel) where Superman and General Zod knock down all the skyscrapers in Metropolis. Over and over. Pointlessly. For seemingly the last hour of the movie. But we'll need some really exceptional CGI to make that band-aid hold. Which leads to ¬Ö who releases a movie in 2017 with original Star Wars era CG? I And even that might have worked had they not overreached by so much. And the music? Not so important to the overall movie, but really? What did they do with that massive budget? Maybe they should have paid the actors and actresses a little less and a bit more for the writers, composers and the CGIShort on plot, same old tired action scenes but now with antique CGI, uneven acting (not that there's really much room in this movie for anything resembling acting ‚Äî ridiculous posing at best) and it only took $300,000,000 to lay another DC egg. How does the same company that is capable of the Dark Knight and Wonder Woman come up with this ... crap?Should come with a warning -- Move along, there's nothing to see here (beyond what you've already seen for free on the trailer).","60 out of 115 found this helpful.

Delete this movie from history please,we have what we deserve in ZSJL!!Its not a bad superhero movie, but less from my expectation. Cuz we all agree that WW's success put high standart for DCEU upcoming movies. First note to know, we know that Zack make this movie while having big tragedy, and in the injury time, Joss stepped in to finish what must be done. not change anything from Zack's. From that note, a mess in putting everything together and last time editing will be ""pretty"" tolerated.First point is the tone, i liked BvS and MoS tone so much, cz it has different view for superhero movie. pretty realism and more characteristic. But i understand, they want better viewer who want superhero movie more ""light"", which make WW great success. And i liked it. But this is too light. Thank god it's not at Thor Ragnarok level. And some CGI are too obvious. Especially for background CGI. So less Zack's way.In the Character point of view, Wonder Woman still stand out the most, followed by Flash and Cyborg (which i recommend WB & DC to have Cyborg own movie to dig his character more. Cuz his set up and problem is potentially good). Aquaman didn't stand out much, just one interaction with Mera, thats understandable cuz they'll develop in their own movie. The let down for me is Batman and Steppenwolf. Batman is pretty good and badass, but i still prefer his performance in BvS which is really dark and grounded. In JL, he smile a lot, came in bright daylight a lot. Im not complaining Steppenwolf un-menacing character (cz i don't read the comic version of him), but i disappointed about Steppenwolf's story about being simple villain, which is make the story pretty easy and blend. But the interaction between superheroes is great. The set up for making Flash as more newbie, Cyborg's personality, and the connection with previous movie set ups are great.But, so far, this movie is pretty good experience to watch. cant wait the director's cut version.PS: End credit scene is one of the best thing that needed in this movie, so sit tight till the end.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

""Mother-boxes"" sounds like a lame ripoff of the Infinity Stones in a post-MCU era regardless of source material, and ""Steppenwolf"" is a vaguely defined character with the goofy name of a famous rock band.Those issues aside, it's clear the crew tried very hard to pull everything together, so it's a shame the effort comes across as half-baked and dull. The producers are probably at fault for rushing this series to align with releases from the MCU.The film hinges itself on its heroes, but Ezra Miller as Flash either can't deliver the emotional depth required for his scenes with Billy Crudup as his father, or the director dropped the ball for those crucial scenes. These moments stick out in a bad way due to Miller's bad acting. The rest of the cast does a great job.There are some great fight scenes, but most of the film is exposition. It's like watching characters read the plot summary with intermittent action scenes, interrupted by brief emotional beats and Ezra Miller's clumsy line delivery.I gave this a 7 because despite obvious flaws, I recognize the source material was written for children. This dark film seems to be intended for adults. Glaring issues: the tone fluctuating wildly from scene to scene, bad CGI for certain elements including the villain, and on-the-nose, mechanical sounding expository dialogue.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The director, Snyder (who also directed 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman V Superman') is only given a ""story by"" credit. If you haven't seen any of those three films, I suggest you do, as this film starts with Clark/Superman (Cavill) already dead and Batman/Bruce (Affleck) and Wonder Woman/Diana (Godot) pulling together a super-team to fight off some impending doom.There's the obligatory hour of introductions to each of the five main characters: Arthur/Aquaman (Momoa), Victor/Cyborg (Fisher), Barry/Flash (Miller, the best new character) - plus more screen time for Lois Lane (Adams), Martha Kent (Lane), Commissioner Gordon (Simmons) and Alfred (Irons), who are all kind of wasted. The plot is that they have to fight off an alien bent on destroying Earth, with his army of zombie-grasshoppers - directly ripped off from 'Star Wars: Attack of the Clones'. It's an odd choice, since this should technically be aimed at kids, but I'm not sure if I'd let anyone younger than 10 watch this...But that's part of the problem with the DCEU so far - it's still trying to be dark and unforgiving, attempting to reach Nolan's Batman trilogy, but not hitting any of the marks. Something's just missing that doesn't hold it all together as well as a Marvel film. And, odd as it may sound, there's probably too much CGI here. Not a spoiler: obviously Superman comes back and helps save the day, but it begs the question - isn't everyone a bit suspicious that Clark Kent is now somehow walking around? There's some decent quips and a few funny moments, mostly thanks to Flash and some OK battle scenes. Plenty of enjoyable moments, but not quite a fully-formed faction film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Because of the fact that I am a huge fan of DC I expected this movie to be wonderful, so I was very disappointed when I first saw the movie, but I actually found it not that bad when I saw it for the second time. I still have that disappointment though. The movie does not meet my expectations as a fan. It does not match the DC's atmosphere that we all know. Nevertheless, it was good to see your favorite superheros on the big screen. I tried to enjoyed that, but again it was inadequate for my opinion.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is a superhero film based on the DC Comics superhero team of the same name. This was the fifth installment in the DC Extended Universe. It features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, and J. K. Simmons. The team, consisting of Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg. The team forms to honor the memory of Superman and to save the earth from a catastrophic threat. Justice League received mixed reviews. Critics praised the action sequences and solid performances, but criticized the writing, pacing, and CGI. The plot was thin, and the villain underdeveloped. It performed well in the theaters, but not as well as expected. The DC Extended Universe failed to develop its individual characters before expanding its universe. They are producing sub-par films to try and quickly catch up to the MCU, instead of developing quality films. They could easily out pace the MCU by just producing better quality, similar to that of the very successful Wonder Woman.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Every other person who is bashing movies like this is either not into superhero films or just don't like DC.

I don't know who and why took such a bad decision!..You cannot expect to create an EPIC movie, an epic masterpiece..,
and restrict it to no more than 2 hours long!,
when even simpler movies and stories are longer.Epic movies like Lord of the Rings were all long, Hobbit movies were long,
Star Wars are all long movies, Avengers movies are all long, Pirates of the Carribean, Harry Potters are ALL long..
this is no coincidence..There are so many characters that appear for the first time,
the audience wants to know some more about them..
and how and why they all got together later etc..The background story of some of the new characters and the
whole story of the formation of Justice League and the fight
against their primary enemy,
is not something you can easily show in less than 2 hours..2.5+-3 hours i think would give this movie more JUSTICE!..","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The villain? after general zord then doomsday what we got in justice league? weakest villain ever, superman didn't took a punch from him, while doomsday was able to beat him. . 5. If superman is more powerful than ww, aquaman and cyborg combined and also as fast as flash then why you need a team? . 6. the ending? opening was good, middle part was better but ending? superman just came and beat the hell out of villain and paradeamons were like krybots of power ranger(completely useless) . 7. Batman's dream in bvs? I thought they will show here- ""listen to me, lois is the key"" what happened to that segment? . so overall i am disappointed, they reduced showtime to just 110 minutes, didn't showed many scenes which were in trailer itself. .so stop fooling yourself.my all 4 friend were angry at me, due to this movie.

The film was excellent from start to finish, people who say this film was bad or this film was not good are really acting like they're a film critic. Its a FICTION film people!! not to be taken so seriously. The character development was great for each character which they don't want to so too much because they have their own films in development in their own right. As a comic book nerd and fanboy I can tell I can die happy now because it was everything that I wanted to Justice League. Barry Allen stole the show, Aquaman was awesome, I liked how they went more into Batman's story, Superman was brief but great to have him back, Cyborg was really my favorite among everyone. Don't know why but liked his character development the most. An cant forget about Diana aka Wonder Woman who is beautiful and strong as usual. Something about that woman. Cant wait what DCEU has in store oh and stay for the wtf after credits scene.","19 out of 38 found this helpful.

It had all the proper elements of a good film, yet studio heads seem to have a serious lack of understanding the psychology of the D.C. Universe.By nature, the D.C. Universe is significantly darker and more mature than Marvel. As such, they have an opportunity to delve into more cerebral stories than Marvel, and yet they treat this like a kids film. I am thoroughly convinced that Joss Whedon has become the last person anyone would want writing, or directing, or even producing their film as he is little more than a generic story teller.While Zach Snyder get's a great deal of flack, if left to his own devices he often times captures the spirit of the grittier, darker comics, IE 300 and Watchmen (despite it's flaws). Unfortunately a great deal happened with Snyder during production which left this movie essentially in shambles and broken from the start.The casting was good, however how they were used was mixed. Ezra Miller's Flash stole more than enough scenes, but Jason Mamoa's Aquaman was a bit too fratboy. Cyborg was interesting, but underdeveloped and Wonder Woman seemed like an extension from the Wonder Woman film. I've liked Affleck as Batman thus far, much to my surprise, but this just seemed meh... Henry Cavill felt entirely wooden and his apparent CGI face was incredibly distracting. Steppenwolf was the most disappointing in that he was little more than Aries redux, and as an antagonist was boring, uninspiring and just another CGI cut scene.In short, this movie was just strange. It seemed that it had all the elements to make a solid film, but moves it too fast, establishes nothing, goes from scene to scene to scene, and is flat out generic and forgettable.It's a shame because this could have been absolutely wonderful.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I am also one of the many that enjoyed Wonder Woman a lot. So the question is, where does Justice League rate amongst these? It comes in close. Not beyond. Not on par either.Foremost, Justice League is a fun watch. The chemistry exuded by all the casts, especially Gal Gadot and Ezra Miller, are contagious. The shift of tone to somewhat ""lightheartedness"" is definitely something for me to get accustomed to. However, the humor is peppered with the right amounts. Sparingly used, at its right times; rather than it becoming quips to transition into the next scene. Serious moments remained serious, as it should be. Each hero have their own distinctive personality & trait; whereby, not everyone turns out to be the same wise cracking sarcastic narcissists. Which was great.Secondly, the story that the League found themselves in...well it is coherent storytelling. Passable at best. It does feel epic only at certain points. Would I want it to be better? To be a masterpiece throughout? Definitely. But it does feel like a ride. From start to finish, even during its supposedly ""downtimes"", it moves along at a pretty fast pace.Now my only hatred for this film. I had my fears when it was announced that Junkie XL was replaced. And that fear materialized into reality. Danny Elfman's score is so generic. Bland. I don't really hear a theme that I care for. OR is there even a theme to begin with? The so- called Batman, Superman theme of the past, were just meh. All I heard was generic music in the background, constantly gyrating annoyingly throughout the impressive visuals.The one thing that the DC films had, which were emotionally charged, goosebump inducing scores, are now gone.

Aquaman is like a rocker, a rebel without a cause who is enjoying ""la vida loca"" and I want to see him in his solo movie. Cyborg is the most bitter, as it is a marginalized human-machine- alien mix. Batman and Wonder Woman have a good chemistry, and WW is still amazing. This is the Superman that I wanted to see in the cinema. The aspect of the parademons is incredible, they are like a kind of hybrid between vampires and insects and the combats with the protagonists are spectacular. Steppenwolf is horrible, very soft, lacked rudeness and character, in addition the CGI is bad, it seems a badly made video game. The CGI in Themyscira for example is terrible, but the action sequence is impressive. The reshoots are noticeable, like the CGI to remove the mustache to Henry Cavill. The dialogues of the film are not very good. The story is simple and is set for the common viewer to understand, simply ""the bad guy wants 3 mother boxes to take down the world."" The film fix some holes in BvS. The colors of the film are really high, they are alive and with intensity, totally different from BvS because of what the darkness was criticized. The film is cut, the priority of WB is obvious, and the scissors between the action scenes is visible to the naked eye, in addition many of the scenes of the trailers are not here. The action is good but in the previous films it is better. OST of #DannyElfman is forgettable, you just hear the theme of classic superman of 1978 and Batman of 1989 (And at the beginning when it comes in WW you hear Hans Zimmer's). The previous films were action dramas and the change of tone of this film is action adventure and comedy (they started the change with WW) and take the right path. It is not an epic film but in spite of all the failures I have HOPE in this universe. I liked it very much. PS: the two post-credits scenes are very good.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But it is obvious that when writer Josh Weldon (former Marvel director for Avengers) took over directing from Zack Synder the movie changed. You can literally see when this happens in the film. It starts off like a Synder DC movie, all dark and trying too hard to take itself way too seriously, then half way through the characters start joking with each other and the movie injects some relief. But its disjointed at best. The problem with DC universe on film is Zack and the control he has. Marvel is brilliant because they have oversight and provides a big picture platform, but they let aspiring directors (lots of them) take some risk and the result is unique fun films. This movie proves DC films will never be on par with Marvel films. Wonder Woman was great, but that was obviously a fluke. The other problem is they just mashed these characters together without time to get to know them. Not worth your hard earned money to see this film. Wait to see it free on an airline, you'll thank me for it.","29 out of 56 found this helpful.

Yes, I know, Wonder Woman was perfectly fine after her 'stand alone' venture, and she is equally excellent here, although she certainly does not stand as far above everyone else in this film; she remains Wonderful.Some have complained about the 'obvious' switches between Snyder's ultra serious tones, and the perceived injected humor of Whedon. I say that the lighter touches are just right, and any contrast with the more darker elements, are absolutely no more jarring than the juggling between danger and planned humor that show up in every entry of the Marvel universe. Those that see them as a forced marriage in Justice League, are looking at it through prejudiced glasses. They want to see discord, so they find it. However they managed to put this film together, considering that two major but markedly different-styled directors were involved, they succeeded well beyond what the doomsayers that had already made up their minds claim.Some scenes in this movie even remind me of Richard Donner's vision of America from his first Superman movie, and even though those moments are small, they are beautifully significant and welcome.The climatic battle scene is not overly long and drawn out, and plays very well.As I said above, it is not quite perfect, but I gave it a 10 here, because it is that close.Do not listen to the naysayers, it is much better than Marvel's Avengers: Age Of Ultron, because although it has to mesh many pieces together, Justice League does not suffer the excess of attempting to jam ten pounds of stuffing into a 5 pound bag as Ultron attempted, but failed to do.I will most readily be seeing this movie in the theaters again, before it's run is through.","12 out of 22 found this helpful.

For years, we've gotten a lot of Batman and Superman movies. It wasn't until Man of Steel when Warner Brothers decided to follow Disney and Marvel's footsteps and create their own cinematic universe. Man of Steel was split for a lot of people, but it had managed to establish it's own identity that actually fairs well with DC's image. The difference between to comic giants was that Marvel was humans becoming gods and DC was gods becoming humans. So why has it continued to split people?A lot of it has to do with how Warner Brothers has been handling it's property. Like a lot of people, I blame that rather then doing the work of making several movies before they get to a major crossover point, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice tried to jump five steps ahead by having too much of a good thing. Now that were looking at Justice League, it has a lot to live up to. For many of these characters, this is the first time were seeing the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg on the big screen. Let's see if Justice League can live up to it's expectation and be heroic. After Supermans death, Bruce Wayne (played by Ben Affleck) has decided to atone for his mistake of misjudging and build a team of metahumans or fellow super powered humans in case another threat comes to Earth. With help from Alfred (played by Jeremy Iron) and Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Played by Gal Gadot), they talk to the quick willed Barry Allen (played by Ezra Miller) from Central City, the legendary fish man of the Scandinavian Arthur Curry (played by Jason Momoa) and the half human half artificial intelligent living computer Victor Stone (played by Ray Fisher) into joining their new league. Meanwhile, an alien villain Steppenwolf (played by Ciar√°n Hinds) has returned to Earth to try and reclaim a set of ""mother boxes"" in order to start an apocalypse. One of then is in Atlantis, another is on Diana Prince's home island Themyscira, and one more is hidden within the human world. Though the team of heroes, now called the Justice League, manage to retrieve the final mother box, Steppenwolf has built an army that has proved difficult for everyone. Will Superman make a return to help his fellow metahumans?Justice League is a mess¬Öthat happens to have good things within. Let's get into the positives first. It's clear that director Zack Snyder (and Joss Whedon) has understood the mistakes from Batman V Superman, and have done things to improve. The plot is tighter and focused on one goal; stop the villain from taking over the world. The overall look is going in the right direction with brighter colors taking fold, thus making guys like Wonder Woman and the Flash seems more like beacons of hope. Plus, the relationships between the characters are more defined and are used to it's entertaining advantage. The two favorites here are Miller as the Flash and Gadot as Wonder Woman. They have a fair amount of screen time that establishes Miller as inexperienced, but with a mouth that's as quick as his actions. Gadot is showing more vulnerability has her connection to the humans has evolved since Wonder Woman. Affleck is great as Batman, but looks constanly disinterested as Bruce Wayne. Momosa does okay with his material (though with not enough time to show more of his personality) and Cyborg seems to have gotten the shaft as he's only in to do computer stuff for the sake of the plot. The problem is that Justice League feels like the tenth film in a series that seems to have skipped ahead (again, that blame is on Batman V Superman for rushing the cinematic universe).Now for the negatives. Steppenwolf is a surprisingly boring villain as he's your typical one- dimensional villain bent on destruction. Nothing new and even worse then Lex Luther's poor motivation in the last movie. A lot of the humor adds a bit more of a necessary lighter tone, but it doesn't always mesh with the Snyder-tone already established. Though it's been well publicized that Joss Whedon took over for the reshoots, it's painfully obvious when he came in, given that his are more humorous when compared to some of the fight scenes and other development scenes that are more grim and serious. I'll give this five Justice League comics out of five. This movie is learning as it's going, but it still has a lot of rough spots. I hope that future DC films lay off on the crossovers in order to give characters like the Flash and Aquaman a chance to shine in their own movies. I doubt I'll return to this like I do for Tim Burton's Batman, but I can see a lot of people overcoming this mistakes for the films more entertaining parts. If your just looking for your heroes fighting, you'll get plenty of it. You'll even get a lot of laughs and entertainment. I just don't think it's for me. Take it in perspective and see if the DC cinematic is worth saving.","15 out of 26 found this helpful.

Say what you will about Zack's dark interpretation of Batman/Superman but at least Man Vs Steel and Batman Vs Superman had an edge of taking a darker approach to this cinematic universe rather than trying to appeal to everybody (like a Marvel movie) but falling short of doing so.A particular disappointment is how the promotion material hinted at large scale battle scenes and introduction of more DC characters when this was quite misleading. Characters like Flash, Cyborg and Aqua Man are rushed in with short moments of development but nothing too deep. Batman is also underplayed which is a shame considering Ben Affleck's performance in the DCEU so far. As for the good stuff - the visuals are good (especially during Flash sequences), some of the action scenes are entertaining and it slots together to create a fun enough superhero movie but the lack of depth, gravitas and direction makes it particularly bland when it could have been so much more than just 'good'. Do yourself a favour and watch Wonder Woman instead","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is the filmmakers going away from the gritty modern style established in ""Man of Steel"" and going back to the classic light feel reminiscent of Rich Donner's ""Superman"" from '78. If you thought ""Batman v Superman"" was disappointing, then have no fear. Joss Whedon is here to make things more.. hopeful.. Yeah, that would be word. Hopeful, lighthearted and more like the old classic superhero stories. All the bad decisions made in previous movies are now starting to get undone. And that's really good. They should have started out this way, but at least they now know what the right direction is. We owe a lot to ""Wonder Woman"" for that. Too bad the studio told them to not go over two hours with the run-time. Because that's what ultimately hurt the movie the most. There's a strange rushed feeling throughout it. Lots of new characters are introduced within a short time and before you notice you are already watching the final fight. That's the real issue here. It brushes over things quickly and you don't get much out of it. It's entertaining, but there's no weight or a good enough connection to what's going on. Everything is just decent. But, hey! This is the Justice League! It should be more than just fine... Right? Well, this is what we got. And it could have been way worse. You can watch it and not be too bothered.I liked the characters. They are all performed well. Flash is the one that I think could have been a little stronger. This is an interpretation of him being awkward and an outcast. He had his moments of being somewhat too weird, but I did laugh at most of it. Aquaman didn't get enough time, but I'm fine with the direction they went with. It was fun to see the League interact. At times I forgot about the actors and just saw the comic book heroes instead. And that's a good sign. Still, this movie is messing with me with conflicting thoughts. I liked the characters and many visuals, but the story and overall pacing is rushing instead of being effective. I didn't feel the important impacts of major scenes. I wish I did. By the way, Hans Zimmer is out and Danny Elfman comes back to the genre as a composer. He re-uses his own ""Batman"" theme from the '89 film as well as using John Williams classic ""Superman"" score. It's always nice to hear these themes, but it's really distracting. It would have been better with some new original music. The action is fine, but it doesn't get that exciting. It's just watchable with little impact. The best fight is actually the one during the beginning bank heist scene. It never got that good again. In the end I'll say that it isn't bad. It's a decent popcorn movie that for once would have benefited having a longer run-time. Just so that we could feel the importance of the Justice League forming for the first time. The good news are that the future of the DCEU might be in good hands now. We'll see, but I hope so.","37 out of 74 found this helpful.

The only major downside of this film, was the Main Antagonist himself ""Steppenwolf"" as there was no realism about him and too much CGI for the Main Antagonist.The takeover by Joss Whedon for the finishing touches of this film surely can be seen as a blessing in disguise and that what makes this film all the more better than the typical dark sided tasteless Zack Synder type films. Personally, this movie would have been a whole lot better had it been directed entirely by Joss Whedon or even Christopher Nolan.Given this is the first of it's kind from DC Comics and the Run-time restrictions set by Warner Bros. Execs themselves; so personally giving 9/10 Stars is purely because of the expected regurgitated criticisms and the negative ratings that follows.""Seeing is Believing""...So go see for yourselves rather than read the expected regurgitated criticisms that follows and give at least more than 8/10 as rating anywhere.

Alas, this is not a one vs. one bout-both can continue to win. DC movies continue to make money (somehow). So once again we watch another dreary Zack Snyder landscape in a movie that looks inappropriately gloomy for one that includes people who fly.  Mercifully, Justice League is better than a few recent DC movie disasters, such as Suicide Squad and Batman vs. Superman. It still falls far short of the exceptional Wonderwoman, but in relative DC terms it feels like a win. 
Part of that comes from actual genuine efforts to have fun. This movie has jokes. Sure, not all of them are funny, but at least one of the filmmakers (likely Joss Whedon) is trying to sprinkle in some joy.  Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller) shoots his shot. He may truly be funny. It's just hard to tell because so many of his lines are not. He delivers them earnestly and with proper comic timing, but he's not quite a comedy giant who can will subpar material to hilarious levels by sheer force of charisma. That's not a knock against him. Few actors ever have possessed such talents. I only wish his co-stars on screen put in half his effort. Gal Gadot was fine, not sparkling like she was in Wonderwoman but fine. To the other superhero stars-I'm not at all impressed. You can do better. Perhaps they lost their energy after reading the script, which is littered with hacky dialogue and boring, predictable plot points. Something happens at some point, but it doesn't go well so the team seeks help from someone to calm down the other someone (that's my anti-spoiler phrasing). This entire sequence of something could be considered a surprise but only if you have never seen another movie before. If that is the case, welcome to movies. Many of them are much better than this one.The greatest flaw in the movie-and I know I'm burying the lead here-is that the villain is awful. Steppenwolf is the least complicated, least interesting villain in recent memory. He wants to acquire power because he wants to be powerful. There's nothing deeper or more complicated than that. The most interesting thing about him-he's tall. Cool.  That is essentially his only defining trait. No, wait. I forgot that he also carries an axe. That may be interesting to someone. The point is that he's about as deep as a raindrop, and an entire team of superheroes deserves a more compelling adversary.Stay with me, just two more nitpicks. One, I cannot stand seeing Amy Adams this tragically underutilized. She's a treasure, and this movie pays her a tremendous disservice. Two, this is second recent DC movie to blatantly exploit the most attractive female character's butt. For real, there are so many butt shots of Gal Gadot in this movie that it almost seems like certain scenes were filmed by a horny teenager. If you're a DC diehard or pathological fan of superhero movies (my group meets every other Thursday), you can see this movie and not completely hate it. Otherwise, I recommend giving this a hard pass. Instead, go see Black Panther. It's 1000x times better.","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

On the other hand they underestimate flash, however he is better than batman by long shot.For the others they are just fine on thier own. I believe this is the problem with DC they have superman (wich mean a huge power gap between the team members), on the other hand Marvel has bunch of superheroes who are close to eachother when it comes to power, so they can build a perfect team.
For the poeple who ask to see Marvel heroes (the avengers) fighting against DC ones (The justice league) I think it won't make any since because superman can destroy them all, maybe he will find trouble with the hulk but the others don't hove enough powers to survive against him, except is they use Kryptonite. Also both sides are good and good poeple don't fight eachother (don't remind me of civil war because no one died there and there is no power gap between Marvel's heroes so no one died).","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Yes, 16 years¬Öcause that's when the Justice League animated series started airing on Cartoon Network. It was my favorite cartoon. I mean my absolute favorite cartoon. Do you get me? I'm also a fan of nostalgia and when I heard that Danny Elfman's classic Batman theme & John Williams' score from Richard Donner's Superman (1978) was going to be featured, I was over the moon. My mind was just filled with countless ideas and opportunities of how they could capitalize on those themes and conjure up some truly epic mind-boggling scenes.Unfortunately, that's where I let myself down. Those epic scenes will forever remain a figment of my imagination. SIGH.As for the movie itself, the story was too rushed in my opinion. The apparent WB corporate directive of keeping the movie shorter than 2hours seems to have done a lot of damage to the flow of the film. Not that 30mins more would make that big of a difference, but I can almost guarantee you that the director's cut will be slightly better. This is especially sad for me since in the comics, DC usually churn out great, very well written story lines. Here, not so much. The movie lacked any depth and all dialog consisted mainly of one liners and sad attempts to get some laughs. I don't have a problem with humor, but the humor in this movie is so forced it became cringe-worthy. Too many ""let's copy Marvel"" funnies about it.If this had come out 10 years ago, it would have been pretty great, nowadays we expect more, want more, deserve more, and with this talent and all the money spent they should have produced a lot better movie.So summarize, Justice League is an okayish Superhero movie. I'm gonna sell the two Hot Toys characters that I've pre-ordered. They don't deserve a place in my cabinet. I miss Christopher Nolan and his Batman Series. I'm disappointed :(","30 out of 59 found this helpful.

I am not personally the biggest superhero fan but I still follow and enjoy them from time to time. I was expecting Justice league to be a hit after the success of Wonder Woman but meh... I liked the story and the newly casted actors, with high regards to Berry Allen played by Ezra Miller. I was just very confused with the cheap CGI effects from a 300 Million dollar Production( 2nd highest budget for a movie). But it was overall a good movie.

But is it necessary? Fans, movie pundits, studio suits and everyone else in between can argue over this for years. The answer is irrelevant, and given the outcome, even rhetorical. As awkward as it sounds, Justice League - with no less than five latex clad superheroes - is the finale to director Zack Snyder's trilogy (following Man of Steel and Batman Versus Superman) but also distances itself from the previous two by trying to fix common complaints about those films - too dark and no spunk, we said. Well guess what; The makers behind Justice League heard our protests and made this film as bright as day. There's also some humour that will draw a genuine smirk from all but the sternest viewer or harshest critic. That's it. Everything else is an incoherent, incomplete, unguided, unwanted mess. The problems are plenty because that mess is all over the place. On one level, the world is still mourning the death of Superman. Like the previous film, Biblical analogies are apparent, but only if you care to look below the surface and only if you know what to look for; which is why a genuine question in this film is whether or not a God can be resurrected, and if so, should that happen. Then the tone shifts to familiar territory. On another level, the planet is about to be destroyed by Steppenwolf (played by Ciar√°n Hinds by bizarrely imitating Liam Neeson), an alien general done up with bad CGI. And then there is Bruce Wayne who claims his superhero ability is being rich. If that isn't a stab at Tony Stark, is it meant to be funny? After hobbling along with these one-liners for an hour, the titular roster is setup for the first and bombastic clash of superpowers. But by this time we are essentially watching two movies, and it won't take long before it dawns on the viewer that something isn't quite right. Or not altogether there. Even as alarming as that sounds, there is yet another movie which struggles to break through the superficial cracks of the main movie, and this is probably why Justice League is almost forgivable - The idea of a team of misfits trying to fit, (which made The Avengers hugely entertaining) seems to find some footing in this film too. Ezra Miller's Barry Allen, AKA The Flash, holds a candle to Tom Holland's Peter Parker. For better or worse, Miller even has a lot more pep than Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne and Batman combined! Another welcome addition is Jason Momoa as the brooding Aquaman, and although there's something fishy about his supersonic speed, there's not much else explored.When it works, it's because of the camaraderie between some of the characters. Along with Miller's Flash, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is almost always one of them. Consistency, though, is not a strong point in this film. In the end, and despite being salvageable, Justice League is content with breeding familiarity. This includes a villain that is both weak and boring, and with an agenda that we have seen one too many times. As for Ray Fisher's Cyborg, there's little doubt that anyone will remember how and why he is a member of the League. While all this is still forgivable given Snyder's tragic personal loss during filming, the biggest undoing is a superhero film unsure of what it wants to be. Which again asks ‚Äì was this necessary?","17 out of 31 found this helpful.

And the other thing for you JL haters is I personally think the JL/DC characters are too ""strong"". So that doesn't necessarily transfer too well to the big screen vs a comic. Hence, the over-CGI complaint too often heard. Marvel characters are a bit ""weaker"" (more human). Overall, JL is a great movie effort.

This movie isn't the greatest or the baddest. I't is just fun action film.
Some stupid jokes of course but not as many as in any marvel movie.
I think most of the marvel movies are whole family time movies and DC is trying to be more teens and older type.
I don't like the Ben Affleck Batman at all. I just don't like the character.
I think they introduce the villain poorly and he is very generic badguy but it ain't that bad as everybody is saying.
They use CGI a lot but so does every movie now. I'm waiting when the CGI hype is going away.

I wasn't gonna see it in cinemas, I wanted to wait until it comes out online. But all those trailer, and the ""hype"" had me going. Turns out, it was very big disappointment. I don't know how to even start. If they want to make a movie, let it go how comics say. Because of their only hit ""Wonder Woman"", they made her the wisest, strongest, dominant character ever. It felt like more Wonder woman ft justice league than Justice league. It felt like Batman, superman and all other characters were there at the mercy of wonder woman. The way batman acts, superman acts (in comics), over here, it was all just about wonder woman. I know wonder woman is inspiring this and that, but they over did it here. I can't even take it out from my mind how bad it felt I don't think so we are ever gonna see bad-ass batman EVERY AGAIN. It's all about wonder woman now. Secondly, CGI wasn't gonna enough. Story was very predictable, nothing special, no surprises. And the Superman, wasn't exciting, somehow you already know what was gonna happen. It all just felt awful, I wanted to see bad-ass ""batman"", meaning of hope ""Superman"", the king aqua man, inspiring wonder woman etc. But this is more like, we beg you wonder woman for your mercy, please guide us, we are nothing without you, all that crap. I'm not hating on wonder woman (comics), but this is really awful. See there are many plot holes, but it would have been exciting if they did like comics, instead making it all about wonder woman because she had such a hit in DCEU. Gal Gadot is to DC like RDJ to Marvel. Just the difference is RDJ helps all other actors in MCU to rise with him, Gal Gadot makes it all about her, her and HER.

I wore my Justice League shirt which I designed myself and was so excited to see how it would turn out. So I went in with high hopes thinking it would do so much better than Batman Vs Superman. To be honest I already thought BVS was a great movie anyway. However I left the cinema very disappointed. It was too funny and had moved away from the whole serious side that DC had pretty much built its foundations around. So I'm sorry but to suddenly change like that and for a massive movie too. It just didn't make any sense to me. It had a lot of good things about it. The action scenes were amazing! Aquaman by far steals the show and I cannot wait to see his solo film. However the one character who think would be the biggest bad-ass in the film is actually the such a wimp. Yeah I get that Batman doesn't have superpowers but come on! You took down Superman and yet now you are scared of a couple para-demons like come on. You have gadgets you could use. This is what angers me the most is when the most bad-ass character in the whole DC universe ends of being the biggest baby in a movie where he should be kicking everyone's ass. My honest opinion I reckon the whole reason why Batman was like this is because he was too dark in Batman Vs Superman, but what did you people expect he is the crown prince of darkness. That is what pisses me off, when non-comic book fans complain about movies that they don't understand and then directors have to completely change movies to suit everyone. It's just not fair to the fans who have loved the comic books and want to see what happens in the comic book come to life on the big screen. Sadly it didn't happen in Justice League. As a huge fan of the comic books this movie just didn't do it for me. Will watch it again probably but I will wait for the extended version to be released and watch that. Honestly if you aren't a comic book fan you'll probably love it. In conclusion overall it was a great action movie. However it could have been done so much better if they stuck to how Justice League: War was done. Yes I am referring to the animated movie. If they had of done that but in a live action movie well then it would have been awesome.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

The Justice League is there. You might pick up on what it means to be a hero in your heart again. So, despite all the whining and complaints from the mass of fans... I say the movie did pretty good.

I mean I could go on and on but don't like too waste too much on this.","26 out of 52 found this helpful.

Entertainment ?? Of course!! Justice league keeps you engaged till the very end And it has enough ingredients to keep your interest alive. So here is the story line -- Batman is gathering a team of meta-humans with the help of Wonder Woman to save the world from the wrath of an ancient Villain called Steppen Wolf. He is searching for mother boxes ,the most powerful energy sources in existence, in order to Dominate the world. There is flash , there is Batman , Wonder woman , Aquaman and Cyborg Of course! And then there is Superman in a long special appearance. Performances: Ben Affleck as the Batman is first rate , Gal Gadot is the real show stealer here , she's outstanding in every frame. Ezra Miller is quite funny and he has given some good lines to deliver. Jason Mamoa and Ray fisher are good enough. Direction by Zack Snyder could've been more better,his Narrative style is so simple and there is no twist and turns in the plot. Editing is fine , could've been crispier. Dialogues are quirky and one liners are well written. Action scenes are thrilling and there are two major Combat sequences one is in the first half and the other One in climax and they both standout. All in the whole JL is a treat for DC fans and for me also. Don't miss it , it's better than BvS and you'll surely have fun. My rating :7 /10","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

We  have all dreamed of seeing these heroes on the screen for an eternity,  and we finally have it. The DCEU hasn't had a good track record, and  it's no secret that I haven't been too kind to it myself. They're 1 for  4 in my opinion. Now...they're 1 for 5.  I went in giving it a chance. I gave it a chance. I wanted to like it.  It's the Justice League for crying out loud. But it's just not a good  movie.   Everything we hated about BvS is in this movie. They didn't listen.  They try to add some humor into the movie but it doesn't work, and it's  mostly with the Flash. It came across as forced and none of the jokes  were funny. It had some tonal issues, mostly it was a movie trying to  be dark and serious and twisted but then there are attempts at humor  that really throw the movie off its rhythm.   Steppenwolf was a lame villain, with a very generic villain plan. His  plan involves these three boxes that are portals, and he has parademons  and they try to bring about the end of the world and the Justice League  has to stop them. Did i mention beams in the sky yet? His CGI is  atrocious. For a movie with a rumored $300 million dollar budget you  would think the visual effects team would at least try to make it not  look noticeable. it was and it was really distracting. And it wasn't  just Steppenwolf. They do the slo-mo action sequences, which I haven't  been a fan of for a long time, but I understand that is Zack Snyder's  style.   I had heard about the movie being flawed, but fun. I can say I didn't  think it was fun. There were some moments Where I felt I was having fun  but then in the same scenes there was something that just took away  from that fun. Even if the movie wasn't executed properly, which it  wasn't, I wanted to have some fun, and unfortunately I didn't feel as  if I did.  There is some bad editing and cropping too. I noticed some obvious ADR  moments and a lot of the heads were cut off when it came to cropping  scenes.   Characterization is really thin, the plot is thin, there's plot holes  galore thanks to the mandated two hour runtime. This is a band of  superheroes that deserves better than what we got.  I am going to give ""Justice League"" a D+.","25 out of 50 found this helpful.

Fans of all ages who like Superheroes, this movie is for you and will guarantee to bring a smile to your face!DC gives us a fun thrilling experience by showing us some of their best heroes uniting to bring us the hope their universe deserves. I look at this movie in parallel to their comics right now; a Rebirth of what everyone likes most about this fandom, and that's got to be the heroics. The inspiration of exceptional individuals that overcome odds to bring hope to those in need. This is the theme of this movie, and you see this vision very clear throughout the film.Was this movie perfect? I will admit, there are flaws, but not enough to get in the way of enjoying the movie. I can honestly say I had fun seeing this multiple times already, which in my opinion should be the reason you go to see a movie anyway, to have fun. We spend money to see stuff like this to escape everyday life and witness the extraordinary, and if you agree with me then you should have no problem seeing this movie.Overall, it's a great movie that you can see with anyone and expect to have a good time. It's a celebration of DC and it's just pure bliss to see on the screen. It shows us the best of these characters, and makes you crave for more at the end. I'm beyond EXCITED for what will come next for DC, don't miss out on this!Also!!! Stay until the very end of the credits, there are two credits scenes!","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"7","/10","It is a let-down, but still judged a bit too harshly","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3864051/?ref_=tt_urv","barbagvido","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62380975/?ref_=tt_urv","21 November 2017","Justice League is the 5th DCEU movie and all four of the previous ones were building up to this one (and it should have been more). So much set-up in the previous movies and did it pay off? No, it didn't. But is it bad? Definitely not.First, let's talk a bit about the history of DCEU. Unpopular opinion here, I liked all DCEU movies so far (yes, even Suicide Squad, I'm gonna get so much hate for this), but I do realize it's very flawed and could have been done a lot better. Almost every movie was a missed potential, including this one. The main problem is that Warner Bros. worries too much and listens to criticisms more than it should. There's nothing wrong with listening criticisms, actually it can be a great thing, but WB gets very confused about them. Man of Steel worked okay, aside from some lack of development and a bit awkward pacing, I thought it worked. BvS was damaged by the editing. Of course there were more flaws like an overstuffed script with too much set-up and some scenes that had good ideas, but poorly executed. Maybe it could have been glossed over easily if they didn't cut it down so much. The extended version isn't perfect, but it's an improvement (even though the theatrical version wasn't as horrible as everyone was saying, it had style, it had ideas, it was different and was a spectacle). But that was supposed to be the movie to release. Then they panicked and listened to some really unfair criticisms about it being too dark. Not every movie has to be an action comedy, we have Marvel for that. And that led to crippling Suicide Squad. I still think it's entertaining and I like it for all it's flashy fun. I just had such an amazing time with it, I just couldn't hate it. Even though I see its flaws, but they didn't ruin it for me. Wonder Woman was finally, a success, so there was a lot of hope here. Aaand it feel a bit flat on its face.It's not bad, just slightly above average. It provides some epic moments, but it falls into mediocrity, because WB got afraid of making risks. They cut it down, so it's not overlong, but it only ended up feeling incomplete. Long doesn't necessarily make for overlong. So it all feels very rushed and at times like you missed a few scenes, even though you didn't. Humor was hit-and-miss (miss more often than hit), so injecting that much humor and copying Marvel was a really, really bad idea. Some is okay, sure, but don't make it feel so forced. The characters are very underdeveloped, if they didn't want to introduce them in their own movies, then give them more time in this one. These are just some really bad creative decisions. Another thing DCEU surprisingly doesn't nail at all is the villains (even though I'm in the minority who liked Jared Leto's Joker), as much as DC usually does. And Steppenwolf is the worst of them all. He's a CGI abomination who looks like he wandered in here from some PS3 game. He looks as bad as Incubus, but he's an even lamer character. There's barely a motivation, just a typical power- hungry alien and actually, you barely notice him. There's not one redeemable quality. Not one.Now let's get to the positives. It's very fun and has some really epic moments that show what could have been. The actors fit their roles, the characters as underdeveloped as they may sometimes seem, are okay presented and each one has something to do or some unique quality to them. The plot is a lot more clear and cohesive than BvS and only so slightly less thin than The Avengers. And has some gorgeously shot moments with beautiful cinematography (Gotham City looks amazing). The score by Danny Elfman is a bit forgettable, but has some surprising nods to some older DC scores. So, all in all, there are a lot of cons, but I think the pros outweigh them. Once again, a DC movie is judged to harshly. It's not great, and it's definitely ruined by the studio, but it's entertaining and considering how production went, it could have been worse.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's as though we've been watching very different movies.I went in to Justice League with an open mind, having had problems with Snyder's previous films (though not hating them) and having loved Wonder Woman. I have to say that despite my best efforts to see past small problems, I found it very difficult to like this movie. I am a fan of primarily the DC trinity. Have been for at least 15 years, and I know that would lead people to think that my problems are likely an objection to the changes from the source material. Let me assure you, they are not. This movie is, at times, disjointed and aloof. It leaves too many things unexplained; so much so that it becomes distracting. Furthermore, it is completely riddled with CGI. There's even evidence of CG in scenes that I wouldn't think require much CG. Most of the worst CG are found in scenes with the villain or Superman.Let me clarify, there are redeemable qualities in this movie. Almost every time Wonder Woman is on screen, she makes the movie better. I still don't take issue with Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman/Bruce Wayne (his motivations and decisions are another matter). I found Cyborg surprisingly compelling. There are a few funny jokes (but also a few truly terrible ones). I was actually excited by some of the backstory and Easter eggs in the movie (the flashback was a highlight for me). And I can really appreciate what they were going for here, but the execution was so problematic.I hated how the amazons were treated in this movie and how they went from wearing roman-style armour in the previous (female directed) film, to stylized bikini-clad warriors in this (male directed) movie. 2 steps forward, one step back I guess.I mostly hated the dialogue and the unanswered questions. The dialogue, like most Zack Snyder movies is so unnatural and ridiculous, not even Joss' snappy word play could save it. At one point Superman says ""but I also believe in Justice"" and I rolled my eyes so hard I thought I would pass out. The villain is never properly explained. Like, how did he get here? How does he have access to his minions? What is his larger plan? I know that it all ties to a larger villain, but it's not explained to the audience. The casts' abilities and power levels are all over the place and the new recruits are given no explanation as to how or why they would suddenly be capable to do battle on the level of the DC trinity (who have trained in combat).I could go on, but there's no point. It will do well. It's the first time we've seen some of these characters, so we'll get more of this and the criticisms won't ultimately matter. But DC could learn a lot from Marvel. It's worth taking your time to build up a cohesive narrative rather than trying to play catch-up. I'd recommend waiting to see it rather than spending $20 to see it in a theatre. Save your money for Thor Ragnarok.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

The film was a slightly better, less dark and lighter film. You could tell they were trying to pull of the humor that Marvel did effortlessly. The acting was decent but it was woven together by a weak story and villain. Except for sharing a name with a great rock band, the villain failed to impress and create a sense of danger. The plot was the standard I want to destroy earth and raise my kingdom and the heroes need to band together again. Ben Affleck seemed uninterested in this film and didn't have as much of a presence as I would have liked. Wonder Woman as always worked like a charm and captured everyone's attention. The flash actually worked and the jokes were not that bad. Cyborg and Aquaman were a disappointment. While they looked the part, they failed too impress. Another big flaw in this film was the importance and hype the overpowered Superman was given. While I don't mind Superman as a hero but he has too many powers and it is only some ridiculous alien monster with no personality that presents a challenge. When he finally returned in the last and lackluster fighting scene he was more formidable than his opponent and easily fought off the villain. Where was the intensity and challenge if this overpowered hero easily beats down the villain. It's obvious Snyder has a crush on Superman.Sadly there was a lot of potential but it was wasted in a movie that will likely be forgotten in a year. Zac Snyder should be prevented and blocked from making superhero movies. He has ruined and stopped the DC universe from taking off except for Wonder Woman. 6.8/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

With the help of Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) the Justice League goes out to defeat Steppenwolf but a moral question regarding Superman creeps up.It seems that in today's comic book movie world one must constantly compare the two rivals. That of course being DC and Marvel but I think we're at the point where that just needs to stop. Sure, fans have their favorites but comparing the two is just rather pointless to me but then again I'm not really a comic book fan. With that said, I'm also not a huge fan of Zack Snyder but I must say that I found JUSTICE LEAGUE to be an entertaining movie. Even though it falls well short of being a classic or even one of the better comic book movies out there.I think the best part of the film is the fact that the superheroes themselves are so good and entertaining. It does seem that Batman's role in the film was taken down a bit and this might be due to how successful WONDER WOMAN was at the box office. She's certainly front and center here and there's no question that's not a bad thing. I also thought the addition of Aquaman was great as Momoa was excellent in the role and it was great whenever he was on the screen. I also thought The Flash was put to a good start here, although it seems they were taking the more ""dork"" approach like Spider-Man was in the AVENGERS movie. I wasn't the biggest fan of Cyborg here as he was the least interesting of all the heroes.Snyder's direction was actually quite good here but I guess there's some controversy over him walking away from the project and it being finished by Joss Whedeon. I don't know all the details of who shot what or who made what decisions but I thought the flow of the movie was quite good. I also thought the CGI world was good for what it was and especially the battle scene at the end, which was a lot of fun. The performances were good by the entire cast as there's no question that everyone is fitting into their roles nicely. I'm still not sure what's up with the voice of Batman but that's another topic.JUSTICE LEAGUE, as I said, has some flaws including it getting off to a rather slow start.

The plot is also not good and misses all opportunities to present a villain who likes to hate for the right reasons, but he is only generic. And what reason to continue with the universe ?!

If anything, it's been incredible the reaction against but also some of the support also. Let's be honest much of the criticism is also due to the rivalry faction of DC fans v Marvel fans, and i can't be bothered with all that.Anyhow, as for this, I am much in the centre. Having only just watched the film I thought that there was actually a lot to commend it for, but yes there are some flaws. Lighter in note than either ""Man of Steel"" of ""Batman V Superman"", it's more accessible. Characters are a good mixture and entertaining, and I really warmed to them. I thought Aquaman stole the show but The Flash was also excellent. Humour was good and simple. So much to like and it all keeps your attention.Flaws? Well, the story could have been better and Wonder Woman actress Gal Gadot really can't act or hold the screen. The villain just wasn't strong enough but thankfully wasn't a simple copy of Marvel. The final battle was confusing, not sure how it was all resolved. Also what's the point of Lois Lane in these films? She's been terrible used, or just simply the wrong actress. Just not convinced.Despite those criticisms, don't get me wrong, it's a fine enough tentpole film. Most critics have gone over the top, and personally I think it's incredible that this has taken as much flak as it has when a number of far inferior Marvel movies have been given an easy ride in comparison (e.g. Avengers 2).It's a watchable and enjoyable film. Deserves more breathing space, and really it's a fine evening out. The series will evolve and improve, especially with new directors in line, so should be interesting.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Now, after 10 years in development, we finally got the movie and it doesn't disappoint.The founding members are Batman, Wonder Woman and joining them are Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg - it's such a disappointment that fan favourite Superman (last played by Henry Cavil) is dead. JL includes two post credit scenes and both are equally great, can't spoil them. What I disliked about the movie?There are some cut scenes which end abruptly. This might be due to keep-it-under-two-hours thing. Most of the sequences from trailers are cut from the movie. In the tunnel sequence when batman brings his night-crawler he says ""My turn' in the trailer and in the movie it's just another stupid joke he makes. I don't understand why Batman has suddenly become a comic character. In another scene halfway the movie batman makes a joke about something bleeding which was totally not Batman like. If someone else made that joke I could understand but this is the Goddammn Batman we are talking. He just doesn't bleed and yell.I really hated the Wonder Woman and Flash sequence where he falls on her boobs. I will not talk about those ass shots.For all those shouting bad CGI I didn't notice Henry Cavil's moustache. The CGI was really done. I was enjoying the movie not looking for a frame to yell 'hey look bad CGI'. Honestly I noticed it only in beginning phone recording sequence (I am sure it was inspired by Homecoming, which is really sad. WB had show little hope that They could have used such cheap shots. They could have allotted this time for more character building.The road to Justice League 2 is very long. I hope it doesn't get cut down too. I can wait five or ten years for a great Justice League movie. Please WB make it happen. Don't give up yet.","27 out of 59 found this helpful.

I enjoy Ezra Miller in the role but Ben Affleck just doesn't cut it as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Aquaman is ok in small bits as is Cyborg. never can have too much Wonder Woman/ Gal Gadot. she is my vision of the real Wonder Woman as a child reading her comic. overall, I enjoyed the movie but there was a lot of things that did not do justice to the story and characters.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Why is their universe simply not working?I think there are a number of reasons but the primary one is that they are using a failing formula. Look at Marvel, they established each character with their own movie(s), they did a slow build in creating their universe and introduced the characters to one another over time.DC however didn't, they did a couple of Superman movies, Wonder Woman, the messy Batman vs Superman and the barely connected to the DC Universe (At that time) Suicide Squad. And then like that boom Justice League without establishing Aquaman, Cyborg or Flash. I'm rooting for DC don't get me wrong but at this stage it'll take something special to turn things around. Batman vs Superman should have been one of the biggest movies of all time yet fell flat and Justice League suffers from the same ills.A massive cgi-fest that feels rushed and forced, an Aquaman who is no doubt badass but simply isn't Arthur Curry, a villian so dull he at no point felt like a threat and a generic army of henchmen.Justice League was supposed to be DC's crown jewel but is just another further demonstration that they have absolutely no idea what they're doing.The Good:Performances are solid for a movie of this genreThe Bad:Aquaman is poorly castAll feels rushedAction scenes are hit and missTerrible antagonistHenry Cavill is just awfulThings I Learnt From This Movie:Aquaman is going to be dreadfulDC is not and will never be able to compete with Marvel","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

They produce Man Of Steel with a powerful villain and weak hero and then they end it by one simple punch which kills the villain. Batman VS Superman just wasn't what is should have been. They fought for about two minutes and then were allies the rest of the time. Doomsday killing the weak Superman was the only thing that saved the film. Suicide Squad I haven't seen so can't judge but I am guessing that the reviews are may be accurate but they may be a little bit too harsh. Then you did produce a very good film, Wonder Woman. Good villains, a hero that can actually stand a chance and an ending which everyone will love. But then Justice League makes a wrong turn.They introduced the heroes in a clever way, Flash obviously being one of the better ones but there wasn't enough of something. Steppenwolf just seemed like a random villain who needed a couple of magic boxes to end the world. He probably only killed about two minor people and that was about it. There was no origin and he didn't stand out very well. For a film which tries to act like the Avengers, it wasn't doing a good job. The heroes were fine except from Superman obviously and Lois Lane is someone we want more of in the films. The ending was boring, the build up took a bit too long and the action that was used was OK. The action saved it really and some of the CGI. In order for DC to improve it needs to start introducing better villains like Bane, Mr Freeze and Joker. Although, the dark Knight trilogy and Lego Batman Movie are probably better examples of using these sorts of characters. Overall 7.3/10 for this film, in some places it would have been lower or higher. For those who prefer DC to Marvel, get it right. Marvel has better movies like Thor Ragnarok and Guardians Of The Galaxy. Even Avengers did a better job at creating the team. When you think about what you liked better out of the Marvel and DC films, more Marvel will be liked. The only time DC might be better than Marvel is when watching some of the Xmen films.Watch this film if you have to but don't expect the sort of battle scenes or decent story you'd expect from Marvel because you may leave feeling rather annoyed.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","An enjoyable transition in the DCEU","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3861366/?ref_=tt_urv","Jatzel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20759756/?ref_=tt_urv","18 November 2017","After the very polarizing critical failures of previous entries in the DC Extended Universe, the year 2017 was seen as do or die for the franchise and it got off to a good start with Wonder Woman, which was universally well received by critics and fans alike. In Justice League, we have a dream film for many who were first introduced to the comics world through the various adaptations of DC characters for both big and small screen. The idea of seeing the epic team-up of said characters in a big budget project was something many fans from different generations could only fantasize about for a very long time and with it finally happening, there was a sense of caution, considering the sour recent experiences. The result was a very enjoyable film that while not a masterpiece, wasn't really trying to be one. The flick succeeds in its' most important mission which was giving fans a fun two hours. There are more than a few negative aspects of the movie. For instance, the short run time makes it difficult to properly explore the characters who probably could have benefited from a closer look at them. When it comes to the villain, Steppenwolf of ""New Gods"" fame, I don't think even more time could have made him a credible threat as he is about as empty as a filler bad guy of the week TV episode. While Superman is definitely one of the better parts of the movie, his return to life feels somewhat hollow in meaning, considering that Henry Cavill is the second name in the opening credits and that there was never a reasonable doubt about his being a fake out death. One that was not properly built up as it happened in only his second film. This time, it feels like the best improvement made was exactly in the handling of Supes, presented as a beacon of hope for the world, which would've been much more meaningful if it had been shown like that in previous outings. The CGI, as you might have read or already seen, is very disappointing and at times it seems inferior to even the Injustice video games. That is unforgivable on a project with such a large budget and while it doesn't detract too much from the movie going experience, it still is very distracting and should be vastly improved in future entries. Putting the negative aside, this was a welcome change in tone. The touch of Joss Whedon is very noticeable and it's a shame he wasn't brought on earlier in the production. We got superheroes instead of dark and gritty antiheroes that do not always work. A team that was actually saving people rather than causing a lot of the destruction that terrified citizens to begin with. They are now very likable thanks to the dialogue and better chemistry between all involved.Ezra Miller, playing the role of The Flash as basically Spiderman now is for the Avengers as a kid working alongside veteran heroes does a good job and my only complaints are that he is basically Wally West with the Barry Allen name. His origin story has a very big hole, but I believe that will be better explained in his own movie. Gal Cadot is perfect once again as Wonder Woman and her story as a reluctant hero gets properly developed. That is of course one of the benefits of having separate movies to establish the members of a superhero team as it helps flesh them out more. Here, we understand Diana's doubts, her motivations and reactions thanks to the fact that we already know the character independently from the League. Ben Affleck does a good job with what he is given for Batman and proves a good transitional leader, being forced into that position by the circumstances around him. He assumes the responsibility of a world without Superman, knowing quite well that he can never become that symbol. The traditional loner becomes the uniting factor here and left me wanting more of the character, in a good way. I didn't care much for Aquaman and Cyborg, but they are good utility players here and think there is a lot of good that can be done with them in the future. Which in the end, is what this movie does, give us a transition from one vision that didn't work to one that hopefully does much better. Man of Steel and Dawn of Justice for the most part, were not fun, but Justice League was. Once you bring entertainment back to the center of film making, you are going in the right direction. I understand and perhaps even agree with most of the criticism for the movie, but I think audiences will be greatly pleased with this leap in quality. Just like The Flash is seen getting used to his speed and stumbling, we are seeing a franchise growing accustomed to its' powers in the lead to something that can be great.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The conflicts between them and their individual stories make you feel that you want to know more about them. The low point of the film occurs after the development and union of the team because the climax develops very simply and the villain (steppenwolf) is totally forgotten, being a character with a vague development and too simplistic motivations. Understanding that it is only the preamble of what should be followed in the DCEU with Darkseid is acceptable anyway but it could have been used much better. Finishing the post- credit scenes are very interesting and entertaining opening the door to a great opportunity forward in the DCEU, Justice League is a relief for this universe, after a shaky and weak start.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Nolan's years at helm are certainly far away by now.The bafflingly conventional, illogical and randomly jumping story doesn't have a single unexpected turn of events and instead treads waters that have been trod many times before and with greater success. The CGI is strangely haphazard, with very little care how it stands out when scenes are edited together. Steppenwolf is an eye-wateringly bad villain, becoming a clumsy scarecrow whose motivations and powers come and go.Actors are an uneven bunch, both as characters and as talents, and fail to generate camaraderie or chemistry. Ezra Miller is so much better as an actor than the rest that he becomes a distraction by reminding us about it constantly. Every time his delivery elevates the poor material, it turns against the movie when the next one who opens his mouth only looks cringe-worthy.","25 out of 53 found this helpful.

Warner Brothers listened to the complaints from Batman V Superman and made the script funny, witty, fun. It had action, drama, and was a lovely colorful ride. They finally got Superman right. I'm actually a bit miffed at how the reviews are so low. DC can't seem to win. I read some complaints that the character development wasn't enough. Really? These characters have been in the collective consciousness for decades. Superman and Batman has been around since the 1930's and Wonderwoman has been around since the 1940s. Do we really need more character development. I love that they got right into it with out all the boring repetitive back stuff. It's too dark they complain so they listened and made it light. Now, they complain it's to light. Ugh. I loved it. Don't let the Critics spoil your time or make you prejudice against it. I think a lot of critics are copy cat reviewers and once a trend gets started they all copy each other.

He's a being from Darkseid to get three boxes on Earth to get total control.Quick (only 2 hours), fast and basically lots of fun. After the disaster that was ""Batman vs. Superman"" I expected the worst but was pleasantly surprised. There's plenty of action and carton-like violence but no blood or gore. The plot is easy to understand and there's welcome doses of humor. There's also great acting by Affleck and Gadot. However there are minuses. Fisher is blank as Cyborg. Miller is neither cute nor charming--just annoying. Also turning Aquaman into a bad-ass was a spectacularly stupid idea. Also Amy Adams (as Lois Lane) and Diane Lane (as Ma Kent) were woefully underused. Still I loved the movie. Also, as always, wait for a cool little sequence after the closing credits.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

So if your some how not familiar with the story about this and the Snyder Cut I'll give you a little refresher. Zack Snyder originally wanted to make this a huge epic but his daughter tragically passed away so he stepped down or was fired from the project. Warner Bros decided to hire Joss Whedon to finish the film. All caught up but if you want more info go to JoBlows YouTube channel and click the series WTF happened to this movie it goes a lot more in depth. But this is a terrible example of company greed, first off the first scene is of Superman with a CGI mouth just from that alone you know it's going to be a train wreck. It just doesn't get any better from there, the acting is just so plain Wonder Woman came out months before this and she was great in this movie here she's just giving a dull performance and it shows. Can we just mention the CGI good lord it's dreadful Steppenwolf looks god awful and so does Cyborg. Overall this is a huge mess and thank god Zack Snyder got to do his cut.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Superman: to bring together the other meta humans of Earth to fight a threat greater than any one of them could face alone. However, if you thought the character development of the three other heroes besides Wonder Woman was lacking in BvS' email attachments, it doesn't get much better in this film.Yes, we see Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, and he definitely rejects the lame stereotype his character has been weighed down by for decades. Yes, we get to meet Barry Allen/The Flash, and Ezra Miller does a fun take on the character to complement the job Grant Gustin has been doing on the CW show. Yes, we get to finally have a proper look at Victor Stone/Cyborg, and for Ray Fisher's first major film, he does a pretty good job.The problem lies with the fact that this film can't shake the feeling that it's just an inferior version of The Avengers. Unlike The Avengers, though, where each main team member had its own film to flesh out their character and motivations and build towards a villain the whole while, this film came before that stage. Wonder Woman had her fantastic origin story, and Heny Cavill's Superman had his film as well, but all the other heroes have yet to be fleshed out properly, and it shows.The action is by far the best aspect of this film. It's what I expected going in to this film, mainly great action and just enough plot for the change in scenery between fight scenes to make some sort of sense. We get that, and it's great.The problem then comes from the plot itself, specifically the villain Steppenwolf, who is the main catalyst for the formation of the Justice League. Never mind his name alone brings to mind magic carpet rides being born to be wild, the full CGI character looks terrible for a big budget film. Plus, while his motivations are explained, barely, and full of clich√©s, his minions the Parademons fall into the same category as Enchantress' minions from Suicide Squad, a disposable CGI army to distract the heroes before facing the main enemy. Their creation, from the bodies of fallen enemies, holds fantastic promise but is never utilized.In short, this film is good in that it is fan wish fulfillment done properly, and has some great character moments between action sequences. I for one can't wait to see the solo Aquaman film. How much of the witty banter throughout is due to Joss Whedon taking over for Zach Snyder we may never know, but it is a welcome addition and blends in seamlessly.If you were let down by BvS and Suicide Squad but Wonder Woman had you crying for joy, this film will land somewhere in between. Check it out and see for yourself, but just know it's a dent in the DCEU's seemingly upward trajectory.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I wasn't sure how I would like Ben Affleck as Batman, but I thought it was great. The Flash was very good as well, gave us some good comedic moments that made some cheesy parts of the film a bit more bearable. Visuals were great.The bad: Where I understand the bad reviews was the plot. The story seemed very choppy and just didn't flow together very well.

Had this come out some ten or fifteen years ago, it would have been a pretty awesome JL movie. It would have looked expensive and edgy, and most things about it would have felt fresh. Sadly, it has come out in 2017, as a too little, too late, too rushed and too cheap wanna-be movie, enormously ruined by its association with the absolutely horrible train-wreck that men call ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"". Horrified by the negative reactions to ""BvS"", JL producers (or suits, more likely) scrambled to change the planned story of this movie, basically cutting it up and throwing away the dark second half (you can check out the leaked original plot in Youtube videos), to replace it with an ill-fitting brighter second half, in which we get a much brighter and ""gooder"" Superman than we saw in ""BvS"", courtesy of Joss Whedon's frantic but disappointing attempt to save the movie via damage control. And, while I think that all the changes have probably been for the better considering what we would have gotten from the original Snyder vision, that doesn't stop this movie from feeling choppy and terribly structured, with a plot (and villain) that isn't very interesting and just amounts to a lot of time-wasting. Lots of action and explosions, but very little story or character development.What chiefly dissatisfies me is that the movie just isn't cosmic enough. Why didn't they pour on the whole Darkseid thing? They should have pulled out all the stops! They are in competition with bloody Marvel Studios, which race onward with one amazing movie after the other while DC is standing still and scratching its behind. They should have gone for bigger and brighter, and poured more money into it, hiring more competent talent, especially regarding the writing. But it's DC. They do stupid things by force of habit (sorry, but they do. Many many people think so).Well, at least this movie isn't a total loss. I expected the worst, but there were quite a few things in the movie I liked (and, of course, more things I disliked. Why didn't we see more of Mera?). I particularly liked Cyborg, with his alien tech that kept evolving and producing new super-tech powers for him. That was cool, especially since I felt that he would be one of the toughest characters to make work. Besides the lack of arcs and development, I didn't have problems with the other characters, but I'll emphasize that I really loved Wonder Woman. She was a total inspiration. She succeeded in giving you the feeling that she would absolutely have your back, and truly care about you all the while, whether you were an innocent bystander or a comrade in arms. She embodies all the admirable and feminine qualities of mother, sister, lover and protector, and that is a heck of an achievement. The movie is worth watching for her alone.I hear that some people really like this movie, as in giving it 8 or 9 stars out of 10. Good for them. For me it was a bit of a hollow experience; something with the potential to be so much more. I rate it 6 stars out of 10, which means slightly above average, compared with other movies of its type. No classic, but conceivably something I'll want to watch again sometime. It's a shame Whedon couldn't do more to save it. Ultimately, I think they should have just redone the whole movie from scratch rather than changing it into a sort of happy zombie version of the original version. Who knows, maybe some form of the original cut will make it onto an eventual disc release. I doubt it will be better, but it will certainly be interesting.","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

Those, my friends, are 30 extra minutes you get to spend doing something else, anything else, instead of watching another DC UNIVERSE snoozefest.With such star power as Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, Jason Momoa, Gal Gadot, and national treasure Amy Adams, no wonder they could not afford to pay Ciar√°n Hinds to actually appear in the movie as the big bad baddie, Steppenwolf. That's right, folks, it's your favorite and most popular DC villain ever, Steppenwolf in full CGI gloritude.What's that you say? You've never heard of Steppenwolf? Well, he's been hiding for thousands of years but can appear anywhere using a blue cylinder dealie thing and he has a legion of scary flying zombie things that are actually pretty easy to kill. Steppenwolf, however, is really strong, and he has a wicked-cool fiery axe up with which he chops stuff and he's sorta angry all the time and never really shuts up. Oh, and apparently the last time he tried to destroy Earth everyone got together and teamed up to defeat him so that seems like a really good idea again, but it's going to be really tough to get superheroes to band together because they all lead such complicated and interesting lives.Steppenwolf is really powerful, but he can become, like, really super-duper powerful if he can get three Mother Boxes (that's right, I said ""Mother Boxes"") together, much like Mola Ram hunting for three Sankara stones, or was it heavy water, red crystals, and meteor dust? Good thing we only have to find three of them, because finding six of them would take too long. Also of note is you can revive Superman with one of them, which is pretty cool, because he can probably punch Steppenwolf's head clean off all by himself.Nice also we have no real back story for any of the newbies. Yes, Flash is a goofy dork who gets to have the most fun, but pretty much everyone else, especially Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill, look like they've been sprayed with stupid dust and inhaled it for a few hours. Also, Cyborg is sort of like a nicer Lawnmower Man, I think. Gonna have to check the press guide on that one.Oh, no Jared Leto?! Perhaps too busy planning his next hairstyle.Oh, and hi to Jeremy Irons, J.K. Simmons, and Diane Lane!

Paranoia apparently washes right off. He puts together a team(who will occasionally even work together when they face off against enemies) of people with powers, as evidence mounts of an alien invasion.This is essentially a series of well-done if repetitive(if Steppenwolf(Hinds, who voices a full CGI character brought to life with bad effects) is in a place, he's probably there to get a MacGuffin Box, and most likely, he'll get it. You wonder why these people even pretend to be keeping them from him, and if they couldn't have done more to make them hard to get to) action scenes, with materials connecting them ‚Äì basically, you need to get the people from point A to point B, so every single fight isn't set in the same location. It is deeply forgettable. Meanwhile, I'm not going to pretend I didn't enjoy myself. For many, that will be enough. It's very clear what is done by Snyder and what by Whedon, and both do some things right, other things wrong.Barry(Miller, funny, socially awkward) isn't annoying. Aquaman(Momoa, really going for that Wolverine status) comes off as a whiny adopted kid in an adult's body, and you don't buy him joining the rest. Cyborg(Fisher, going for RoboCop) goes back and forth between ""I can't control the unpredictable tech growing in me"" and ""here's how we're gonna do this because I now know what I can do and no problems accomplishing it"". The introduction of these three is rushed and underwhelming. It feels as though we're expected to have watched the three solo movies that have yet to come out yet. Wonder Woman(Gadot, who does raise a lot of the meh material she's given) is given little to do, and it's clear that those behind this don't love her character like Patty Jenkins, Gal, and 90% of everyone who watched her own film. Atlantis and Themiscyra feel like footnotes.I recommend you go in with adjusted expectations, rather than not at all. 6/10","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, & Ray Fisher are fantastic as the newcomers to the team. I loved it, it's way better than Batman V Superman, & I can't wait to see it again tomorrow. I know I'll be seeing it multiple times at the theater as well as buying the Blu Ray when it's released. My biggest complaint is the Runtime is too short at 110 minutes, with 10 minutes of credits. I think the movie would be better had they left in about 15 to 20 minutes of obviously deleted scenes.

I have read a comics, but even for me it would be more interesting if I would know original story of characters, in this Justice League you get new characters and have no idea who they are, what their motive? Even in comics, those characters have different original stories depending what you read...so you don't connect with them...I did not mind cgi, but story was half-baked and you can blame studio or director swap, but to be fair movie just seemed that will fail from beginning. So for me question was...how studio? or directors could not see that this would not work?

Because, a superhero movie is not at all meant to be critically acclaimed, its about satisfying your fans who want to see their heroes on screen.
Now coming to the movie Justice League. Even though they couldn't pull of a 'The Avengers ' level movie, they managed to give the justice league franchise a decent start. The movie is well paced,you wont feel like its slow anywhere. Actually i felt they could have slowed the movie down a bit. They could have given a better build up to the introduction of their heroes one by one in the beginning,like marvel did in The Avengers. Someplaces CGI wasnt upto the mark. In some places it looked like a gameplay rather than a movie(it could actually work for some people). The dialogues were funny and witty sometimes. Not that strong a story, but they didnt let the audience feel bored at any point of time.
Overall its an entertaining 2 hours. They managed to give the justice league a good start, but they could have done better.

There will be plenty more films likes this cause it's where the money seems to be and it's business but it's really sad because people deserve more - there's literally no redeeming feature in this film . Superman films of old with Christopher Reeve were fun , they had humour , the CGI was basic but you believed in them . This was just like watching someone play a computer game over their shoulder there was no attempt to draw you in as a viewer . It's such a shame that after the deserved success of Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy we are back to being dished up this rubbish , there's really no justice ! Don't bother unless you like a film to have no substance whatsoever - waste of time , waste of money , terrible movie .

Unfortunately, it was just terrible.The dialogue is frequently very cheesie. The villain is so boring. Part of a characters face is CGI'd and looks horrendous. Characters freely shout out secret identities in front of civilians. Portals ""conveniently"" open up at perfect times, and in perfect locations. There is a random family that is shown every so often, and we are supposed to care about their well-being. Yet the movie does nothing to make us feel attached to, or even learn anything whatsoever about these people. So when they are in danger, it's not even of concern to the audience. And then the one thing that really bothered me the most...The final battle does not have a single drop of water in it!! AQUAMAN IS A MAIN PART OF FILM! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!? I'm not saying the entire battle should've taken place on or near water. But at the very least, the director should've found a way to use water since it is what a MAIN CHARACTER can control. That was pathetic.There are many more things I could bring out, but I wanted this review to not contain spoilers so that hopefully people that read it won't waste their money on watching the movie.There are 4 funny lines in the movie I enjoyed, and 1 really cool action scene near the beginning with the Amazon's. But those things were not enough for me to give this movie even a 2nd star.Don't waste your money watching this in theaters. Wait until you can watch it at home on the comfort of your couch. Invite some friends over so that you can laugh at how terrible it is together.","22 out of 47 found this helpful.

This movie, to me, is how a super heroes league movie should be made.Now a few points:In conclusion, JL is a great superhero movies and raise the bar in how you should develop multiple characters in a movie. It is not yet perfect but you will be satisfied with what the film is heading towards to. It opens a door for all the single hero movies in the future. The casts are great and way better than in Avengers. The spotlights of the movies are Ezra Miller and Jason Momoa where they steal the show multiple times. Wonder Woman and Batman appears less so that they can give the stage to the new characters, which is something Avengers failed to do.

Iron Man and The Dark Knight are two of my favorite movies from the genre and, well, after Batman v Superman's dreary, soulless debut, I went into this with low expectations. After seeing so many 10 out of 10 ratings on IMDb, I was highly skeptical, especially with a number of bad reviews, calling this film 'mediocre' etc. I need not have worried.It is excellent, and not just in comparison to its predecessor. I suspect superhero fatigue is the cause of some negative reviews, and frankly some reviewers complaints seem bizarre, like they missed some important dialog, or something. Avengers had an alien spacecube macguffin, and this has three, so yeah, the motives of the villain tend to be pretty simple in superhero movies, something I'd like to see addressed in future. Since so many villains tend to be underdeveloped, I can hardly fault this film for falling foul of the same problem (so I won't). Still better than Thor 2's villain!The villain, while being a rather generic 'destroy the world type', has well written lines at least. And I thought he was brought down in a clever way (with callbacks!) His main purpose is to bring the heroes together, and it's quite well done (yes I'm surprised). The character interactions are a highlight, not just with the primary cast but the supporting actors too. Victor Stone's tragic presence was palpable and I found his origin and capabilities fascinating, and hey, Aquaman isn't a joke anymore (though a bit heavy on the 'aquabro' stuff I think). Ben Affleck is probably my favorite version of Batman/Bruce Wayne, Gal Gadot brings her usual warmth and heart to the role, and the Flash had the right amount of levity to lighten the mood (though I can see some people finding his quips a bit too much)Some have called this movie disjointed and 'stitched together', though it's not nearly as bad as suggested, and flowed quite smoothly for the most part. Events are explained to just the right degree, without too much or too little exposition. The overall visuals have rather uninspiring cgi and seem a bit dated, and the palette is 'confused', probably the result of bringing in another director once Zack Snyder had to step away (condolences to his family). But again, when it was over I had a smile on my face and I will definitely catch it again soon.P.S. For the love of god, get Joss Whedon to edit BvS into something watchable, I'm sure there's a halfway decent movie in there somewhere.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Now usually when a big movie is released the pirated versions that are released online are bad quality usually recorded by camcorders etc. but this was illegally released clean quality which shouldn't have been out till February or March. So most people didn't have reason to go cinema when they could watch good quality print Online. How or who managed to do it is anybody's guess because it is something unheard of this is 1st time I saw a clean pirated print of a Blockbuster 2 days after its premiere released on internet.
 As for actual movie not really that bad it started beautifully, aftermath of Superman's death, his return and his whole presentation was awesome totally something to geek about probably my favorite part of movie. Aquaman was awesome maybe the best casting choice of all Characters, Jason Mamoa looked totally kickass, truly like Kingof Oceans should along with Amber Heard as beautiful Mera, would love to see their own movie. Flash and Cyborg did the Job nothing much to write home about but nothing negative either. Now Amazons and Wonderwoman , though all other Amazons looked awesome in cosmetic sense the way one would visualize I didn't understand why Hipolyta had a Russian accent. Gal Gadot has gained some weight to look more the part and she acted really well but here I do agree with most critics she was too skinny for the even the her exotic looks fits the role. 
 But still the worst part of the movie was Steppenwolf not the character itself but because it was made completely out using CGI, when they should have used only Partial CGI. Now it is understandable CGI is required to present an Imposing God Like being but they should have used partial CGI like Marvel did with Thanos because of which Steppenwolf ended up being worst part of the movie, it made the movie look cheesy and cheaply made. I sure hope they don't make same mistake with Darkseid in upcoming sequel.

After Batman and Robins abysmal critical and financial failure in 1997, no one ever thought Batman would ever be seen as cool again. Batman seemed to forever be ruined after a series of bad films in the 90s. Luckily in 2005, Christopher Nolan gave us the best Batman to date by far with Christian Bale donning the cape. Follow the success of that reboot we not only got the most inspired and brilliant trilogy of Batman movies, but one the the best trilogy of movies period. Grossing billions at the box office, getting IMMENSE critical praise, and landing on every serious movie fans all time favorites list. It seemed thanks to Nolan, Bale, and co. Batman could do no wrong.. Only a few years later movie studio WB got stupid and presumably listening to the wrong fan base (you tubers who account to a small handful of unemployed losers) who hated the success and wanted a more cartoony, goofy, generic Batman and dc films. Instead of smartly observing the colossal success of the dark knight trilogy and following through that proved successful path for their other DC properties, they went with the 2 or 3 guys on you tube who bitched and moaned and pushed for goofy, mindless fodder. Also I assume WB wanted to rush to mimic Marvels success with Avengers ( afar superior film to Justice League). Here we are with the final product. Surprise Surprise. After the failures of Man of Steel, Batman V Superman, and Suicide Squad ( all had great potential that was squandered), who really expected JL to be anything but the same old trash we've been getting? Well if anything, there has been consistency. In this DCEU, the films get progressively worse than the last. Man of Steel was bad, BvS was terrible, Suicide Squade was abysmal, and JL is...the worst one of all. Bravo. If mindless action set piece after mindless action set piece with terrible cw level CGI, generic standard, take over the world plot by CGI villain with a cast of completely undeveloped plot, corny jokes, and boredom is your thing, well then check it out and enjoy. Everyone else who wants quality filmmaking, a good story, stand out action and spectacle, steer clear of this mess. Its a shame for those who waited so long for a live JL movie. Fanboys will be in denial and convince themselves this movies isn't that bad but it is. Ben Affleck also joins Clooney as the two worst portrayals of Batman","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

DC Comics/Warner Brothers has been playing catch-up to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, although it has not been as nearly consistent in quality.
Bruce Wayne/Batman has been invigorated with hope since he witnessed Clark Kent/Superman sacrifice himself to stop Doomsday in Batman v. Superman. He is working with Diana Prince/Wonder Woman to build a team of heros to deal with the growing problem of powerful enemies. He recruits the elusive Arthur Curry/Aquaman, Barry Allen/Flash, and Cyborg. While the Flash (Ezra Miller) is on board quickly (no pun intended), Curry and Cyborg are a little reticent.
While this team is being assembled by Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), the menacing Steppenwolf returns to the Earth to recover the four Mother Boxes left on the Earth. The Amazons have one, the Atlanteans have the other, while two others remain missing. As he moves in on them, the newly formed Justice League takes action. However, they lack a certain something to defeat the powerful being.
The only choice, they assume, is to resurrect Superman. It is obvious he comes back, but he is not right. Superman must remember who he is and what he represents. Kal-El/Clark/Superman retreats back to Smallville to rediscover who he is while the remaining Justice League take a gamble on defeating Steppenwolf.
First, the bad. The movie was a bit rushed, not giving enough exposition to set up the plot. The audience really has to pay attention to a quick-paced story. Another Achilles heal to the franchise is stealing ideas. In the early days of Marvel, they borrowed ideas from DC. As their cinematic universes expand, the opposite is happening. The World Boxes are the DC answer to the Infinity Stones of the MCU, and Steppenwolf is Loki, although a bit more sinister.
On the other hand, we have some good conflict, and decent characters. While Cyborg lacks imagination, Erza Miller gives Flash his usual smart-ass comments and humor laced with a little fear. Even better is Jason Momoa's interpretation of Arthur Curry/Aquaman that defies the culture of ridicule and jokes of his uselessness by being stronger and tougher. Henry Cavill, however, really shows a little more depth as he renews relationships with his mother (Diane Lane) and Lois (Amy Adams).
Do stick around for a couple of post-credit scenes, because one of them sets up for whatever the sequel will be. Sure, their writers could take some lessons from the MCU writers, but this DC outing is pretty decent.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Original director Zack Snyder left partway through due to a death in the family, leaving Joss Whedon to finish up. The movie careens from one character's intro to another with no regard for either exposition or transition. Affleck is bored, boring and oh-so-chinless in that leather cowl, while Gadot grins and bears the close-ups of her butt in tight leather pants. Other female characters seem like dutiful afterthoughts. Whedon's punched-up dialogue yields a couple of amusing moments.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ben Affleck as Batman is growing on me. Gal Gadot is awesome as WW. The rendering of Cyborg is great. Aquaman is just okay. But the guy who plays the Flas is all wrong. Weak, awkward... I just want to hit him for some reason. 
The storyline is a bit blah. And, frankly, Superman's strength makes the point of a team seem redundant. The other heroes can stay home - just call Superman.

DC still has a long way to go and considering the big players in the DC comics world, I have hope that they will get there soon.This movie made promises it couldn't keep, even though stylistically, this was still entertaining. My favorite character was Barry Allen (The Flash). Ezra Miller was really good as Allen and added the comic element in the film. His expressions were perfect and made me laugh throughout.

That feeling you have when your girlfriend breaks up with you, or you have a big hangover but nothing to eat in the fridge..This movie is the sad future of hollywoods big super hero franchises. I actually kind of liked Batman V Superman, and I was chocked by the last trailer that came out. I thought it looked weird and bad, and my thought became real..I have no idea how a movie like this, gets screened in front of an audience, and then approved to hit cinemas world wide. People don't have any standards anymore, and it seems like it's just a CGI-race for the producers. They even made my favorite superhero useless. In Superman V Batman, they actually destroyed my fears, and made Batman Badass! He had a couple of scenes where he shined. Like when he saves Supermans mother, and he just goes apes**t on those badguys. THAT IS WHAT THE AUDIENCE WANNA SEE!however, the movie had one of the worst endings I've seen in a movie in a loong time. The bad Zack Snyder greenscreen/CG-hell turned out to make the movie worse instead of better. Zack Snyder can't make a good climax for his movies.I think the guy needs a break away from Hollywood for a long time. The man has showed us he can make good movies, but the cgi environments we thought and loved as art, (like in SinCity and 300) turnes out to be just a getaway from what we actually love about movies. That we can relate to them, and make us disappear into a world where everything can become real. But the 60 mins CGI show, just turnes out to be a bad, not well done, gimmick.

This one looks like a freak product, as if the decision-making layer is confused when it is building the future of DC, and it wants to be cool and think about the market. Part of it is still a serious pretense, but it has not been fully implemented; at the same time, some jokes are added casually, and the story is simpler. The entire video was a sequence, everyone hurriedly appeared, assembled, fought, and ended. I look forward to the protagonist of the second egg.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Can honestly say it is a lot better than other reviews and critics are saying. Is it better than Avengers? No, better than Age of Ultron? Yes. What does let the film down and it's not just this one but majority of superhero films is the villain is not that interesting, the CGI on it does not help. Generally the story was well put together and the length of the film went really quick. I found it very enjoyable and a decent attempt by DC to finally put the justice league together. Lets just hope if there is a second they step it up.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Of course it's not true, because for decades of existence of both publishing houses they have created many stories in different genres and stylistics. So it happened that in recent years we saw cheerful movies from Marvel and serious from DC. Partly for this reason many people have so negatively perceived lighter tone of Justice League.But a problem of the movie is not that the tone was replaced, but that it constantly changes throughout the all picture. Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon shoot absolutely differently and these distinctions are very noticeable.","16 out of 34 found this helpful.

However, that doesn't excuse the meh film that the Justice League is. Or more accurately, how all recent DCU movies have felt...and that includes Wonder Woman! Also, that opening scene with Superman....I can only call it disturbing. It was even worse than Brannagh's fake moustache in Murder on the Orient Express!! Can't imagine why Henry Cavil wants out....???That being said, the smaller scenes are quite good. The characters were all enjoyable and the chemistry between them was good. Batman and Wounder Woman were both highlights. I would like to see more of them in perhaps better DCU films, in the future.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Now, how do you introduce 4 new characters and give them a proper character development and quality screentime while 3 already existing characters still need to get parts of their own? Not the easiest of tasks and I don't feel it worked here. It really feels like they are trying to play catch-up with Marvel.

Because of this precise reason all DC films can ever be is ""above average,"" not excellent. Now, personally I enjoyed Justice League, I had very low expectations while going in but the film out to be much better than I expected. The entertainment factor was there, the action was thrilling, the humor worked most of the time. Overall, I found it to be an above average film and a decent effort. If only, the studio was brave enough to adapt some of the better story lines from the comics, this film could have been so much more. Marvel is not known for their phenomenal plots, they focus on entertainment and its clear that Warner Bros is trying to jump on that bandwagon with Justice League. For the future we can hope that Warner Bros come to their senses and retain some originality by focusing on good story lines and character development. But for the greedy piglet the future looks bleak.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I aren't so in super hero movies, but this was actually not so bad, but not the best either. I think it had good with super effects. The action were actually good, but I would like more development between the characters. The plot could have been made better. I think they focused more on the action part than the plot part. I think it would have been better if we could see more interaction between the different superheros due to the fact that most of them had never meet each other before. I also think the superman entrance were not that good. Would have been a lot more epic if he had came to save Batman or someone else in the last moment. In addition, the enemy had a bigger boost when he collected the three stones together. And it weren't that good plot development when they had access to his power source so easy. I really didn't expect a lot from this movie, so actually I am not that surprised. But overall it was good movie to watch in the cinema and it was entertaining.

But still, the Snyder cut is so much better than this in countless ways and this ended up being so underwhelming! This one felt so rushed with very little character development, dialogue that seemed like it was written by and for children, mostly bad acting (except for Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, and Ezra Miller), mediocre CGI and terrible green screen (good CGI in some parts), humor that worked only half the time but the rest of the time was atrocious, no DeSaad or Darkseid and no real motivation for the villain, and scenes that were not needed and could've been replaced by much better ones that we saw later! It's been a while since I've been this let down by a superhero movie that was supposed to be a big grand experience but it undeniably wasn't! So much charm, excitement, and exhilaration was missing!

Somehow I don't think that one word will be enough for a full-length film review, but that was what I, and most of the audience, was thinking for the entire runtime. Justice League is tons of fun, with a light and laid back tone to it, unlike previous DCEU entries. The overall plot is a continuation of Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, following the events of the film. Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) wants to put together a team with the help of Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, in what will be and already is her iconic performance as Wonder Woman. They both target The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and, hopefully, Superman (Henry Cavill) to form the Justice League, and stop an evil force led by the fan favourite villain Steppenwolf, played eerily by Ciar√°n Hinds. After the poor reception of Batman V. Superman and Suicide Squad, DC were hoping for a beacon of light to appear, this was the excellent Wonder Woman directed by Patty Jenkins; for the second time, the DCEU have released another entertaining follow up that will restore the fans faith in Warner Bros. and the DC Extended Universe, and may finally create some competition between them and Marvel.The introduction of the iconic characters that make up the universe was short and sweet, but got the job done with a reasonably short runtime of just two hours. The action is non stop from beginning to end, with great humour and dialogue that put a smile on my face throughout. The comic relief is evidently The Flash, with embarrassingly nerdy lines that suit the character perfectly. The only main character that isn't explored satisfyingly enough is Cyborg. Little of his past is explained and your left feeling no more attached to him than when you first heard of him. The character is also quite dull and doesn't stand out when competing with others like Batman and Wonder Woman!
Considering there was direction from both Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon, the film's pace and tone stay consistent, and the story remains coherent and understandable.However the film suffers from a painfully weak villain that just feels like a throwaway character, and one that is very forgettable and is by no means chilling or spine tingling, unlike the comic version.
Regardless of the frustrating flaws that stand out, Justice League is everything you would want it to be with resonating heroes and their relatable issues. Non-stop entertainment and fun is exactly what a superhero film should be, and that is exactly what Justice League is.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The critics were really mean. Man! They just could't help their selves but sliced and chopped the movie into pieces and left it dried out of its juicy parts.My suggestion for my fellow movie-goers, don't read the review unless you've seen the movie or they'll eat your positive energy with their mean and brutal reviews. It'll force you to see the movie as a comparable stuff.For me, the movie was good but not perfect, obviously. The tone was lighter than BvS, and that's a good sign. Not that I'm complaining with BvS movie tone but I believe some, if not most, movie-goers think that the tone was too dark.The cast were good and team were tried to get along each other in quite funny way. Although, there were some moments I felt the jokes were dry as I have seen them during the trailer. When Barry Allen ask Bruce Wayne what he's super power was, and Bruce replied, ""I'm rich."" It could've been funnier if I haven't seen it in the trailer.Of course as a critic, I would say that they could have done better with the story line and tied some loose ends, but the movie just doing fine if you watch them with an unprejudiced soul. You are watching a movie, not a score board. So, just enjoy.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

It's just that scenes doesn't flow nicely. You'll definitely notice when scenes just look incomplete, like it's missing a follow up or a backstory. Nothing to love about the soundtrack. Steppenwolf is okay. Generic villain, but I enjoyed seeing him kicking ass on screen. It's just that..you wish he'd bring more pain, u know what i mean?CGI, nothing worth criticizing or applauding. It's OK. If you TRY to find weird, out-of-place CGI, you'll find it. But if you just attune your mind to enjoying the movie, you won't notice anything weird.The league themselves are great. Flash's jokes are a hit and miss, but it fits his character. Didn't thought I'd say this, but I loved cyborg. Ray Fischer did a great job. I was worried that aquaman would be the one-liner guy, but he's great as well. Gordon, Alfred, WW, Batman, Flash's dad, all great as usual. Last but not least, superman. BADASS.Since BVS and WW is the benchmark for DC movies nowadays, i'll just say this. I hated BVS. It made me physically mad. Although JL is not as good as WW, but I had more fun with JL.Summary : Enjoyed it a lot. Has its flaws, but definitely worth the wait. I might get crucified for this but..........i liked it more than avengers *runs away","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It must have been a phase I went through: we all have small secret shames. One of mine is that as a 30-something, I got into the Justice League and JLU animated series. I still think there are great individual episodes in those series, as well as some great story arcs. So I was actually excited, when there were distant rumours of a JL movie. That excitement was worn down and all but forgotten by the negative response to the films that built up to this. They weren't necessarily great, but their biggest failing was that they fell into the shadow of the Marvel machine; the movies were less epic, less all-encompassing, and the PR couldn't compete. 
So instead of hunting out a seat in the first weekend or even the first week, I undertook watching this as a (slightly hopeful) chore, but I was so relieved.
The film had a lightness I can't necessarily explain; it felt familiar and authentic. It had qualities of superhero stories that felt like reading the comics and watching the cartoons, almost as if maybe it cared for the audience. Crazy huh. For whatever the glitz and drama of the Marvel movies, they are perhaps more than a little self-involved.
The cast did a great job. Aquaman was introduced really well and Jason Momoa was cast really well. Ben Affleck's Batman isn't the same one as all the others. I thought he was more real, more believable, just better all round. A much-needed change. Lego Batman he is not. Wonder Woman and the Flash brought all that those characters are supposed to bring and did it v.well.
All those years ago when there were rumours of a JL film, I would've expected it to have been epic. Now, I was relieved it wasn't. It was just very good. (Yay, Justice League!)","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Because what? it's a superheroes movie. You came to theater just to watch your childhood superhero unleash their powers. You dont want a complex plot, because it's not meant for drama or story-driven movie, just pact of actions. But nowadays, you can't see how bad the scores can be given, if it's a DC franchise. Marvel use the same pattern (heroes prologue, enemy appears, fight, heroes win) but DC experienced less favors when rating comes. Im not in position to have a grudge with Marvel franchise (as i enjoyed some of their franchise too). Have you watch Deadpool, Ironman series,Thor and Avengers: age of ultron? Tell me how can you say they're better than Justice League?As i told you earlier, maybe this is not an epic movie, it's just a good movie.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yes watch the snyder cut, and don't watch this if you havnt. Forget it exists and only know the snyder cut with BvS DOJ extended cut with MoS is the best trilogy until depending if 2 more movies finish the story began years ago by director zack snyder.So what I'm saying is ive seen this and when it came out it was just accepted at the time being... If I'd known what I do now I'd have waited to just the snyder cut because it is such a difference in every way it is on LOTR level scale of story telling versus this movie which can find its footing and is all over the place. It just doesn't feel right yet you'll see it just to see live action justice league, but Hope was restored and the new cut though 4 hours can be split up if need be. To be truthful it goes by fast because it's so fluid as a movie, if you're a true movie goer trust me and see the only version the OG version and forget this.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

She probably the best of the group in this film, but nowhere near as good as in her own movie. Batman happens to be there too? A character that could have done with his own origin movie first is Arthur Curry/Aquaman. He was fine, but he doesn't seemed to be important. Ezra Miller was pretty good as Barry Allen/The Flash. Again, little back story. He had the most comical role which was a nice change to see in a DC film. Another member is Victor Stone/Cyborg. He was given a brief back story but not enough for me to know or care about the character. Those are the main characters. The dialogue was terrible, it was a really poor script. The jokes were not funny and felt forced. The majority of the film seemed to be a CGI mess. One of the earlier action sequences on the island of the Amazons was really good, but the others weren't great. The score was lazy. As for the positives, I thought the villain Steppenwolf looked cool. I quite liked his minions as well.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

They are totally biased against DCEU. Guys, most of you watched Thor: Ragnarok. Do you really think a movie gets a 94% rating based on comedy and better visuals? This is absolutely crazy. We all know that with Rotten Tomatoes. The more money that studios pay critics to say kind things about their horrid slop the worse the movie is. Critics supporting Disney/Marvel as usual. 90+% RT rating? Sheesh!Let's talk about the movie. I watched JL in IMAX 3D with Laser and it was mind-blowing. This resulted in images not that sharp but projected by Dual Projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX (no cuts in the screen at all!), along with 12000 watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand each time you see action! Let us discuss what I liked and disliked:+ The Bat-crawler + WW entry in the movie+ Bat-suit upgrade + Victor Stone: The best side actor + An improvement from Henry Cavill. + Actors gelling as one cohesive unit. + Hats off to Synder for not giving up on the project despite family issues.+ I liked that this movie connected to Batman V. Superman. + JL is much better than Batman V. Superman. + The end credit scene is the best I have ever seen.Finally, we have achieved a live-action version of the animated JL series!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Both critics and fans alike seem to dislike it. I on the other hand found it to be a much more well-formulated superhero movie, that goes to show that they don't all have to have a bunch of humorous sidekicks that and tongue-in-cheek sensibillity.
Batman: Ben Affleck delivers a more than solid performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. 
Wonder Woman: Doesn't fill out the whole movie, and actually makes sense in a strategic way this time around. I really am warming up to Gal Gadot's rendition.
The Flash: Steals the movie with his aspergian take on the character. 
Cyborg: Gets more space this time, and is vital to the story.
Superman: I like how he's pulled back into the story. I'm glad we didn't have to watch a lot of backstory on that one. That would've dragged out the whole storyline.
Alfred: I really love Jeremy Irons' Alfred. Sophisticated and sly. Even if it's fusing Lucious Fox and Alfred Pennyworth into the same character. 
Zack Snyder has done real well, and I think pulling on Joss Whedon was a good call. I wonder how much he affected the tone of the film.

"6","/10","One of the most underrated films ever!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4037665/?ref_=tt_urv","milleniumlogan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur73253133/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2018","As is evident from my rating I loved this movie! Before I get into what I liked about it, I would like to address some of the common critiques circulating about this movie.A common criticism of the movie is that, ""Superman's face CGI is so bad."" For those who don't know, this comes as a result of the fact that Henry Cavill had a contract with the studio of MI-6 saying that he must keep facial hair until that movie is done filming. Obviously, superman does not have a beard so Warner Bros. solution to the problem was to use graphics to make superman's face clean-shaven. I can honestly say that I don't find it to be that noticeable. Sure, if you take a screenshot of a scene and stare at it for long enough you can notice some distortion but during the movie it really isn't all that noticeable. I think a large part of the criticism here is coming from the fact that everyone knew about the facial hair dilemma so everyone went into theaters just waiting to see his face. If you don't have a problem with the Grand Moff Tarkin in Rogue One, you should not have a problem with superman's face either. Especially since the Tarkin was barely distinguishable from characters in Call of Duty.Another criticism of the movie is that, ""The villain is so terrible!"" Let me just say that if you go into a superhero movie expecting a villain as complex as, let's say King Edward Longshanks in Braveheart, you are going to be disappointed! Steppenwolf does what a villain in a team-up superhero movie needs to do. He has a feasible plan to destroy the world -unlike Ultron in Avengers: Age of Ultron , he's got an army, some motherboxes to find, and to top it off he's a badass. If you need more than that from a superhero villain, it is probably a good idea to avoid the genre of superhero movies altogether.Now I'll get into what I liked about the movie:1. I liked every character in the movie. Ben Affleck does a great job portraying an aging and at times somewhat humorous batman. Plus, his batmobile is even cooler in Justice League than it was in B v S. I will be very disappointed, if he does not continue as the batman because he is by far the best batman. Batfleck forever! Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman also adds to the movie in that she avoids falling into the typical mean, brassy category of female heroes that often tend to annoy me and instead portrays a more compassionate character. Jason Momoa is great as a trident-wielding and often gruff hero. Henry Cavill's Superman is much more fun to watch in this entry in the DCEU than he was previously. Ezra Miller adds a well-timed humor into the mix and the Cyborg is necessary to the plot.2. The chemistry between the characters was awesome! They all played off each other exceptionally well. One of my biggest complaints with the first Avengers was the constant bickering between Captain America and Iron Man. Arguing is not entertaining. If it was I'd pull up a chair every time I saw friends or family having heated discussions. In Justice League, there was only one true argument and it didn't last long. 3. The action sequences were great. The trailer teased some awesome action and the movie did not let me down. All the characters individual strengths were used to their full potential to create some of my favorite action sequences in any movie to date. The first time I watched the movie, I found myself grinning from ear to ear.4. The length actually ending up being perfect. Like many, I was worried when I saw a runtime of only 2 hours but in the end this runtime ended up being a major plus. 2 hours ended up being just enough time to build a story without getting bogged down by unnecessary drama.I saw this movie three times before it left theater and I will definitely be buying it when it comes out to Blu Ray. As a final note, don't listen to the critics like Rotten Tomatoes. They are just people who have likely gotten a degree in film and as a result feel that they can dictate what movies are good and what movies are garbage. I really hope that bad reviews and mediocre box office results don't hamper the future of the DCEU. There needs to be a Justice League 2!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The scenes of the League members together, bickering and bonding, spike the film with humor and genuine feeling, creating a rooting interest in the audience. Without it, the film would crumble. The addition of Ezra Miller as 'The Flash' was a great thing as he was maintaining the balance between action & some comic sequences. The CGI was good with enough good sound editing. Although it felt that at the second half the movie started faltering due to excessive use of CGI and for over use of fighting sequences. I admit that it was way better than Batman v Superman & Suicide Squad and was a decent watch..My Rating : 3/5","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Problem is, when you approach something superficially without passion or heart, it shows. Whedon took Snyder's Cut, chopped off 2 hours, inserted tons of Marvel phase 1 quips, and turned up the contrast. It didn't work. Why?1) The tone is inconsistent. Regardless of how people felt about BvS and Man of Steel, we had been introduced to a darker DC universe with heavier emotional themes. You throw in quips every 5 minutes, the tonal shift is cringeworthy. Batman saying ""something is definitely bleeding"" is just so stupid. I like some of the jokes in isolation - like Aquaman sitting on the lasso of truth - but a lot of the new comedic bits are sooo lame and forced. Not to mention ""booyah"" and ""I'm also a fan of justice""...god...really?2) The threat is weak. While I think Steppenwolf in Snydercut looks way cooler and the increased violence was fun, I cared more that he was actually a nuanced villain. You understand why he's doing what he's doing and even slightly sympathize with him. He is completely generic and non-threatening in Whedon's cut. The looming threat of Darkseid is more important to establish and of course we lose that here.3) The characters are weak. Because of the press for time, we don't get to have time to have our heroes join together in an organic way. We introduce Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman here and barely get any character development. It's a tall order to get us to really care about these heroes as nuanced characters in one film as it is and 2 hours to do it is just not enough. I would argue even Snyder's cut couldn't accomplish it all - he definitely made Cyborg and Flash more relatable but Aquaman was still a bit of a mystery (albeit the solo film was always planned to be next). By the time they all get together in this cut it feels unearned and not special. The Justice League uniting should feel special.4) The stache. I understand Whedon needed to rewrite the script and this required reshoots with Cavill. The contract he had with Mission Impossible sounds so juvenile. Im gonna give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt that this was the best CGI they could afford (which, still, really?). But that's so messed up to not just cede to wear a fake stache on your film and force another crew to spend tons of money on CGI. Just another example of spoiled rotten kids/execs in the sandbox who don't play well together. So dumb.I'm gonna be a little controversial here and say people reaped what they sowed. I like Snyder's darker, broodier vision for this universe since Man of Steel and I like the theatrical cut of BvS and loved the ultimate cut. The studio did what they thought was best and it just didn't work out. Now thanks to a vocal, and slightly toxic, minority of fans, we were able to get Snyder's original vision and it was great. I hope DC learns from this, picks a lane, and sticks with it without focusing so much about the bottom line or recreating Marvel's success. In my personal opinion, making the DCEU a ""darker"" version of MCU would be awesome.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Many reviewers ripped it for sub-par CGI (computer graphics). Some focused on the overall story being thin. Others commented that they felt it was disjointed, plodding, and uninspired. After seeing the movie I can say... those critics are correct, but I still liked this movie overall. Some of the Justice League cast gave rock solid, bordering on inspired performances! Ezra Miller, who plays the Flash is not good, he's great! He's quirky and geeky, vulnerable, and funny. Jason Momoa is also pretty good as Aquaman. I'm not thrilled with the scripts personification of him as a kinda muscle head, surfer dude, God of water, whatever, but what the guy is given to work with, he does a good job of pulling it off. Gal Gadot is great (as usual), but her star power diminishes a lot when she becomes just one of the gang. The Cyborg character is a throw-a-way. Maybe he needs more of his back story to be revealed to flesh him out (no pun intended), but I just wasn't feeling him. As for Batfleck... Somewhere Christian Bale is crying in his old bat cape. Ben...hang up the cowl son. You're too old, and nearly talented enough to pull off Batman. The movie did reach a point for me, where I wondered if it would be redeemable at all, and then something happened. Almost like when Kirk Gibson limped to the plate on two bad legs in the 1988 World Series, and hit one of the greatest WS home runs in history, Justice League found it's heart! I still have issues with some of the story. For instance, there are inconsistencies with the previous film (don't want to divulge and ruin the movie for ya), but I can let those things go. I left the theater with mostly positive feelings about this one, flaws and all.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Each excellent character had their time to shine & all had great chemistry together, Also the music score was Awesome. Steppenwolf was yes all c.g.i but looked & sounded excellent!!! The voice was great & perfectly fit the ancient character. All the action was great fun & the sewer scene with Batman's Awesome Nightcrawler vehicle was FANTASTIC!!! There's lots of great gems all through the movie, from great scenes to great character bits there's so many great parts, The Parademons look great, Lots more good things in this movie than bad things? So if you like it, just like it & forget all the hate!!! I totally enjoyed this as a big budget fun fantasy adventure & that's exactly what it was. ""The Flash"" kinda stole the show as the funny younger hero & his own flash theme is beautiful. Totally Awesome fun & very underrated. Also BEN AFFLECK is still the absolute BEST batman & bruce Wayne we have EVER HAD!!! I loved all the scenes with Affleck as Bruce/Batman, he's perfect in the role.The Flash pretty much steals the show, he's Awesome.""Aquaman"" is excellent & ""Wonder women"" is again fantastic & really holds the group together as the big heart of this rag tag team, the only character that didn't really get alot of depth was ""Cyborg"" as i did hear he was supposed to be the main arc or heart of the movie but had lots of scenes cut so that impacted his character part.""Superman"" becomes the ""Real"" superman in this movie, he become the comic book style icon.The cast is excellent!!!Steppenwolf is one of the greatest movie villains I've seen in along time especially in big fantasy comic book.Justice league is just a big budget action-packed,funny fantasy adventure!!! Would've loved it if this came out in the 90's & i saw it as a kid,

TL;DR Zack Snyder () was the original director and got to shoot most of the movie, but a tragic family issue made him step off the project. Enter Joss Whedon (), the new director who reportedly changed much of what was originally intended through reshoots and re-edits, delivering a less than two-hour superhero flick as demanded by the studio. At the time, my expectations were extremely low, not only due to its complicated production phase but also due to the DCEU's filmography until that point. Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad, and Wonder Woman were the films that preceded the get-together of Justice League.Ignoring my opinion on each film, my biggest fear walking into this movie was the fact that only two members of the team had an origin film (Superman, Wonder Woman) while Batman shared the spotlight with the two previous heroes in BvS. So, how would they introduce three new superheroes and get them all together as a team to fight an unknown villain in under two hours efficiently? Well, I didn't know the answer, and after rewatching this movie for the second time, it's clear both Whedon and Snyder had an impossible task. People quickly jump to comparisons, and it's easy to look at Marvel's own cinematic universe after its undeniable commercial success and call it ""the best formula"". However, I defend that there's no good or bad method.Even with an origin film for almost every major superhero, The Avengers has approximately a two-hour-and-thirty-minute runtime. This proves that it doesn't really matter how much screentime the characters already have, there's still a necessity of creating a story that efficiently and logically brings them all together to fight a common enemy. Justice League was doomed from the moment the studio mandated that runtime restriction, independently of its production issues and crew changes. Snyder, Whedon, or any other filmmaker would struggle to deliver a movie that could reach the fandom's incredibly high expectations. Despite all of its unquestionable flaws, I still find this film decent enough.Cast-wise, DC is proving to be as impeccable in its choices as Marvel or any other studio with massive franchises. From my second favorite Batman actor of all-time to the absolutely perfect casting of Wonder Woman, the newcomers are more than worthy of belonging to this fantastic universe of characters. Ezra Miller brings a quirky personality to Barry Allen / The Flash that really humors me. Jason Momoa might have changed the world's opinion on Arthur Curry / Aquaman by delivering a cool, badass performance that will end many jokes about the supposedly useless superhero (everyone has seen the countless memes throughout the last decades). Finally, even though Ray Fisher seems to be a good actor, the fact that Victor Stone / Cyborg is 95% CGI doesn't help his display.However, the predictable issue with the screenplay comes true, negatively affecting these new characters. The first act features extremely rushed introductions to the heroes, cutting from one place to another with no flow or rhythm. It almost feels like six different character trailers randomly mixed together with no connection between each setup. In addition to this, Steppenwolf (Ciar√°n Hinds) and his cliche motivation related to the pursuit of three MacGuffins are as lazy, unexciting, and generic as it could be. By far, the worst aspect of the entire movie. From the horribly non-menacing, amateur design to the awfully cliche development, Steppenwolf will go down as one of the worst villains ever seen in a superhero film.Changing to the good side, Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot share quite a few compelling dialogues that I actually wish I could have seen more of their characters' reluctant yet strong friendship. A bit more of Batman comes through to the audience, but there's still a lot to uncover from this version of The Dark Knight. However, it's in the action sequences these characters shine, which leads me to the only compliment I can offer Steppenwolf: it works well enough as the entertaining punching bag of the Justice League. Contrary to their introductions, Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash all have key moments during the action-packed third act, working together as the team of superheroes the world so desperately needs.Batman planning everything, Wonder Woman leading with heart, and the new metahumans showing their skills make the last thirty minutes partially compensate for the rapid-fire first hour. However, it's Superman - trailers and posters showed him, so this is definitely not a spoiler - who steals the show. I find Henry Cavill a great casting choice for Clark Kent, but the previous movies didn't let both the character and the actor reach their respective potential. Justice League holds a surprising, outstanding moment in Superman's return to action, making me genuinely wish for his sequences rather than the rest of the heroes. Finally, something exciting about The Last Son of Krypton (yes, the digitally-removed mustache still stands out, but it's such an irrelevant nitpick)!Technically, the costumes look great, though they're toned down by the murky aesthetic. For example, Wonder Woman's suit popped off the screen in Patty Jenkins' colorful film, but in this one, all costumes seem to lack glow. On the other hand, Gotham looks fantastic in that dark atmosphere, and the final battle emphasizes a red filter that surprisingly works quite well. The action sequences are mostly easy to follow, even though CGI often overwhelms the screen, but I can't deny that some scenes really left me astounded. The editing team (David Brenner, Richard Pearson, Martin Walsh) obviously had struggles with so many reshoots and modifications, but overall, Whedon was able to put together a relatively coherent movie story-wise.Justice League remains surprisingly decent, even after all these years. Despite its massive production issues and the studio's mandate for a runtime shorter than two hours - dooming the film even when Zack Snyder was still at the helm - Joss Whedon still manages to deliver a reasonable superhero flick. Every actor offers excellent performances, namely Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot, but the negative expectations regarding the lack of screentime to introduce and develop unknown heroes come to fruition. Whedon and Chris Terrio couldn't do better than an extremely rushed first act, skipping from a new character onto the next one with no connection between storylines or even consecutive scenes. In addition to this, from his awful design to his generic evil intents, Steppenwolf is undoubtedly one of the worst villains ever put to screen. The action-heavy third act features enough entertainment to compensate for some other minor issues with the screenplay, delivering outstanding sequences worthy of a much better movie. In the end, I hope that the upcoming Snyder Cut brings a lot more of the captivating character interactions that elevated this film, but without the restraints of studio orders.Rating: B-","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

On the contrary, the plot here is so simplistic to the point where it isn't really important at all. The Mother Boxes are extreme McGuffins and when you think back on the film, the story isn't really what jumps out at you. In fact, more than that, the story is forgettable and just a bit dull. There are no twists or surprises or any fear or suspense at all. On top of this, there's a very confused structure, where in the first half it's as though the film can't decide whether it's about the world coping after Superman's death or if it's about Steppenwolf's plan to conquer the world. It all feels a bit mixed up and results in some scenes seeming out of place and boring in comparison, slowing down the pace of the film. It also feels as though the story was very light and we miss a middle. With a decent start and end, the middle does tend to waffle a bit; though there's a fun fight scene, there's not much else, resulting in a bit of a rush towards the finale. This is a shame as the middle section could really help us get to know the characters and give them room to grow ‚Äì as well as improving the plot and giving it a chance to develop.As light and dull as the story is though, the fun rarely comes from its plot; the best parts without doubt lie in its action and characters. The former, however, lacks potency because there's no threat at all within the story. Yes, the fight scenes and set pieces are amazing; there's a variety of action, well-choreographed fights and a kinetic energy (especially when all characters are working together) that brings an exciting energy to the film and is a joy to watch. However there's rarely a feeling of doom when the only vulnerable characters in any danger are a rather obscure and irrelevant Russian family as token civilians who are easily saved ‚Äì no one else is ever in any peril and so the stakes really don't seem particularly high.Still despite this, it really is difficult to care when the action looks this good. As with each and every Zack Snyder film, though he doesn't often make good movies, you can always count on them excelling in the eye-candy department and Justice League is no exception ‚Äì this is certainly a film that deserves the full IMAX 3D experience. With impressive CGI, thrilling action set pieces and wonderful costume design (particularly for Aquaman) this is an absolute treat for the eyes and there's lots to enjoy just in aesthetics. Sadly though, it's not all good news; there are frequent scenes where the use of green screen is painfully obvious, standing out amongst all the other good CGI; and it looks like the recent controversy surrounding the more scantily clad Amazonian warriors had a right to come up ‚Äì these costumes are ridiculous and nigh-on pornographic. It's a shame that while Wonder Woman took one step forward with regards to sexual equality, Justice League took two steps back.Still the highlight of the film is certainly the characters. All of them mix well, their interactions together being a high point and each of them remaining unique and interesting with their own brand of comedy. I can't help but wonder how much of the lighter tone and comedic moments were down to Snyder or Whedon who completed directing¬Ö Newcomers hold their own and can easily stand next to current favourite Wonder Woman. Momoa brings a comedic version of ultra- masculinity to Aquaman which fits really well and Miller's Barry Allen is certainly the comic relief that was needed in the DCEU, fully personifying all the comic book enthusiasts in the cinema and easily encouraging a whole audience to laugh. Gadot continues being perfect as Wonder Woman, bringing so much more than her beauty to the role, but being an inspirational character that stands out. Affleck seems to be more comfortable as Batman than in his previous outings and certainly shows promise. Amy Adams as Lois Lane and J.K. Simmons as Lieutenant Gordon are criminally underused considering their talents, yet despite brief appearances they make the most of their screen-time. The only weak link in the cast is Henry Cavill who still can't hold a torch to Christopher Reeve. Too dry and wooden with only a couple of facial expressions, it's a shame we've yet to see Superman develop a personality; in comparison to his fellow teammates this stands out as a stark contrast. If anything, his appearance made little difference to the story and perhaps the story would have been the same (or maybe better) without him¬ÖThe other weak link of the film is certainly Steppenwolf, the villain. With very little character or personality, Steppenwolf here just appears as a random, generic bad guy threatening to conquer the world. His 'evil plan' is dull and simple, easily thwarted and is of very interest. Considering the roster of characters DC have at their disposal it seems strange and disappointing to have chosen this to be the Justice League's first threat.Despite their recent wobbly track-record, fortunately the first live-action film of Justice League is not the disappointment so many dreaded. Leaps and bounds ahead of the first three films but certainly not as excellent as Wonder Woman, Justice League suffers from a lacklustre plot, iffy structure and painfully generic, boring villain (not to mention the Amazon costume controversy). However, luckily we have great actors playing lovable characters, wonderfully exciting and kinetic action set-pieces and a more light-hearted tone with comedic moments that gives the whole film a unique personality. Though not all critics may like this film, this is certainly a crowd-pleaser and, at last, it feels like DC are on the right track.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was our first Justice League movie that many had been anticipating for years. It just felt like a failed attempt at all angles, horrible editing and completely skewed direction of where the story was going to end up and where the studio wanted this to go. You could tell how much had been changed and where VFX was used to change already completed shots, to the new vision of Whedon and the studio. It was all around just a embarrassing to clearly show everyone how incompetent the team was who handled this.After ZSJL, it is BAFFLING that they would even release something like Justice League. You had an amazing movie with ZSJL and scrapped 90% of it for the worst reasons possible. The story holds so much more to it. Every character is done justice in their adaptations and how amazing they are. Each character having plenty of time to get to know and love each of them. The action is amazing, the CGI is top tier, especially compared to most movies today. So much more thought and heart was put into this screen play. There's so much world building that anybody could have taken over the helm after Zack Snyder and fulfilled what the fans would have loved to see. If you are hesitant of ZSJL After watching this piece of garbage, please give it a try. I can assure you that it is a totally different movie, leaving you wanting everything it wanted to give you in the future.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Personally, I was a little afraid for the future of DC's franchise. After an audience gets a bad taste in their mouth, it's hard to forget. But, 'Justice League' actually comes though with just enough action and fun to make up for previous mistakes.In the film, we are introduced to more heroes, like Cyborg, The Flash, and Aquaman, as well as reuniting with familiars like Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. As I said before, it is a fun film, but has a few ""flaws"" in my opinion. First, even though there are many heroes, only Superman has died and the whole world falls apart? Sounds like Bruce and Diana aren't doing their jobs! And Aquaman is a little too cocky to be taken seriously; it takes from the drama. Cyborg is the best character because he is calm, level headed, and not annoying.But, I must say I enjoyed the theater experience and it's worth your movie-watching time. The visuals are spectacular and not too cheesy, and the action is quite ""edge of your seat."" If you are afraid you're in for another 'Batman vs. Superman,' don't be. It really makes you look forward to the upcoming DC films, like 'Aquaman' and 'Justice League II.' Also, it is not necessary to have seen any previous DC films like 'B vs. S' or 'Wonder Woman.' All you need know is that Superman has died. But I do believe this movie was released at the wrong time. It premiered in November 2017. A superhero epic like this didn't deserve a release in dreary November! A June, July, or August ""summer blockbuster"" release would have suited it better.So, if you see 'Justice League,' you will not be disappointed!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Not because Whedon's style is ugly and Snyder's good looking, but because the mixture of both generates a contrast so big and noticeable it ends up being distracting.Plot is non existent. Scenes just happen with no substance or reason. The villain is just a placeholder, he is a literal mcguffin looking for three mcguffins to create a bigger mcguffin.The heroes are boring and uninteresting, they tried to make them likable with humor but it is poorly written as the rest of the film.

I guess some people are in a binary state of mind when it comes to reviewing and it's either love or hate. I mean, some flaws in a movie, book, tv-show, or people for that matter don't make them a 100% bad. 
I'm not a purist, certainly when it comes to fantasy, mythology, superheroes, or anything that comes from our imagination. I actually like the playing around with it, exploring different universes of thought. And of course that always goes hand in hand with some mistakes. It's the price of admission for any creative process.
I think this movie is a solid good action flick. The character development is either non existent or very straightforward, the story is much less confusing and complex than Batman V Superman. There's a lot of smiles, and I even found myself laughing out loud at some moments (Flash). Superman and Batman are far less intense which is nice. I liked the screen time everyone got. There's plenty of action. I liked the visual effects. The end credit scenes included a funny scene as well as a pointer to a possible next movie.

Superman. It's funnier, it has more action, it has less brooding and darkness, and it's just plain much, much more fun to watch. Justice League is the kind of movie that should put DC back on the same sort of cinematic path that Marvel has been treading over the past decade.The movie picks up where the aforementioned Batman v. Superman left off. Superman is gone, having sacrificed himself to save the world. Meanwhile, Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) begin to recruit an alliance of super-duper people (Flash (Ezra Miller), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Aquaman (Jason Momoa)) to prepare for what appears to be another alien threat.That alien threat is one Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds), the nephew and second-in-command to the yet-unseen super big bad named Darkseid. Steppenwolf has arrived on Earth to collect three Mother boxes ‚Äì objects that, when joined together, will grant immense power, etc., etc., etc. Steppenwolf is aided by thousands and thousands of Parademons, bug-like creatures who were once men.Here's a brief list of what I liked about the movie. 1) Bruce Wayne has a wry, understated sense of humor that ‚Äì get this ‚Äì is also self-deprecating. 2) Jason Momoa kills as a manly-man king of the seas. 3) Gal Gadot is just as terrific as she was in her own movie and in BvS. 4) The Flash is hilarious! 5) There were plenty of tight action sequences that, despite being shown in IMAX, were easy to track. I could see who was fighting whom and with what! The overall tone of the movie is more in line with what Marvel's doing ‚Äì there's physical fighting, there are biting remarks, there are doubts (our heroes are human-ish, after all), there are touching moments. Everyone delivers, which isn't always the case in ensemble pictures, but Affleck in particular really stepped up his game as the Bat dude. A lot of people liked his performance in BvS, but I found him stiff and boring. That's just not true in Justice League. Bats still has a huge ego, still likes to run things, likes to work alone even among his team. And he's still kind of a jerk. But he's not a boring jerk; Affleck, finally, gives him a personality! And lo! DC was saved!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I look forward to multiple viewings. Yes, the ""world-destroyimg supervillian"" is pretty standard but this main goal of this movie is introducing new heroes and the challenge of bringing the League together. On that level is works great. 
With only 2 hours there isn't too much time to give a lot of back story to Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman along with the emotional battle Superman goes through after his resurrection. We do get a good intro to the personalities and motivation of the new members with a touch of a backstory. Not too much is needed for The Flash and Aquaman with planned solo movies for them. Movie succeeds in getting rid of the ""lameness"" of Aquaman and makes him dark and cool with some real power. The Flash is great comic relief. It's not even close to being too much. Cyborg isn't nearly as well known but he gets a key role in the plot that puts him on the same level as the other new members.
Wonder Woman once again dominates the screen with her conflict whether she should show the emotional strength to lead the team. We all know Batman and Superman and Batman is great fueling the rams formation along with Superman coming to the rescue as the cleanup hitter. 
Can't wait for them to get back together!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

My wife skipped, not her type of movie.In essence this is a continuation of the ""Batman vs Superman"" movie, in this story a mythical character Steppenwolf has returned with a plan to destroy the whole world, perhaps the whole universe. As he gains more power the six remaining members of the Justice League are trying hard but seem to be fighting a losing battle. They really need Superman but can they figure out a way to re-animate him? To bring him back alive?Well as we know anything is possible in the comics. And now we know the world is still here, so there's that. As a long-time superhero fan I found the movie a bit uneven but still enjoyable. As much as the movie, I enjoyed the approximately 14 minute BD extra that explains the history of the Justice League and its characters in the comics, and some of the changes over the years. Plus the picture and sound are first-rate, my powered subwoofer really got a workout!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

When Man of Steel came out, I could see a positive future for the DCEU. While slightly flawed, at least it had some truly impressive visuals, backed up by a decent story. I was pretty satisfied. Even after the messy Batman v Superman, I still had faith in the DCEU, for it had the ambition to make something outstanding, though being not really successful. While the terrible Suicide Squad disappointed me, the major hit Wonder Woman, which was pretty much successful in every way, refueled my passion for the DCEU.And then we have Justice League. While it is entertaining, it has just so many problems that make it impossible for me to enjoy.1. The re-shoots. As many people mentioned, one can easily tell whether a scene is made by Snyder or Whedon.2. The editing. Too many close-up shots being shown continuously (a very common problem that already happened to many blockbusters, such as Warcraft). Everything happens way too quickly, which means ZERO character development. Therefore it is almost impossible to actually care for the characters if you don't like them already.3. The visuals. I am hardly a big fan of Zack Snyder, but I find it very enjoyable to watch his unique shots that somewhat capture the feeling of the comics. In Justice League, there is merely any interesting shots; most of the shots are no better than any ordinary blockbusters.4. The story. The script is SO generic - much more so than Man of Steel and BvS. Everything is expected. There is NO sense of danger, and we simply cannot fear the villain at all. Also, though everyone knows that Superman will return, it is supposed to be very powerful moment. Instead, they managed to somehow make his return in a way that is not thrilling at all.5. The humor. I don't mind DCEU to be something more light-hearted, but if you want to have humor, at least do it right. The fact is that probably not more than 1 out of 3 jokes in this movie is actually laughable. Other jokes are either stupid, or simply not funny.Above all, Justice League is a watchable blockbuster that provide just enough fun to make your 2 hours worthwhile. Don't expect more.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I don't really care what critics have to say, I just make my own view. As I have written in other reviews, my favorite of the DCEU is Man of Steel, but I appreciate all of them.Also, in regards to Marvel, I also like some of those movies. I didn't like Guardians of the Galaxy 2 or Spiderman Homecoming, I really thought Justice League was better, but Thor: Ragnarok takes the spot for the best comic book movie of the year. Don't let it deter you from seeing this one though, as Justice League is still good!For this movie I will give the good and the bad:The Good:1. The Characters. Wonder Woman and Batman are great, as usual. The Flash is funny and Aquaman is awesome. Can't wait for his movie. Cyborg is interesting. A character who will not be named is great as well. They all work really well together and really make this movie special. 2. Comic book moments. There are a lot of good comic book moments to like here. The references are good. I think an improvement that they made was the actual comic book type stuff as this wasn't as apparent in Batman V. Superman3. The ships. I ship Diana and Bruce together. They obviously dropped a lot of hints that I really dug. Can't wait until the ship has finally sailed. I ship Lois and Clarke obviously. A bit disappointing, but I liked what I got.4. The continuity. I liked that this movie connected to Batman V. Superman. In a lot of ways, this is the third movie in a trilogy. While you will feel like you are missing some things, there is some continuation here.The Bad:1. The plot. There is really not much to see here. 2. The villain. Very weak villain. No high stakes. It also felt like he was delivering his lines to a green screen instead of to the Justice League.3. The CGI. Probably the worst of the negatives. Everything was CGI'd. The worst would probably be SteppenWolf. Why did he look like that? 4. Bad editing. Man, this movie was all over the place. There was one scene that really irked me. Wonder Woman was wearing her costume and she walks in the next shot with something else on. When did that happen? lol. 5. Many scenes in the trailers not in the movie. I am sure we will get an extended cut, which I am eagerly awaiting. It felt like a good 30 minutes was probably cut and I'm sad that we didn't see it. Can't wait for the Blu-ray.6. The music. What I liked about the other DCEU movies was the soundtrack. This movie didn't really have anything memorable with sound except the song in the credits. I missed that about BvS and Man of Steel. DC, please fix for other movies!Overall, if you are a fan of comics or the other movies, go see it. It is a fun time, which is what people expect from something like this. One thing, before I am done, is that I wanted to comment on the DCEU, in general. Yes, they have received poor critical reception, with Wonder Woman having great reception, and this movie is no different. However, we can't really judge this movie now, because this movie was already done with and shot. The real course correction won't happen until Aquaman. In fact, Justice League was shot before Wonder Woman and spent a long time in post production. There really wasn't much they could do. I will say that there are some changes in here that will show the better movies to come.Also, this is not the real ""Justice League"" movie. Everyone knows that. The real one will come when Justice League 2 happens. I do believe that DC knows how to fix their issues (CGI may take some time) but I am hopeful. This movie does show that there is a bright future. Go see it.My DCEU ranking:Man of Steel Wonder Woman Batman V. Superman/ Justice League (tied with BVS) Suicide Squad","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

DC is just catching up. And frankly, I think that's the reason I did not enjoy this much. I tried to be positive in my expectation of this movie and mentally prepped myself to enjoy this one, but it just didn't work as I hoped it would. At the end, my reaction was a big ""Hmm... "" with a pout.But, it is not at all bad. I was still entertained by this movie because I am big fan of superhero movies. Thank God for Wonder Woman! Putting aside Gal Gadot's beauty being really captivating (and hard to turn away from .. and I'm a girl), Wonder Woman's play and weight on this movie was a plus for me. Frankly, I am tired of Batman and Superman, and it will take more for me to get interested in those characters (after so many past movies to give justice to those characters). Cyborg .. am still conflicted. Not sure if it is the acting or I just should not expect more from this character. Aquaman -- thought it will be more grand and the Flash -- character was just okay but when The Flash character has been established a long time in the TV series and you get a different character story in the movie, that is a bit disappointing. I hope DC will be good at planning the build-up stories of these characters. That's what Marvel did right. I read in the news that Joss Whedon (Marvel) helped out in finalizing this movie. So it makes me wonder.. can it be that the goodness I got from this movie is because of what Joss had put in?

The film picks up where ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" left off. With the death of Superman, the world continues to mourn while Batman and Wonder Woman assemble the Justice League to defend the world against Steppenwolf; an alien villain set on destroying the world. ""Justice League"" had enormous pressure riding on its shoulders as a follow up to this year's ""Wonder Woman"" and its behind the scenes problems with director Zack Snyder stepping down earlier on in the film's post production phase. Faced with multiple reshoots and a new approach by Joss Whedon, ""Justice League"" feels wildly inconsistent and unfocused in both plot and central theme. The first half of the film feels so jarring and all over the place no scene seems to mean anything to it's accompanying scene. The story attempts to balance several elements from the DC comics lore that it manages to make it feel more meaningless than satisfying for a true fan. This is obviously disappointing since I thought most DCEU films so far have done that quite well.Since the first half and the second half of the film feel so disjointed and uncomplimentary, the pacing feels down right painful. This bogs the story down almost as much as the villain Steppenwolf who not only feels clich√©, he's actually blatantly bad. Many are complaining about the CGI being subpar for the villain. I would argue the actual character design and construct are so generic and video game-esque, that it's not really fun watching him on screen. Complaints aside, ""Justice League"" has some fine, memorable moments and qualities. First, the portrayals of all members of the league and their characterization was very satisfying. Ezra Miller stole the show as The Flash and Jason Mamoa as Aquaman was compelling to watch the entire time. Both Ben Affleck and Henry Cavil give quite different representations of the DC comic's heavyweights which I still have mixed feels about. Despite hesitations however, every character worked well with each other and it was truly entertaining to see every scene they were in. Recently, a large glaring issue with these genre films many have had is its tone. Recently, many audiences have preferred more lighthearted, fun, and humorous approach to the superhero/action genre. Films that make fun of the dramatic and cheesy nature that correlates with the genre stories. Sacrificing genuine emotional drama for a jokey one-liner, modern day superhero films have lowered their stakes, minimized the impact of their villains, and filled the screen with more clever one-liners than ever before. In the case for ""Justice League"" the movie falls right into that trap by fitting the mold and not standing out. Regarding Warner Bros and DC comics films, I enjoy and appreciate a film that tries to be more. With big characters come heavy ideas rooted in mythology and ancient storytelling. Perhaps the biggest complaint about ""Justice League"" is its resolve to appeal to mass audiences with more jokes and low stakes; even if it means it being forgotten in a few months. Say what you will about previous DCEU films but at least people still remember them.At the end of the day, ""Justice League"" is a good time. I would eventually recommend going to see it. It beats other comic book films this year but doesn't come close to touching some of the best. It's fun, riveting to watch for the characters, and definitely peaks my interest for the future of the DCEU. It would really be best to see this one on your own and form your own opinion.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This really was a well put together movie. I was a little nervous because of how much they had to pack into a 2 hour movie, but they did it really really well. It had a few more jokes in it than BvS which gave it a little more of a light-hearted feel but always kept it's feet on the ground. My fianc√©, who is not by any means a comic nerd like some of us, was able to watch it and be able to understand the characters despite the little insight. It's almost as if the trailers were the introduction to the characters and it worked out really really well. I gave this movie a 10/10 starts. Yes, I am a little biased because I'm a big DC fan, but I still went into the movie with an open mind, for better or worse. The acting is great, the CGI is beautiful, the cast really did mesh well together, and each character had more than a few moments to shine which helped it not be the ""Batman and Wonder Woman and Friends"" most were thinking it would become. Need something to go watch this weekend, go see Justice League. You will not be disappointed!","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

OK. First thing first. It is not half as bad as people make it out to be. BvS was bad. Iron Man 2 and 3 were bad. Green Lantern was pathetic and so was fantastic 4. This movie is good. Now to the review. I think people have made it a habit to beat the hell out of DC movies just for fun. I watched the movie and enjoyed watching it. Are there things that could have been better? Yes. But hell, if people can enjoy other superhero movies that are pure entertainment and very less in terms of storyline, why not this? Avengers was awesome but it had a very kiddish and predictable storyline too. Wonder Woman was wonderful but come on, it was no Unbreakable or Watchmen, and it wasn't supposed to be either because these movies are supposed to be fun. So, if you go there just to enjoy the movie, I think you would love it. Good things about the movie - Action is good. Acting is good. Comedy is good too; they gave away all the good lines in the promos though which I think was a mistake. Batman felt like what he is - a man with no super powers but still a superhero due to his other characteristics. It felt nice because he was particularly shown to be a vulnerable character. Bad things - I personally didn't like Flash and Batman's costumes much because their necks wouldn't move and it was a constant distraction. Steppenwolf's character could have been used in a better way. Sure, he was strong but also, shallow. Same thing stands for Aquaman too. Either something was really wrong with Henry Cavill's face or I had just forgotten how he looked. Will have to watch it again for that. Really bad thing - I somehow don't want to see Jesse Eisenberg as Lex ever again. They should listen to the fans and just replace him. That one scene of him playing Luthor made me cringe. Last, there should have been Darkseid. He should have been there, even if for just one scene. I was hoping to see him till the very last name rolled on the screen and was disappointed to see that he wasn't.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The DC Extended Universe kicked off with Snyder's Man of Steel in 2013 which garnered mixed reactions from viewers and critics. The dark tone and the reimagining of Superman's character were not accepted by many people and the chaotic action scenes added more hate towards the best Superman film I have seen. Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice followed in 2016 to mostly negative reviews resulting from the butchering of Snyder's into 151 minutes. With a lot of plot holes and a convoluted plot, the released cut of BvS had been just an average film. But the Ultimate cut released on Blu-ray with 183 minutes runtime proved to be one of the best superhero films. Then came Suicide Squad, which was another film for DC that had to go on to be a panned by the critics. With an average script and disastrous editing, the film was mostly carried by Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot who made it watchable to an extent. Wonder Woman was the film I was most disappointed in DCEU that everyone else seems to love. With nothing new to offer plotwise aside some big blunders, no real character development, no memorable action scene and a laughable attempt to make it look like a feminist film it totally disappointed me. Now Justice League is out as the 5th film in the DCEU.Justice League starts off with Batman facing the imminent threat of parademons lead by Steppenwolf from an alien world (probably from Apokolips) who are searching for three Motherboxes in the earth. To face the threat Batman and Wonder Woman tries to make an alliance with The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg.Unlike Snyder's previous entries in the series, there is no building up of scenes instead from the first scene itself action starts in this action-packed film. The plot is kept simple to provide the superhero team origin story the main focus. Zack Snyder has always excelled at making great opening credit sequences and although not as good as some of his previous works, the post-Superman world is shown with remarkable visual flair.The rewrites in the screenplay by Joss Whedon is evident in the lighter tone of the film and the joking around of the characters. Visual command of Snyder becomes more evident with scenes that were obviously part of Whedon's reshoots.The appearance of Superman in Justice League was obvious for many reasons. The scenes following his return, I was having goosebumps for a whole lot of reasons that were totally unexpected. The interactions between Superman and Flash makes you hope for a future with more of those in the DCEU.Aquaman and Flash proved to be the most entertaining characters even in the small spaces they got. Cyborg and Flash are in their beginning stages and have a long way to get to their full potential. The scenes from Atlantis provided some insight into what the Aquaman film may deal with. Aquaman was a badass character who is able to be humorous at the same time.Yet the film leaves you longing for more. The numerous cuts by the studio are not as evident as that of BvS but still makes things too quickly approached which could have had better treatment. While a lot of the one-liner jokes works a lot of them felt too forced and doesn't really fit with the DCEU. The mustache removal of Henry Cavill was clearly visible and weird to look at in many scenes.Whedon's involvement definitely changed the tone of the film which wasn't a disaster, but it would've been better otherwise. The film could've been much better if it was approached with darker themes that could've been explored here.Superman's character arc and the Injustice tease from BvS is pointing towards a darker future, though the involvement of Snyder in an uncertain state and Whedon's current involvement doesn't give hope for that arc.Even with all the problems in the film, it was entertaining and satisfying enough for someone like me with the childhood nostalgia for Justice League.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well¬Ö¬Ö Not really.The film follows Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Godot), as they look to assemble a team of other gifted individuals to help fight off a pending invasion. The death of Superman has left a void on the Earth, and this has paved the way for an ancient evil to return as he attempts to conquer the planet, he must collect some infinity stones artifacts to help him start the end of time (or something like that).If a story really is a movies backbone then Justice league is disabled.Characters are most certainly Justice Leagues strong point and as a huge fan of these comic book heroes it was exciting to watch Bruce, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg and Superman all meet up and interactive with each other. The chemistry between the main crew is fantastic and I personally would have loved to have seen more moments like this.Affleck, Gadot and Cavill (even with his weird CGI top lip) play their roles excellently and the newbies Ezra Miller (The Flash). Jason Momoa (Aquaman) & Ray Fisher (Cyborg) all do a fine job of bringing their characters to life. Ezra Miller adds a lot of humour to proceedings, even if some jokes fall a little flat) and Jason Momoa portrayal of Aquaman goes swimmingly. The only character I'm not a fan of is Ray Fisher's Cyborg. This isn't his fault, in fact his acting is quite possibly the most impressive of all, however his character is very generic and feels very much like a knock off Iron-man.One of the films biggest issues is it's runtime. A studio imposed time restraint of 2 hours would have been a huge crucifix on Zack Snyder and then his replacement Joss Whedon considering just how much they had to cram into this film. Not only did it have to deal with the repercussions of Batman v Superman but also introduce many new characters and bring with it a powerful new threat. The movie jumps from one scene to the next and the audience is at real risk of getting dizzy. Its all very messy and cumbersome, some scenes could be stand-alone youtube videos with little to connect them to the following scenes¬Ö The final chapter could have been shot for any other DC movie and then just bolted to the end.Then we come to the films main villain¬Ö One of THE worst villains I have ever seen. Steppenwolf (I had to google his name as I couldn't for the life of me remember) is entirely CGI and has no real presence. Muttering words like ""no protectors here, this world will fall..blaah blah blah"" is as shallow and uninspiring as they come. Apparently as a dedicated comic book reader his motivations would be a more clear but to me I had no idea what his problem was and this just highlights how little I cared about the main story.The action in the film is decent enough and there are some stand out moments that made the nerd in me cry in delight, however so many blatantly obvious CGI backgrounds and almost video game like character moments pulled me out of the moment more often than I'd have liked.Justice League feels like a cake that was made without all its ingredients and not left in the oven long enough. DC should have taken more time to establish its characters first before throwing them all into the same pot. Overall it was much better than I expected, and the two bonus scenes in the credits show some interesting potential down the road.

The narrative was a bit wobbly at the beginning.However I did find the characters of Aquaman, Cyborg and especially the FLASH VERY ENTERTAINING. Perhaps Marvel have so got the SuperHero format locked it's hard for us to appreciate any comic book movies that deviate from the Marvel Template.DC still have a long way to go in giving Marvel a run for their money...","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's more dark than the marvel movies but is way more lighter than BVS. So it's actually quite fun. Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg are all great. They are introduced pretty good despite the fact that we have never seen them before. My personal favorite has to be Flash.The action is also pretty good, but I got a bit tired of all the slow motion. I also kinda felt that the fight scenes with Batman was a bit slow/clunky but that might just be me.All in all it's pretty enjoyable. It starts really dark but gets gradually lighter and is really fun in the end. So if you like superhero movies I would recommend taking a look.7/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ben Affleck is the best Batman they've had","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4190090/?ref_=tt_urv","RomanceNovelist","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22769532/?ref_=tt_urv","4 June 2018","Ben Affleck is the best Batman DC live action movies has had, except on par with Michael Keaton. Keaton didn't ""look"" like Batman, but his movies were fun. Affleck even looks like the cartoon version of The Dark Knight. And yes, I think he is better than Clooney. Kilmer. And yes, leaps and bounds better than that miserable Christian Bale. When people think of Justice League, and comic book movies based on the DC Universe, the first thing we do is offer advice on how to make them better. Why? Because they are so terribly flawed. For one, the movies take itself way too seriously. The characters rarely smile. I saw a few smiles in Justice League, but not enough. The movies are painted dark blue, but not in a fun gothic way, like the original Batman (Burton) movie. But in this grey, dark blue-ish dismal way. People go to comic book movies for fun. Thankfully, Affleck embodies Batman enough that it saves the movie, along with Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Speaking of which, WW is what a comic book hero is supposed to be. Her movie was fun, light-hearted, and entertaining. The problem I have with Justice League is that the characters don't seem to have chemistry. But this isn't the actors' fault, but the writing. Make these movies fun again. And lighten up.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie is just straight up sh*t even coming fresh out of it. Wonder Woman proves to be a one hit wonder for the DCEU as Zack Synder and Chris Terrio's script continues to prove that they do not know what they're doing at all or perhaps it's WB's poor handling of the movie that ultimately made the experience dull and boring. This film had potential to be good, the plot itself was decent but the execution was sloppy and felt extremely rushed, running at around a mere 2hrs, this was a film which needed to spend more time developing its heavily underdeveloped plot. I want to see this movie again but without studio interference, the ultimate edition/director's cut has potential to be great. Zack may have made a good movie here but studio interference may have just fuck3d it upFirstly to address the positives of this movie, the heroes are great, they were all very likable and were enjoyable to watch on screen, the chemistry between them was a stand out part, they made a great team. The story itself was also decent, though formulaic and the post credits scene was an amazing set up, it was my favourite part of the entire movie.Moving on to the negatives now, Aquaman was a completely negligible character who was just kinda present with his pitch fork but never really did much, The flash had too many ham-fisted jokes, like Jesus i get it he's an outsider you don't have to constantly remind me of that. Ezra Miller did a good job in my opinion, and his character has potential, the flashpoint movie has potential to be good just keep Chris and Zack away from the story. The god awful CGI completely threw me off at times, close ups of Steppenwolf and Cyborg and Superman's edited out mustache was done so poorly and proved to be extremely distracting and took me out of the movies at times. The story also has terrible pacing, too much is happening in such a short amount of time, i thought i was watching multiple movies at the same time in the recruitment part of the movie, it just felt too disjointed and didn't flow very well. The film/story is also just way too short, i was surprised when i realised the movie was about to end because i felt as if the story could have been further developed, my realisation of the villain being defeated was of shock as i had expected some more complications to arise before the final act of the movie came together however it turns out THAT WAS INDEED THE FINAL ACT. The complication and resolution for this story is too formulaic and very disappointing there's nothing special there to discuss. I myself adore DC, however this film is embarrassing, especially when the best part of the movie is the 30 second post credits scene. If you want to see a good Justice League movie, you're better off watching DC's animated work which is done much better than this poorly paced and executed mess. Hopefully WB fixes the DCEU before they do the Justice League vs Darkseid story because i really don't want to be let down again like this.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

After a while of thought after seeing the movie I have come to say I think this movie was a lot of fun on its own. Its not Wonder Woman that is true and it does go darker than some Marvel films ever would, but Justice League is in fact a Marvel film through and through. Rather u like it or hate that. Having a director like Joss Whedon come in and do re shoots on the film only helps this claim. This film is a result of a whole lot of criticism regarding this entire universe and how it was built. The foundation was never steady to begin with and as a result this film hurts because of that. Luckily despite that Justice League still manages to come out with a lot of entertainment value that puts a smile on your face. The movie has a lot of funny scenes that do put a smile on your face and make the film a lot more enjoyable. The characters are far more interesting and I enjoy seeing them coming together making for a far better experienceThe film does have a few issues tho. The entire second half of the film is a mess from a technical stand point. The editing is really poorly handled and so is the flying green screen overhead. Also mustaches for days. There are some weird cuts and slices and a few other problems that the film has. Overall Justice League is still a enjoyable film despite some of its flaws that it had. I defiantly want to see it again. It was fun and light and I just really overall enjoyed my experience in the theater.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The ""Justice League"" film you've all been waiting for, dreaming of...just kidding, it's not. Warner. Bros. once again has made something that should be a fun ride from start to finish, pleasing the crowd, infusing its audience with energy, into a boring, scatterbrained mess, where nothing is coherent or of sense, action scenes that are so empty and hit as hard as the New York Giants' defense. Most surprisingly about ""Justice League"" is how cheap it looks, the film cost THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS! Why does this superhero team up movie look as pricey as a CBS crime drama?! Many people thought the success of ""Wonder Woman"" meant that WB and DC had figured it out, but no, here comes Zack Snyder doing what he knows best, turning light, fun comic book material into his dark, twisted little fantasy, Joss Whedon's involvement sheds some light, and I do mean some, but it's all in vain, really the only two highlights here are Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman and how the film decided to use Cavill's Superman, there are nice team moments but they are most certainly few and far between. ""Justice League"" is a small baby step in the right direction for these characters but not much else. Everyone involved deserves better, from the cast to the crew to the audience, it's time WB moved from Zack Snyder, it's clearly a failed relationship with nothing left to offer, zip, nada.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

There is an interesting movie under the rubble, on the joint effort of different personalities and the resurrection of a fallen hero. But this is a film, which has been sacrificed for the constraints of time, the frenetic pace, the easy joke, the forced copy of the competition formula. Factors that prevented the narrative from this film to breathe, stupefying the purposes of the different characters, as if the ""story"" was cooked by too many hands, preventing it from flowing naturally. And yes, the CGI effects are under-cooked too often. And one has to wonder whether the re-shoots were worth it. If the resources, would not have been better used to polish the technical aspects of this film, than to pursue the magic sauce of levity. We will never know, without basis for comparison. Still, there are good moments in this film. The team works well together. There is a visible and pleasant chemistry between the characters. Cyborg was the most pleasant surprise, the comedian flash was funny most of the time, and the Grunge Aquaman was more than eye candy.Batman and Wonder Woman are the pillars of this story. And Superman. not because of the actor's fault, incorporates the best and worst of this film. For every good moment, follows visual noise or narrative inconsistency. In short, if you want to see superheroes fighting, or making meaningless jokes, this movie was made for you. If you belong to a more demanding audience, there is a lot in this movie that leaves some bitter taste in the mouth. Personally I liked the characters, the cinematography (mostly). Did not like: The story, The frenetic pacing, fuzzy special effects. Squeezing all this together. I give 6.5 points out of 10","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

The problem I have is, I think too much of the movie was left on the cutting room floor. Yes I know it was a 2 hour movie, but just like Suicide Squad there were scenes in the movie trailers that were not in the finished film. Too much was missing from the story, it was choppy, and rushed. Yes I understand most people do not want to spend 3 hours at a movie, and long movies tend to slow down the action, but this is done at the expense of character development, and a comprehensive and cohesive story. I can only hope that they add in all the scenes, that we didn't get to see on the Blu-ray. As usual they were so close to an awesome movie with the DCEU. Is it worth seeing: Definitely Could it have been much better: DefinitelyThe next few days will tell, I truly hope the movie is a huge success, but with the reviews and ratings so far, and with the huge budget, reshoots, and mustache wipes, it will likely squeak by, at best.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

What marvel did was that they gave us a proper insight to their characters with a briliant and connected chain of events. They started with Iron Man and gave us a big showdown in a form of Endgame. We knew the Avengers. We could sympathize with them. We all knew what they were fighting for. We knew what all of them went through and what led to the final battle. Their actions and betrayals were somehow justified, credit goes to the studios obviously.Justice League should've been DC's final showdown because they started so well with Man of Steel. I am one of the biggest comic book fanatics and even I wasn't excited for this movie. Nobody knows what went wrong with that. It was so predictable, dreary, and dragged. There was no character development. Bad comic timing followed by cringeworthy dialogues and action sequences.
How many times do we have to make them realize this simple fact that BATMAN IS NOT GOOFY. Also, Ezra Miller is a great actor but he was truly horrible as Flash. As a comic fan and most of y'all will agree, Flash is goofy BUT badass at the same time. He is not an ameteur and a dumb superhero who has no idea what he is doing.In my opinion, they rushed into this. I think the following movies should've been released before they did Justice League and also in the same order:
1. Man of Steel
2. Batman Solo Movie (included teaser of Flash)
3. Wonder Woman (included teaser of Aquaman 'cause flashpoint.. well)
4. Batman v. Superman (could've been much better but I still loved it. Included teaser of Justice League but not in a way that happened in the actual movie.)
5. Flash Solo Movie
6. Aquaman Solo Movie
7. Man of Steel 2
8. JUSTICE LEAGUEI think they needed atleast 7 movies for a proper character development but, well, studios weren't paying attention to the viewers. Disappointed. I hope they will make it up to the fans with Snyder Cut.
Fingers crossed!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

So as everyone knows, Justice League has been getting more than bad reviews, like many others I also don't understand why. It is only a movie after all. Enjoy it regardless of what's not good.The reason this movie has been getting bad reviews is because of the weak CGI in many places/scenes, this isn't hard to spot, even because of the many re shoots that took place months after filming finished, there really shouldn't be CGI that looks ten years old and basically like your watching a video game, with a budget of ¬£300 million you should have the best CGI possible. Another reason the movie got bad reviews is because of the film feeling rushed due to it originally being almost 3 hours long, to cut 50 or so minutes off of the run time isn't too clever as the result is every scene feeling rushed and only a few minutes long, personally I believe it needed to be two and a half hours long. I think this is the biggest negative, hopefully there will be an extended edition when released on DVD.Steppenwolf isn't the worst villain of all time as many are saying, he at least has more than a few scenes where he is intimidating and threatening, okay he is your average villain who want's to take over the world but you do fear him and I believe he fits the movie just fine. Whether or not DC/WB's should have took the Loki approach from Avengers Assemble and have a human actor instead of all CGI is anyone's guess, I had no problem with the villain although it was all CGI, people who are saying they should have had the most powerful villain first, this is more a taster of things to come and gets you in the spirit of things.I will say that the marketing for the movie wasn't the best, movie posters only featured 5 characters and no Superman in sight, cast interviews where the actors got told to say that Superman isn't coming back etc, I won't spoil anything for anyone who is yet to see it, not that it is a spoiler anyway but no one in this world for one second believed that DC's most iconic character would stay dead, terrible promoting in an amateur way, it might of been better to just promote Superman in your movie as he is your most iconic character.The actors are spot on with their roles, you always get great performances from Gadot, Affleck and Cavill as they have played their respective roles for 3/4 times now, I don't believe there are a better three actors to play these roles and one can only hope that Affleck stays on as currently it looks like he want's out of playing Batman, also Cavill is only signed up for one more Superman appearance, either in a Man of Steel 2 or another Justice League, not sure who else you can find to play these iconic roles, Gadot is I believe signed on for a sequel to Wonder Woman and I hope she stays on for years to come, same as Affleck and Cavill. Fisher as Cyborg, Momoa as Aquaman and Miller as The Flash all have their characters down to a tea and their performances are of high standard, it really does feel as though you have known these new characters for a long time just as you have known The Avengers for the last ten years or so. You also wan't to see a solo Flash movie, a solo Cyborg movie and it makes you look forward to Aquaman being released in 2018. You don't see much of Irons as Alfred or J.K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon but the latter hopefully will have more scenes in the sequel or the rumoured solo Batman movie, also Adams as Lois is also underused and only appears in a few scenes.Lastly, as it currently stands, Justice League is struggling at the box office and a sequel looks unlikely, hopefully it keeps making as much money as possible as there is an end credit scene that potentially sets up a potentially amazing sequel, to not see that come to fruition will be a huge shame. It's going to be interesting to see what DC/WB's do next with these great characters and what direction they go in.Justice League has a few problems yes, is it a perfect movie? no, but it is an immensely entertaining movie that keeps you hooked from start to finish with it's rich/iconic characters and fine actors, okay, it's your standard plot but this will not be the last time you will wan't to see The Justice League United, here's to a Justice League 2 and to hopefully an ultimate edition on DVD. DC/WB's do Justice to The Justice League.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The lowest possible rating means it's one of the worst movies you ever saw in your life, and in this case that means you almost never watch movies or you're just an annoying little prick that thinks he knows everything better. Don't get me wrong, everyone is entitled to his opinion but please just stay fair. Justice League doesn't deserve a 10 star rating, far from, but also not a 1 star rating. I wanted some easy entertainment, and that's what I always want when watching a superhero movie, and that's exactly what I got. It doesn't matter if it is a Marvel or a DC superhero, I enjoy both if the movie is okay. Putting the Detective Comics superheroes Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, AquaMan and Flash together in a battle against Steppenwolf is to me a nice concept for a story. The CGI's were what to expect with such a high budget. The cast was also okay even if I'm not a big fan of Ben Affleck. Gal Gadot on the other hand is candy for the eye. So after all this said, yes there are better superhero movies, even much better, but Justice League is certainly not the worst movie ever like some grumpy people on here wants to make you believe. It's worth watching if you like some easy entertainment and you like superheroes and vilains.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

If I will critique something is not the actors, the directors, the thousands of people making the actual movie, the mustache BUT the movie executives that has no clue how to stop sticking their nose where is not called for. They need to let the directors and creators to make the movie they want not subject to a 2 hour time constrain. Justice League is a Fun movie, it has some really great scenes between the heroes an hoped to open doors to upcoming films.

He and WonderWoman recruits meta-humans and other people with abilities like Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg. It's a pretty non-linear plot and ain't complicated with multiple story lines like BvS.The core of the movie is the actors, everybody has done it perfectly, especially Gal Gadot's Charisma, she just mesmerizes everybody with her presence. Ezra Miller as Flash is just like the comic book character joking around giving a light atmosphere to the movie. Batman's character arc is the most important thing how he changes after superman sacrifices his life for humans and now is a less darker version and doesn't kill criminals or brands them. Aquaman and Cyborg are honourable mentions. Amy Adams has the least role. That was a let down comparing to MoS and BvS.The background music isn't up to the mark and you won't be humming it after you come out of the theater and Elfman used old themes to give it a vintage effect. Nothing compared to Han Zimmer and Junkie XL .Cinematography is good, but not as good as Larry Long's in the prequel.The script has many one-liners, it's a different approach from the dark tone of the DCEU movies. So it's a transitional phase.The only con will be that there isn't much element of surprise for Fans. And the pace of the movie is too fast, you won't have anything to remember to geek about in this 2hr movie.The movie has many goosebumps inducing scenes and crowd going bonkers, you will lose your voice shouting and cheering if you watch with fans.If you want to watch the movie to get entertained, this is the right movie for you. If you expect satisfaction as a Zack Snyder fan, this isn't the movie, you would certainly miss his vision of DCEU. And regarding 37% Rotten Tomatoes score, it's not the official one, Leading Critic said he never posted his review and Town Tomatoes just took it without his permission. One critic's 2.5 rating was placed in rotten category and it's just pure injustice people targeting Snyder movies.RANT ABOUT WB AND JOSS WHEDONThis review won't be complete without this rant. Zack Snyder completed 80% of the movie and asked Joss Whedon to complete the movie as he had to deal with a personal tragedy. Approaching Joss Whedon was the first mistake, he included some lame, ridiculous scenes that ruined the characters like Lois Lane and Martha Kent. Second mistake was WB forcing Zack Snyder to cut 45 mins from the movie, the same happened with BvS and ultimate edition turned out to be a misunderstood masterpiece, it's not right production company inferring with an artist's freedom.All we can do is wait for the director's cut and watch the movie the way it was intended to. And please stop the negativity based on the biased group of critics called Rotten Tomatoes. Just watch the movie and decide for yourself.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Honestly the plot is terrible, we've seen this story line to many times. I feel like nowadays all superhero movies have to be about saving the earth. The plot was very simple, there was noting special about it, it doesn't stand out at all.The villain was also a big letdown, there absolutely nothing unique about Steppenwolf, I mean he could've been amazing, but he was just boring, his motif was the same as any over powered villain, he just doesn't bring out anything scary or amazing, he's just boring.The one thing I did like where the references and the easter egg's, it gave me a little excitement that DC will have a brighter future for there next films. Being a fan of the comics I was really hoping that they would follow the Injustice story line, I mean that is one of the greatest story line's ever released and since they have all the rights to their characters it could be possible.That's another thing. I feel like the character's were to rushed, there was no feeling, in the short time Justice Leagues was able to make impact for the characters backstories, but it just wasn't the same as Wonder Woman. I really felt like they should've released the solo films first. Because The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg just didn't really have any feelings for them. Justice League felt like a really rushed film only focusing on my making money. With a 300 million budget they definitely should've been capable of more.It also just feels like a mirror of Marvel. DC fanboys always talk about how their universe is so much darker, but put it next to any Marvel movie and it will seem exactly the same. Some of the jokes seemed forced, never thought Zack was they type of guy into comedy, but speaking of Zack, it really didn't seem like his type of film. Apparently there was 5 hours of footage, but it most of it got cut. Of course to make it a film. You can see that from the trailer, there was a lot of scenes that weren't in there at all. WB really just needs the director to let his vision flow.Overall the film can be enjoyable while watching, but after it's done and you've collected your thoughts you'll just think of it as a d√©ja vu. It was pretty disappointing for me, because the film had potential. I know there's a lot of positive reviews, but if your going into the theater expecting another BvS or SS then you'll think the movie was amazing. Honestly all the 9-10 stars or 1-4 stars are a lie, its not complete trash, but it fails to deliver something to the fans and the wider audience, with that being said I feel like critics are a little harsh on DC.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Although I'd prefer to see the traditional versions of heroes, I liked the changed Aquaman, with a more powerful and with a badass looks and attitude. There was not much development of the character, but we all know him and he is goingo to have his own solo movie, so thats not a major problem. IMHO, Cyborg was not a choice that made sense for a JLA origin movie. He is originally a Teen Titans character. They managed to make some good sense for his being there, though. As for the Flash, he is just too differente from the character I grew up with as a DC fan. Too young and clumsy and clearly effeminate. Not that there's anything wrong with a gay character, just with the turning of Barry Allen into one.So overall it was a fun experience. But not yet the DC movie that does justice to JL.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The digital effects look like they are something out of The Mummy Returns. There is essentially no character development, which would be fine if these were all firmly established characters, but they aren't. Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg are all making their first movie appearances. The Superman that we see here bears very little resemblance to the character of the same name from Man of Steel and Batman vs. Superman.DC/Warner Brothers seem to have taken previous criticism of the previous movie being too dark and joyless to heart and has horribly over-corrected. There are lots of jokes to be found, most of them not good, in my opinion, though sense of humor is highly subjective.Gal Gadot is good but there's nothing on the page for her to work with. Henry Cavil is like he always is, which to me comes off as stiff. Affleck seems like he's increasingly desperate to remove himself from this series and can't be bothered to even really try. I've never been a fan of Ezra Miller in general, and his portrayal of Peter Parker... I mean, Barry Allen, does nothing to change that. I don't understand how it's possible for Jason Momoa to be this uninteresting, as big and magnetic as he is in other things, he comes off as completely uninteresting here.I can't help but feel like Warner Brothers were worried about releasing another critical disaster like Batman v. Superman and settled for making a boring movie instead of a terrible one. Personally, I don't know if that was the better choice or not but you can easily give this one a pass.And with this, I am officially done caring about the DCEU as a collective entity. The Wonder Woman sequel is almost certainly worth checking out. The Flash and Cyborg solo films? I'd say they may not even get made at this point, considering the once-again disappointing box office numbers. Hypothetical Future Justice League movies? Not without and serious, fundamental course correction.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

It's fun, it's action-packed and at times, funny when you least expect it, which is the best kind of funny. It's better than any other DCEU movies that have come before, not only that it seems be treading on new ground than the other DCEU films. But that's a good compliment, saying that it was just better than its predecessors. In fact, it's an understatement. It's unlike the previous movies in every way expect in its flaws which we, the audience, has grown to tolerate in this kind of movies. It's unabashed in its intention to serve to our liking. Perhaps, for this reason, the critics are barring the movie, for not taking an original and creative stance. Batman, as he always did since The Dark Knight trilogy, shined in portrayal, although, at the middle of the film, there are some traces of the infamous 'BvS decision making' still left in him. As the film progresses to the end, he redeems himself and we see this progression, his progression, to the decisions he makes later in the end; we see the emotional detection, if one would call it that. The princess, Wonder Woman was her usual best self. There was a little insinuation of romance from Batman (from Alfred, to be accurate), but that was not reflected back from Wonder Woman. The new kids on the block are well constructed too. Maybe there was enough character development, but why should one care for such pristine things like proper character development in a superhero movie. Also, how does one get around to do proper character development for people aren't human, or entirely human. There is no reference point, there is no relatability, to begin with.And action, as good as it was, in the moments of glory, was also a tad over the top at times. The Mysceria (I never could spell it or pronounce it.) fight scene was mesmerizing in execution. The 'change in costumes' of the Amazonians was exactly exploitation of women's sexuality because we barely see it. The Amazonians are always on the move and one will be occupied with what they will proceed to do, to properly notice the shortened costumes.The biggest flaw of the movie is how easy the protagonists have it. The answers, all of them, come at so fast a pace that the film seems to be zooming to the end, and to say that the villain was weak is not only a character assessment but also a literal one. The villain, who is all so powerful throughout the film is defeated in a matter of minutes. The evil plan is the same too, the destruction of this planet or that.The music was underwhelming as in its effects on the audience is ephemeral. It's good for the moment, but not as good upon revisits.It is fun is the final verdict. See it if you want to have fun.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Given the poor to mixed reviews of all other DCEU movies aside from 'Wonder Woman', the initial critical response made me feel even more dread at the fact that DC cannot get this franchise rolling. However, if you are a superhero fan, throw that critical response out of the window. Listen to the comic book guys, the YouTube superhero vloggers and GO SEE THIS MOVIE.Yes, objectively, the movie does suffer from pacing issues and the main villain is under-developed but the Justice League members are wonderfully brought to life. Every single character in the league has so much personality for you to like and each character has enough space for development in their upcoming movies, it's intriguing and exciting. I would also like to contradict the growing opinion that Ben Affleck's Batman and Ray Fisher's Cyborg are weak. I completely disagree with this, Batman has gone through a significant change and they have moved him far closer to a Batman we might expect but he still has a lot of room to grow as well. Cyborg is shown to be quite troubled but very cool and possibly has the most intriguing function of the entire team. Everyone loves the Flash, Aquaman and Wonder Woman but my highlight for the movie is the change in Superman, he is completely different which is so refreshing and his scenes and chemistry with the Flash are just great to watch and you can't help but smile.Admittedly, my score is a little inflated and on the current theatrical release it should be closer to a 7 or 8, but the reason I gave it higher was because I believe this is not the final version of this movie we shall see. The two main issues of the movie, mentioned previously, can quite simply be solved by giving characters more screen- time and dialogue. Everybody is expecting there to be a huge extension to this movie given the Warner Bros. mandate of the 2-hour restriction. This means that there could potentially be huge amounts of film set to come into this movie, from the trailers alone, that will develop the characters more and explain the plot in more detail. I also have confidence in this because they have done this before with BvS. I hated the theatrical release it was such a poor production and the editing guys messed up. They have taken a lot out of this one too but have not spoiled the movie this time, thank goodness, so it's certain there will be good footage to come. Finally, Zack Snyder and his team do like to write a complete story, it was arguably even a bit convoluted and contained too many layers and symbolism in BvS, so I am certain any kinks are ironed out in the DVD release.I love the Marvel movies to bits, but I am more of a DC guy and I desperately want this franchise to start moving in the right direction and I think this movie signals a change to a more character driven universe. I actually enjoyed the tone of 'Man of Steel' and 'BvS: Ultimate Edition', and the approach of making the characters experience a journey of self-discovery and creating a universe where the superheroes are constantly being challenged by the people they are protecting, it makes it more real. I think the theme of most if not all of the DCEU movies was going to be ""where do I fit in the world"", or ""what is my role in all of this"" and that defining of self was going to drive these character on stories of discovery. This movie shifts that emphasis to be more about the personalities the characters already have and how they can bring life to a story. This is a very Marvel approach to writing, so whether you like that or not the movie certainly benefits from giving these characters room to breathe and not suffocating them in dreary personal pressures. There were still seeds of the original theme in this movie, a major part of Barry Allen's personality is that he is very awkward, Aquaman's life is without direction and Cyborg is somewhat of a recluse; so they can return to this theme nicely going forward but this movie took the right approach for what the franchise needed.Overall guys, you will enjoy these characters despite the pacing issues. If you are new to DC comics characters it might help to read up a little on the characters they are bringing in to help in the immediate term but I am certain the DVD release will complete this movie for how it was meant to be and improve on an already thrilling and exciting movie experience.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

DC has learnt some lessons.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3861992/?ref_=tt_urv","Troy_Campbell","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22164449/?ref_=tt_urv","18 November 2017","Playing catch-up in the comic-book cinematic universe race (Disney's Avengers and 20th Century Fox's X-Men franchises still way ahead), Warner Brothers' assembly of their most prized DC characters has had an arduous road to release. Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were critical disasters, Ben Affleck has quickly reneged on his long-term involvement as this universe's Batman, and director Zack Snyder departed before principal production finished due to unfortunate personal circumstances. All that aside, Snyder‚Äîwith the help of Joss Whedon who was brought in to complete production‚Äîhas carved out a blockbuster that has seemingly learnt from some of the mistakes that bogged down BvS. First, the tone has been lightened, most directly through the introduction of quip-happy team members Flash (Ezra Miller) and Aquaman (Jason Mamoa); the former's social awkwardness and the latter's carefree swagger adding a nice counterbalance to the core trio's sincerity. With his super-speed depicted on screen via awesome slow-mo, Flash is also gifted the best action sequences. The standout set piece, a Superman-Flash confrontation, is an exhilarating skirmish that ranks among the best of the year. Unfortunately, the Chernobyl-set climax is the epitome of what plagues these DC movies: overwrought green-screen battles that are messily edited, sloppily shot and virtually indecipherable from a visual standpoint. Why they keep persisting with such a gloomy aesthetic and murkily choreographed action is anyone's guess. The villain is a tad bland too, the end-of-world obsessed Steppenwolf (played in motion capture by Ciarin Hinds) offering very little outside of the usual bad guy tropes. On the flip side, Henry Cavill's Superman is the coolest he's ever been, Gal Gadot is still charmingly kick-ass as Wonder Woman and Ben Affleck broods the hell out of his aging, grizzled Batman. More time and effort has clearly been put into crafting a more cohesive, interesting story too; the surprisingly short runtime (enforced by Warner Brothers) driving the creative team to strip back superfluous narrative elements and focus on the character relationships that propel the main plot along. Somehow, despite the odds stacking up against it and its many flaws, Justice League delivers a decent superhero romp. There's just enough humour and charisma to give the longevity of the DC cinematic universe a glimmer of hope.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

My rating, however, is based on MY OWN predetermined view of what THIS film should and should not be. With that in mind, despite the numerous trials and tribulations that it faced in its production (switching directors at a late stage in its post-production, regardless of who took the helm and their previous work, will always result in a slightly less coherent film) this is still a perfectly watchable film with moments of genuine hilarity, emotion and intensity. Personally I am sad that we will never get to see the version of this film envisaged by Zack Snyder, as Whedon's input is definitely noticeable. Nevertheless, the result is a family friendly superhero flick, which is what Warner Bros. and Snyder and co were seeking in the first place. For me this is a 10/10. I understand why the critics might bash it, as they are reviewing it against THEIR OWN predetermined criteria, however I just hope that fan love for this franchise shines through the negativity and keeps the so called DCEU alive. Regarding the cast, Affleck is Batman, and while he does not have the same intensity as in Batman v Superman (something which I loved) he is more than qualified to deliver in these films. Gal Gadot: nothing needs to be said for her, stunning and impactful as we all know her to be. Ray Fisher makes an excellent Cyborg, delivering the emotional turmoil through which he suffers and the brighter moments perfectly. Jason Momoa: well lets just say it's going to be a long wait for his solo Aquaman outing, he's a force of nature. Ezra Miller is the Flash, I'll leave that at that. Last, but certainly not least, Henry Cavill has delivered the ultimate modern day Superman. While he too faced a share of difficulties in the additional photography, not least because of his contractual obligations to Paramount, he manages to steal the scenes he is in and it provides a great conclusion to the character arc started in 2011 with Man of Steel.What it comes down to IS whether we fans choose to see all that is good with the DCEU, as opposed to drowning in the negativity of others who purely want to bash the film. As the film itself shows, we can strive to be better - and as fans we should.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

I loved it! I came into this movie expecting hot trash but I enjoyed myself a-lot.
The Good.
I would say the Justice League (the characters) were really well written. I like Batfleck, Wonder Woman Flash Supes and Flash a lot. They have solid chemistry and the writing is solid overall for them. I only don't like Cyborg as he's kinda bland but I excuse it as. well his stories kinda depressing.
My main gripe with this film is the villain and Super Man's power.
Okay so this movie is a Mcguffen chase okay fine. SO WHY CAN THIS VILLAIN TELEPORT? It takes away so much potential since he can just zoop away I mean so much tension is most it goes against the film.
An super man. Ignoring horrible CGI stache I think the problem is he is so over powered. What's the point of having the JLA if he can wipe the floor with them?
Flash Batman and Wonder Woman could wipe the floor with him let's be real.
Aquaman's cool.
If you can look over the CGI I think you can have fun with this movie as Batman and Flash have good chemistry.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's not bad or great, and while there were a lot of hiccups leading up to the release, including $25MM in reshoots, a change of directors and writers, and a time crunch to get the CGI done before the film's November 17th release date, I'd say it's a movie worth seeing. It definitely doesn't have the feel of when Marvel brought The Avengers together for the first time on the big screen, but it is a step-up from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad. Let's start with the pros. The characters. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) steals the show (as she did this summer in her solo movie debut), The Flash (Ezra Miller) is the comedic hooligan of the group, Aquaman (Jason Momoa) is the BAMF and King of the Ocean, and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) is the brains. While the character development for 3 new characters is tough to achieve when making a 2 hour film, I think that the movie does a good job in regards to providing enough back story on each character to give a sense of clarity for the viewer. Another pro is the lighter tone of the movie compared to Batman v Superman. You can clearly see where Joss Whedon picked up after Zack Snyder stepped down. Whedon is a mastermind and it was great to see his comedic take on film come to life in Justice League. And now the cons. The movie's plot is just like any other superhero team up film. Villain comes to Earth and needs to collect the ""doomsday"" machine. Villain collects said machine. Villain inevitably loses to the superhero group after the group goes through a loss/devastating blow. It is predictable and we've seen in many times over (The Avengers, Batman v Superman, The Avengers: Age of Ultron, Suicide Squad). Besides the predictable plot, it's upsetting to see a movie with a ~$300MM budget butcher the CGI. You can clearly tell where they fell short due to the Joss Whedon reshoots, and while it could've been better, it just wasn't up-to-par like most Marvel movies. For anyone who is a fan of DC, there are plenty of Easter eggs that set up future films.Like I said, it's a pretty good movie that's worth the watch if you're a fan of the genre.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

There's only so much social justice angst and guilt and preaching about how we're ruining the environment and I can take.Ezra Miller as the Flash tried hard for comic relief, but was trapped in a millennial pajama boy character.Ray Fisher did well as Cyborg. He played it straight - traumatized man, who believes himself a monster, and takes the opportunity to allow others who are different into his heart.Gal Gadot was resplendent. Her energy lights up the screen, and she's the perfect Wonder Woman.Henry Cavill finally got over being the annoying, ennui-ridden Superman. He was all Jesus and hope - sunshine and rainbows. I don't think I could have tolerated another moody, conflicted Superman.Jason Momoa was by far the best thing about this movie: relaxed, fun, intense, and hot all at the same time.And now they're doing a BATFLECK MOVIE???

The formation of the team has undergone some changes over the years, but for this film version we have the meeting of Superman, Batman, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Flash and the Cyborg. In 'Batman v Superman', in addition to the Holy Trinity which had a much greater prominence, we quickly glimpsed Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg, indicating that this would be the team of this first version of the League in theaters.
Once again, who heads this meeting is Zack Snyder, one of the main creative minds in Warner's latest films. This time, the script is under the responsibility of Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon. Interestingly, Whedon was primarily responsible for adapting the first two meetings of the Avengers for cinemas, a rival publisher of DC. The invitation for the screenwriter / director to stay with one of those responsible for the script had a clear objective: to try to make the story a little less obscure and with more humor, in addition to having the artist's ability to integrate different worlds into a unique and cohesive.
In Justice League, Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) assemble a team of superheroes composed of Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) to face the catastrophic threat of SteppeWolf (voice of Ciar√°n Hinds) and his army of Parademons that try to conquer and remake the Earth through the combined energies of the Maternal Boxes, which are separated and hidden in places around the world.
The beginning of the film shows a world that has lost hope and is still shaken by Superman's death. People have created memorials for the superhero and his memory is everywhere. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane) continue to keep in touch, but still suffer from the loss of Clark and have difficulty moving forward. In the midst of this, Batman investigates the rise of Parademons. Batman tries to deal with the guilt of Superman's death, while constantly dealing with his own mortality and humanity in a team of superheroes. Feeling that a greater evil is about to appear at any moment, he needs to contact Diana Prince, who continues to defend people and fight for justice, to meet with other metahumans like Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman to face an evil bigger.
The first twenty minutes are dedicated to showing a little more about these last two and the recruitment of both for the Justice League. If Barry Allen, the Flash, accepts right away, enthusiastic. The little thing shown about Flash is that he keeps moving and does not stop at any job, that his father is in prison for killing his mother, but that he has always defended his innocence. Unfortunately, this question is not addressed during the film and the scenes only serve to situate the character to the audience. Victor Stone (Cyborg) has a great IQ, had a football scholarship at the University of Gotham and was considered dead after an accident in which he participated with his father, leaving his body modified like a machine. He is recruited by Wonder Woman. Arthur Curry, Aquaman, who wants some peace of mind and refuses Bruce Wayne's first contact. He only joined the team after Atlantis suffered an attack and made him realize that something more dangerous was about to happen. There is also no further explanation of his past, perhaps why an upcoming adaptation of Aquaman is right, which will tell his story in more detail.Unlike the Marvel Avengers, in which almost all of the main characters had solo films before the team meeting in the first Avengers film, here the script has to waste time introducing three main characters from the team. The script, unfortunately, ends up showing them in a superficial and generic way, as if it were an obligation before inserting them in the battles with the Holy Trinity. In this respect, Warner / DC lacks a little more care when dealing with characters from its main group. It is necessary for the public to care, create bonds with those superheroes who are willing to sacrifice there to save the Earth. The only one that does better in this task is Flash, the main comic relief of the film, responsible for practically all the moments of humor in the film, and there were even a few. Aquaman also carries a charisma and presence of scene that set the stage well for his solo film. Cyborg, due to the accident, is still in a phase of denial and does not see his powers as a gift, but as a disgrace that ended his life. Only gradually does he realize that he can be useful against something greater.
The Justice League members' first team collaboration was at an abandoned facility in the Port of Gotham, where they face off against enemies looking to find out where the Maternal box kept with the men was. These are breathtaking scenes in the underground, including the powerful Nightcrawler, another toy created by Batman. However, they feel they need Superman's help to defeat the enemy and devise a plan to resurrect him using one of the Maternal Boxes. Halfway through the film, we see this plan in action and the consequences of Superman's return. This was an expected moment, after all, the Justice League without Superman is totally uncharacterized. The question was how they would get him to return and the solution found until it is consistent with the plot and does not sound so appealing. Too bad that after meeting his great loves, Superman soon has to return to active duty to help save the world once again. The Man of Steel, who has always been a problematic hero, since the fact that he is practically unbeatable harms the creation of threatening situations, here it appears in an imposing way. The hero's return is one of the highest points of the production.
Unlike previous films that did not know how to balance the action so well with the development of the characters, this one does a little better on the mission. Snyder does well in what he knows how to do better again, that is, the creation of striking images, whether in the scenes where Batman appears in the shadows in his intimidating poses or even in the creative battle scenes. This time, we have good scenes scattered throughout the projection, with special emphasis on the scene in which Diana saves people from a group of reactionary terrorists, or even the entire sequence of the reappearance of the Steppe Wolf on the Paradise Island of Amazonas. Once again, the Amazons show their value, their courage and render great action scenes against the Steppe Wolf and his Parademons. Even flashbacks showing the unity of a unified army that included Olympic Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, humans and Green Lanterns that offered the Steppe Wolf the first defeat in the past. We must also highlight the scenes of the theft of one of the Maternity Boxes in Atlantis, introducing us to that underwater world for the first time, even if for a short time and the final climax of the village in Russia, when the entire League gathers to try to defeat the threat of the Wolf of the Steppe. Unfortunately, this last act is all shot on green screen and the artificiality of the scenes gets to bother, despite the visual being quite interesting as a whole.It is worth mentioning the good photography work by Fabian Wagner and the production designer by Patrick Tatopoulos. Composer Danny Elfman returns to work on a DC film 25 years after Batman: Return. He does a really interesting job, mainly for putting together his score for Batman, Rupert Gregson-Williams for Wonder Woman, and John Williams' classic theme for Superman.
One of the biggest problems of the 'League' is an extremely convenient script, where everything is easily conquered, if the question is to convince Ciborg, this happens in a common way, if the group has to go after Superman's body, it comes without difficulties , and so on, as if nothing defied those heroes. Justice League surrenders to very poorly thought out crutches, such as a series of expository dialogues, some flashbacks and a huge number of catch phrases, in a search for easy acceptance by its audience.
The film is visually compelling, but it fails to treat some of its characters in a shallow way. Following a little of the Marvel formula in the presence of Joss Whedon in the script, there is more room for humor and scenes that are a little clearer and less dark at different times. And making the movie fun at one time or another does not erase bad narrative development. Something that still has a problematic performance by Ezra Miller that always seems in a different tone than the rest of the film. Or Ben Affleck's non-existent comic timing, transforming Batman Vs Superman's stern Batman into something a little lighter. Incidentally, Whedon is one of the film's screenwriters and also directed part of the filming, after Zack Snyder left because of a personal tragedy. The director's credit, however, goes only to Snyder, while Whedon shares the script with Chris Terrio. In fact, Snyder's absence in the final stage of post-production is felt. Known for composing great action scenes and possessing a rare skill with this segment, the director seems not to be there to avoid bad moments of computer graphics (removal of Cavill's mustache) and others of dubious taste (construction of SteppeWolf).
'Justice League' is sometimes lost in two worlds traveling between the dark and the basic humorous clich√©. It is a movie with some flaws, but very fun that will delight any fan of the genre. In the end, we have two post-credit scenes, one of which is really important that indicates the emergence of the Legion of Evil, rival to the Justice League, created by Lex Luthor, who had just escaped from the Arkham madhouse. It is essential that the viewer remains in the room until the last second. Justice League is not the perfect movie, but it is a light of hope in the DC universe.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

But I was certainly surprised. Justice League feels natural; it has the Zack Snyder visuals with the crisp Joss Whedon editing to maintain the perfect pacing and energy for the comic book spectacle that is this film.Justice League is certainly more lighthearted than its predecessors, but it still maintains a tasteful amount of seriousness to it when needed in the storyline. While Man of Steel and Batman v Superman focused on the realistic societal aspects of a world with superheroes, which I think was one of the strengths of the DC films, this societal realism is not as prevalent in Justice League. This would make sense, given that this is literally a superhero team that's getting together; society is less of a concern when they know it's in danger. Also, having too much emphasis on societal realism has shown to hurt the pacing of the films, as noted in previous examples.Ultimately, the film doesn't feel like it was trying to copy a Marvel formula, and shows DC managed to find the formula that has worked for them. The storyline itself is a basic superhero team versus big baddie and nothing special, but various moments in the story help flesh out the characters and add a fun spin here and there with the skeletal outline to help further develop the relationship between the team members. Nothing in the story feels ""forced."" The writing/dialogue is decent and characterizes our heroes perfectly to create a unique dynamic between each one. Standout performances are Ezra Miller as Barry Allen and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman (as always).This film is by no means perfect and certainly has flaws. The film can be visually tiring with the Zack Snyder brand of special effects and CGI backgrounds, and the fight scenes can be repetitive (not nearly as long as Man of Steel, however). The character development can also sometimes be lacking with the supporting characters, as per Zack Snyder style. More can also certainly have been explored with the main characters, especially with Superman and Aquaman's stories that are all but briefly mentioned and minimally explored. But these flaws only apply to minor aspects of the film's overall arc for the group as a team, and don't impact the enjoyment you'll likely get out of this film.Justice League is, at the end of the day, an ode to the comic book fans. The film is littered with references to the DC Universe that'll make any fan excited, and be sure to watch out for two post credits scenes. It's been a while since I felt this excited and hyped for the future of a franchise (i.e. pre-Avengers Marvel films), and fellow superhero fans are certainly in for a treat for this entertaining thrill ride of a film.7.5/10","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

They tried marvel movie beats, it failed. They tried the marvel all star director, it failed. They tried to get lightning to strike the same place twice, and we as DC fans got betrayedIf this was just a Joss Whedon guilty pleasure, I'd still be fine with it.

The film had started well and I very much enjoyed the chemistry between the members of the team to which i felt was the best feature of the film, i think Joss had taken his notes from Avengers and showed these to Snyder. Affleck looked very uncomfortable portraying batman (After 1 and a half appearances) and quite exhausted trying to carry the team, i have read other reviews and i agree that he lacked charisma but he's still one my favourite actors to play batman (maybe my favourite). One of the problems with this film is that if you saw Wonder Woman, you may consider this a step down when you compare it to the dialogue and action sequences. Every member of the team had their own uniqueness to them and it did add to their chemistry but i just couldn't help think this is just a rip off from 2012's Avengers. If you watch this from start to finish you may even see similarities in scene sequences (starting with introducing the villain to recruiting the team and then the finishing fight scene) if not a direct mirror of the avengers film. I Personally felt Warner Bros panicked and brought in Whedon to write something in the hopes of bettering his original creation, it's down to public opinion if he failed or not.I had also hoped that additional characters such as Gordon, Alfred and especially Mera (portrayed by the awesome eye candy that is Amber Heard) had got more screen time, i was quite let down at that but i guess it was due to the festering rush to get this film complete. The main issue with DC is that they rushed this whole franchise, there was literally no room for character development, only WW was the exception due to the individual film (you can count BvS also), does anyone not wonder why 2 DC films were released 6 months apart from each-other? it just screams ""lets try and catch up with marvel 10 years in the making"". Regardless, I still felt this film was entertaining and it's action sequences were above average, Steppenwolf as a villain was a let down, i am not going to give anything away but the word ""Ultron"" comes to mind (again, thanks Joss). At no point was i quaking in my boots thinking the world would end, there was no sense of panic at all. It was a desperate plea to bring in bigger and badder villains who aren't worth the ink they're printed on. Overall, if you're looking for a superhero film which is action fuelled and enjoyable, this is up there on the list with the likes of Avengers, Civil War and Deadpool. However if you watch this as a die- hard DC comics fan, you may be 50/50 on this, maybe even disappointed but it depends on what you expect and what you want from these films nowadays. It still doesn't take away from the fact that this will be a box office hit, but be warned, when leaving the screen, you may find yourself feeling confused in terms of where this franchise is going in terms of direction. Even though I liked the film, I have never had one play on my mind as to what they are trying to do here.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The culmination of the DC Universe, that unites the beloved heroes from our childhood in... the shortest DCEU movie to date? And the least profitable one at that? What's supposed to be a grandiose milestone is just a fun, flawed and a bit forgettable movie. The one thing that JL undoubtedly succeeded in selling us the characters. I am now officialy interested in their separate solo movies,albeit their introductions feeling rushed in the midst of the whole behind-the-scenes drama. The editing room of WB probably looks like a particularly booze-fueled bar brawl right now. Good luck cleaning Wan! Speaking of chaotic wreckage, how did this CGI happen to exist? Sure, some of it looks nice, but the villain looks straight out of a PS3 game. Steppenwolf, as they continue on and on repeating his name, is just a cookie cutter threat with a few cool lines. Aliens are invading as many blockbuster scripts as planets nowadays. The pacing in the beginning is a bit frustrating, originating from shifting the focus from character to character. What truly saves this movie is the team interaction. I have always though that Affleck is okay as Batman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman has been the main driving force for DC and the new ""recruits"" are fun. Their witty banter about everyone's own corner of the world is what adds a much needed flair to the movie. You can feel that behind every character, there is the potential for a whole movie franchise to bloom.Conclusion: Enjoyable,but inelegantly underwhelming, Justice League paves the road for a lighter tone in the future of the DCEU. The characters make the journey worth travelling as their team-play breathes life into the movie. I allow myself to be pessimistically excited for future films in this shared universe. And from now on let only one director handle a project please!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Went in with EXTREMELY low expectations and I left with a smile on my face. It was the only DC movie other than Wonder Woman to have that effect on me... and let me be straight here: it was NO Wonder Woman. There is a distinct difference between the drab Snyder-verse and the lighter toned Joss Whedon-style, but thankfully it's not jarring since both Directors worked on the project.What worked: Characters. The heroes were very well played. They do feel thrown together, and origin stories are just mentioned but not explored. Wonder Woman was fantastic as usual. Batman was not a miserable SOB, and was actually fun... it made me want to see more Batfleck. Flash was funny (still #NotMyFlash). Cyborg worked better than I thought he would. Superman was FAR MORE Superman-like than ever before in this universe (still no Christopher Reeve). Aquaman was fun and I hope they get to explore him more in the future. Parademons were pretty cool... BOOM Tubes were rad. Good nods to a wider DCU.What didn't work: Character specific CGI was TERRIBLE. Steppenwolf looked bad. And for the longest time I stared at Supes thinking ""what's wrong with his face?"" when I remembered Joss Whedon re-shot Superman scenes and had to digitally remove a beard. The movie was not as ""EPIC"" as it could have been... but I think after the 3-hour movies we've been presented with, this was a much needed respite.There are 2 post-credits scenes: one is pretty fast into the end credits and is a lot of fun. Then one is at the very end and is VERY cool, even though it has someone I cannot stand in it.This movie is FAR more family friendly than the other DC movies to date as it should be. If you were going to compare universes:Wonder Woman is to Winter Soldier what Justice League is to Age of Ultron.7 out of 10.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Keep in mind I really liked MoS, LOVED BvS, and thought WW was amazing. Suicide Squad was a mistake and so does not exist.Overall: 7/10: Fun movie that you should see, but probably not in the theater.Special effects: 3/10: The special effects were often simply bad. After the great effects of BvS, MoS, and WW, these effects were actually a major downgrade. In fact, I was constantly pulled out of the action by extremely obvious CGI. Do not expect Star Wars or GotG level special effects (and even GotG had some issues with green screens being obvious). The CGI'd villain looked video game quality. Obvious CGI faces, landscapes, backgrounds, and even occasionally heroes. The Flash's lightning effects looked not much better than the TV show. I often felt like I was watching a good-looking animated movie, not a live-action movie. I did not feel like this so much with the other DC movies. It relied far too heavily on CGI landscapes in particular. I get that much of BvS (such as the main fight on the rooftop) used CGI backgrounds, but they didn't look like CGI backgrounds, and I wouldn't have guessed it except for seeing behind the scenes footage. Can't say that for Justice League. Somehow Wonder Woman often looked fake during her fights (though she was great otherwise). Warner Brothers should be embarrassed. Acceptable for maybe 2010, but not for a AAA movie in 2017 when they're competing against Marvel and Star Wars. Sometimes the effects were very good, but this almost made it worse when they became super obvious and undetailed.See it in theater?I don't regret seeing it in theater because I wouldn't have wanted to wait until DVD, and other than the special effects, I got pretty much what I expected, but sadly not what I hoped. It was a fun movie and a nice way to spend a couple hours. I recommend NOT seeing it in theater, though, because the special effects will look less jarring on a small screen. And unless you absolutely don't see the major ""twist"" coming for some reason, you're unlikely to face real spoilers.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It did not work with Suiciede Squad, and it did not work with Batman Vs Superman. The good thing about the DC characters is that we can relate to them as humans, these characters they have created are probably the worst part of this ""new"" franchise. Ben Affleck in a couple of movies after battling the most powerful aliens in the universe, will go back to fighting Joker and Harley? I do not know who writes this bad for Hollywood and who approves this! They should have kept to what we loved about the Nolan Scripts! Both Batman and Superman!

Somehow every time they achieve to make most miserable super hero movies. In fact there are many aspects to talk about why this one fails but definitely horrible CGI stands out. It is so bad I felt like watching a b-type movie and Van Damme or Chuck Norris might come out to screen in any second. Zack Snyder still lives in the era of 300 where heavy visual effects makes you believe that it's a video game rather than a movie. I won't even talk about lack of character backgrounds, boring script and bad editing. Those have already become common failures of DC movies.Even though I don't like to compare Marvel and DC yet I can't help myself. Producers have the same budget with any other Marvel movie (around $300 million) and somehow they manage to make such bad movies. I guess Marvel has got the best crew on board and there is no talented artists left to DC. Justice league is a movie about having good team to overcome obstacles. But more than that it's about having a good team to make a good movie in the first place. No doubt that it's what's missing here.","1 out of 11 found this helpful.

That being said, I've always respected DC for being different from Marvel and doing its own thing. Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice were both controversial movies, but they did have their own signature. Zack Snyder has always had the unbelievably unique ability to transfer the pages of a comic book to the silver screen beautifully and that is also evident in Justice League's intro. But with the change of directors and Whedon taking over, that signature and that dark vibe was lost. I am aware that the popular opinion is that DC movies are too dark and somber and that they have no soul. This is where I disagree. They have soul and Id say that they have even deeper character developments than many of the Marvel movies. BvS is one of the realest and most intelligent comic book movies ever created. It is by no means a perfect movie, but it is a very grown up superhero film. And this is where I give high praise to what DC has done. Somewhere along the lines Whedon tried to make this into an Avengers movie and while that is a very delightful idea, it just fell short because of the already different vibe and style of the movie that was started. He tried to change it and bring more light-heartedness to it, but that should have been done in the conception of the film, not with re-shoots and gap-fillers. Most people will say that Ezra Miller's Barry Allen was the most fun character and he brought much- needed life into Justice League, I actually thought most of his comedic lines were forced and childish. And childish is a word that I would use to describe this movie. It felt very glossy and fluffy, especially in the final act. There were funny puns and one-liners with impressive CGI fights, but there was no weight behind it. This is where I contemplated the idea that DC tried to manage their movie into something very Marvel-like, but unsuccessfully in my humble opinion. And with that being said I think that Cyborg was the true break-out star of this movie. Ray Fisher down-played his character and he did it with finesse and subtlety which worked perfectly with his tragic backstory. All-in-all I will NEVER give up on DC movies, even after stinkers like The Suicide Squad, but I really hope that they stick to their style and not try to mimic what Marvel is doing. DC, do not rush your movies...you will stumble, you will fall, but in time, you will reach your destination. In time You will accomplish wonders...","1 out of 11 found this helpful.

I had HUGE expectations since the day they announced but thanks to reviews I toned my hype down before going to watch it. Turns out, it is a REALLY ENTERTAINING film! I'll give you the pros and cons.PROS: 1)You will most likely love the characters and their new more saturated tones. (Personally LOVED WW & Flash)(But the more saturated costume tone made me fall in love with Superman, and so did the character which is being made justice)(I also might be one of the few people that like Batfleck and still I think he could've been better in this movie) 2)Fight sequences are TOP NOTCH! (if you love battles between superheroes this is a great movie to watch) (Personally my favourite parts of the movie) 3)Finally, some jokes enter the DCEU (and to me they were good and some really funny) 4)The tone is lighter but still a bit dark which I LOVED. (THANKFULLY not as light as Marvel) 5)At least the villain fights. (I read that this movie has villain problems.... and it has, BUT still not as bad problems as Marvel has) 6)It was easy to follow and not broken like BVS... BUT (read the cons pls) 7)Finally, some after-credits scenes and they are GREAT! (Some of my friends were like 'but that's a Marvel thing' and I was like, I know a hundred other franchises that have after-credits scenes) CONS: 1)At times, especially when it's a close-up, the CGI just looks terrible and cheap but I got over that. 2)I WISH it was longer than 2hrs. Definitely not enough for the characters of the JL to bloom. (They bloom but I wanted more) 3)If it was longer I feel like the story could've evolved much smoother and would probably feel less disjointed and less rushed. (I'll definitely watch the extended version) 4)The end of Steppenwolf could've been better but it was OK. 5)Superman was WAY TOO OVERPOWERED! It felt like everything was over when he returned THAT strong. 6)Danny Elfman did an OK job but let's face it. He is NOT Hans Zimmer. (Very forgettable soundtrack is the best I can do right now)This was my objective opinion about the film! Overall, for me, it was a good movie and I had a good time at the cinema. If you like DC animated JL movies then you'll probably like this movie too. It felt like watching the cartoon which I think is amazing and gave me that excitement. I think people who haven't gone to watch it should give it a chance and stop listening to critics who were clearly ready to bash it anyway. I definitely believe that it does NOT deserve that much of a low rating on RT or Metacritic. Also, if you give it a chance, they could always fix what you might not like in the next film.

On one hand were the expectations- viewing my favorite heroes on screen together was a goose-pimpling experience (give it up Marvel- Superman and Batman put together trumps all your flock). Also, after 3-4 middling ones, and one good movie, this was DC's make or break move. Marvel's big bucks is what DC was after, and true to their style, it was the movie that kind of summarized DC's Phase 1, much like The Avengers did for Marvel back in 2012. So in short, Justice League was a movie that I desperately wanted to like. All DC had to do was to dish out a coherent yet original fare, which may seem simple to imagine given the wealth of material available, but difficult to execute- imagine Suicide Squad and Batman vs Superman and you get the idea.The good news- it is a fun movie, mostly. Having two directors may have had its minuses, but it Whedon's addition surely lightened things up. Justice League picks up from where Batman vs Superman ended- with Superman's death. His death left a lasting impact- with Batman reducing his homicidal tendencies, Wonder Woman surfacing, and other metahumans stepping up. At the same time, the world is a place worse off without Superman, with people being afraid- a perfect time for parademons who feast on fear to appear, along with their master, Steppenwolf. Speaking of whom, is one of the movie's many mistakes. Bland, single track and CGI only- this guy the worst comic book villain in recent times. ""No protectors here. No Lanterns. No Kryptonian. This world will fall, like all the others""Steppenwolf is here to steal the 3 mother boxes - one each in Atlantis, Themiscyra and Metropolis, which will help him conquer the world, and terraform it (yet again, DC?) amidst a lot of Mother, Unity mumbo jumbo. In a world without Superman, Batman realizes battling such an alien threat will require a league of superheroes, and goes about assembling his team, and when the team is proved inadequate, the focus shifts to reviving Superman, who understandably, tilts the balance by waving his little finger. But not without letting each of the Justice League members know who the boss is.""I miss the days when one's biggest concern is exploding wind-up penguins.""One of the many joys of watching Justice League is looking out for the easter eggs. Some of the Old Gods feature- Zeus and Artemis, as well as a Green Lantern. Deathstroke makes an appearance, Flash and Superman race, Gorilla Grod, Penguin and Captain Cold are referenced- oh there is so much more! But the flaws are equally many too- bad CGI, inconsistent tonal shifts that is associated with two distinctly different directors, wooden acting from Affleck, and Gadot, and most importantly, poor editing. I really do not understand the 2 hour rule here, as this is a movie that could have been at-least 20 minutes longer to give some more backstory to some of the new characters. More so because it is the new characters who steal the show- nerdy Flash, macho Aquaman, and techie Cyborg. Justice League brings together heroes with a range of powers- mythology, science or as Batman would put it, money based. But unlike The Avengers, where all the heroes had already been introduced in solo movies, this introductory team up feels hurried and inadequate. But then Justice League was never the main event- everybody knew it once the villain was announced. As a build-up though, it works well. Where does the DC Extended Universe go from here though? It is in the right direction at-last I think, but really needs better directors. As for Justice League the movie- depending on the mood in any particular day, viewers are likely to classify it as good or bad. It is a strange movie, as I said at the outset. 7/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Dawn of Justice was entertaining but convoluted and confusing. Wonder Woman had an amazing setup undercut by an underwhelming villain. Let's ignore Suicide Squad.Justice League doesn't have the same epic feel as MoS, and doesn't have quite the intensity of DoJ. But, the dialog and characters are as good as in WW, and it's a heck of a lot easier to understand than DoJ was, even after DoJ's extended cut. To be clear, my seventy-year-old parents were able to follow the plot, and enjoyed it.The villain is not the scariest in history, but he's a lot more intimidating than Ares. Certainly beats the pants off the MCU Ultron.There's a scene with the five revealed League members attempting to recruit a sixth, which may have been my favorite scene in any of the DCEU movies. If nothing else, it's worth watching the movie just to see that.The pacing did seem a little uneven. I hear that the studio insisted on a certain runtime, which couldn't have affected anything positively. I'm looking forward to seeing an extended version, which I expect to be smoother.A few people have complained about the special effects. I don't know what they're talking about. People go to see special effects extravaganzas and then complain that there's CGI.

I knew that the reviews for this movie weren't up to par, but I still thought that it might have its moments, especially since I enjoyed ""Wonder Woman."" Having seen it, I can say that ""Justice League"" has a few entertaining parts but is overall another disappointment for DC comic book movies. (Still, it's not an unfettered disaster like ""Batman v. Superman"" or ""Suicide Squad."")The biggest problem with ""Justice League"" is just how bland and dull it is. The film feels about as formulaic as a superhero team-up movie could get, with little plot or character development. The visual style feels completely 'been there, done that,' as does the excessive amount of CGI and relatively clunky action scenes commonly found in DC films. The villain, Steppenwolf, also feels very meh. The CGI effects of Steppenwolf and his minions are almost laughable. And the movie's script, with by-the-book writing that's cringe-worthy half the time, is generally poor, although I will give the writers credit at trying to pull off an interesting and unique enough sort-of-plot-twist in the second half.That's not to say that ""Justice League"" doesn't have any redeemable qualities. Some of the performances are fine, although even the lead actors are unfortunately given relatively little to do to stand out from the other main characters. The film does have some enjoyable action scenes and one-liners, particularly a team-up scene with all the main heroes that occurs a little before the halfway mark. But these moments still fail to infuse the film with a spirit of originality, making this a serviceable but highly forgettable film. 5/10Note: Having had a free IMAX pass, I saw this movie in IMAX. The picture and sound quality were good, but they did not stand out in a manner characteristic of some other films I have seen on IMAX screens.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I can't for the life of me understand why Warner Brothers insists on bringing these movies in short (2 hrs for JL, 2-1/2 for BvS), when ITS THE FAN-BOY WORD-OF-MOUTH THAT WILL GREATLY DETERMINE THEIR SUCCESS. As has been widely acknowledged, the extended cut of BvS reveals a MUCH BETTER movie than the theatrical release. I have no doubt the same will prove true of JL. If it's good, people will pay and watch despite 2.5/3-hr run times - ever heard of Lord of the Rings, Avengers, the Dark Knight Trilogy? SMH.I'll say ""spoiler ahead"" here out of abundance of caution, but for anyone paying attention/that has seen Man of Steel/BvS it's obviously not: Superman's return is the big problem with this movie. It's awfully rushed, as is his addition to the team and his reacquaintance with Lois Lane, Martha Kent, Batman and Wonder Woman. I'm sure the WB-mandated 2- hour running time accounted for a lot of the short-shrift given to this element of the story. Cyborg's crucial origin (given the movie's overall plot) is administered to us fire-hose fashion as well.As for the villain Steppenwolf, he's a pretty standard, (literally from his own mouth) destroyer-of-worlds bad guy. Some reviews have complained about the bad CGI: I didn't think it was bad, just a lot of it, including the obvious un-mustaching of Henry Cavill in unfortunately too many full-screen head shots (making it nigh un- missable). I actually thought the action sequences were far and away the strong point of the movie.It's too bad Snyder couldn't finish this. Whedon's lighter touch is clear in numerous moments throughout (some work, some don't). Still, this was a better movie than the BvS theatrical release (but not the BvS extended edition). Makes me all the more anxious now to see the more Snyder-esque cut once this hits Blu-Ray! As it stands, this movie is a solid super-hero romp, but not a lot more. But it does not approach the disaster some have tried to make it out to be (as was similarly done with BvS and Man of Steel).","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It does add to the intrigue if the entire Justice League is part of the movie.
Marvel has been milking its Avengers series for a long time. It was natural for DC to follow suit. While Batman V Superman was panned by critics & fans, Wonder Woman was a huge hit. 
The movie revolves around Steppenwolf, who with the help of parademons is out to conquer earth. He intends to do so, through the combined energies of three mother boxes. It is now up to the Justice League to try & stop him. The first hour is spent introducing all the characters. Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Flash (Ezra Miller), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) make an appearance for the first time. Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) does a Tony Stark & tries to assemble a team of superheroes to fight Steppenwolf. This does sound & look formulaic, the writers could have come up with something new. Some superheroes readily accept, while some take their time. But predictably, all of them combine forces when it really matters. The movie does consist of a pleasant surprise in the second half, which will delight DC fanboys.
The acting by the cast is decent. Ben Affleck & Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) are good. Ezra Miller as Flash provides comic respite. His friendly rivalry with another superhero in the second half will make you smile. Jason Momoa & Ray Fisher are decent. Would like to watch their standalone films in the future. We did not get bored during the movie & neither will you. Director Zack Snyder must be credited for keeping us entertained.
While there were no glaring flaws, there was nothing special either. The movie follows a very similar trajectory as compared to Avenger series. It is very formulaic & cliched. We are die hard fans of Batman thanks to Christropher Nolan - Christian Bale's Batman trilogy. Unfortunately, the Zack Synder - Ben Affleck combo is no match to their predecessors. You will not be in awe of the film.
If you enjoy superhero movies, you will like this one. But do not expect something out of this world.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Poor Justice","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3862276/?ref_=tt_urv","coreyjdenford","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53918492/?ref_=tt_urv","19 November 2017","This review of Justice League is spoiler free** (2/5)Wonder Woman was a surprise addition to the DC Extended Universe, less tonally serious and more quick witted puns were to the screenplay mostly coming from Chris Pine's stammering Captain Steve Trevor granted it had seriousness to the story when Diana Prince had to fight her way through the flanks of men during World War I but mostly it was a fun adventure enlightened by the fantastic Gal Gadot and it was seen by man as the saviour of the DCEU. Justice League sees her replenish the role as the titular heroine, and again she's on top form using her sword (not the Godkiller) and Lasso of Truth to defeat a new villain which brings a threat to end the world. The question you're probably asking is; does she standout above all the men in DC's super-squad team up? Well if Ben Affleck's Batman had his way, then, sadly not, she's stunning when it comes to battling time but it's overall it's Affleck who holds most of the clan together. Thankfully, this isn't a bad thing as he's welcomed into the film with wide eyes from the audience; tonally his story is better, and, much lighter than last year's boringly brooding Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice which now we can likely forget. And maybe it's due to the lighter tone he's given after the various re-shoots from Joss Whedon after director Zack Snyder left for a family tragedy. It's not really surprising that Whedon comes with the lighthearted tone of the MCU's super-team-up Avengers Assemble, he adds several in-joke an obvious standout comes of course from Jeremy Irons' Alfred ""Those were the days where one's biggest concerns were exploding wind-up penguins"" suggesting that Batman's past is much closer to Tim Burton's Batman than it is to the straight-faced antics of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy; a notion reinforced by composer Danny Elfman (replacing Hans Zimmer) who here has a snatch from his infamous '89 Batman theme. Obviously re-hinting at the sillier past of the caped-crusader pushing the film away from Snyder's earlier DCEU entries and giving it an entirely new tone mash up. But Whedon's involvement of the Avengers'-lite plot does come with pointing out that he includes an alien villain who teams up with some other alien beings who look oddly like another Batman villain: Firefly (is it just us that noticed this?) But to be fair, it would be tricky to maintain post-Nolan somberness when Bruce teams up with an Amazon princess, a half-human-half-cyborg, and a big hairy merman who brings a pitchfork to a laser gun fight and commands the ocean, weird? Right?Sure Justice League is indeed some hokey stuff in terms of the super-team mash up they each get their time on the screen individually guiding the plot to follow their story in all this, first there's Aqauman (Jason Momoa) who only sees Bruce as guy who dresses up as a bat, his personality later transcends into sounding and looking like a rodeo clown, next we get Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) he's just a geeky guy who's never really been in battle, etc. This is about as much of their stories it has to offer, thanks to the mayonnaise plot the film suffers from several curses one of which is the 'too many characters, too little time' curse with five supers on the team each with their own personality they're left particularly nondescript they only have a few lines for plot before they have to battle. It's not all bad as Affleck can be forgiven for looking a little bit lost as the bruised world-weary Bruce. It makes sense that Batman would normally be excited by all this intergalactic, high-stakes idiocy, as well as being left behind during some of the action. Maybe next time he will get to play with some non-CG exploding penguins.VERDICT Fun and breezy at times, yet lumbered by the watery mayonnaise plotting offering little in the way of quality and reassuring a significant shortcoming of how forgettable it is.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

A simple setup that is very clearly the opposite of the extreme convolution that is Batman v Superman, which this film follows upon very clearly. Taking place a couple of months after these events (and a while after Suicide Squad), Superman is dead and the world mourns him. Evidently, the largest problem in this film is its setup, which comprises roughly half the film. It's a familiar story, assemble a team and tackle the bad guy. Most of the new members, namely Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman, are given some proper character development. Flash is a young man stuck in limbo who is still hung up over his mother's death (the cause of which is evident to anyone who watches the TV series with Grant Gustin) and Cyborg is bitter over the nature of his condition following his ""reconstruction"", clearly at odds with his father. Aquaman is the odd one out in these circumstances, a rather strange situation considering his own film is the closest to release. His personality shows promise, but I can't help but think that his arc could have been stronger had they stuck with the original running time of 2h 30min. There is simply not enough exposition to him to really care about his arc. Cyborg is the opposite, his exposition is reasonable, but his personality is lacking, with most of his humorous attributes going to Barry Allen instead. This is clearly a problem with the script, which fails to take advantage of Ray Fisher's natural charisma in any of his character's interactions. Overall, however, it is a good setup for a reasonably enjoyable to watch team. A team seriously undercut by a frustrating aspect.Unfortunately, Justice League also has the misfortune of dealing with the death of Superman in its second half, which was an unconvincing and underwhelming addition in Batman v Superman. The repercussions of that awful movie are felt here, where the necessity of the need of the Justice League is undercut in the final act of the film. It's no secret that Superman is back, the marketing team literally included him in the main poster the day after the film came out as if it was a big reveal. Given his power though, the need for the Justice League to conquer obstacles without Superman's help is almost completely gone, his involvement overshadowing all prior teamwork and commitment the group of 5 displayed. This leaves the inevitable final battle feeling heavily anti-climatic for the main characters the film had dedicated half of its run-time to establishing. On the bright side, it is a return of form to Superman, whose personality has clearly changed for the better since his last appearance. He is far more cheerful and less brooding than Batman, as it should be. Still, it is more an advertisement for better days with Henry Cavill's incarnation, one which would seem to benefit from his actor's charisma as well.The villain, Steppenwolf, played by Ciaran Hinds, is also given ample screen time in the film, far more than I was expecting. Unfortunately, and very clearly a consequence of the film's screen time limitation as well as the writing, his exposition, motives and personality are all utterly crap. The film utilises elements of Jack Kirby's Fourth World very poorly, with minimal reference to the New Gods or even Darkseid and Apokolips. Darkseid and Apokolips were a necessity in a film dealing with Parademons and New Gods, even if that appearance was rather small. What we are left with is a henchman without a master, which severely undercuts Steppenwolf's already vague motives. Ciaran Hinds mentioned that his character ""is old and tired, wishing to escape his enslaved position under his nephew Darkseid"". Yet we see very little of these motives at all, nor its impact on his already bland personality, which reduces Steppenwolf to a generic alien invader who could have been so much more if he had been written with those essential elements as a priority for the film. The film also cost well over $300 million when including marketing, which only makes me more disappointed in the final result. No DCEU film so far, with the exception of Wonder Woman, has ever exceeded ""good enough"", which shows a distinct lack of quality when compared to Marvel. Fact of the matter is, they are in the same ballgame, and comparisons are inevitable. Justice League, with its range of issues, is not an exception and continues the trend for what I hope is the last time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I confess that my feelings fall somewhere between the two. It seems that DC Comics just cannot replicate the success of Marvel Universe's Avengers.Superman is dead but the Earth is under great threat and so Batman and Wonder Woman put together a league of superheroes, adding Aquaman, Cyborg, and the Flash to the team facing somebody called Steppenwolf. The movie has considerable visual appeal with a whole variety of locations and worlds and lots of crashing action, but the plot is weak - yet again a small number of objects of great power which must not be brought together - and the characters (too many of them) are of variable impact.Ben Affleck is dull as Batman, never achieving Christian Bale's convincing portrayal of the role, and it is Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman - fresh from her success in her stand-alone appearance - who is the most appealing character, not least because we know so little of the back story of the other three league members. As for the huge and ugly villain Steppenwolf, he is just like so many other sci-fi bad guys and his entourage of flying warriors looks too much like the monkeys in ""The Wizard Of Oz"".The film had a troubled production with original director Zack Snyder - who helmed ""Man Of Steel"" and ""Batman vs Superman"" - having to step aside and leaving the final shooting to Joss Wheldon. This mixed heritage is combined with a confusion of tone with the work unsure whether it wants to be as serious as the previous two films or more comedic in the vein of ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"". There are extra scenes at the very beginning and the very end of the credits.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's bewildering as each gets a slice of time and with relatively independent stories.The whole story is not convincing because superman alone can defeat the big boss which makes the rest of the story unnecessary.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

However, I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed it! It is a short movie at 120 minutes but all the key characters are given a proper (albeit quick) introduction. The set up for the villain using DC mythology is nicely done. Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman with elan (as she did in her solo movie) and Ezra Miller was a great choice for the Flash (different take to CW's TV show). Ben Affleck finally comes into his own as Batman, playing a reluctant, fallible but likable leader. I think the true stars are Zack Snyder (I had completely written him off based on BvS, but I guess all that criticism made him come back better and more determined to succeed!) I believe Joss Wheedon (He directed Avengers Age of Ultron) was pulled in to finish this movie and his touch can be felt in refining and improving the work Snyder did. I hope this movie helps shift gears for the DC cinematic universe and helps it go into full strength. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this movie.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The superman part was just a bit too dumb but important. The badguys voice was just a bit too growly to understand.In either case on the cusp of the third decade in the 21st century CGI with this quality is inexcusable.And the worst part is one could clearly see that all this was lovingly and nicely crafted, incuding bits of the CGI.A special mention goes to whoever wrote Flash's and Cyborg's parts. They were witty, charming, but relatable unlike most of the over-the-top heroes. In both marvel and DC.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

All I can say is that through the bulk of the movie, I was enjoying the characters, the story, and the imagery too much to remember the frequent flaws I kept hearing about. One consistent positive in all the reviews, character and character interaction, I was able to put together to find an engrossing story. The diversity of character personalities, backgrounds, and abilities made for a tough and driven Batman, compassionate and resilient WonderWoman, stubborn and find-his-own-way Aquaman, self-conscious yet grounded Cyborg, quick-witted yet angsty Flash, and finally a morally driven and also resilient Superman. Steppenwolf? Loved him as a villain. Not in my top ten villains, but a worthy opponent to our heroes. along those same lines---CGI? I'll lay it all on the table, I have HUGE threshold of acceptance of it. Don't get the idea that I praise the CGI in ""Birdemic""; and any appeal found in SyFy movies' CGI hinges on how much laughter it stimulates. I draw the line below the Yetis in Mummy 3, anything of at least that quality won't take me out of the movie.Overall I felt a great balance in all areas that count.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Each of us would probably have seen some adaptation of these characters in some media or another especially through comic books or animated series/movies. This movie is sort of a rebirth for some of the characters to add some lightheartedness in a dark & bleak universe.The movie made me wanna see more of these characters in their own solo movies. The movie introduced these characters well but the impact could've been a lot better if they had their own solo movies beforehand. Steppenwolf was a terrible villain who needn't have been a complete CGI character. The climactic battle involving the league and steppenwolf was underwhelming. It was still better than the fight against enchantress in Suicide Squad but that's still not good enough for the premier league of DC. A certain mustache removing CGI for a character was so distracting. The usage of the soundtrack from the 1989 Batman movie and the Batman Animated series was such a class move. There were still so many good moments that provided a lot of fun throughout. This movie could've been a lot better but it is what it is now. There are issues in the movie, that if you don't nitpick on them you might actually enjoy it a lot. Don't skip it due to some Rotten tomatoes score.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Smartly producers are seeing that a super hero like Superman (Henry Cavill) or Batman (Ben Affleck) is better served by having more heroes to expand audience and humanize.In Justice League, Diana Prince is a welcome leader, having jumped into that spot no doubt because of her box office success in Wonder Woman early in 2017. Here she teams up with Cyborg, Flash, Batman, Aquaman, and Superman (recently resurrected) to defeat Steppenwolf (voice of Ciaran Hinds), who is bent on bringing back power and global destruction to the dark side. The team motif, so popular in pulp fiction and sci fi these days, is best expressed by Commissioner Gordon (J.K. Simmons) to Batman: ""Good to see you playing with others again."" Oh, well, nothing new here, especially with the usual out-of-date explosions and knock-abouts, both to me not worthy of advanced sci-fi but along with bullets, staples of the genre. The reliance here on fist fighting and gun shooting seems beneath the dignity of advanced civilizations such as ours. The banter is banal, and the wonder of the Wonder Woman film earlier this year places this epic in mediocre land far, far away from the Amazons.With so much run-of-the-mill CGI as a central focus, no wonder plot is thin and characterization superficial. While director Zack Snyder tries to give enough time to each character to develop, too many of them mean too little rounding out their personalities and lives. What we have is what we have‚Äîa middling story of the same stuff told with characters just waiting for their own next motion picture. Please, no more Batman vs. Superman films‚ÄîJustice League is close enough.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

However Justice League takes the friendly lighthearted approach in hopes of following the Marvel formula. In doing so it lacks any emotional heft or tension. Also with only Superman and Wonder Woman having their own standalone movies, its very obvious DC are eager to keep up with Marvel. However it is less gloomy than Batman v Superman and it doesn't drag on as much. The story feels more focused and a lot less cluttered with no set up to other instalments. Izla Miller and Jason Mamoa are good in their roles as Flash and Aquaman, they are easily the best characters who could have done with their own standalone films. Ray Fisher as Cyborg is OK, he does have a good story arc as half man/half machine, however he doesn't contribute to the team much, he just reads files and fixes things.Some of the action scenes are enjoyable including Wonder Woman foiling a terrorist attack and the team fighting Superman; But most of it is forgettable. Danny Elfmans score isn't bad, with nods to Batman (1989) and Superman (1978). Unfortunately the plot is very thin and lacks any originality or logic. It revolves around super-villain Steppenwolf chasing down three cubes in order to rebuild the earth. This prompts Batman/Bruce Wayne to bring together his super-team and eventually bring Superman/Clark Kent back from the dead. Steppenwolf is a boring villain who lacks any substance. He doesn't do anything but talk tough and punch things, he just leaves his disposable insect minions to do most the work. There is never a sense of real danger as no one ever gets hurt, except only at the beginning involving the Amazonians protecting the first cube. But from then on, there is only one or two civilian casualties and a few minor injuries here and there. When it finally comes to the finale, it is clich√© and generic. It literally just feels like a rehash of X-Men Apocalypse. Ben Affleck isn't given much to do this time, he just looks bored which is a major disappointment as he was easily the best thing about Batman v Superman. Gal Gadot looks to be slowly loosing enthusiasm playing Wonder Woman too. At this point its only the new members who seem to be enjoying themselves. Midway through Post-Production, Director Zack Snyder had to quit because of a family tragedy leaving Joss Whedon (director of The Avengers) to finish the job. This included filming re-shoots and finishing visual effects shots, all in the space of a few months. This results in the film looking very cheap, the visual effects are often lacklustre with many of the scenes being shot on obvious green screens. Its no wonder WB delayed the reviews, its as if they already knew it was doomed. Overall Justice League is OK to pass the time. But there is just too many characters who are given too little to do. Yes it is enjoyable in parts, but Its nothing special, its not the worse film ever made, but it should have been A lot better given the $300 million budget and cast.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

You can't put the League to fight a Darkseid- level villain in their first assemble.I can't wait to see Aquaman next year, and Shazam, and every next DCEU movie!""FOR DARKSEID!""","11 out of 28 found this helpful.

Oh and there are post-credit scenes now!Of course, the main differentiation from Marvel is that, whereas The Avengers finally united our favorite heroes from past adventures, this one is a union between our favorite DCEU cameos, some surly bat, and Wonder Woman. We meet Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck), the caped billionaire tech genius who unites the team; Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller), the super-fast youngster; Aquaman (Jason Momoa), the Atlantean trident-wielder; Cyborg (Ray Fisher), the cyborg; and Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), the Amazonian demigoddess. There's also Amy Adams' Lois Lane because where would these saps be without her?Superman also returns (no longer shunned), back from his death at the hands of Doomsday in the last film, and as a testament to the quantity of hoot given by all parties involved: Henry Cavill didn't want to shave his moustache for the Whedon reshoots, hence it had to be erased digitally in post, as even the biggest newbie when it comes to spotting CGI will notice. Note: in the age of online hype and clickbait, this is hardly a spoiler. I shan't apologize.Our villain is the enraged Steppenwolf (Ciri√°n Hinds), who once before descended to Earth with hopes to recreate it through the use of so-called Mother Boxes, only to be overcome by the Atlanteans, Wonder Women and Green Lanterns of the era (all this is explained in an expository scene that doesn't remotely resemble Lord of the Rings). He is also connected to a future, even greater villain named Darkseid, in that he is the latter's uncle. It's always funny when dark alien overlords have perfectly conventional familial relationships and related terms. Uncle Steppenwolf is coming over, darling!I am being harsh but I did appreciate some things: the casting of J.K. Simmons as the new Commissioner Gordon was welcome and Jeremy Irons still delivers one of the more interesting renditions of Alfred in Batman movie history. There exist true moments of chemistry between our heroes as well, certain characters are still likeable (e.g. Flash and Wonder Woman), composer Danny Elfman brings something sweet to the table, and in true Zack Snyder fashion, slow-motion is never used as shoddily as it could have been.Still, the fact that this is a re-shot and carelessly stitched-together piece of work is all too apparent. I wasn't too comforted by the visual effects or action scenes either; it's the usual PS4 gameplay footage posing as live-action cinema. With actors who wouldn't shave, directors being switched out at bad times, and editing that doesn't allow for the best of flow, the circumstances were just too unkind for Justice League.Is there yet hope for the Extended Universe? Well, some critics actually do see promise for the future, welcome the brief runtime of what could have been a truly tedious origin story, and are happy about the decreased self-seriousness of it all (even if such scenes still remain, as when the opening sequence compares humanity's grief over Superman to Prince, Bowie and Leonard Cohen). If they recover from the underwhelming box office numbers, DC might just get a new chance. So say the reviews I have thus far read and so it may be.But sure, the critics are still being paid off by Marvel to write deliberately biased reviews and make DC look inferior. That's why it is Warner Bros. that partially owns Rotten Tomatoes and not Disney, right? That's why even people like me, who don't get paid for doing this and just enjoy writing film reviews, also agree that these are poorly planned and (usually) incompetent movies, right? Feel free to hit me up.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Every single time Zac and Joss had a chance to drop an unwanted one liner, they took the opportunity. Making viewers uncomfortable. Inconsistencies between the power levels of certain characters were questionable as well. I was really looking forward seeing some of these characters come to the big screen.

I think a lot of the negative reviews are coming from some Marvel fans that only like Marvel. I never go out and bash the Avenger movies even though they are so childish. Some are not but here lately. Plus Marvel puts out about 15 movies to DC's 1. I am surprised that people have not gotten sick of them. Seems like they have 15 movies for each of their heroes. I have to be honest and say that I loved the Dark Knight trilogy so much I was even hesitant to jump on the Justice League bandwagon. Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale made 3 classics. Batman movies that will be talked about 50 years from now. Do you think they will be talking about the Avenger movies in 50 years. So I hope they keep making the Justice League movies.

It's a Zack Snyder film (we all know his way of doing things) but it's definitely an improvement compared to Dawn of Justice.

Fans were expecting something dark, interesting and really worthwhile. But we didn't get what we wanted. Unfortunately. The great one.There was a lot of talk after the release of the team action movie. They continue years later. It is important to say that the film was shot by Zack Snyder, but then Joss Whedon came and redid a lot. And such rotations could not but affect the final version of the blockbuster. Changes in tonality, colors, music and dialogues are felt almost with the change of each scene. The beginning is purely Snyder. The credits and the song are very worthy. But the further events develop, the less I, as a spectator, liked it. The film was slipping into a kind of attempt to turn a team superhero action movie into a kind of ""Avengers"" from Marvel. And this attempt was a failure.There are practically no strong scenes. The most memorable with the return of Superman. And that's only because it's always interesting to see a beautiful staging of the clash of heroes among themselves.In this regard, the actors' performance is not even remembered. Honestly. There are sluggish attempts to imagine the Flash performed by Ezra Miller as a kind of joker responsible for humor. Frankly weak. You can laugh a couple of times, but no more.Affleck and his Batman are kind of bland compared to the previous movie. His motivation disappeared somewhere, and with it the brutality that Snyder created.Momoa and Aquaman appear as if a certain narrow-minded inhabitant of the seas, whose motivation is not much revealed.Wonder Woman, which Gal Gadot demonstrates, is also weak. She tries to help Bruce assemble a team, acts as a kind of glue, but there is no strength in her.The villain Steppenwolf turned out to be insipid, a kind of liquidator without meaningful motivation, whom you do not understand and know what he is fighting for.I don't want to talk about the others.If you watch the movie as a separate blockbuster, then you may well like it, but when you have already seen the previous pictures and are waiting for something much bigger, you inevitably get disappointed.And this is understandable. After all, several directors worked on the picture, the script was redrawn, the plot changed. All this literally takes you from frame to frame.The result was the failure of the picture and, as at that time, everyone believed that the cinematic universe was coming to naught. The Justice League does not reveal the huge potential that is invested in it. And there are unlikely to be fans of this film, even among the fans of the heroes.6 out of 10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

First: the comments saying Zack Snyder would have made a better movie have to come from people who never watched one of his crappy productions. He is REALLY BAD, I am sure this movie would suck even worse if he hand't left. He is the king of apathy.
The CGI is... not good. Not just superman (didn't know about the moustache but makes perfect sense now) but the landscape, the fight scenes... I mean, are we sure this is the finished version?
And sure, the visual is bad, but it's ten times worse because they let a 12 y/o write the script. That's the only explanation for the ""jokes"", the dialogues that were supposed to be impactful but were just cringe... and that random family nobody cares about because they were never introduced so why bother making a scene saving these random people? Make them a part of the story, guardians of the place where the villain was supposed to connect the boxes, I don't know, do something!
Also, they could have just left out the overexplaining. Did it really make a difference that rope WW has makes people tell the truth? Not for this movie. Do we really need to show and explain a million times aquaman has some water related powers? It's just constantly underestimating the viewer, it's horrible.
I completely disagree with people saying the acting was good. Even Ezra wasn't great (I know he is good but the material he had to work with...) but GG gets away by being gorgeous even though she is almost a robot when it comes to acting. More than the robot guy! And Affleck? The expression ""looks like he's smelling a fart"" comes to mind.
The main issue here comes down to poor writing. This movie is considerably darker than some other superhero ones, we get introduced to a villain that kills many amazons and that should be felt. Even Diana barely cares. It's the perfect intro to an emotionally stunted script.
The last point is: why bring back the dead? You loose all the emotional impact of characters dying if you start introducing the resuscitation card. Why not just seriously mame him in the last movie? Now nobody will ever care as much if a main character dies. Honestly, it's like the writer never went to a writing 101 class. The amount of hospitals and schools that could have been built with this budget... it's just obscene. Waste of money.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

They feel like actual humans (even though one is an alien). So much heart and fun in this one. They made you care about not only the populace but about the actual heroes and those they love. Each hero is brought to life, each one flawed in their own way, and each one makes you believe in hope. They are the light, the truth, and Justice will be served. A near-perfect super hero movie. Better than Spiderman: Homecoming, better than Man of Steel and BvS by miles, and just as great as many of the Marvel films out there.

Do I love Gal Gadot more as Wonder Woman than I despise Ben Affleck as Batman? After all, ""Dawn of Justice"" was an horrendous movie, maybe the worst superhero flick I was ever forced to endure, but Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman almost saved that one in spite of Affleck's poor attempts to be the Dark Knight, right? To be honest, Affleck douched less this time around, and Gadot was the utter hot badass we've all come to know and love. Flash was really fun and much-needed comic relief among all the badasssery oozing from everyone else. All in all, this was a good movie, better than anticipated, but I'd still contend that Affleck needs to be replaced. He's just not the right guy to be Batman. 7 Stars.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If it were me, the DC Universe movies and series would all be rated R. Yet, I also need to have fun and this is kind of what Justice League was. It's two hours long, but the actual fight with evil is in the last 15 minutes and almost inconsequential. The dynamic between the characters, in the end, is why the movie is worth watching. And, spoiler, Superman's not dead... he's just ridiculously overpowered, which makes the entire League concept kind of pointless. That's where the fun comes in. Go watch the film, turn your brain off a little, and enjoy. The true depth of the Justice League concept can never be reached in any type of movie. You have comic books and animations for that. Now, Cyborg was awesome. In this digital age he might even be overpowered himself, but his character wasn't truly explored. Aquaman looked good, but for the life of me couldn't see his point. The Superman/Batman/Wonder Woman trio worked great, as it did in the movie before (quit whining and watch the extended version). That leaves Barry Allen, who was kind of fun. There are holes in the logic of... well, everything, but I reiterate: fun!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

If you're like me and just like to sit back an enjoy a movie for the entertainment, meaning that movies aren't your life and you're not a wannabe movie critics, then this movie is for you!The character development is fine and all of them are enjoyable, even Batman has great moments that helped define his character and make him more likeable. The Flash would have been the comedy relief if it weren't for everyone else having their share of levity. I was really surprised that I liked Aquaman as much as I did and even Cyborg was really cool. You care about every character in this movie and hope they all make it through in the end. Steppenwolf was definitely a surprise. When I heard the moans and groans regarding a CGI villain, I paused and lost interest in wanting to see this. Man, was I wrong. He's a great villain! He's a big baddy that wants to destroy the world and he's pretty vicious! Maybe I enjoyed him because I'm not naive enough to think that a villain needs some other reason to do evil things to than he's just fricking evil! Maybe these critics wanted to see the villain whine and pine about how someone stole his milk when he was 3 or about how his mother forced him to watch Oprah against his will or whatever. Who knows with those film critics. Guys, they did the bad guy right with this one and that's all there is to it. When it comes to the big baddy, stick to the basics. After all, we don't want a repeat of Jesse Eisenburg's Lex Luthor do we?The plot: A bunch of zombie like flying creatures that are attracted to fear show up in Gotham. Batman investigates and comes to realize the world is being threatened. He then begins to seek out and recruit(with the help of Wonder Woman) Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg to help save our world. In closing, ignore the wannabe critics, grab some popcorn, and just enjoy the fricking movie. Remember, movies are just entertainment, they're not your life.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Directed by Zack Snyder, the film brought together the new kids on the block of superheroes in Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Jason Fisher) and everyone's favorite man of steel (Henry Cavill).While on paper, this all-star cast gives off an 'Avengers' vibe, it's a far cry from that franchise. For one, the actors completely lack chemistry. Everything seems forced, especially the few comedic moments that are thrown into the mix. Sure, 'Justice' is supposed to be more serious in nature than anything in the Marvel universe, but it's possible to strike a balance without coming off so wooden. Even Gadot's Wonder Woman does not radiate the same sense of confidence as she did in her titular role last year.Aside from the poorer than usual acting, the story is nothing special - the heroes band together to stop the threat posed by New God member Steppenwolf as he tries to collect three powerful boxes that could destroy Earth. This is standard fare for any superhero entry, so it doesn't really count against 'Justice,' nor does it do it any favors. So what does this leave us? Not much, unfortunately. Everything here is pretty much forgettable.It's possible that DC films can make a comeback, as 'Wonder Woman,' 'Suicide Squad' and 'Man of Steel' all seemed to click with audiences. Hopefully 'Aquaman' can beat the odds in December, otherwise many will blame 'Justice League' for casting a shadow on future releases.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well, this film brings him back to life by a company of dazzlingly brilliantly costumed actors - a fine cast who seem to take the whole adventure too seriously - and a director (Zach Snyder) that prefers CGI wowzers to storytelling, perhaps because of the screenplay pasted together by a cast of eleven (count 'em, 11!) writers. But comic book heroes continue to sell well and keep the theaters full - very possibly because these noisy action packed movies are a way to escape the realities of the world in which we live. The 'plot' is well summarized - Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes-Batman (Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and The Flash (Ezra Miller) -it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions. Amidst all the explosions, flying beasties, Amazons, and the evil Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciar√°n Hinds) up rises Superman (a very buff bare-chested Henry Cavill) and his usual entourage (Diane Lane, Amy Adams) and with the help of J.K. Simmons, Jeremy Irons et al, everything is simply OK again ....maybe.... there will never be an end (or need) for superheroes.For lovers of the comic book realm this one will please. Big on CGI (excellent) and not so much on story.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The premise of the film sees after Superman's death Batman and Wonder Woman set out to form a team to save the world from the forces of Apokolips.Main Character
Ben Affleck is back as Batman for the last time and I thought he did a good job in the film. As I mentioned in my Batman V Superman review I really like Affleck as Bruce Wayne and I feel like his character develops a bit this film. You see him as more of a team leader, and a bit more light hearted which felt natural and made him easy to root for in this film, though he doesn't lose his edge as Batman needs to have that. Gal Gadot is back as Wonder Woman and she is great in this film, she is really strong in the role and is a character you can get behind, the dynamic between her and Batman is a highlight of the film and feels like a natural progression from their relationship in the previous film.Supporting Characters
Ezra Miller plays The Flash and he did a really good job, his character is nothing new to me due to the character being used in the TV show but it was done effectivley enough. He is clearly the comic relief character and he was funny, I also liked his dynamic of the new hero and you just see his confidence grow in the film which felt like some character depth. Jason Mamoa plays Aquaman here and he isn't given lots of character development but he is no doubt fun to watch, especially in the action scenes. It was a good start for the character which would obviously be further expanded in his own solo movie. Ray Fisher plays Cyborg and he might be the most interesting character in the film, you see how his changes have really affected him as a person, for a big part of this film he feels more like machine then man but working with the other characters brings the best out of him. Now this one could be considered a spoiler but lets face it this was revealed way before the film came out, Henry Cavill is back as Superman and this is The Superman that we should have got in Batman V Superman, he is actually likeable and more charming. He is still great in the action scenes and has the necessary mix of humour and drama that this franchise finally got on track with the character.Story
The story of seeing this dysfunctional team of special individuals having to come together is fun, I mean we have seen it in The Avengers but it is done fine here and seeing each characters personality come out when together to make a fun dysfunctional group. But the story is kind of all over the place, first the villain, Steppenwolf has really bland motivations and you know he is basically just a glorified henchman for Darkseid. Also due to three of the main characters don't have movies before this, the film has to rush there origins and it feels like we don't really know that much about them except if you are a comic book expert.Script
The script is much better here, it has a really good blend of drama and humour to it. It has the Joss Wheddon feel about it which when he took over this film it seems like he added a bit more of a balanced tone instead of Zack Synders very moody tone that had been in his previous films.Style
The style has some interesting action scenes, it had a great representation of the new characters powers especially The Flash which made this a fun film for sure. But there is some CGI issues, especially in the final act, it just seems like it was made in a bit of a rush and without care. Also the first act is choppy and the pacing is off which makes it hard to focus on the important parts.Overall
Overall, I was suprised by how much I enjoyed this film, it is a great fun experience with a good set of characters and set up hoepfully the first of more installments of this franchise. If it can get a bit more focused and get a better villain a future Justice League Film could be up there with The Avengers films.Rating - 8/10.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

A 6-7 is understandable, 9-10 is far-fetched.Synder's Batman is the most cinematically pleasing one. We all love the Arkham games and Synder's Batman reminds us of that. The starting scene of Justice League and the camera angle made me remember the memories of Arkham Knight and Arkham Origins games.The movie was dull, underdeveloped, CGI-ed and cheesy but I still prefer DC than Marvel. It is less superhero-ey and more hope-y, or whatever. People are complaining about bad jokes here but love when the same is being done in Marvel movies. I don't get the appeal of Marvel movies, I don't. I'm at the point where anything Marvel could do won't make me fall down to my knees and watch the upcoming movie or heavens the shows now.Justice League was not made according to Snyder's plan and now we are eagerly waiting for ""The Snyder Cut"" which will be coming in 2021. I don't know what more to expect, I haven't been following the ""call for help"" tweets and posts about the Synder Cut. Honestly, I am not a comic geek or an enthusiast of superhero genre, I just dabble in some DC from time to time, at the very least.But, I know Snyder's cut would be a lot different. We see some of Synder's magic in BvS, when he released the Ultimate edition. Did it make the movie more likeable? Yes. Could it be avoided and see the original and still feel slightly pleasant? Yes. Rumors are Justice League's Synder Cut would be totally different and be more binding. Let's see.As always, Ben Affleck looks like a far more accurate Batman and his body structure helps too. Henry Cavill is charming as Superman. Gal Gadot is a Goddess, in and out of the movie, Ezra Miller- I'm not a fan of as Flash, Cyborg started out whiny and Aquaman is appropriate to the point of uncanny.Let's hope we remain alive for the Synder's cut and the Pandemic we are currently in (Yes, 2020) dies down pretty soon.Cheers","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

They just wanted the film to be done just in time to get their bonuses! If they would have given Snyder time to mourn and heal and not interfere with this film and where Snyder was going with it, they would have had a huge success on their hands.This is the film that proves that the current executives in WB does not know how to make great films, they just throw what ever they can and hope something sticks.Thank God we have HBO Max, at least Snyder vision of the Justice League is restored, now of only we can get the Ayer cut to Suicide Squad green lit explaining how that story leads to the Justice League.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Even when Star Trek the Movie Hit the Screen, my father complained that the movie should have been more like the opening scene with Klingons!
Each Series has to reintroduce itself and the same was true for Justice League. While we have had introductions to Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman; this is the first time we actually start to build the story together, what they are and what they mean to each other. Couple that with the introduction of Aquaman and the Flash and there is an intricate web that needs to be told. While comic book and cartoon loyalists may have a different evaluation base their interaction with the characters; I believe that Justice league does an outstanding job of laying the foundation for the franchise.
 The possibilities about the friendship between Superman and Batman and the tension between Wonder Woman and Batman can lead to a vast number of story lines. I am eager to see where they go? There is always the what if, especially in product that means so much to so many. My pet peeves are related to the darker Aquaman and flighty Flash characters that vary from my childhood images; but, I love the story line and it lays out the ground work for a franchise that could surpass them all!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Man of Steel was okay, Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice was bad, and Suicide Squad was garbage, but Wonder Woman was good, and that's their only redeeming film in their extended universe.Zack Synder is a terrible filmmaker, only making films that have beautiful aesthetics over story substance. I don't like any of his films, but I will say, ""They are damn good to look at."" However, his movie 300 has both a good narrative and a breathtaking aesthetic pallet. 300 is his only good film.I don't know why Warner Bros. decided to stick with Synder after Man of Steel and BVS both bombed at the box office.Can terrible filmmakers eventually produce good work, of course.Justice League is the first team-up movie featuring some of our favorites superheroes, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman all team-up to protect the world from the evil that plagues the world. I wasn't looking forward to this movie, to begin with, however, I did want it to be good, and I did want to feel the epicness.Justice League is fun while watching, but almost none of it is memorable.I had a blast during a majority of the action scenes, but none of them stick out to me. If you were to ask me what was my favorite action scene, I would say, ""They all felt the same, except for the man in the red cape, I like what they did with him here."" The story amongst the characters is thin, Aquaman, and The Flash get the short end of the stick. Cyborg's story development has the impact unlike his co-stars, but he doesn't have any layers added to his character.Aquaman is dull and typical, but Jason Momoa did make the experience fun.The Flash was fun to watch, but his story was dull and predictable. We already know who Batman and Wonder Woman are and so they don't need an introduction.Overall, I didn't care about the plot. The character's stories were razor thin. The action was forgettable. The villain was $hit. The CGI was terrible. I loved all of The Man in the Red Cape scenes. The action was fun while watching.I don't have any major gripes with the movie. What do you go to a superhero movie for, you go for the fun right, and you're looking for a good time, right? I had fun with the Justice Leauge, but it should've been more than fun, it should've been epic.For a more in-depth review, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ES622BChk","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Saying that it is ANYTHING like the artistically MASTERFUL, ""Justice League: TAS"" By Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and Andrea Romano, is deeply ignorant at best, and bordering on blasphemy in the case of certain reviewers... The animated show has everything this long format, BORING trailer has:
1.- Engaging Narrative
2.- Thoughtful Writing
3.- Proper use of NARRATIVE STRUCTURE
4.- GREAT SET UP AND WORLD BUILDING
5.- ACTUAL CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!6.-PROPER DIRECTION
7.- PROPER PERFORMANCES.Also, it is properly well edited, and it has A LOT less budget than this, overproduced parody of itself. Worst of all, is the way this unartistic, corpotative aproach to superhero cinema, has damaged the general public's perception of this magnificent, modern GODS and their wonderfull mythology. I'm deeply saddened by this, I feel so small, and useless, so utterly powerless. Superman is to me like what Jesus is to Christians, or what The Buddha represents to Buddhists, and I can't do anything to stop people from despicing and disregarding Superman as a jockey, overmuscled, Randian, chouvinistic yankee simpleton, because they only know this ignorant and disrespectful caricature that makes a laughable travesty out the one divine figure that's been able to convince me of holding on to life despite my long lasting struggle with depression and nihilism. This kind of prostitution of art for the sake of endless profit is socio-culturally HARMFULL, psychologically WEAKENING, and emotionally malnourishing, and the corporative psychopaths who run the addictive, junk-show, are a DANGER TO SOCIETY, and they should be tried for crimes against humanity.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I grew up to the Super Friends, was a fan of the Justice League animated series, so when they announced Justice League the movie, I didn't get my expectations too high, but still found myself looking forward to it. When Rotten Tomatoes came out with their rating, I wasn't surprised. They seem to have it out for DC movies recently. Man of Steel was better than they gave it credit for, Dawn of Justice though, was definitely not good (except for the Batman warehouse fight scene, that was pretty epic), Suicide Squad was a little fun, not as bad as critics say also.Without giving any spoilers, JL decidedly turned up the humor on this one, which many gags did not fall flat for me. The Flash stole the show when it came to comic relief. Aquaman has a hilariously ""heart felt"" scene that was one of the best scenes in the movie. When Superman returns (seriously, I'm sure this is in no way a spoiler by now) he and Flash have a couple of great scenes, and Clark and Cyborg have a great one also. Batman does his thing and is played very well by Afleck. And of course Wonder Woman is once again played great by Gal Gadot. The villain is standard fair. Has a couple of decent scenes, but other than that, he plays his part, as do his minions. Don't get me wrong, this is not on par with many of the Marvel movies put out there (I don't mean to play the DC vs. Marvel card here) but this is a good entry and good beginning for the future movies. Please don't go in with a ""I'm going to hate this movie"" attitude and go in for a good popcorn movie and enjoy it.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ben Affleck knows nothing about playing Batman except to try and imitate the gruff voice of Christian Bale, which was electronically modified anyway. As soon as Man Of Steel became a hit, they should have stayed focused on Superman and Lois Lane and then they should have introduced all of the characters of the Justice League so that we would know who they are in the ensemble movie. These people need to take a huge look at Marvel and pretty much copy what they're doing. Because they're doing it the right way. Very little screen time for Superman and Lois Lane made this really boring. The villain sucked. It was bad character, bad dialogue, and bad effects. It simply all fell flat. The only real salvation for this movie is Jason Momoa as Aquaman and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. And, they still fell short. Most likely because they were working with bad material.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I didn't hate it. I loved Wonder Woman she was bad ass, The Flash was funny, Aquaman was cute, Batman was okay typical rich guy playing hero and Cyborg was a bit annoying but okay. In all honestly Cyborg got on my nerves with the whole I'm a robot, my mom is dead blah blah blah be grateful you're a alive dude and shut up. Anyway the film itself was cool for what it was. I do enjoy a good superhero film but the whole Steppenwolf thing was a bit strange. Of ALL the villains in DC you pick that guy? Why? Was it because he was big and powerful? And what was with the three boxes? That was a bit weird but I've never read the comic so maybe theirs a hidden message I'm missing but I've read a few of Batman and Wonder Woman comics so I'm aware of the series. Now I did love the special effect of the film BUT I will say this the whole stop motion thing that superhero films do was a bit annoying. TWe get it we're watching a superhero film we don't need to be remembered every 5 minutes when a hero takes on a villain and time stops. I really only saw the film for Wonder Woman because I am a huge fan of Wonder and she bought love and understanding to the film. Now the Flash was funny a bit annoying at some parts but he sort of reminded me of Spiderman in Homecoming when he was trying to understand the gadgets and get use to the suit. Batman was a bit boring to be honest but it's Affleck he's no Bale so I didn't really care for him but for what it was he kept the story going. Aquaman was hot, oh I know you guys are going to be up my butt oh she only going for he hot superheros, umm yeah so? I need something to look at when I'm watching a superhero film. Same goes for Superman both bad and good guy, if you've seen the film you know what I mean. And like I mentioned Cyborg was a bit of a downer and annoying guy. Should you watch this film? Well if you are a superhero person then I say yes go watch it but if you're not into the whole superheros saving the world then yes you'll like this film. But if you're not a into superhero films then I'd pass on this one and wait for it on redbox if you really want to watch it and see what all the fuss is about. I'll probably buy it to add to my DVD Blu-ray collection.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This film is getting critically panned and is under-performing at the box office. It's sad, because I was actually hoping this film would actually do well, despite everything plaguing it, given the surprise success of Wonder Woman. I feel that if this film had come out ten years ago it would have been praised as an amazing achievement, and would have done unprecedented numbers.However, in a world where we've now had two Avengers movies, and Civil War, many people see this as a generic, by the numbers flick, which is a valid argument. I understand those who feel that way. Even so, I found myself having fun with the movie, and I feel there are some genuinely good things about it.The plot is the same as the Avengers, so there's no point in going over it. First, I'll discuss what I like about Justice League. The film looks good, in my opinion. There are instances of sub-par CGI particularly with Cyborg, but overall I like the look of the film. When the action kicked in I was having a good time, especially during the climax.Ben Affleck as batman was really good here. I always liked Ben Affleck as an actor, and felt he could play a great Batman. His character was just characterized so poorly in BVS. Thankfully, I liked him a lot more here. You can tell the events of BVS are weighing greatly on him, and is trying to make a change for the better. I also like his costume more here than BVS. His outfit was awesome here, and he gets some good moments and fight scenes.Gal Gadot was Wonder Woman was also a plus for the movie. I liked her in BVS, her own movie, and she was good here too. She had some good banter with Batman and the others, and her action scenes were always entertaining.Jason Momoa as Aquaman was okay. I actually liked more than I thought I would. I'm still not totally sold on the look, but I found him fun enough. Though, he did have his annoying bits. Cyborg was there for me. I didn't dislike him, but I did not really care much for him either.Now I discuss the things I don't think worked about Justice League. Firstly, I'm not a fan of this version of Barry Allen/The Flash. I don't think the actor was that good, and I found the character more irritating than anyone else. I'm not even comparing him to the CW Flash series, as I'm not a fan of that either. In my opinion they have yet to get the Flash right in a live action adaptation.The villain was there. He looked cool, but there was nothing else to him. So he's basically the average MCU supervillain.The thing is, aside from Superman, Batman (sort of), and Wonder Woman, none of the other heroes have gotten their own solo film developing them as characters. Due to this it makes it more difficult to get invested in them. Much of their backstory is shoehorned in this film as long exposition. I know much of this film found itself on the cutting room floor, so there probably are more scenes in the movie dedicated to developing them. However, that can have the effect of making the film too bloated and unfocused, like BVS was. Whether you like the MCU or not, there way was the more effective when it comes to setting up characters.The final issue is with Superman. Henry Cavil is a great actor, he looks good in the costume, and I think he could play a great Superman. There are moments in this film where the Superman as he should be does come through, even if it is little. The problem is that this Superman has been characterized so terribly throughout the DCEU, especially in BVS.What's so weird about this film is that everyone is constantly saying how much of a selfless hero superman was and how much the world needs him, including Batman. Everyone keeps saying how superman is a symbol for hope and justice. Yes, Superman is supposed to stand for those things, but with how he's been handled in these movies, including this one, those claims are entirely unfounded. Even in this film Superman still seems like a muscle headed idiot who only listens to Lois Lane.In BVS everyone, including Batman, hated and feared Superman. Not to mention, Superman himself does not seem to care to much about being a hero. He even admitted it to Lois in BVS. Even in this film he still does not seem to care that much. Nowhere is that demonstrated more than in the opening scene of the film, where he gives one of the most awkward and unconvincing heroic speeches ever. From that scene, and the montage that followed, I thought this film was going to be a disaster. Of all the DCEU movies, this one had the weakest opening sequence, other than maybe Suicide Squad.Overall, Justice League is a fun popcorn movie. There are some glaring faults, with a couple being major. There are really bad things in this film, but the film as a whole is okay in my opinion. It's probably even my second favorite of the DCEU line under Wonder Woman, though that doesn't say much. It's definitely better than BVS and Suicide Squad. I'd even put it over Man of Steel (though I like MOS alright) because Justice League had more fun, was not as long, looked far more colorful, and didn't take itself so overly serious.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But I surely did not love it either. The movie is passable. It has some major problems and some that can be ignored. First of all, the most common problem is the villain. Steppenwolf is given a backstory but it rather seems very forced and clich√©d. The whole movie is a clich√©. But the villain was just another CGI monster like ultron, doomsday or Aries. The second problem is not actually the fault of the director but that of wanner bros. as they passed the mandate for keeping the runtime of less than 2 hours. Due to this the movie was not always coherent and feels very rushed. Also sometimes the CGI seemed to be awful(Henry Cavil's moustache) Other problems were that the dialogue was sometimes weak and some of the humour fell flat. As for the positives, the movie is fun but disposable, all the performances were great specially Jason Mamoa. Ezra Miller is great as flash too. Ray Fisher us also good as Cyborg and Ben and Gal are top notch. The team has a good chemistry overall and Henry Cavil also steals the show. They really nailed Superman. But this is not a great or even a good movie, its okay and you'll really enjoy it if you're a DC fan.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, unlike MARVEL, a company that grew from the world of comics to movie production, Warner can't handle allowing the creators to bring their vision to life. After seeing this, you can imagine exactly how things went. Some 60 yer old suit, freaking out at the idea of putting 300 million in a movie about men in tights fighting monsters. Well, there you go. You lost your money and you destroyed a franchise.
Next time, bring in people from the world of comics and acknowledge that you just don't get it. Don't worry about it, you are not the first. Ever since 1000 BC, people did not understand how a story about a king lost in the sea, fighting one eyed giants could be taken seriously. It's incredible that people who want to run a story telling business, are afraid of the primordial version of story telling, namely legends, myths and the fight of good vs evil. It is those stories that have kept story telling alive and popular throughout the course of human history. How long will it take people to acknowledge things won't change now, if they haven't changed since the Dawn of human civilization?

It certainly could be better, but still I believe it is far better than what one could expect after all the complications that accompanied it's creation. Introduction of new characters is quite brief and it all feels little rushed from time to time, but I think creators did the best they best considering the fact they had to fit in two hours of screen time. Yes, the plot Is very basic, it is here just to give bunch of heroes a reason to fight something. Yes, it isn't particularly original or even artistic, but NO it isn't garbage. If it should be considered a bad movie then all the ratings of Marcel avengers movies should be reconsidered because it is Injustice to praise them and them hate this. Most of the aspects critics Don't like in this film Are contained in marvel movies to. So, this Is a comics book adaptation with all it means. the strongest it has to offer in my opinion Is a likable team player by well chosen actors.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","What should have been like an epic season finale ends up as a mid season filler","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3878720/?ref_=tt_urv","xamtaro","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19392148/?ref_=tt_urv","8 December 2017","It is no simple task for a movie to introduce 3 new characters, present a narrative of these characters coming together, build camaraderie, flesh out the stakes, the threat, follow up on existing plot threads from past movies and give closure to the development arc of Superman all within a mere 2 hours (including opening and end credits). JUSTICE LEAGUE is brief to the point of absurdity and most of its problems result from the post production process of editing and incorporating reshoots all in a bid to cater to the lowest common denominator.Following the death of Superman, criminals have become emboldened, plunging the world into a state of terror. In London, Wonder Woman stops an extremist bomb Attack while back on Gotham City, Batman is investigating the appearance of flying alien creatures that seem attracted to intense feelings of fear. A close encounter with one of the creatures convinces Batman that the alien invasion he so feared was imminent and he proceeds to recruit the super powered individuals whom he discovered in the previous movie BATMAN V SUPERMAN. Meanwhile, the alien warlord known as Steppenwolf makes planetfall intent on stealing 3 ancient artifacts known as the Motherboxes in order to unite them and summon forth a power that will destroy the earth.The first act is a hasty haphazardly edited sequence jumping around the world and from character to character. There is hardly a sense of chronology or flow to the scenes! Perhaps if the movie was edited to focus on one character at a time culminating in the arrival of Steppenwolf at Paradise Island it would have flowed better. Instead it feels like scenes just end prematurely to cut to a wholly unrelated scene only to cut back minutes later. Arguably the flow improves once the team gets together for their first mission to investigate mysterious abductions in Gotham.Problems of its truncated narrative aside, JUSTICE LEAGUE does a good job of establishing its characters and building the camaraderie. The chemistry between teammates is impeccable. Their unique personalities play off each other beautifully and there are tender emotional moments interspersed throughout the script. My only beef with the script is all the random moments of humour. It just does not mix well. This is an end of the world scenario and you have awkward slapstick, flat jokes and even traditionally serious characters like Batman trying to be funny. With its laughable dialogue peppering even serious battle scenes, the stakes are trivialised and it becomes difficult to take their story seriously. The hodgepodge Of 2 very differing styles courtesy 2 very different directors is evident from the get go with character even changing appearances between scenes clearly giving away evidence the insertion of reshoots. Even the overall look of the move was given an overhaul. Gone is the evocative colour filters of past movies replaced with a garish palette. Also in removing the filters, the CGI elements stand out more due to the lighting mismatch with the non-CGI elements. This is a huge pity as much of the action depends on visual effects. Even the villain Steppenwolf is a full CGI character. Thankfully he is a compelling threat. His limited screen time gives him an air of mystery like one of those traditional slasher movie villains and his twisted personality really comes through. The action is also masterfully shot for the most part utilising dynamic camera angles and slow motion to give the perfect resemblance to comic book panels brought to life. Only the final battle comes across as disappointing and generic (and very obviously a reshoot).It pains me to have to counter every positive with a negative but there is something I have always enjoyed and it is when movies go beyond being mere stimulators of adrenaline and endorphins, and instead address and explore deeper themes in the narrative. Movies that get you thinking. Justice League was none of this and it is sad because there was a lot of potential to explore. We are hinted at the more metaphorical aspect of a movie as a tale of reviving hope in the most hopeless of situations. We are hinted at moral conflicts and the ethics of Batman's sudden proposal to revive Superman with an alien device. We are hinted at a much deeper narrative surrounding the individuals and their emotional baggage. Hinted hinted hinted but never explored or even addressed outright. Themes that were explored in past movies, the deconstruction/reconstruction of a savior archetype, the impact of super powered beings on international politics, the world's reaction to such beings, and much more all abandoned.The result is a truncated summary of an epic that could have been. Sacrificing thematic depth for levity robs the movie of any uniqueness it may have had in this day and age saturated with superficial superhero shows. It's inconsistency is it's greatest weak spot and seems to indicate that the studio had little interest in telling a compelling tale. The amazing action, the bombastic battles which showcase the extent of each characters' skills, and the near perfect portrayal of each character show that this movie was meant merely as a primer: a means to instill an audience with a greater interest in its characters so as to get them on board for the many inevitable spinoffs. It may make you see superheroes as cool again in a most perfunctory way, but little else beyond that.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's completely rubbish. But it's still entertaining. Not because it's good. But because it's relentlessly, perfectly stupid. It all plays like a Saturday morning cartoon. And even though it's a total mess, it's de-Snydered enough to not be as much of a dark, dull dirge as Batman V Superman. It makes The Avengers look like The Godfather Part II. Aquaman and the guy that played Cyborg were surprisingly good. Ezra Miller breaks even on the annoying/adorkable front. And Affleck is still a decent actor in a dodgy suit and a flaccid, jibbering thankless role.
It's 90% exposition and contrivance, 90% CGI and 110% reshoots. Basically think of everything bad that happens in movies you hate and this one pretty much has it all. It even has four poor Russians living near a nuclear reactor who have cracks in the wall with the shotgun on it, candles because, you know, they're poor, and a Russian nesting doll because, you know, they're Russians. That's basically says it all about this move. Neither Snyder, nor Whedon, nor Warners are at fault for this movie alone; absolutely every single person that worked on it from caterers to casting agents, from runners to ringleaders should all equally share the blame for this fairly inoffensive but undoubted waste of everybody's time.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

All I can say to that is, I WAS A F'ING IDIOT, IT IS QUITE SIMPLY MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!First the positives: Ezra Miller steals the film as the humorous, exciting Flash. Jason Momoa is Cool as Hell as Aquaman. Ben Affleck is outstanding as our favourite Bat while Gal Gadot is simply 'Wonderful'(pun intended) as Wonder Woman. Ray Fisher does a fine job up is upstaged by the above. The rest of the cast is fantastic do their part. The action sequences are great, not over the top and pit the characters as we have seen in the other DCU films in movements that look like they have been taken straight out of the panels of some of the greatest DC publications of all time. I could go for hours, but then I will give away parts that, you will soon see yourself.Now the Negatives: Ummmmm, it should have gone for four and a half hours, because it was SPECFREAKIN'TACULAR!!! There are no other Negatives!!!!Do yourself a favour, don't walk, run and see this. I think it is the movie of 2017. Some has commented that the CGI is poor or Ben Affleck look's like he wants to be somewhere else. I think these people should go see a Woody Allen movie, order themselves some Tofu and honestly F'Off!!!Witness the Birth of the League 10/10","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

The movie is a straight follow up from BvS, and focus heavily on the League, which is the best thing about this movie.I didn't care that much for the villain though, and didn't set my expectations high, as we've only have had a few menacing villans as time has expanded. (Looking at you Heath Ledger)When it comes to stand outs for me, i gotta hand it to Ray Fisher's performance in this movie. What an enthusiastic actor man. Every Cyborg scene and moments with him, had me glued to the screen. People talk about that the CGI was awful, though i absolutely disagree. Cyborg was the most interesting character in this movie. Batman though, was written poorly. He had his moments, but nothing close to his warehouse scene in BvSThe movie in overall was great and entertaining.

Batman is by far the worst disappointment for me but I'm sure everyone reading this will have there own opinion on which character is the worst. The funny thing is that I actually don't mind Ben Affleck playing the bat. It's how they present the character that is most disappointing. Where is the batman who defeated the likes of the joker and bane. That batman was a force to be reckoned with, a figure who commanded both fear and respect. And where has the tumbler gone? That was a masterpiece of a batmobile. Batman used to have clever gadgets and could disappear in a moment's notice. Any idiot can be given more guns but the bat was always more than that. 
The rest of the characters, apart from the flash and superman , I had never even heard of. There was no emotional investment in any of the characters. I didn't find myself rooting for any character which was ashame. What this film was is basically Avengers Assemble but with different characters and no storyline.
As a short filmmaker myself I can tell you that it takes nearly as much effort to make a bad film as it does to make a good one. But I honestly thought they would have learnt there lesson after batman vs superman which was equally disappointing. 
It quite rare when I review a film that I can't find something that is positive about it even when it was a horrific disappointment. But I can honestly say that I cannot find a single element of this film with I was even remotely satisfied with. 
The characters looked animated most of the way through and possessed abilitys not remotely believable. Not looking at anyone In particular (wonder woman). This film was way too cgi heavy. I really wanted to believe that this would finally be the DC powerhouse smash hit that would level the playing field between DC and marvel but the truth is that marvel are wiping the floor with DC and if DC don't turn things around pronto their fan base is going to start shrinking. No matter what the critics say the toughest critics will always be the fans.
This film scores 1/5 for me and that is because it lacks in all areas
Weak plot
Weak characters (including the villain)
Very weak character development.
DC need to wake up and smell the coffee but I have a feeling that they are going too lose a lot more money before they realise that they have made a mistake. Snyder is not the right man for the job on this occasion I would offer the franchise to Christopher Nolan.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

That's actually hard to fully get on board with. As much as Warner Brother Studios continues to play catch up with their rival film studio, they have managed to pull through in certain areas. As divisive as Man of Steel (2013) and Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) were to many viewers, Warner Brothers has managed to finally establish their set of shared movie universes. And as much flack as they get for stumbling along the way, they are persistent, you have to give them that. Now with their magnum opus here, finally bringing to life famous characters and successfully uniting them altogether, their end result is just okay. They got Wonder Woman (2017) right, so how did this turn out to be just okay? It's just a lot when it's all said and done.Directed again by Zack Snyder, the plot follows the events of Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) with the death of Superman (Henry Cavill). Fearing that with Superman gone, earth won't be able to defend itself from a new evil named Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciar√°n Hinds), Batman (Ben Affleck) gathers Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) as backup. There's also a subplot about the possibility of resurrecting Superman using what is called a ""mother box"". According to Wonder Woman, there were three and if all were combined it would be the beginning of the end. The script was written by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon of which both have had their share of successful films. Whedon is obviously known for leading Marvel's The Avengers (2012) and Serenity (2005). Chris Terrio was the writer to Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and Argo (2012). But even with this premise and setup, there are still problems to be had with the script.Recurring supporting characters are almost pointless in this entry, except for a few. Actors like Jeremy Irons as Alfred and Joe Morton as Silas Stone are used because they are necessary for certain characters. However, other characters like Commissioner Gordon (J.K. Simmons), Lois Lane (Amy Adams), Martha Kent (Diane Lane), Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and even Mera (Amber Heard) are all characters that either can be reintroduced or debut for their first time in a another film. Jamming in all these other individuals throughout the movie just feel like the producers want everyone to remember these people exist. Another blunder is the whole cataclysmic plot device that somehow makes its way into every superhero film. Can there ever be a time where these kinds of things aren't used in ensemble movies? It's just a really tiresome setup. Lastly there's the concept of Superman's memory if he were to be brought back to life. If his memory does remain, how is it that he seems to remember only certain things?However even with that said, there are components that do work in this film's favor. Gone is the dark and and ho-hum atmosphere of Man of Steel (2013) and Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Now the tone has shifted to where things are more as one would say, normal. On top of that, the actors who share the lens together share great on screen chemistry. Momoa, Gadot, Affleck, Miller and Fisher all have their moments to shine. Momoa and Miller are really the ones who steal the show; which is impressive. Especially for Momoa, since Aquaman has always been thought of being the harder superhero to adapt correctly. Some of their interactions together are based on prior decisions, while others are analyzed through the time a choice is made at that very moment. Either way, the dialog held between these individuals are done so in a way that is enjoyable and lets the audience know that these protagonists are not serious all the time. Yet when a call to arms is made, this is another area where this movie shines.One thing's for sure, Zack Snyder knows how to create action spectacles and that's no different here. The action is better than his other efforts because the live-action doesn't look so much like a video game cut scene. This also in due part to Fabian Wagner's cinematography. Wagner, who has mostly used his skills on the small screen did an adequate job for this blockbuster. Many of the shots capture a lot of geography and hardly any of it is too close to make out. Wagner has filmed for the Game of Thrones and Sherlock series, and for Victor Frankenstein (2015). For music, the film score was composed this time by Danny Elfman. Thankfully Elfman really knows how to make a score work correctly. The drowning soundscapes of Hans Zimmer and Tom Holkenborg are hardly ever heard here and that's great. The Man of Steel (2013) theme is heard once but Elfman rightfully reuses John Williams' Superman (1978) theme and his own Batman (1989) theme during the film. That's classic music and it works better than anything else.While it may still have its problems of over bloated character appearances and overused plot devices, this entry has slightly improved over passed blunders. The action still entertains, the on screen chemistry between actors is great, and the film score is more organic in sound.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

This film has an overreliance on CGI, and has a somewhat disjointed narrative. With a touch of 'The Magnificent Seven' in plot the story rushes to bring the superheroes together for the purpose of producing the action sequences which is where it works best. The bickering and bonding among the characters spike the film with humour but sadly there is something missing in the charisma of some of these characters. Batman cuts a reduced figure - Ben Affleck's muscularity and desperate demeanour is appealing but he is less impressive delivering the droll humour and at times he is dull in the exchanges. A film with such a fantastical setting demands alacrity from all its characters but Cyborg offers little more than crabbiness leaving Wonder Woman to add some sparkle and charisma. By the second act fatigue sets in with repetition in the action sequences. It's a thinly-written story but there's plenty of good visual effects and Flash serves up some good one-liners.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

That's what happened here. When tragedy struck Zack Snyder's life, the producers of Warner Bros took it as an opportunity to change things around and deliver a product that would massively deviate from the tone and style used by Snyder in his previous entries in the DCEU and be a more fan-pleasing and aimed for mass consumption product. The problem is that by trying to blend together such contrasting filming styles, the final cut resulted in one of the most bizarre viewing experiences seen in a long time.
The first act of the movie, with the introduction of the main characters and the main threat, choppily edited though it may be, is competent enough. It's during the second and third acts, that the movie's problems become more glaring. Unfinished and rushed CGI, glaring photographic tones and poorly developed characters and story arcs, are the norm here. That being said, it turned out to be a more enjoyable experience than that of BvS (at least Superman behaves the way he's supposed to). It's just to bad that because of some Warner exec's decisions, the movie turned out to be such a shooting and editing mess, that'll probably cost the planned sequels to be shelved for a very long time.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

What's the saying? Haters gonna hate? Well, I question the ability of some of these critics' ability to do their jobs... Justice League is Fantastic. Hands down. No one, no review what-so-ever, can convince me otherwise. I have now seen the film three times and it only got better with each viewing. None of what is criticized about this film is even remotely true and accurate. From the opening scene to the final battle, JL has everything a comic-book, superhero movie should have and more. The actors played their part beautifully and the chemistry between them on screen is top-notch. The CGI critique? Please. Unless directly pointed out (no thanks to social media) it goes completely unnoticed. That's the cold, hard fact. Those who claim they can tell Snyder from Whedon...again, give me a break. If it was never known or said, again, completely unnoticed. Deal with it. Steppenwolf is by no means weak. He was menacing. He was threatening. He was the big bad he was meant to be and the perfect precursor for what is to come, or should I say, who is coming. My one and only half-complaint is that Mera didn't get enough screen time that she deserved because she is a force to be reckoned with. Thankfully, there is a standalone Aquaman film coming and that minor, minor flaw will be rectified. In closing, ignore the trash- talk and go see the movie for yourself. Form your own opinions, but if you didn't like it, fine, but there is no need to trash someone because they liked it. Doing that says more about you than the film. Sad. I loved it. Thought it was spectacular. Most definitely entertaining and suspenseful and made me thirst for more (in a great way). 10/10 4 out of 5 Stars Two Thumbs Up Justice League is a must-see.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

They were both not a masterpiece at some point but they were both popcorn movies really enjoyable and thrilling with some great leading ! Yet they both had problems wheiter on the directions. This review is on Justice League so sorry for the Alien:Convenant Cameo.
Justice League was a movie us fans of comics and supeheros have all been waiting so long for Justice League to finnaly have it chances on the big screen.
It wasn't has good has we expected it to be. But what can we really expect from a movie that switched director midle production? My point is has a fan it was an honour and a dream to see the League and I enjoyed the movie I came out with a smile on my face and was happy that I had lived such a fun experience an experience I had waited so much for.Acting: 8/10: The actors all had chemistry together. We can all see they had fun making the movie! And it turned out to be good, Jason Momoa is the best Aquaman we could of hoped for, Gal Gadot is a stunning and a perfect Wonder Woman, Ray Fisher brings a great character in Cyborg and he really looks honored to play Cyborg, Ezra Miller is a funny and touching Flash, Henry Cavill is has good has expected, Ciara Hinds has a magnificent voice, Ben Affleck so there is my -2 out of 10..... DC fans which I am may bash me oh that -2 but I am saying it out loud I don't like Ben at all.... yall can say whatever you want I still don't like him.... I miss Bale and Keaton. Directions: 7/10: It felt so rushed (and it was) the runtime doesn't help at all. I mean we all know what happen to Snyder it is a tragedy and kinda is the main problem in the direction. Whedon taking over may not have been the best .... because his vision and Snyder's are completly different on many levels. But he did what he can so I still thank him for that .... yet he still made terrible choices and this movie was a Snyder movie and he changed the vision of it. But for a movie with two completly different directors the directions turned just fine for me.Cgi: 5/10: That Superman moustache cgi was cringe-worthy..... the final battle cgi was bad and the cgi on Steppenwolf was pretty bad too...... But the cgi on Flash was pretty damn incredible ! And Cyborg suit was actually a suprise since it was actually amazing! Music: 9/10: The Music was fun !!! Even though we haven't really have all of it since half was cut still the results were great the music used matched every scenes!Characters: 10/10: One thing we can all agree on is how DCEU has a touch with their characters such as in Suicide Squad or Justice League both had problems but their characters weren't one of them problems.Place in the DCEU: 7/10: It was a great follow-up to Batman vs Superman.The story was well placed for sequels.... yet it came out after one of the year finest movie: Wonder Woman........ which was a hard movie to compete with so expections were even higher than before for Justice League. But the biggest problem was that we din't really got to know all of our characters the movie came out to early.... we should of explored the characters a little more before making a movie about all of them joining together...Enjoyment: 10/10: If you're a DC fan or a person looking for a fun time well Justice League is November answer! It with cheer you up with a great smile. Don't find it's mistake just Watch it and enjoy it ! That's a 8/10 for me ! Thank for reading my review! Sorry for my English .... not main language...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Zack Snyder or Joss Whedon's 'Justice League' is the ultimate build up to the 6 heroes coming together, 3 of which were set up, the other 3 not at all. The characters relationships work, however that's the only thing that works in this dumpster fire. Aquaman is a bland character and is very unlikable anytime he is on screen, to make up for this he makes jokes that don't land and does some 'badass' stuff, like hitting the cgi villian Steppenwolf. Batman does a complete 360 and changes from a brooding dark basically murderous vigilante to a jokey Tony Stark type figure. It doesn't help that Ben Affleck looks barely awake throughout the course of this film. Wonder Woman is just as boring and 1 dimensional as she was in 2016's 'Dawn of Justice' with only her solo movie providing any reason to care, the countless references to Steve Trevor annoyingly remind us that we could be watching a better movie. Ezra Miller's the Flash is an attempt to recreate essentially Spider-man, removing any intelligence that the character previously had, in place for a quirky, constantly messing up Flash, purely for comedic relief. Cyborg is bland and one of the few interesting characters that the movie refuses to explore. The film has awful writing with jokes that almost never land, and a plot that is so generic and straightforward that it just makes you realize the best thing about this movie. It's so straightforward and generic that you can watch it as just a dumb superhero popcorn flick. This film is unintentionally funny, and looks ugly compared to Snyder's usual beautiful style, the CGI is awful with some shots I can compare to that of the Injustice games and the main villain Steppenwolf who appears as a PlayStation character. The effects are awful, references to Wonder Woman that are shoehorned in, no consistency in this cinematic universe, and a film ugly to look at. However this film is dumb-fun and feels like a Saturday morning cartoon special and I had fun watching it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's been a rough road for DC, with all but one of the movies being either panned by critics, or receiving mixed reviews. After a complicated production process, the final product is quite the mixed bag. First, the good. The league works well together, and they all develop quite well. Batman and Aquaman learn to work in a group, Wonder Woman is still the strong leader she was, and the Flash is a good comic relief. That chemistry between the group is vital, as the movie could not possibly be good in the slightest without it. And, to the movie's credit, they handle this quite well. The Flash was surprising, and the movie managed to give him a backstory and character development. Aquaman looked and fought cool, but wasn't as interesting a character as he could have been. Batman was much better in this movie than he was in BvS, and they at least tried to redeem him from his portrayal in BvS. If you think he's going to be as good as he was in the Nolan trilogy, don't. Jeremy Irons is also a great Alfred. Wonder Woman may not be as good as she was in her solo movie, but the way she and the Amazons connect to the overall story is very interesting. And, the bad. Steppenwolf was one lame villain. He's remarkably generic, seeking the Mother Boxes to destroy the world. And the fight scenes with him, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman appear to be recycled. His lack of clear motivation is also a problem. Yes, there is apparently a deleted scene with Darkseid in it, but that really should have been in it to begin with. Even if it's exactly like the Thanos scene in The Avengers, it would have made the movie as a whole better than if they dropped it. Cyborg is all edgy and brooding. While that is understandable, given his situation, it just feels like the same crap we saw in the previous DCEU movies. Still, his presence here also means we'll probably never see a proper Teen Titans movie. Superman's return, even ignoring its predictability, was extremely cringeworthy. Also, it teases Green Lantern, but he doesn't appear outside of flashbacks. That's not cool. Given the internal issues there were at DC, you can pick this movie apart and see ""the Zack Snyder parts"" and ""the Joss Whedon parts."" It's quite evident who would have done it better. The future of the DCEU has been questioned lately, as Justice League didn't do nearly as expected at the box office. DC absolutely needs to turn things around in their next few films if they want this franchise to be successful.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Of course, its nowhere close to The Avengers, but its not trash like most of the reviews say. Christian Bale is a better Batman for me, but Ben Affleck isn't bad either. All the actors were really good. The only thing that bugged me was the CGI villain. Other than that, I think its a fine comeback for DCEU.

"6","/10","Marked improvement over Suicide Squad, but falls short of being spectacular","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3864933/?ref_=tt_urv","mitreflec","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur82582708/?ref_=tt_urv","22 November 2017","I didn't know what to expect for Justice League - after the alleged travesty of Batman vs Superman (a film I decidedly skipped) and Suicide Squad, contrasted against Wonder Woman, Justice League could either go south so far or transcend all expectations to wow its audience.Safe to say, it didn't go either way.Pacing-wise, it felt a bit all over the place. It started out slow and steady, introducing each member of the Justice League in its own time (as opposed to the montage in Suicide Squad), but conflict resolution was over in a blip. The apparently mandated 2h runtime could be to blame for.Plot-wise, it did try to undo its mistakes from Batman vs Superman. However, it came across as shoddy patchwork with no purpose other than to erase the events of the aforementioned film. The erasure of the events is done so clumsily that any potential consequences are immediately resolved within minutes, pretty much leaving the audience like ""What? That's It?""Following the idea of undoing the events of Batman vs Superman, it could've created interesting villains. However, Justice League opts for the 'safe' villain - a textbook villain that isn't impressionable, but can do no wrong.The characters in the Justice League itself are quite interesting. There are outstanding ones, as there are ones that just fade into the background.Ben Affleck's Batman just didn't do it for me. It's been a running gag that Batman's only got riches without any 'real' power or skillset that just keeps being emphasised in the film. Sure, that's comic relief, but at the expense of Batman being valued as an asset to the team. By the end of all the gags, you're just left thinking, ""So why is Batman even needed in the film?"" It would've been better to see Batman demonstrate his redeeming qualities, maybe as a leader or a tactician, but as far as I can tell, the film makes no such effort.In contrast, Henry Cavill's Superman is just too powerful. As a character, Superman is done brilliantly, but his skillset is far too broad and far too great. He's basically overpowered, leaving me wondering why there was a need for Batman vs Superman at all. If he is all that powerful, and Batman is lacking, a conflict between the two seems like a ludicrous idea. (Again, coming from someone who hasn't watched Batman vs Superman) If he is all that powerful, why the need for the Justice League? Surely the Justice League allows heroes with a niche skill set to help each other out, but if DCEU's Superman exist, why bother at all? Justice League just seems like Superman and the Gang.Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is just as charming as she was in the character's feature film. She has grown as a fighter and a person, but still has her own demons which she grapples with, making her that much more likable and charismatic.Jason Momoa's Aquaman appears long enough in the film for audiences to have a good idea on what his character is like, but short enough that leaves them wanting for more in his own standalone film. Needless to say, his performance doesn't disappoint.Ezra Miller's The Flash is brilliant. He provides the appropriately-timed comedic relief, all while showcasing what he can offer to the team. The shots of him in action are done perfectly, complementing his humorous character. I'll definitely be waiting on a solo film from The Flash.Ray Fisher's Cyborg - not too sure what to feel about the character just yet. As the centerpiece of the team in this film, a lot is expected from his character. However, due to the compelling performance of his counterparts, Cyborg seems the least impressionable of the team. He doesn't really add anything new to the table, other than what is required to facilitate the plot. That doesn't make Cyborg bad, though - he is decent, but just not strong enough.Overall, this film is a 6/10. Just above average, as it is a cut above its predecessors, but even with its brilliant cast (albeit disappointment in the portrayal of some key team players), its pacing is haphazard and the plot is standard superhero-fare, with nothing fresh to offer.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Justice league in neither as good as Wonder Woman, nor as bad as BatmanVSuperman. What it is, is half a rushed movie, chopped up to look like a full film. Imagine watching lord of the rings, but only the scenes with Frodo and Sam. It would still be a OK movie, but it would never come close to what it could have been. In the same way, Justice League was not a bad film, it did however leave me wondering just what was left on the cutting room floor to fit the WarnerBrothers 120 minute limit.The story flows cleanly, albeit in somewhat strange directions at times. The characters all get decent time to tell their stories; no mean feat considering the number of leads, most with no real histories. The visual are mixed, switching from beautiful scenes of pure Snyder vison, to scenes of unfinished CGI and sloppy backdrops. The music was something of a letdown, with a few notable exceptions, most of the scores and songs used were uninspiring and became background noise.The real star of the show is the characters. Just as well in a movie, existing solely to bring unknown characters to the foreground. Gal Gadot's Wonder woman has more than proven herself to be a fan favourite character and the writers have allowed her to remain unchanged. Her strength and passion drawing the others in and acting a sentinel for the heroes. Ben Affleck's Batman has traded in his previous fury and grit, as seen in BvS and instead become the wise determined father of the group. His dry wit and charisma shining through, to make him into the backbone the JL needs. Ray Fisher's Cyborg fell somewhat under the radar, not because his character wasn't important, but more because it was important for his character. The hidden powerhouse of the group, noticeably sensitive and wounded, seeking refuge amongst peers. Jason Momoa's Aquaman was a standout, at times, funny, sensitive, aggressive and possessive. Momoas acting chops are undeniable at this point and his skills are on full display here. Ezra Miller's Flash surprised me, not only with how comic faithful it was, but also with just how damn funny he was. Absolutely the comic relief, the flash injects the levity the movie needs, when it needs it and keep it from descending into the morose as many DCEU films have done before.Justice league is a character movie about heroes coming together and becoming a team, in that respect, the movie is an undeniable triumph. The actions scenes are haphazard at best while the tone, music and the pacing were noticeably underpar. For all its flaws though, justice league remains an enjoyable watch, with engaging characters in an enticing story, brilliantly acted and with an unmistakable superhero flare. I don't doubt that reviews for justice league will be brutal and unforgiving, pointing out the films problems and pretending its charm doesn't exist. Don't be fooled, this is a fantastic movie, hiding beneath the veneer of bureaucratic Hollywood politics. When the uncut version of this movie drops, it will likely get the respect it deserves. In the mean time, justice league remains, if not the movie the DCEU deserves, most certainly the one it needs right now.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There are way too many jokes, and most of the jokes aren't even funny and don't contribute to the plot in anyway. It sounds forced and just sounds dumb. The soundtrack by Danny Elfman was ok, but it just did not match with this movie. During the fight scenes, the soundtrack was so quiet and light that it didn't feel like an action scene. The time spent on Cyborg is almost zero. Cyborg has never appeared in a live action movie that I know of until this movie, and audiences are left to wonder what Cyborg's backstory is. The mother boxes are poorly explained, and SteppenWolf talks way too much. I would not recommend this movie. Instead, I would recommend Snyder's Cut of this movie. Its called ""Zach Snyder's Justice League"". It is a lot better than this garbage movie. I will not be seeing another movie by Joss Whedon, as he made Wonder Woman do inappropriate scenes and made Ben Affleck not want to return as batman, and overall ruined the DCEU forever.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Their comments ranged from ""not fun"" to arty comments like ""didn't delve deeply enough into the superhero mythos"". Sheesh. IMO a superhero movie is about popcorn, grip the edge of your seat action, and hopefully some laughs. Reviewers cannot make up their dang minds. Comic book movies (unless helmed by Christopher Nolan or George miller) are just supposed to be fun.The top four actors (Cavill, Gadot, Mamoa and Affleck) acquit themselves well. Eisenberg, Miller and Fisher are woefully miscast and hurt the film every time they're on screen. Likely why fisher's role was reduced in this version, despite his complaints about unfairness. Besides, Cyborg? There are SO many DC heroes that would have been a better choice.Because this version was a chopped up reshoot, it is, well, choppy.But the humor and comraderie are welcomed.The biggest disappointment is that we finally got a chance to our favorite DC heroes (with some good actors in the roles) and they blew it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Just look at her.Ben Afleck is awesome as always, and I actually prefer the more modest, yet still mighty batman that he brought to Justice League.The only two things I am not very satisfied with, is that we didn't get enough of the great Jeremy Irons, and that the cyborg character was pretty much irrelevant to the story.Whiny geeks will always whine no matter what.

The acting, with an ensemble cast featuring Gal Gadot, Ben Affleck, and Jason Momoa, brings charisma to their respective roles, yet the film struggles to find a cohesive tone. The film editing, attempting to blend the distinct styles of Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon, results in a narrative that feels disjointed at times. The strength lies in the camaraderie of the heroes and the visual spectacle of their powers in action. However, the weakness is evident in the rushed plot and uneven pacing that prevent the movie from reaching its full potential. The music, while delivering on heroic themes, doesn't leave a lasting impact. With a 6/10 rating, ""Justice League"" falls short of the superhero team-up glory, offering glimpses of greatness but ultimately succumbing to its behind-the-scenes challenges.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They are in a big quandary. They have no idea what they should do with their films. They used to make dark films (One of the reasons I prefer DC over Marvel) but critics were not too happy with that, so now they are going the Marvel way, making films with colours and a lighter tone. Marvel has excelled the art of making such films and it works most of the time. That is exactly what DC is trying to do here. Unfortunately, it did not work. Some of the jokes were good but most of them were cringeworthy.
Justice League is not that bad but it could have been much better. I mean, It is the first Justice League movie. Who was not excited for this? I loved the animated JL and was really pumped up for this. That is why was a big letdown for me. It was too cliched and weak. I have two big problems with this film.
The villain is too generic - just like Marvel villains (Marvel villains are pretty weak. Hela was amazing though). Steppenwolf is another one of those I-am-going-to-destroy-the-world kind. He is a powerful villain in the comics, the movie version sucked. Say what you want to say about Man of Steel but Zod was an amazing villain. One of the most well developed villains in superhero films ever.
Another problem with this film is that the characters are not well developed. I think they should have made the solo films first. First Avengers came out after Iron Man, Spiderman, Captain America, Hulk and Thor. We knew most of those characters. That can not be said about this film. We had three new characters without any development. The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg. They were all flat and one dimensional.
I have loved Ben Affleck as Batman in the previous films but his acting was pretty wooden in this one. It seemed to me that he was not interested. Same is the case with Gal Gadot. She is fine but she was much better in her solo film. Director matters when it comes to getting the best out of your actors. Too bad Jenkins did not direct it and Snyder left in the middle.
There were other minor issues with the film. The CGI was pretty video-gamish. You can deliver a much better experience for $300 Million. I have no idea what they spent that amount on. Also, the background score was totally forgettable. I could recognise the Batman, WW and Superman themes and that was all.
Now the good things.
The Amazonians fighting Steppenwolf is pretty well done.
Overall, Justice League is another forgettable flick from DC. It is not as vomit-inducing as Suicide Squad but it is not great either.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I mean I came for Henry Cavill, but I will stay for Jason Momoa too, but making us wait so long for Superman was a bit like his minimal part in 'Batman Vs Superman' (I didn't see the Director's Cut). I like both Supe and Aquaman for their characters as much as their muscle. Neither got the right screen time in this film.
I also like Wonder Woman, but Batman played by Ben Affleck doesn't work for me. The Flash was a surprise too, as I had expected a version of the one from the TV series, but Ezra's take is completely different to that other guy from Glee's. I didn't mind his character though. As for Cyborg, I don't know enough about him really and that is true even after seeing this film. How does he do all the things he achieves here, it wasn't clear at all.
They really aren't much of a team and it's still heavily Batman focused despite the antagonist being part of Aquaman and Wonder Woman's history primarily.I am a Marvel fan, I have read their comics and I like the stories and the films that are produced. I have not read any DC comics and don't rate many of their films that highly so far, so if you're looking for a review that isn't going to compare this film to the genius that Marvel films produce, you're reading the wrong one.Where DC fails, with the films that I have seen, is that they forget that not everybody is an uber fan. Not everyone gets the fact that Mrs Johannes the cleaning lady from scene three once appeared in a Superman comic in 1968, but there is a lot of that here for those fans and that's fine, but I think their focus is too much on pleasing these hardcore fans and not enough about bringing everyone in to enjoy it.
I also think that they rushed these few films out in order to compete with Marvel's Avengers and the build up to Endgame, without ensuring that the story was good enough first and the actors were strong enough for their parts or even giving them enough of their own series to be well established before this film, as they must surely have been in the comics. Marvel didn't do this with Captain America or Thor I hear you cry, but they didn't need to, they got it right first time.A lot of the film seems quite simplistic, there aren't the twists and turns you get with Marvel or the techno jargon to explain things properly. If theirs something a bit scientific in Iron Man, they will bring in a character who doesn't know what they're talking about so that it can be explained to them, and as a result, the audience who may not have degrees in rocket science and this is why Marvel succeeds almost every time.This film just misses something key that made 'Avengers Assemble' so much better. I'm not a film maker, but it's certainly not the story I would have chosen as the opener for this team.I know a lot of DC fans will say that the Marvel characters were stolen from DC, but what they did when they allegedly took them was to make them much better and more polished, because DC had already shown them where the characters flaws were. They learned from DC's mistakes to make their product more realistic and believable as well as being easier to access.
We haven't had time to get to know the characters here or at least these actors in these roles, before this film was made so I didn't really want to cheer them on, because who are they really?The stories formula is very simple too, it has similarities to some of the Marvel films, so even if DC did do it first in the comics, Marvel makes them look like they were copying by getting it on the big screen first and they did it with much more style.I think the production itself isn't that good either and relies on CGI a bit too much. Cyborg is actually a very weird shape for example and even Jar Jar Binks had better definition than Steppenwolf. Allegedly he was Born To Be Wild, but I didn't see it.Take all of that out of the equation and you've got an okay superhero film. It scores a 6 for me, because even though it's not done brilliantly, it's still a superhero film, which is what I like to watch.I would definitely be interested in watching the Zac Snyder cut, because I think this film was too short and I'm definitely missing something, although I was kind of glad when it finished.I can only hope that now that The Justice League is established a new story can be written that really shows how good the characters can be for the next film. And lose Jesse Eisenberg, who on Krypton thought that was a good idea?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The DC Universe doesn't feel the need to crack a joke every 20 seconds like Marvel movies(10 in Thor), this makes it feel more like reading a DC comic book which often dealt with darker themes. The colour palette in the movie is brilliantly done, remiscent of the beautiful airbrushed artwork of the 80's comic books I read as a child.
The criticism of the bad guy is valid, he is boring and generic, but then again, so is the bad guy in countless cape movies. 
The one thing I found jarring was the casting of Jason Mamoa as Aquaman, I couldn't think of many actors worse suited to the role. As I stated earlier, the movie's visuals are highly reminiscent of 80's artwork, so why you wouldn't cast an Aquaman that looked and acted like hero we grew up with is hard to understand and may negatively affect the upcoming movie. Maybe enough GOT fans will up the attendance.
Anyway, ignore the critics, unless you are a fanatical Marvel movie fan you will probably enjoy this movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The way they cut several scenes from the film made it very empty, without good development and with quick events. Two hours is a good amount of time for him, but they didn't know how to use it. Characters that had not yet been introduced in this universe were very poorly introduced, Cyborg and Flash are very weak characters and do not have a good development. Superman is left out, but when he appears he becomes a very strong character who minimizes the other heroes, making it seem that they would not be able to save the world. The brighter colors, the more heroic Superman and the beginning of the film are some positive points that do not make it a complete disaster.

And, his power is living underwater and having tattoos... Pass.)...Wiki the Justice League - there have been like 100 different members of the Justice league. So, what's with RoboCop? If you have both Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot, then you have to come up with a better group of supporting cast and a better script. Again, The Flash worked out - but, RoboCop sucked and Stepenwolf was better left playing 'Magic Carpet Ride' in some Casino bar somewhere, because that whole storyline was ridiculous. This movie was a reaction to the popularity of The Avengers films. I don't like Marvel comics, I don't watch The Avengers movies, and I think this movie was a huge disappointment.I won't watch this movie again.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

First half hour is still pretty terrible though, choppy, disjointed and uninvolving.Gets better as it goes along.Each character has their own distinct personality and some good lines.Definitely an effort was made to lighten the overall tone and feel of the movie, even as it does the whole end of the world scenario yet again. But I guess the JL wouldn't be necessary if the stakes weren't that high.Stepenwolf and his flying minions were pretty standard baddies though, pretty meh through and through and never really stood out one way or the other.Plot was as vanilla as it gets.Action sequences were pretty snappy and fun, didn't wear out their welcome. Byplay and interactions among the team were best part of movie.Performances were really solid, actually created likable characters, well likable-ish for Ben anyway.and there were some decent chuckles and the occasional laugh to be had.Overall not as good as WW, definitely better than BvS and SS.Worth a look","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Justice League is one of the most disappointing super-hero film and it could have been worse if not for Gal Gadot's tremendous performance and Ezra Miller's comic relief.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3869245/?ref_=tt_urv","shobanchittuprolu","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44415751/?ref_=tt_urv","28 November 2017","Justice League (2017): I never expected DC would have such downfall whereas Marvel is building an unanimous string base allover the world.I may not be a fan of any super-hero films but I used to love Justice League series in my childhood.Even the animated films of DC used to provide enough fun but what happened now?While Man of Steel is below average,I thought BvS is pretty decent compared to its negative reception,Suicide Squad wasted its amazing potential and Wonder Woman is the only film which put DC on a success track.But,I was proved wrong that DC have no idea of doing justice to Justice League..The only thing DC got right till now is casting of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman.Plot: The Superman (Henry Cavill) has perished, and the world is in peril. Still haunted by visions of an apocalyptic future, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) continues to investigate Earth's metahumans, and along with Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) recruits a speedster named Barry Allen a.k.a. The Flash (Ezra Miller), a water-powered Arthur Curry a.k.a. Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and cybernetically enhanced Victor Stone a.k.a. Cyborg (Ray Fisher) to form a ragtag team. Unfortunately, Bruce's visions start to become fully realized with the arrival of Steppenwolf (Ciar√°n Hinds) and his Parademons - an alien force hunting three hidden devices known as Mother Boxes in hopes or reshaping the world. Knowing that their help is needed, Earth's hidden champions come out of the shadows to form an uneasy alliance and usher in a new age of heroes.My Review: Five films into the DCEU, the DC brains trust should have their s*it together by now. They should have an understanding of why their films are or aren't working as well as they could, i.e. they should have some idea as to why Wonder Woman worked but Man Of Steel, BvS:DoJ and Suicide Squad didn't.While previous DC films tried to be too serious,they tried to change into Marvel's way of generating comedy among characters.It rarely worked in Suicide Squad whereas Wonder Woman has good fun moments.But Justice League tries to look too cool which backfired very badly.Miller gets the bulk of the best lines although Momoa and Affleck trade a few zingers. These comedy moments are the only part which makes us bear this mess.The major drawback is in the storytelling and structuring. The efforts of introducing new characters, existing characters' motivations, and the intricacies of plot (with its triple MacGuffin) is almost too much for the first half of the film. The film struggles to get any real momentum going as Batman and Wonder Woman try to put their team together, while slotting in some action set pieces, and detailing who and what the Big Bad is (who himself is one of the worst villains I had ever seen in a super-hero film).Aside from a few jokes ‚Äì which unfortunately don't always land where they're supposed to ‚Äì and a handful of enticing action sequences ‚Äì especially the ones surrounding Flash and Wonder Woman ‚Äì the film, as a whole, feels simplistic in structure and lazy in execution, with the story lacking substance, ingenuity and enough heart to leave a lasting impression.What works best in Justice League is the characterisations. These are popular superheroes for a reason, and they are well realised on the screen. Casting has never been a problem in the DCEU and again they nail it. Gadot was born to be Wonder Woman.She is undeniably the true star of the show.The film's smartest move is to recognise that Gadot is the beating heart of this enterprise. And given that this enterprise rests on a fairly straightforward idea, that a dark world needs hope above all else, you can't do much better than giving people the luminescent Israeli with the wide smile and twinkley eye.Miller ‚Äì the film's main source for comic relief ‚Äì and Momoa as the raggedy Aquaman, delivering engaging performances leaving Fisher's Cyborg as the least interesting of the lot.Affleck and Cavill still remains insipid.So,Justice League is one of the most disappointing super-hero film of all time and it could have been worse if not for Gal Gadot's tremendous performance and Ezra Miller's comic relief.My rating 5.25/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the previous movie, they killed off Superman right? In order to make a huge amount of drama, right? I mean... Superman is the most important character in the DC franchise pretty much, so killing him made some massive waves amongst the DC franchise fans and completely set the tone for future movies, because ""what were they going to do without Superman, the most powerful character there is!?"".... well.... with this movie, we now know exactly what their plan was... and it's pretty crappy tbh. They played with all DC fans' emotions by killing him, and then doing what they did in this movie just literally undid all of the future 'good will' that they had with fans.... fans were expecting some new and unique character arcs in the future movies, due to Superman being missing, but that would ACTUALLY have required some good writing and good story structure, which is something that it seems the movie's writers just weren't keen on... so instead they opted for the much easier route, and simply undid everything they built with the previous movie.You see, Marvel did exactly the same thing with Avengers Endgame... they undid all of the drama and suspense that they built with the previous movie, because they simply opted for the easier route of character arcs, instead of actually having to plan ahead and write better stories and plots for their characters, they literally just undid everything, and made it so that it's as if nothing that they showed in the previous movie actually happened.So.... in summation: The writers of this movie were lazy and the plot/story of this movie is all over the place as a result and not really even worth investing any thought into wrt. the affect this story has on the great DC universe, since the writers have already proven with this movie that they have NO problem with messing with or otherwise screwing around with the canon of this franchise... but, the movie has lots of action and if you're looking for a mind-melting amount of CGI fight scenes, then this is the movie for you. This movie could have been an 8/10 movie, if the writers weren't as lazy and slackjawed as they were.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

And as a Justice League fan I was also thrilled and excited to see this movie, being a fan of the Justice League animated series and Justice League comics I wanted to see the first live on screen appearance of my favourite childhood heroes. But I have to say I was little bit disappointed with the outcome. True enjoyed the movie but the final product, I was disappointed with. Once you see the movie it is clear that this is not the original version of the movie that was intended to hit the theatres or at least this was not the full version. The portrayal of the six characters that is mainly Superman, Aquaman, Wonder woman, Batman, Cyborg and Flash were good. Some may suggest that the characters of Cyborg could have been improved but still good job nonetheless. The movie was a lot of fun compared to the previous installments of the DCEU. It had a lot of humour in it compared to the dark, gritty and serious Batman v Superman movie. For any DC fans this movie definitely has some comic references here and there in some scenes which will excite them but to the general audience who are most probably not familiar with Aquaman and Cyborg this movie may not have the intended effect it should have had for them, especially with no solo origin movies. Zack Snyder tried his level best to explain the story of the new characters to his best but unfortunately because of the WB mandate of making the movie only 2 hour long significant portion of the movie was edited out, and the resultant problem is evident. This has caused a lot of pacing issues with the movie. Most of the scenes don't have a completion to them.The transition between different scenes is also not smooth. There is also use of extensive CGI, but still there are some scenes that falls apart such as the infamous moustache replacement which is visible in a few selected scenes. Plot was also week most probably due to the extensive editing done to the movie which also results in a weak villain who is one dimensional with no motive apart from conquering the world. Justice League is the result of what could have been the greatest movies of all time but failed because Warner brothers wanted a short film that would excite the general audience for the future DCEU movies, sacrificing plot, villain and importantly the loyal fans of DC. But Warner brothers did succeed in their motive of exciting the audience for the future of DCEU.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

They bring together a band of 6 heroes who were introduced with MoS, BvS and WW, to face a new foe (Steppenwolf) that requires a team of superpowered people to be defeated.All the tools were present. Diverse heroes, backgrounds, powers, villains, but still it fails to deliver. Why? For several reasons. Each reason itself shouldn't be a problem, but all together in one movie is too big a pill to swallow.Batman is a hero that can carry the whole of DC on his back, but not in a team. Batman himself is the personification of anti-social disorder in something that should feel like a team of friends or colleages. It also doesn't help that Ben Affleck seemed uninspired, as opposed to BvS. Wonder Woman has the advantage of mythology, but other than that, Gal Gadot (WW) and Jason Momoa (Aquaman) can't act for sh*t. Not sure if this is because of their acting skills, or because of a flawed script, because their lines where at times cringeworthy. Not too mention the villain. The good voice work is overshadowed by nothingness. The villain feels unknown, uninspired and uneffective. He never feels like the ultimate villain that might bring the apocalypse. After WW and BvS they AGAIN took the risk of having a CGI villain. Sometimes it works, but apparently not in this movie. More background information in order to be able to relate or to understand might have helped.This doesn't mean the movie has nothing to offer, because there are several good parts. First of all, what the movies did right was offer a glimps of more to come. Hints of Steppenwolf, Apokalips and Darkseid instead of showing too much. I hope DC will show more of Darkseid, with a proper introduction. Superman himself was never more interesting than here. He was not introduced as the most powerful hero, but as powerful and potentially very dangerous man. His turn from confused to good was rushed, but that is not Henry Cavill's fault. Cyborg's background sounds like the most generic one, but Ray Fisher's acting shows Cyborgs human conflicted side in a very robotic and alien body. Ray Fisher and Henry Cavill were the only ones in this movie who properly understand ""less is more"". Flash was also a welcome addition. Although sometimes misplaced, his comedy was what was lacking in the previous movies and it was never too much, although sometimes a distraction. Every team needs a lighter note.And finally the action. Although the CGI was at times obvious the action was a delight. It felt as if they let go, and gave every hero the chance to shine. The only thing lacking was an enemy that you could actually care about, but that doesn't diminish that this superhero movie is also an enjoyable action movie.Even with the good parts, this movie is flawed. It absolutely works as a standalone action movie for kids or for a new generation. But as a build up for a universe to expand on..... well, there is nothing that feels worth expanding on, due to the lacking of interesting backgrounds and connection.The lesson to be learned here: Even if all the tools for success are present, without chemistry and introduction, there is no decent end product.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I didn't hate Batfleck as much as I did in Batman vs. Superman, so that's a positive, I guess. Wonder Woman was herself, but because the film was totally lacking in depth and originality, her moments that were intended to be emotional or sincere just felt corny. That's no fault of Gal's--I really think she did the best with what she was given to work with. Cyborg was...there. The Flash was actually quite enjoyable: adorkable, clumsy and with a handful of humorous one-liners up his sleeve. When his solo movie comes around I will probably see it and enjoy it if they make it like a medley of Batman Begins and Spiderman: Homecoming. Aquaman was 100% the standout of this film for me. Jason Mamoa was absolutely great, especially in the non-fight scenes, but even in the midst of chaotic CGI monster tackling, he still got a few laughs out of me. I think I will really enjoy his solo film, particularly if they make it like Wonder Woman's origin story. This was probably the worst superhero film I have seen since Thor: The Dark World. But I've decided to just view it as an extended trailer for the new character's solo films. If you look at it from that perspective, it's alright. But as a movie, it's pretty awful.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

My problem here is that the actor playing the Flash creates a silly portrait of the hero, makes stupid mistakes and lacks personality. DC already has invested on the TV character who for me was a better Flash - people, specially kids already know him. Aquaman needed more time to balance his presence, the lord of the seas uses few times his command of the waters - perhaps the battle needed to be closer to a water source. Most fans wonder why Green Lantern was not in the film as he's took part in the original battle against the dark forces, perhaps this would have required another 30 minutes of film.","0 out of 10 found this helpful.

The Avengers stunt was carefully setup and well executed, with a charismatic villain. This new type of group superhero movie has now lost it's excitement quotient. I actually found the extended cut of Batman v. Superman to be an entertaining movie. I found Ben Affleck to be a good balance of smart and tough. He is slightly demoted this time around as we have to be committed to this being an ensemble piece. The introduction of the new characters are the bright spot, as we are introduced to actual new superheroes, instead of a reboot of spiderman, etc. The screen time spent on developing the Cyborg character, for instance, creates some depth and sympathy. Same for the Flash character, who visits his father in prison (obvious plot bait for a future episode). Aquaman is one of those weird superheroes that needs to be setup carefully. It is understandable that Hollywood has never tried to do this type of hero before. The villain, guess what, wants to destroy the world. He is part of the generic side of this story, being able to summon flying robot insect people (or something like that). You might expect that other subplots would arise involving others colluding with the main bad guy. Thankfully, subplots that add extra running time are kept to a minimum. Mainly, because with so many main characters, you have your hands full just keeping them all busy. Pacing is good with this film, trying it's best to get through a heavy emotional beat in a hurry. For me, I think a popcorn film needs no excuse to stay consistent with the number of minutes between action scenes. Joss Whedon found the right formula with ""The Avengers"", so you can expect his influence on Justice League to be familiar territory. Gone are the flashback/nightmare scenes that were a curveball from BvS. Wonder Woman is already a familiar character, so it is nice not to feel that she has to regurgitate much of her past. Her action scenes perhaps have a bit more imagination to them since she is still a new character with new superpowers. Jeremy Irons is more light-hearted than Michael Caine's portrayal of Alfred. It is too bad this film felt it had to hold back with the kind of world Zack Snyder had created. It ends up being not very exciting and more of a chore. Certainly the novelty of creating ensemble films are feeling stale. Nevertheless, to get a chance to see more Wonder Woman, and some likable new co-horts, you won't get bored.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Which in the end delivers a jumbled mess of a film, but unlike BVS and Suicide Squad there is a love of the material going into the film that I previously couldn't find in the other films. The cast is exceptional Gal Gadot fresh off of Wonder Woman is still killing it with her performance, Jason Mamoa is fun and charming in his role as Aquaman, Fisher as Cyborg gives a grounded and comic accurate portrayal and even Cavill is starting to have more fun as the Man Of Steel. Afleck is good, but he looks like he's much less interested than in BVS which is a disappointment to me, Miller gives a funny and nice performance as The Scarlet Speedster, But I personally as a Flash(TV) fan can't see anyone but Grant in the role, which I know is wrong, but Grant does a great job. The visuals are a huge downgrade from BVS and Wonder Woman and it feels like playing a video game sometimes, Steppanwolf is a terrible villain who doesn't pose a threat at all, and the plot of collecting the motherboxes also feels like a video game plot, but in the end it's still nice to some of the best superheroes ever on screen together, it could've been so much more, but for what we got it was okay, and I'd watch it again.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I absolutely LOVED it!!! A movie doesn't have to be a perfect artistic masterpiece with a plot too complicated to follow, to be good. This movie gets tons of bad reviews and I can't understand why. The plot was easy to understand and all the action scenes were easy to follow, unlike many movies nowadays. The chemistry among the cast was absolutely stellar and made me excited for what's to come, unlike any of the other movies so far in the DCEU (except ""Wonder Woman""). Ezra Miller as Barry Allen was easily the best part of this movie, his humor was fantastic and I found myself laughing every time he was on screen. The Flash has always been one of my favorite justice league members, and this was my favorite version of him on screen, despite my love for the CW show. Jason Momoa's take on Aquaman made him seem like a useful member of the justice league for the first time which I greatly appreciated, well done. I didn't know much about Cyborg coming into this movie, but I thought Ray Fisher did a great job and I am looking forward to a standalone movie to learn more. Gal Gadot, Ben Affleck, and Henry Cavill were great as always, and honestly maybe the best I've ever seen them in the DCEU.

CGI and Cheap Looking ProductionFor a film that has this much budget, JL definitely looked like a Saturday Night Skit in a lot of scenes where the heroes were not in their costumes, where there were normal peopleThe CGI looks very off and weird in some partsIt's inexcusable to be honestThe film also has a lot of badly placed humor that kills the seriousness of the scene and a lot of the humor does try to APE the MCU's approach to humor. I like MCU although i would say they sometimes over-do their humor in some parts of their films. JL does something similar here and it feels forcedAnother thing is tone, this is not really an issue but at the same time it kind of IS. The light hearted tone is not the problem, the real problem is how forced it feels in some parts. Some characters have changed drastically and become so light hearted compared to how they were in last two films, it's jarringThe word jarring reminded me, The Editing is also jarring in this filmThe villain Steppenwolf is very disposable, although has clear motives, barely feels like he presents any real threatHowever what works for JL is that it's completely fun and enjoyable, it's a good time. But it doesn't feel like it has rewatching value. It's like a time pass ride that will entertain you.The film also lacks substance. Unlike BVS and MOS, this film felt very barebones entertainment like Fast and Furious films and although Fast and Furious Franchise isn't BAD, they are definitely popcorn entertainment and so is Justice LeagueHowever JL does deliver a more coherent story than BVS and MOS, it doesn't try to do too much in one film although it does feel rushed because more than half of team members had to be introduced in ONE FILM and the run time of 2 hour doesn't help either. The film definitely could've benefit from a bit longer runtime like 2 hours and 20 minutes at leastJL also feels very self aware and pokes fun at itself in a way that seems like they're just going ""OH THE MASSES DIDN'T LIKE THE DARK TONE OF OUR LAST FEW FILMS? WELL WE WON'T IMPROVE STORYTELLING, WE WOULD JUST GIVE YOU JOKES, HERE YOU GO, HERE ARE YOUR ONE LINERS AND QUIPS"" and it also pokes fun at some serious things about its previous films which felt unnecessary All in all, JL is fun time but it is no more than that. Although i enjoyed it less than BVS, If i speak objectively, JL is a better film than BVS and it is better executed but JL still lacks a lot in the plot and execution Sadly it doesn't live up to the hype and doesn't do justice to the Justice League. The first live action JL film should've been amazing and instead we got another divisive OKAY film that amps up the entertainment factor for the mass audience but doesn't do much to be considered a really good film and that's why i said it's fine but JL should've been much more betterAlthough its a fun ride, i was underwhelmed6/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Slowly, he starts to assemble a team but as every team needs a leader, he might need to bring back an old ""friend"".It's a superhero movie which only from its title reminded me of the beloved cartoons with the same name so I simply had to see it. Unfortunately, what I saw was a bit far from my expectations. It's story is lame to say the least. An old enemy comes to threaten the world so Batman starts recruiting and that's about it. Everyone seems to be willing to join without much hesitation so they start to fight. It's too simple, linear and predictable to make justice for a movie with this title. The characters are not very likeable, having very limited dialog, almost if they were paid by the number of words spoken, and when they do, nothing memorable or even worth mentioning comes out of the actors' mouths. Thus, very little emotion can be generated from such a movie and it's a shame, as it tries to introduce a fair amount of drama but fails miserably.It simply feels mediocre. From the story, characters and even actors to the action itself. You get a couple of fights and some CGI moments which are a bit more intense but nothing than can keep you breathless. As it also is pretty predictable, almost nothing seems satisfying enough. I know that all seems bad but it's not as bad as it sounds. It's just that I really had some expectations from it, especially as I've seen Aquaman first, and most of them were completely destroyed. It simply doesn't have a story which is capable of getting the most of the characters it has, making them feel weak an even useless at times. They even have an antagonist which feels as lame as the rest of the story and somehow manages to dominate the action every single time.As far as I'm concerned, this movie is a failed attempt at bringing back the Justice League in live action. It has a bad plot which isn't able to keep up with the weight of its characters, thus making them look bad. The movie doesn't do anything great in any department and this can be easily seen. Even the visual part isn't as spectacular as it could and should have been. You're simply left with the impression that it's a cheap film, average in every aspect with nothing that can make it stand out from mediocrity. Not even its cast couldn't raise it, and this is a great shame.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

With the creation of Superman and the contradiction that a superior being has no advantage whatsoever, because he is more vulnerable regarding friendships and family than a ""normal"" human, a mirror of humanity has been created that no other superhero delivers. So I always worry with Superman movies. The comics can deliver the side stories of humanity. The movies can not, because the producers always prefer the action and not the needed affection. The cast could deliver easily - some few scenes show it. But the script does not ask for many. But this movie is a must to see anyway. Every movie that shows Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is a must. She delivers in a magical way - it is unbelievable how fantastic she looks, moves, speaks, inside out, outside in. I wish, a good social competent script for Superman. And a script with the depth of Logan:Wolverine for Wonder Woman.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The Problem is the Audience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4081692/?ref_=tt_urv","ioshadha","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22714724/?ref_=tt_urv","5 March 2018","Let's get started on this topic by giving a rating of 8 for Justice League.... It's not perfect by any means, but for me as a true DC/Marvel comic fan I appreciate Justice League more than say the most recent Marvel's Thor - Rangrong which in my opinion was a big joke and a comedy than anything else. If you ask most people (the general audience) however, see this the other way around and this is why - Let's get the obvious out of the way first... Justice League as I mentioned, by no means perfect. As many have indicated the plot and some character development could have been better... what Justice League needed in my opinion is more screen time. The movie seriously lacked screen time to bring a group six superhero characters together therefore affecting the whole flow and the plot of the movie... But the movie manged to maintain true DC essence in it to a degree. DC differ from Marvel from being more dark and twisted in their stories...Justice League in many ways maintained what DC is all about. Many 
(the general audience) would see this as being boring or non entertaining but if you know DC then you know what you are up against. Batman vs Superman had a similar tone to Justice League... again many criticized that movie too.The problem here come down to the blockbuster earnings. Marvel has been making some healthy $$ figures on recent movies like the whole Avengers series and other solo movies such as Iron Man. Studios don't care about maintaining the original essence of DC or Marvel comics... for them the the success lies in the $$ figure. So, how do they earn more $$s? Well the answer is of course developing movies to capture a wider audience than the true DC/Marvel comics fan base out there... My friend rated more recent Guidance of the Galaxy and Thor - Rangrong very high... I asked him why. His view was simple - it fun, lite and great entertainment with some hardcore CGI - you walk out of the theater happy... nothing wrong with his view... but he has no clue whatsoever what DC or Marvel comics are all about - have never read them. He would easily mixed up Marvel and DC characters. And that's the general audience I'm talking about... And this is how Thor - Rangrong gets its high ratings and blockbuster $$s.By this definition Marvel by default has the edge when it comes to entertainment as Marvel comics have more fun/brighter element in the original comics in comparison to DC. Iron Man's and the Guidance of the Galaxy success were around these elements - Audience like this. However, studios try to apply the same theme across on movies such as Thor - Rangrong which in my opinion led to jeopardizing the Thor character to a comedy which was disgrace and ended up in a disaster regardless of it successful blockbuster earnings. Only a Marvel fan would see this but no the general audience. You can see how ratings on Thor - Rangrong go either very high (general audience) vs very low (Marvel fans).So, this my take on how DC and Marvel movies will continue to the future... Studios will try to make more $$s. Marvel was first in this game... they sort of got the formula right making more $$s by focusing on entertainment than maintaining the true essence of the original comics. DC will follow the lead at a certain point. Its going to be interesting to see how DC does this if they wanted to maintain the dark and twisted nature of DC comics which is what differentiate DC from Marvel. The end result however, is that Marvel and DC movies will gradually loose the true essence of the original comics and what they were all about.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Batman is the most popular, or at least the one who has been written the best.Wonder Woman is 3rd, and then it gets weird. Maybe the Flash is fourth or the Green Lantern. Doesn't matter, although The Flash is pretty good on TV.A house built on a weak foundation won't stand, and in Justice League the writing--the story is weak.The dialogue is so on the nose, with the characters just telling you whatever is on their mind. The characters are introduced quickly, perhaps to get the story going, but there is no subtext, no build up, no real tension. The team comes together quickly. Didn't the writers watch The Avengers?Perhaps the mistake that spawned all mistakes is the clear lack of knowledge about who Batman is, or the lack of appreciation for that character. Ben Affleck has the look, but just like in BvS, that is not how Bruce Wayne/Batman sounds--that is not how Bruce Wayne/Batman acts. Anyone familiar with the Batman comics, or the 90s cartoon, or the Justice League cartoons, or even the Tim Burton films and the Chris Nolan ones, should know Batman's voice--the Dark Knight--the Detective. Batman is a pillar of the DC Comics universe. If you don't get him right, the Justice League house won't stand.Batman wouldn't boast about his wealth, like he is, well, another guy currently in the White House who likes to tweet. He would own the fact that he doesn't have powers, and that it hasn't held him back any. AND BATMAN DOESN'T USE GUNS. And Superman? How did Richard Donner and Mario Puzo get him right in 1978, but he is uninteresting in Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and now Justice League?In Justice League, for me Wonder Woman is the only well written-- well developed--multi-dimensional character. Ezra Miller's Flash is also interesting. Everyone else is a jock, nothing special.DC just has no quality control, and the solution to that is simple, STOP HIRING DIRECTORS, AND START HIRING FILMMAKERS--Directors who are also experienced writers/story tellers like Patty Jenkins, Chris Nolan, and Joss Whedon. AND THEY MUST KNOW AND LOVE THE DC COMICS CHARACTERS they are putting on film.Otherwise, you just end up with the Hulk movies directed by Ang Lee and that other guy. Even then, there still needs to be someone scrutinizing the script and the dailies, or you just end up with Suicide Squad. And the cartoon Suicide Squad was pretty good, so how did the live version get so off? Marvel has its act together, despite misfires like Age of Ultron, and Thor Dark World. So why can't DC?Lastly, why isn't Darkseid the main villain? Why one of his subordinates? And if you're going to have the subordinate, why not bring Darkseid in at the end to raise the stakes--to show the fight will continue in the next film. At least show him in a post credit scene, instead of that douche bag version of Lex--oh nevermind.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

This film also may be linked with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. We find Ezra Matthew Miller, who had a cameo in B.V.S. Dawn Of Justice getting a full role as ""The Flash"". Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot reprise their respective superhero roles. Joseph Jason Namakaeha Momoa also reprises his role as ""Aquaman"".Plot in brief: Thousands of years ago, Steppenwolf and his legions of Parademons attempted to take over Earth with the combined energies of three Mother Boxes. They were foiled by a unified army that includes the Olympian Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, mankind, and the Green Lantern Corps. After repelling Steppenwolf's army, the Mother Boxes were separated and hidden in locations on the planet. In the present, mankind is in mourning over Superman, whose death triggers the Mother Boxes to reactivate and Steppenwolf's return to Earth in an effort to regain favor with his master, Darkseid. Steppenwolf aims to gather the artifacts to form ""The Unity"", which will destroy Earth's ecology and terraform it in the image of Steppenwolf's homeworld.Verdict: This film is okay as a time-pass film and rewatchability is also decent. I personally disliked the actor chosen for the role of Flash. The rest of the cast is okay - Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot carry their weight as do Henry Cavill and Jason Momoa. Henry Cavill has really done a rigorous body building workout for his role as Superman. Special effects are the mainstay of comic book superhero films and here it doesn't disappoint. The sound-effects are also good. Zack Snyder could have directed differently, but he took the same generic route as most of his earlier movies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I prefer DC to Marvel, but mostly I'm a huge comics fan. Thor is currently 8.0 on imdb, JL is 6.8. This is absurd, Thor is a far lesser movie than JL. Guardians of the galaxy 2 was also a lot worse. It seems Marvel managed to reach a point were anything they do is good, and DC (because of the Dark Knight series, maybe?) can't do anything wright. I reckon after BvS, I had higher expectations to a JL movie. The 8 reflects a bit that disappointment, has a DC fan I wanted a 10. The run time of just 120 min really threw me off. So, after watching, It actually seemed a good DC movie (even with the director's problems), and well paced. It's not has good has BvS, but it's not bad, at all. I reckon each character could have had a standalone movie first (including Batman - and also, the entire decision of going with a older Batman was also a disappointment to me, might have made sense to a BvS story line, but on JL not really), but this small, easy in the eye, JL, might have been a good contribution to just that, and to a larger, bigger assembly movie in the future.If you have no affinity to DC, you probably didn't like BvS, and you'll probably not like JL. Thor is just a comedy (and a quick way to kill off unwanted characters for infinity war), so probably anyone will like it (specially on drugs).But is not DC's fault there are almost no good blockbuster movies anymore for you to see.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

People are already claiming that it signals the (premature) end to comic giant DC's 'shared universe' (which, in case you're not up on the cut-throat world of comics and their filmic interpretations) was Warner Bros' answer to the seemingly unstoppable juggernaut that is Disney's 'Marvel cinematic shared universe.' And, they may be right, but sadly for possibly the wrong reasons.The tragedy is that DC has ‚Äì arguably ‚Äì the most famous and beloved superheroes in its arsenal, i.e. Batman and Superman (whereas Marvel was forced to rely on (due to licensing issues) a rag-tag band of its lesser-known stars such as Iron Man and Thor). Twenty years ago if you had told the cinema-going public that they were about to witness Bruce versus Clark slug it out on the big screen it would probably have been seen as the cinematic event of all time. However, 'Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice' kind of whimpered its way through the public's consciousness, leaving no one that excited (and die-hard DC fans more worried) about the film that was supposed to bring all their most beloved heroes together for their first major outing.Critics have already slammed 'Justice League' for being a 'directorial mess,' citing a change of directors for the post- production phase and general studio interference. Now, I'm not saying they don't have a point. Original director Zack Snyder wanted a film that was closer to three hours, yet the studio wanted as many showings per day as possible, therefore made the cinematic cut just under two hours. So the finished product does feel decidedly unfinished. Also, a few weeks before 'Justice League' came out, 'Thor: Ragnarok' sneaked out in cinemas. And, despite it being about one of my afore-mentioned 'lesser' heroes and it was the third instalment in Thor's personal film career, it was amazing. It performed better than even Disney had hoped and forced 'Justice League' onto the back foot in the public's and critics' eyes alike. There are plenty of other minor gripes like the 'forced' humour that secondary director Joss Whedon seemed to feel the need to add, JK Simmons being very underused as Commissioner Gordon, continuity issues, things that aren't properly explained due to the harsh cutting to save runtime, the ‚Äì slightly cheesy ‚Äì CGI, especially in the film's villain himself, Steppenwolf and that one terrible line poor Jeremy Irons is forced to utter during the final battle. However, I felt the real problem lay in the fact that 'Justice League' was released too early. Superman was only given one solo film, before sharing the stage with Batman (for a new caped crusader's first outing after Christian Bale refused to reprise the role and link Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy into this new shared universe). Aquaman was decent enough, but he would have benefited from having his own stand-alone film shown BEFORE he was put into JL. The Flash makes his first film appearance, despite DC giving him his own (highly- prised) TV show and then choosing to create a new version for the big screen. And, as for Cyborg, personally I liked him, but no one besides die-hard fans of the kids' cartoon 'Teen Titans' will know who he was. Wonder Woman was about the film's only real character people felt they connected with due to her having a hit film (or should I say the ONLY hit film) prior to this get together. Therefore, whereas much of the audience this film was meant for has already seen this kind of 'superhero shared universe' played out by Marvel characters. All of which had their own solo films to build up their characters and bring a sense of grandeur to the point in time when they finally come together as one unit. Here, it just felt rushed for the sake of 'playing catch-up.'If you're wondering what my 'Simpsons-related' title refers to, it's about a little-known episode of 'South Park' which made fun of itself and 'The Simpsons' where the jokes come from the fact that the Simpsons has been on TV for so many years that they've done everything and there's nothing that 'South Park' can do that feels original. This was how I felt watching 'Justice League.' Every time something happened a little voice in my head said 'Marvel did it, Marvel did it, Marvel did it' and that was kind of disappointing. Whether it was watching Aquaman fly and fight like Thor or the team chasing Infinity stone-like cubes to stop them falling into Thanos' hands (sorry, Steppenwolf), everything felt like I'd already seen it before ‚Äì and, sadly, better.I didn't hate 'Justice League,' in fact I found it an okay movie and definitely not as bad as many of the online community is making out. However, it is definitely a missed opportunity and could have been so much better if handled with just a little more care and forethought.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Super Cast, Brings Justice To This Franchise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3859965/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","16 November 2017","LIKES:Casting: A movie relies heavily on a cast, especially finding those worthy of holding the mantle of our iconic heroes. Justice League's director gets an A+ from me for the cavalcade of talent crammed into the new super team. While Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill are still not the best fillers for their roles compared to others, they did well in their involvement in the film to warrant applause. Gal Gadot reprises her role fantastically, bringing everything we loved in her stand- alone film and delivering it in spades to this installment in looks, demeanor, and kick butt fighting. However the highlights are Ray Fisher, Jason Momoa, and Ezra Miller. Fisher has the chip on his shoulder, passively destructive role down pat, showing the struggles of new power. Momoa has that brashness/arrogance of a rogue who feels he is above the rules, who soon begins to understand the limits of the lone wolf. However, Miller was spot on for the role of The Flash, capturing all the charisma, comedy, and nerdism I've enjoyed with the modern telling of the fast hero. The cast works so well together, bringing the roles to life in a very entertaining manner that feels like the League of the past on Cartoon Network.The Comedy: The hero movies are starting to shift from adventure to comedy genre for me, and Justice League took a major turn down this avenue. Much of the writing is well-timed, comedic goal, utilizing well-timed cursing, witty sarcasm, and a sharp edge banter that many love, especially when the characters fence with their insults. Of course, the Flash, has a major hand in the laughs, his geeky, na√Øve admiration of the heroes laying the groundwork for other comedic devices that involve both physical and mental qualities, seriously his face is hilarious. With this comedy laid out throughout the movie, one will find it hard not to chuckle quite a few times in the movie. The Action: If you've read my reviews on previous DC movies, you know that the action is often weak for me when comparing to Marvel's masterpieces. Happily, the comic book battles that hooked us from the comics have finally started arriving. Justice League, much like Thor, have a number of exciting moments that act as stepping stones to the excitement at hand. Much of these brief stints are more entertaining than some of Marvel's skirmishes, able to grab the serious tone of DC and deliver a darker fight to ensnare us. The semi-diverse fights bring out the technology bangs, and really deliver an action-packed punch that much of this universe has lacked. Finally, this studio is getting things right. DISLIKES:Shallow Story/Characters: There is a reason Marvel divided their universe into multiple, single character focused stories, in that it builds up the characters for one to latch onto. With their failing enterprise, DC skipped a lot of steps to go directly to the group movie and as a result the character development is lacking. Enough ground work has been laid to get the gist, but Justice Leagues has too many story elements in it to give that satisfying feeling of accomplished storytelling. With little mystery, buildup, and sometimes even challenge, this film's adventure is a little rushed for this reviewer, culminating into a rather bleak, predictable mess. Snyder-Vision: The slow moving special effects were great so long ago, and still have an emotional bite to them that really maximizes the kill. Yet Snyder can't seem to listen to the audience members/critics, or is rebelling because he won't stop overusing it. Justice League continues the trend of utilizing the tactic for nearly every exciting scene, sometimes in good taste, and often in more egotistical, eye-rolling displays of drawn out cinema. Hope you like seeing every detail at half speed, because you are going to have your fill. The final battle: After all the preparation, all the little battles to tease you, one hopes for that defining climax that really puts the battle over the top. Justice League dropped the ball on this for me, not in terms of being lame (like Suicide Squad), but instead not being much different from the trailers. This final battle has had much spoiled in the advertising, and rather than building upon it, like the Avengers, the movie held little flare outside of the battle with the Steppenwolf. That gigantic army you saw in the trailers¬Ö doesn't really do much, which was so disappointing with all the hype they placed. It was a good start DC, now finish with that bang we all want to see. The VERDICT:If you read other reviews, you'll see this movie was panned, but this critic found much to enjoy in this movie. It's fun, funny, and a rather good introduction to future team movies with an incredible cast to boot. Sure, it still has some rough story patches, and they haven't quite understood the execution of a good finale (or the balanced use of slow-motion). Still, it's the best movie of the DC universe for me overall, and a good comic book movie to boot. Naturally, I'll recommend this for the theater, and implore you to enjoy the comedic ride and chaotic action at hand in what will hope be a starting point to the next wave of DC movies. My Scores:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

The film is entertaining as I'm such a big fan of the characters and DC but it isn't a perfect movie, it's far from perfect thanks to it being left unfinished with the final product being a movie with two visions, Zack Snyder should have finished it, may his daughter rest in peace. Joss Whedon tried to finish it but failed but succeeded in making it light hearted, funny and possibly other things but he really did cut too many scenes. Let's put the negative aside. The villain, Steppenwolf which is played by Ciaran Hinds who is a great actor and the character has potential but the rewrites for the villain made the character fall flat.The visual effects are stunning to look at, but there are also CGI that are just horrible and the moustache removal is one of those. The costumes are on point, just fine and realistic.With all that said, I have to say I find the movie entertaining but after getting the chance to watch Zack Snyder's Justice League which is the intended version but it's sadly not Canon. That film is superior in every way but if you enjoy more light hearted superhero movies with akward jokes and bad pacing then watch this, the 4 hour Snyder Cut is perfection.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Is it because of Snyder (Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Watchmen) who maybe isn't good enough option for directing the movie or is it maybe because of hype that never gets to reach it's true potential we will maybe find out when Matt Reeves gets us a new Batman movie. As it goes with Justice League there were some pretty good things and some that maybe should have been taken more devotion to magnify them. From the start plot seemed like it had some potential with us seeing Batman gathering team to save the world from upcoming threats and then at some point it just took the wrong turn and kept feeding us with boring plot. Then it was cut to action scenes which made us forget about plot and put us to edge how good they actually looked but moment they were gone comes realization that it didn't fix anything and again put us into horrible decision or sub-plots. Then action comes back and it's 'great' villain which seemed less scarier than Batman if you take him to perspective because of miserable power that it showed us. Steppenwolf just seemed like he is good at kicking things around and provide no real satisfaction from villain that it's supposed to be. In the end it seemed like it was no trouble to defeat him but company fighting him just made themselves more problems with their decisions. Directing as always from Zack Snyder is like 'seen that', 'been there' and 'done that', nothing new and interesting that will keep you amazed and even sometimes bad as you look into movie and see scene jumps from the start to the immediate end and you're like 'okay they just cut the whole middle of scene'. Stars in movie are pretty much all the same and gave performance as expected, except Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Flash (Ezra Miller) which both had their good and funny scenes and absolutely stole moments of their screening time. It wouldn't hurt to make movie more violent and with far more story telling but not much longer in time which doesn't seem like tough thing to do but we are only here to watch the movie and not make it. 2.5/4","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

That's not to say this is a bad thing, as fans of comic book heroes will always love to see their favorite characters team up to take on evil forces almost as much as they want to see these bastions of justice duke it out. Justice League certainly delivers on this, but in a way that felt uninteresting and lacking the serious consequences to the world at large.Concerning the characters themselves, Justice League succeeds in creating a unique team with some interesting heroes. Wonder Woman's (Gal Gadot) success in her standalone film could be seen in one of the first (and possibly best) sequences of the film. Additionally, The Flash (Ezra Miller) was a constant source of entertainment as the comic relief. Most importantly, Justice League succeeded in making Aquaman (Jason Momoa) an absolute badass. And while there have been plenty of films with Batman (Ben Affleck), this version certainly seems to draw from its ""detective comics"" roots to significant effect.I do find it somewhat ironic/fitting that Zach Snyder directed this penultimate collection of superheroes from the DC universe, especially considering he directed the darker DC superhero film, Watchmen (2009) early on in his career. Plenty of his style remains in this film, but the impact of the plot seems to be a miss here. I think this is mostly because the main antagonist doesn't easily trace back to one of the known entities in the series: mainly Wonder Woman (2017), Batman v. Superman (2016), and Man of Steel (2013). At least in The Avengers, audiences had already met Loki in Thor (2010). I'm a little disappointed there wasn't more Steppenwolf music as part of the soundtrack, though.A procedural gathering of superheroes, I give Justice League 3.5 stars out of 5.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now I love comic books movies and I'm neither a Marvel or DC purist of any description so I'm not biased in any way. There's something magical in seeing Batman and Superman share a scene much more so than any of the Marvel films yet (I'm waiting on a possible Spider-man and Deadpool crossover). I may be in the minority here but I personally think that Ben Affleck is the perfect Batman and Bruce Wayne. No-one has got it this right since Michael Keaton. The look of the dark knight is perfect and I'll be sad to see Bat-Fleck go. Henry Cavill has also done the same for Superman. In fact there were no characters here that felt that they didn't belong.
On the topic of other characters, The Flash? Brilliant! Would have liked to have seen a lot more of Aquaman though. Cyborg? I was not too familiar with him so didn't know what to expect. They did a nice job of explaining the backstory without dragging it out.
The film itself was a blast. Like I said, I'm no purist so personally I didn't care what they got right or wrong about the characters. I wanted a good film and that was exactly what I got. This kept me engrossed from start to finish and unfortunately it was over before I wanted it to.
I have known for some time not to trust reviews as I have loved some films that have been bashed by the media and fans alike. My advice to myself has always been to watch it and see how I feel. How do I feel after this? I feel DC have made a great flick and this is now something to build on.
My only gripe, my only frustration is how they handled Cavill's moustache. It was horrible, just horrible. For those not in the know, Cavill was obligated to keep a moustache for another project and was forbidden from shaving it off. The fix? Just cover it with CG. With the amazing things that can be done now, it was nothing short of a cinematic crime that they butchered the CG on this so bad. The result of this is that for 99% of the times Supes was onscreen if felt like watching an animated character plonked into a live action film.
This film isn't perfect, far from it. But it is a lot of fun. Some have said that it is a touch slow, I didn't think so. There was a balanced mix of action and plot building here. How bored would you be of a feature film with non stop action? There would be nothing to look forward to, nothing break it up. Where would the plot be?My final thought though? Just watch it with no preconceptions (which may be hard). Forgive minor deviations from the comics and just loose yourself in the fantasy that we have loved for so very long. After all, isn't that what we all want in this type of flick?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They have dialled back the dark depressing moodiness from the previous Superman films and replaced it with silly one-liners that feel horribly out of place. Rather than have the balls to stick to their guns but try to make it, you know, not trash, they decided to backtrack and make something that was done infinitely better by Marvel 5 years ago.And it even fails at doing that properly. Rather than integrate the various superpowers organically into the plot of the film, three out of the five members of the Justice League could literally be anyone else. Batman does some Batman stuff, and there are a couple of scenes where someone needed to move really fast, so Flash was useful every now and then, but there was nothing in here that specifically used either Wonder Woman, Aquaman or Cyborg's superpowers, other than needing ""a guy who is really fast and really strong"". So if you went into this film with no preconception of who was who and what they could each do, you would be seeing a guy dressed as a bat with some cool gadgets, an annoying teenager who can run really really fast, and three interchangeable characters who can all punch people really hard.That is my main problem with the film but here are a few other spoiler-free bullet points:-90% of the comic relief was from the Flash, and the only times I laughed were at non-Flash related bits. -Think of the least interesting villain possible. I guarantee you the villain in this will be less interesting than that. He was literally ""evil guy who wants to do evil with magic MacGuffins and destroy earth."" -Sick of seeing infinite armies of faceless robots/aliens/insects/zombies that are decidedly non-human so that we can show the heroes decapitating and dismembering them without affecting the PG13 rating? Well, Justice League has you covered! They have an infinite army of faceless robot-alien-insect-zombie things all at once!I am kinda ripping this film a new poop-hole but it wasn't as bad as BvS or Suicide Squad. It was watchable but in a ""this is trash"" kinda way. Much of the film felt like scenes taking place in a vacuum, with nothing connecting them. Most of these scenes on their own were entertaining enough, but as a film it didn't do anything for me. 4/10.For anyone curious I would rank the DC films as follows:1. Wonder Woman (5/10) 2. Man of Steel (5/10) 3. Justice League (4/10) 4. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (4/10) 5. Suicide Squad (3/10)","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I don't normally see movies while they're in theaters. So I've only recently decided to check this movie out but I read a lot of the reviews on here beforehand which almost caused me to not even bother because most of them were so bad. But something told me to give it a go anyway and, honestly, I'm really glad I did. This movie was awesome and not nearly the horror show everyone made it out to be. Was it perfect? Of course not. I really wish each character could've had their own origin story first so that we could feel more invested in them. I also think the villain was a bit stale and cliche. But other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. The character interactions were great and the action scenes were top notch. Seeing some of the critic reviews for this movie really made me think Marvel has these critics in their pocket because they keep hating everything DC does but then give everything Marvel craps out these days 5 stars. Seriously, give it a watch and make up your own minds instead of following the crowd of people who want to seem smart by agreeing with everything the critics say","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Justice League aims for a brighter tone, but ultimately falls flat on its face. Watchable it may be, but also disappointing.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3863356/?ref_=tt_urv","fuzzymax-76787","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur79992617/?ref_=tt_urv","20 November 2017","Expectations were high ahead of Justice League. It had to kick start a cinematic, justify its colossal hype and set up solo films for a couple of new heroes. That and make bucket loads of money. Walking out of the cinema following this film, I knew that it would not accomplish all of those objectives. First, the positives; there are some excellent action set pieces in this film, accompanied by solid (for the most part) special effects. There it's also some amusing humour threaded in throughout, and in terms of acting, Gal Gadot gives another reliable turn as Wonder Woman, with Ezra Miller stealing scenes as the Flash, even if his irreverent quipping becomes irritatingly tiresome after a while. The set piece in the middle of the film is also spectacular, if overshadowed by the dismal second half of this film, and it was dismal. The flaws are about to come pouring out now, so hold on tight. First and foremost, the plot of Justice League is diabolical, at times even ridiculous. The editing in this film is very messy as well; you can really notice that a lot of the film was cut in post production. I do appreciate the tragedy surrounding Zack Snyder however, so I can forgive this. The characters I cannot forgive. The way they are scripted is horrible especially for characters like Aquaman and Cyborg, as portrayed by Jason Momoa and Ray Fisher respectively. Cyborg is really underdeveloped (although that isn't helped by Fisher's lifeless performance), and Aquaman underused and forgettable. Ben Affleck also seems to have lost that special something that made him so watchable as Batman in BvS; perhaps his charisma. And finally Ciaran Hinds, who portrays Steppenwolf, makes the most strained, generic and by the numbers villain I think I've ever seen in a Superhero Film.To say the cast isn't helped by the troubled production and awful script and plot is an understatement, but I expected so much more. In conclusion, a sloppy, disappointing mess, which is actually still quite enjoyable if you take away the negativity weighing it down and crippling the film's positives. One last thing; there is a scene with a *Cough* *Cough* character and their somewhat controversial bottom lip which I thought was very poorly thought out, bar one brilliant element.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I don't understand where that $300M budget was spent. As promising the first trailer was, the theatrical cut proved to be a garbage mixture of DC Characters and Marvel Tone. Joss Whedon and Reshoots are clearly the reason of why this movie was so bad. So bad that it made me cry. If you look at the reshoot scenes, The dialogues given to these DC Characters are very similar to their similar ego in MCU. Batman was talking like IronMan. Aquaman was Thor. Flash was Spiderman and Superman was treated like Captain America. I am 100% sure this was not Snyder's vision at all. Shame on WarnerBros for letting this crapshow run in cinemas. I don't understand why this movie was given a Green Signal after the final product. Release the Snydercut because that's what DC Fans really deserve.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The entire movie had a very good pace and wasn't too long, the humor was great and it worked well while maintaining a serious tone overall. The Villain was ehh, but it was the interaction between the heroes that made the movie, didn't really matter who the villain was. For me the big surprise was the Flash, Ezra Miller was just perfect, he really nailed it. I originally did not like the casting but now I really look forward to the Flash movie (hopefully without that awful costume). Superman was very strong and had some great lines, Cavill delivered! I hope we get a Superman movie with a good script, Man of steel was not great. I also liked Wonder Woman way better in this than the standalone version, Gadot plays a perfect Wonder Woman. Momoa played Aquaman just how they wanted, and it worked well, I just prefer the old school version but nobody else would. I ended up liking Cyborg better than I thought I would, and he was important to the movie. Batman was OK but I'm still not a fan of Affleck as Batman, or Amy Adams as Lois Lane. Future looks very bright for DC, and I think most DC fans will love this movie.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Was very let down and depressed after witnessing the treatment of Superman. Shame on the WB Execs that Disrespected and RUSHED JL ahead despite ""Mustache Gate"". Should have taken the time to do the CGI mustache removal the right way or waiting on reshoots until after Henry Cavill was done with MI6. Blacksuit Superman had a beard! Could have just kept Cavil's facial hair. Very horrible beginning with mobile phone footage of Superman. Next, Stepphen Wolf was not scary at all. Nobody feared him. Then WB CUT Justice League down to nothing!!! I remember thinking ""That's it?!?!?!?"". JL felt very brief like a cartoon episode. They removed so much footage to have a short run time in order to have as many shows as possible!! Guess what WB? IT DOESN'T MATTER How many shows you run when the theaters are EMPTY!!! It is Quality over Quantity as far as worrying about a delay in your Bonus $ from Justice League due to the WB merger with AT&T. Serves them right that it bombed and lost money!! Karma is real. Learn your lesson WB!! Never disrespect Superman a.k.a. The Man of Steel (your #1 guy) ever again!! WB has severely damaged their brand just like they did with 1997's Batman & Robin!!! Yes it is that BAD!!Some jokes were funny and Most were not. The comedy was hit or miss. 
The score was outdated and did not fit the film at all. Very boring and generic score from Elfman!! Very forgettable and paint by numbers music. 
Shame on Joss Whedon for everything that he contributed to Justice League. We demand the Zack Synder cut!! We want the black suit Superman!! We want Darkseid!! Why WB Why???

You just can't sell hopefulness to millennials. They can't take hope, they've been fed a constant diet of doom and gloom all their lives and hope is a toxin to their system. No doom and gloom and it may as well be the Smurfs for them. So we of the generations raised on science fiction and super hero stories filled with hope for the future just have to accept that and celebrate what little bits of hope they allow us these days. Can't deal with it? Get Hulu and watch TV from the 80's, 90's and early 2000's.With that lead weight hanging around the necks of those trying to write good science fiction and superhero stories we're lucky they don't have all the heroes in black with a chest full of awareness ribbons spending most of the movie preaching to the normals about how much the earth has been screwed up by their greed and short sightedness. In light of that the MCU has managed to dance that fine line like a ballet dancer while the DC folks have been dancing the line like a drunken Irishman at a DWI stop. However in this movie I think they got pretty darned close, more like an average joe with only one beer in them. Maybe it's just me, I've always given super hero movies a lot of slack. Heck, I enjoyed the Green Lantern movie.I will give you it's hard given the current political climate to just make an entertaining movie. What with every stripe of political animal ready to march, boycott and write emails to sponsors over things you'd never imagine could be taken offense to what's a guy to do? Super hero stories are going to be harder than most. The costumes alone can generate four years of college material for a Womyn's Studies Major. You can't put everyone in the same lumpy jumpsuits and hope to make that fly after all. With that particular Sword of Damocles hangin' over their heads I am happy if the costumes are close enough, the characterizations are decent and their origin stories from the 60's and 70's aren't totally polluted with todays PC garbage. Justice League took it to the line and held it there the whole time bringing us the best movie we could hope for with all the forces of PC darkness standing against them. So relax the politics people and just try to enjoy the movies. I'm giving it an 8 because I think that's what it deserves. Not trying to overcome the low voters who did so for whatever reasons they may have had or trying to hold down those who high voted it because of some other reasons. Maybe I could have given it a 7 but the easter egg made me give it a +1. You know what I mean... Brunch... Yup.

Not because of the movie's different directors, not because of the negativity surrounding BvS, not because of the sinful feelings I have when I see Wonder Woman's wondrous wonderbra: it's because this is a superhero movie and I'm not 12 anymore. I've got loans, man. I'm so busy with work I get guilty if I don't use what precious free time I have reading up on the news or doing one-handed pushups (or something. That's something adults do, right? Pushups?). I'm an adult, with a beard and everything: so, can I really watch a superhero movie and *not* get the guilties? Answer, no, definitely not: especially with the Marvel movies. They've become virtue signaling romps, like that last Spiderman Homeburning or whatever it was it was called, where the only white people were racist, ignorant teachers or, uh: THE VULTURE. (BTW Marvel is owned by Disney, who also owns Star Wars (yikes) and Fox (double yikes). The latest Star Wars game, Battlefront II, has just come out, and you basically have to buy the game only to pay *real money* while *playing* the game to win. Disney's too big, man. Maybe one day they'll own DC, too: and if you have to ""pay to win"" then think of what other crap they'll pull in the future (or even now) and the Marvel superheroes start to look like tyrants, or at best colourful distractions.But hey, I guess distractions are the name of the game. I have had a mad couple of weeks and I haven't been to the cinema since October, or whenever it was that Stephen King's IT came out (""IT"" being, of course, Stephen King's disappointment to us all). Seeing a movie helps switch your brain off and, oh baby: I was overdue. When you're overburdened and up to your eyeballs in work, you gotta switch off: pay nine dollars to go to the movies on cheap nite and watch explosions and car crashes for 90 minutes. So, come on Justice League, I'm an adult, but let's see what you've got.Parts of Justice League are genuinely funny. There are good quips back and forth and the story and dialogue doesn't take itself too seriously, a sin the Dark Knight and BvS movies committed. The movie's filled with action (yay), the CG is all cool to look at, and I really liked Steppenwolf, especially when they were explaining his backstory. His end is somewhat anticlimactic and this is a movie setting up future movies, but it's not as in-your-face about it as BvS was. (Or any Marvel movie. Yet another Infinity Stone? Great.) But there are still those immersion-breaking moments that stop you from really getting into it, really enjoying it, really making you forget you're a grown man who's got a job that keeps him in the public eye (kinda). Batman's suit has limited head movement, so he's got to do that Michael Keaton thing where he turns his whole body around (or at least at the hips) to see who's standing juuuust to the left of him. The suit isn't as good as the Dark Knight versions and not having Christian Bale in the role hurts the whole universe thing via broken consistency. And, when Batman wears his armour batsuit without the mask it makes his head seem, God, how to say this delicately: comically small. That's a lot of this movie: people wearing big shiny armour suits (the Flash's is too red, looks like one of those (S&M? No, M&M) suits). Wonder Woman's costume is the most natural looking because it's the simplest, so it's the least distracting.And, to reiterate a negative point: Steppenwolf was pretty darn cool, but his exit was unceremonious. And if Barry Allen's going to announce that he's Jewish, can Batman be a Rastafarian? Anyway. Does Justice League suck? Pleasantly, no, it doesn't suck: but it's not great, either. It's somewhere between ""just okay"" and ""pretty good."" It's your bog standard baked potato, with a small splash of sexy, sour cream.But I'll tell you, I enjoyed it much more than any of the Marvel movies I've seen in the last half a decade.","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

The thing that ruined this movie was it had no set up, I suppose as a sequel to Batman vs Superman, it didn't really need one. However, it just jumped into the action without any explanation.The whole film was just rushed. When you've got a studio trying to play catch up when it really doesn't need to, you have these problems.I could see Joss Whedon's contribution and that's what killed it for me. It was too gooey, too soft, too slapstick. Not serious enough. No major themes were explored. Batman vs Superman had a little gravity to it. This film just stank of the Avenger's model, it didn't have any villain presence. Just a smash till he dies vibe to the whole movie.The unnecessary inclusion of civilians you couldn't give two tosses about.No, one, character actually stood out. They were all so dry and looked bored throughout. You can tell the whole thing changed tones.If you want to waste money one day, go and see it, but I'd wait till the Blu Ray uncut version comes out.

"7","/10","A Good Entertaining Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3859764/?ref_=tt_urv","voyager-95288","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur67687919/?ref_=tt_urv","16 November 2017","I liked this movie a lot, I would be in love with this movie if the story line is a lot better. I just wish the Execs at WB would just leave the movies alone, anything they touch they ruin the movie experience. BvS they didn't allow the 3 hour long, so we got the jumbled mess and I liked BvS, love the Ultimate Edition. I hated Suicide Squad and it was again the WB Execs changed the vision of the director. I LOVE Wonder Woman and again the WB Execs almost messed it up by not wanting the no man's land scene which became one of the best Scene in Super Hero movies. Now Justice League the Moron at WB said the movie has to be only 2 hours when in fact when you watch this movie there were parts where they jumped around and you like what happened and you knew there were parts missing. The Movie was originally 2hrs and 45min, cutting 45 minutes is cutting 1/3 of the movie and this is why it has a lot of terrible ratings from critics which I think has it in for DC anyway because Marvel can't do no wrong. Justice League is a true Super Hero movie, the characters were awesome, I just wished they had more arguments between the characters because they came together and work together too quickly. This is what this film was, very quick. My favorite Character is the Flash, coming in, I didn't like him in the Trailer because his face does not look right, he just looks weird, but Ezra created his own version of the flash and he was very funny. Enjoyed him in every Scene. A surprising character is Cyborg, had to get used to the bland talk but it works out at the end and strangely enough you become attached to him. Aquaman I knew was going to be Cool and so was Batman, I just hope Ben does not quit as Batman, really like his batman, like his Bruce even more. Wonder Woman, well, is Wonder Woman she shines again, she's like a big sister to these guys, so it was great. The villain could have been better, especially his back story, it was very short and typical of taking over the world type deal. Everyone knows Superman is returning so no spoilers here, when he does return it was Epic! It was the Superman that a lot of people was waiting for, the classic Reeve Superman that has hope. I liked the MOS Superman and BvS, I didn't mind that he was going through tough times on earth and it made him a better Superman. I read the rotten tomatoes reviews and it makes me laugh as you can tell they either Hate Snyder or DC because their points about the movie does not make sense. This was a really good movie, not a great movie, could have been if they would leave more in, but you know what I enjoyed myself and can't wait to watch it again, it was also fun when the crowd gets into. I was in a full theater people were clapping and cheering, so I have no idea what the critics were looking at. I came out smiling and happy, with BvS I came out saying OK, not bad but confused because so much was gong on. I had to watch it again to assure myself that I do like the movie. Justice League I came out and knew right away this movie was good. Can't wait for the Blue Ray to get that extra 45 minutes. Go see this film, who cares what the critics think, they have their own agenda, see it for yourself and you decide and come back here put in a review :)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Justice League Improves Upon Similar DC Efforts and Continues to Take the DC Universe in a More Positive Direction","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3862684/?ref_=tt_urv","CANpatbuck3664","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur63857399/?ref_=tt_urv","19 November 2017","All of Zack Snyder's movies share strengths and weaknesses and when you talk about what he does well, action scenes/set pieces are always at the top of the list. This movie adds upon that, they deliver what you want from this type of movie. Two scenes stuck out to me, the first fight between our heroes and Steppenwolf and of course in the finale. They add new wrinkles for some of our returning heroes and they highlight what each member can do pretty well. The CGI is good and it never felt overloaded (at least for this genre). They also go to new locations that despite the fact that they're entirely CGI, I thought they looked interesting and relatively believable.I want to touch upon the return of Superman (its not a spoiler, they show it in the trailers). I really enjoyed how they decided to handle the impact of his demise (even though Bruce Wayne has a crazy 180 degree turn in his attitude that seemed to skirt around the entire point of BvS) and we get some quiet and understated scenes with Lois Lane and Martha Kent grieving and bonding together. Even when they decide to get gooey sweet with his reunion with Lois, I thought they sold it. Instead of coming across as unemotional and distant, Clark has a lot of emotion in this and he even made me chuckle with some of his lines. He played off his Justice League teammates really well and although he seemed to be playing on a different level than his teammates, they utilize his full power set and I applaud Snyder and his team for changing up their approach.The biggest surprise of the movie was how much I enjoyed the new members in the Justice League. Cyborg was a grounded character (at least in temperament) and even though he was full of angst, his abilities were interesting and I thought his relationship with his dad was emotional without being overbearing. Aquaman benefited from casting Jason Momoa but they are very tongue-in-cheek about his abilities and yet there was never a point I was about to start laughing at his inclusion. The Flash wasn't nearly as funny as the creative team thought he was but Ezra Miller shone through it as an actor and I liked how they decided to use him as a character. Add in that commissioner Gordon had a nice cameo and that smaller returning characters like Lois Lane, Martha Kent and Alfred Pennyworth were all nicely sprinkled in, they did a good job handling so many characters.This is a big cast and while I can't give each of them their own paragraph, I'll do my best to give my thoughts on the performances. I already talked about Henry Cavill, he improved across the board. Ben Affleck isn't bad here but he suffers from the fact Batman is written a little more bland. Gal Gadot was also stronger in her solo effort but she's still good. Ezra Miller actually succeeds despite the material, Ray Fisher is surprisingly strong as Cyborg and even though Arthur Curry is Jason Momoa doing his thing, he's a charming guy and his charisma makes his character memorable. Lois Lane and Diane Lane are both really good with what they're given. Amber Heard was decent in her small bit and I really liked Joe Morton as Silas Stone.The negatives of this film are pronounced but they weren't deal breakers. The first and most notable for me was the cringe inducing dialogue carries over from BvS. There are so many awkward lines and when the movie tries to be funny, I thought it fell on its face about 80-90% of the time. To be fair, there were some good lines too but I thought they were lacklustre for the most part. Some of my favourite characters from previous DC properties felt underutilized or shoved to the background. Batman comes off as a self-centred jerk for large portions of the movie and other than the action scenes, Wonder Woman's part is either to lecture the other members of the team or brood over the loss of Steve Trevor (the movie also doesn't do a great job explaining why she didn't help in other conflicts over the last century). Steppenwolf also made for a pretty underwhelming villain. I've seen worse (Malekith from Thor: The Dark World comes to mind) but this movie is built more around the heroes and the villain isn't the focal point.People either rail against the DC Universe or they love it completely. I've been down the middle on it for the most part (I gave Man of Steel, Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman 8s or 9s, Batman v Superman was a disappointment but I still gave it a 6) and despite its flaws, this is still a solid movie. I might not be popular for saying this but I thought some of the players in BvS took some notes on what worked and what didn't and applied that to this movie, which I congratulate them for. They do a decent job setting up the new members of the team, the action scenes are good from beginning to end and I liked what they decided to do with Superman. Depending on the direction WB studios and DC decide to go, there's material and momentum to build off of in Justice League. We'll just have to see what happens, if you're a DC fan or you're craving some big action with superheroes, this will fill that spot. I would actually give this a 7.5/10 but I can't go a full 8 on it so I'm rounding down to a 7/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The director had access to great graphic engines and nothing else. They forgot the book on imagination. That too sucks because they probably used some video game people to do the bad graphic work. My PS4 has better graphics.. and stories.The plot is so basic that you could have predicted it within the first few minutes. 
The actors are doing a terrible job at acting all through the movie. The Villain is s so horrible, that he seems like an afterthought to the casting process. So they end up with just CGI.Special Mention to Gal Gadot. She is the Katrina Kaif (Bollywood people will know this) of Hollywood. All through the movie she is posing like its a photoshoot. Does a pathetic job at playing the role, or even look like WW (yes, costume alone isnt enough). To top it off, she cannot act!All in all Alfred and the props did the best acting in the movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Did not they know that? They had a budget of 300 millions. They had the money to bring in all of the original seven members of the Justice League. They could have at least bring in the Martian Manhunter since they think bringing Green Lantern is a bad choice. It is not like it is Green Lantern's fault. Green Lantern is awesome. They could not find a nice story line and make a real costume. But forget that subject, now that people are accepting and watching DC Movies like Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman , they should consider every possibility for making a decent movie. Their movie released strategy is all wrong. They should have introduced all seven character first one by one with a solo movie of their origin with giving hint and connection for the next movie and about the Justice League. The budget should have been sufficient, not much, not less. Then they could have made Justice League with a big budget consisting all of the original seven members and of course with a best story line and a biggest super villain like Darkseid. It would have awesome and I strongly believe that people would watch that movie a lot. Then after a long time when Superman is on the side of the government and Batman is a criminal of the law who fight crime, they could have made Batman Vs Superman and as a sequel the could have made BvS Dawn of Justice. But they did the BvS very early, introduced a boy Lex Luthor, Killed Superman, made Justice League without the seven members with a lame super villain that people don't even know. And that is why Justice League 2017 could not attract people and failed at the box office. By they, I mean the people responsible for making the DC Extended Universe Movies. And think they should learn from their mistakes and make better movies in the future. I hope that very much because I am a biggest fan of the DC Universe.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

That ad was simply the scene from this movie where they try to rip off the scene from Captain America: Civil War where Iron Man recruits Spider-Man but with Batman and The Flash. The scene was so bad that I then decided that I would go out of my way to watch the full movie in the hopes that the whole thing would be a so-bad-that-its-good movie. Unfortunately, its just boring. Plot - This movie's story is so bland and uncreative that anything you might imagine being the plot would probably be more interesting than the actual movie. Characters - I've got nothing against any of these characters on their own or in other versions of them. In this movie they suck. No-one has any depth or is interesting enough to hold any of the scenes in there. There are hints of actual personalities, but not enough for it to actually be entertaining. I was hoping that it would end up being funny, but the dialogue is so bad that its not even ironically entertaining. Its just sad that someone was paid to write this script. If there even was a script. The only person in this movie that was even good was Aquaman. I'm not even a fan of the character. He's just the only person who was entertaining because the guy understood he was in a dumb movie and just didn't care. Its a bit like Hawkeye's dynamic in Avengers: Age of Ultron. He knew he was in dumb, boring movie, but he worked with the minuscule screen time he had. Villain - The villain isn't even a villain. Its a mass of CGI and some moron screaming into a microphone. I've seen a lot of superhero movies, and this villain is by far the worst. He has no motivation or premise and is even worse than the mess that was Apocalypse in X-Men: Apocalypse - and he was a pretty terrible villain. At least Apocalypse had a motivation. It was dumb and his plan was dumb, but at least I understood what he was about. Sound Mixing - I'm not one to point out the actual audio quality (I don't hear well enough to pick up slight changes) but the drop in audio quality for certain scenes is noticeable. Multiple different kinds of microphones were used in this movie and I don't see why. Honestly its a bit distracting when all of a sudden Wonder Woman appears onscreen and it sounds like her lines were dubbed over using an iPhone to record the new audio. Also, the soundtrack is played so quietly under the sound effects that I don't get why they put the music in at all. Visuals - This movie looks like total sh**. The effects suck and the color palette is so bad even I noticed how crappy the colors are. There are brightly colored scenes that are also grainy and the overall visual quality itself is bad. Any scene where they are in a field or forest look bad because of the weird colors and any scene in a populated area looks terrible because of the bad CGI. The effects would be funnier if this movie was less boring. Honestly if this movie had the creativity to go totally off the rails, then it would be way more entertaining than what they went with.Overall I would not recommend this movie. Its not even worth watching on an ironic level. Its just boring.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's hard for me to do this, but I just want to and quite frankly need to. I went to the movie theater twice to see this movie. Twice in four days. Did I have fun? Hell yeah. Did I laugh? Absolutely. It was a good time, both times. But, is it a good movie? I'm not sure. I'm gonna list the good and the bad and let you decide. PROS: - The characters are great - it's funny - it's the GODDAMN Justice League! - and i mean every character (from the League) works great for me. EVERY SINGLE ONE. They had great chemistry.CONS: - the plot is just bland, empty - villain is weak - sure he's huge and all but there was just one scene where I thought he was a threat and terrifying - the soundtrack is non-inspiring - Danny elfman was a mistake. I love the old batman and all but this is the new one. It was not an epic soundtrack. It was generic and boring. - I did not feel inspired after walking out of the movie. I should have been inspired like hell. I was not. - Cavills CGI mustache were bloody terribleNow, i think that the version we saw is not a complete version. I enjoyed the opening and closing scene the most. It was emotional, real and interesting. I know that was Snyder. And I love it. Whedon did great but some of the jokes were misplaced. I want my DC movies a little darker, more serious. It adds depth, emotions. I want real stakes. No matter what you think of BvS - it had that. It inspired me. It was fun, emotional. With all it's flaws. Marvel is fun as hell, great movies. BUT they have no shock value. They are predictable. I don't always want that. I love Snyders vision and I think WB need to chill out and not set all those boundaries. I want that complete version of Justice League. The world deserves it. To end this - JL is a step in the right direction, but they need more creative freedom (the directors). It could have been and should have been better.My vote - 7/10. I know i said a lot of bad things and it sounds like a 4 or a 5, but i enjoyed it and i don't blame neither Snyder nor Whedon - I blame WB. Go see it, decide for yourselves.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

And then throughout the whole movie The JL kept loosing until Superman showed up and started punching Stephenwolf in the face . The JL won because Superman showed up or they would have lost. Its like Batmans efforts of putting a team of enhanced individuals was useless. The movie sucked.

As a fan of these movies it's very annoying that critics seem to have a group think mentality. Ie Other critics are rating it harshly I better too. In no way is Justice League worse than Thor: The Dark World (which is Marvel's lowest scoring movie with an RT of 56%) but for whatever reason critics are particularly hateful when it comes to Zach Snyder's works. Again he isn't perfect but his movies are certainly better than the critical reception. If you like superhero movies then you'll like Justice League. It's big, it's fun and it's a great step in the right direction. I sincerely hope that Ben Affleck stays on as Batman.

The bar has been set quite high and Marvel has the clear advantage of having established itself first. It seems to me that DC is trying to establish it's own voice steering away from accusations of copying Marvel. The Dark Knight Trilogy is clearly their compass in this regard. A hard act to follow indeed.
 Reviewers have suggested that solo films would have been a better way to introduce the characters but I think that this would only draw unfavourable comparisons to Marvel. I may be wrong but this is the assumption that I am making.
 That being said, I think the chemistry between the leads was viable enough to warrant further exploration. I had a couple of groans at the beginning (only two) but this was more than made up for by the amount of 'wow cool' moments later on.
 Given the constraints of having so much material to have to cram into one film, the final product was one that I would recommend. I have no doubt that I will watch this again at some point in the future.
 Whereas I agree with some of the points made by other reviewers: somewhat rushed introductions; generic bad guy; sombre tone, I came away from this film genuinely looking forward to another installment.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Well yes this is how I feel.
I gave it a 10/10 because Mr Snyder and his vision made sense,it was all coming together until well,the cuts happened.
Movie was trimmed,cut,chopped,compressed,lacked depth.
I absolutely loved the characters,cannot fault the actors or their costumes and performances.
Seeing more of Gotham and the glorious skyline was one of only a few satisfying aspects.
I feel WB owe the fans big,and I mean a massive massive debt.
They need to up their game and give in to the original vision of Zack.
The 2 hour 45 min Snyder cut will never happen,it's a hard pill to swallow. It for this fan it's unforgivable what the studio have done.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I strongly believe, DC finally managed to successfully capture the tone of their upcoming movies. If they use this as a foundation for their future movies, they could be as popular as Marvel in the next 5 years. This movie was a blast from start to finish. It was like watching a 2 hours DC animated movie. I'm gonna watch this movie at least 5 times in the theater. Be sure you watch this movie on IMAX. There are some Snyder shots that you have to see it on IMAX to experience the best of it. In the last decade, Marvel managed to surpass DC with their MCU.

No jokes here, but this much-hyped Superhero Spectale lacks fizz. What's surprising is that this is an even weaker film to DC's very own & forgettable Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice. 'Justice League' Synopsis: Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater threat. The fundamental problem with 'Justice League' is it's poorly written Screenplay. While the first-hour is all about forming the league, with their back stories, the second-hour is an action mayhem. And very sadly enough, none of it really works. Barring a few funny one-liners & a set of spirited actors, there is nothing that stands out here. And Steppenwolf has to be THE weakest DC villain in a long time! So it's the Writing, that's clearly the culprit here! Zack Synder's Direction underwhelms. Cinematography is of standard quality. Editing lacks sharpness. Art & Costime Design are brilliantly done. Action-Sequences are decent. Graphics are surprisingly tacky. The Score is alright. Performance-Wise: Ben Affleck continues to be a tough Batman & impresses, but it's sad that his version of Batman is so underwritten. Gal Gadot is a firecracker as Wonder Woman. She looks absolutely ravishing too! Ezra Miller shines as The Flash, delivering a sporty performance. Jason Momoa too makes a mark as Aquaman. Ray Fisher as Cyborg is alright. Others lend ordinary support. On the whole, 'Justice League' is a poor show. A major disappointment!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Avengers maestro Joss Whedon assumed the role at WB's behest and while his directorial experience doesn't tie all the loose ends together, Justice League remains an entertaining if unevenly assembled superhero movie.The plot picks up after Superman's death and the world is now at risk of another alien invasion. This time by the bloodthirsty tyrant Steppenwolf (a CGI Ciaran Hinds). Batman and Wonder Woman race to assemble a new team of superpowered humans (Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman) to confront this otherworldly threat.If anything is to be commended about Justice League, it's the cast. They're solid as action heroes and rock solid working together. The action scenes emphasize the importance of teamwork. Interestingly though, some of its best moments are just with the JL members talking to each other.Ben Affleck remains a worthy successor to Christian Bale as Batman, far more likable than in BVS. Gal Gadot is the standout as Wonder Woman. Jason Momoa is having a blast as Aquaman. Ray Fisher and Ezra Miller play the youngest members, Cyborg and Flash. Both do fine when they're enjoying themselves. However, sometimes, Fisher plays his alter-ego Victor Stone a tad wooden. Ezra Miller plays the role of Barry Allen/Flash with glee but his hyperactive manic performance offsets the dramatic moments he does have in some parts of the movie.While most of what works in the movie makes it fun, what doesn't work remains glaringly noticeable. Unfortunately, the choice of antagonist Steppenwolf is utterly uninteresting despite his imposing design. This is due to the CGI for his character being standard at best and Steppenwolf's motivations being murky. His demonic minions look better and are more menacing. A second issue is the pacing. It's become knowledgeable now that WB cut the film down from a longer running time of perhaps 2.5 hours to roughly two hours at best. While this does make it a quick sit, the movie's first half takes too much time and then it's a mad rush to the third act and its obvious reveal.Speaking of which, I'll REVEAL THE THIRD ACT TWIST. PLEASE STOP READING IF YOU MANAGED TO AVOID SPOILERS THIS LONG. Superman does come back to life and for purists, this is the closest Henry Cavill has been to the classic image that Christopher Reeve trail-blazed. It's great to watch. One is left hoping that Cavill is given another chance in the future.It's true that JUSTICE LEAGUE is not the next AVENGERS. That may disappoint some people and leave them underwhelmed. If it had a better villain and a better sense of pacing, it'd be a strong contender for that title. But as it is, it is a step in the right direction as set by the superior DCEU film Wonder Woman.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm not a crazy Marvel or DC fan I have always been a fan of both universes in film and comics. But since Man of Steel had such a bad reaction or should I say mixed reaction I've felt it being hard to win people over with this new version of DC movies. Man of Steel ended being in my top 10 superhero movies of all time and this is coming from a person who isn't a fan of Superman. But not everyone agrees with the movie so then comes Batman v Superman which I thought was subpar not a great movie but still has parts I can appreciate and suicide squad which I loved upon first viewing but then started to see its flaws after a second time and understand why people hate it. But going into Justice League I was kind of scared because Wonder Woman was so great I didn't want them to backtrack and I have to say they did not. This movie is great sure it has plot problems and a villain who is totally forgettable and says mother a lot you'll see what I mean when you see the movie since he is referencing something but this movie has such a great vibe. It's about hope and these new age of hero's and I think it took the right step for the DC characters since a lot of the complaints was that it was too dark. Without giving to much away with plot basically steppenwolf comes after 3 things on earth and Batman and Wonder Woman have to recruit the team in order to stop him. And one of the best parts of this movie is the characters and the way they interact with each other. Flash and Wonder Woman where the stand outs, Batman was great as always, cyborg was spot on and aquaman brought all The comedy. Overall I'm happy to say the movie was great. If I was to rank it in favorite DCEU movies so far it would be. 1. Man of Steel 2. Wonder Woman 3. Justice League Oh yeah Danny Elfmans score is great when you hear the Batman and the Superman theme the audience will probably clap loud. Pros: Characters, script, score. Cons: villain, a few plot holes, needed to be longerAlso the 2 post credit scenes are awesome the first one is fun the second one reminded me of the iron man post credit scene but very Anti you'll see what I mean lol don't wanna spoil it but overall I had a smile on my face the entire time after I left the theater. I wish I can explain more in detail but there are so many spoilers in this movie most of the trailer didn't even show everything something's was misdirection and some things aren't even in the movie that was in the trailer. And some characters don't get much screen time. But like I said it's a great movie. I'm hoping it gets a rating that it deserves because sometimes I think people are overly critical about these movies. If I was to compare it to a marvel movie I would compare it to Captain America civil war or the first Guardians but with the villain from Thor the dark world","22 out of 83 found this helpful.

Almost nothing in the movie was unique and it has all been used in superhero movies already in the last decade. Unfortunately, Justice League is unable to improve on any of these secondhand moments. Instead, a villain with a horned helmet (who is not Loki, Ares, Hela, Surtur, or Incubus) seeks to destroy the world with the help of a faceless CGI army (that isn't the Chitauri, the things from Suicide Squad, the Draugr, or the Dark Elves) and a cube of pure power (not the Tesaract). The character introductions were heavy handed as a result of having to bring in three new heroes and the tone was largely dark with occasional moments of levity. The Flash was the only real source of humor and that was undermined by the mopey serious behavior of the rest of the characters. The Flash's big action scene was essentially a worse version of the Quicksilver scene from ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" Really nothing from Justice League stood out, and even an hour after seeing it, I'm already starting to forget what happened. I felt like I had already because it was essentially copying the formula Marvel used in ""The Avengers"" but with a more bloated storyline that tried to force in too many characters (Commissioner Gordon served no purpose) and Zack Snyder's signature joylessness.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

So when I heard they were making a Justice league I was hopeful. I have to admit though, seeing these characters on the big screen again proved why Batman or people without superpowers, should not be fighting super villains, but that is another story.OK, so......this movie was a good effort in the right direction. I typically do not like DC movies, because they are not fun, and they don't build any bonds between the audience and the characters. It seems that they rely on the relationship between the fans and the comic books. Personally.....I like it to feel something towards the characters. Like hate or admiration......or some emotion. Usually, I end up feeling frustrated....awkward....or even irritated. And whats with Batmans voice??? Is this a whispering contest???The movie was better than BVS.......and waaaaaaay better than Suicide squad. I did not like how they brought back certain characters. There was very little explanation....and nothing to do with the comic book explanation. At the end of BVS, the ground was vibrating around Clark's grave....remember? What about that? In the comic, and in Smallville......yellow rays of the Sun were his friend and source of power.I hate it when movie producers or writers decide to add in their own original information that goes against or degrades the original story arc. Trying to simplify things for a broader audience?Anyhow.....over all it was pretty good. There might be hope for DC movies yet.I rated this a 6.....which to me means Highly Watchable.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Here's my review of JUSTICE LEAGUE . So Zack Snyder did his take on finally uniting the league with a bit of Joss whedon's touch then and there. What this movie did was correct all the mistakes from bvs , like constantly brooding characters and bad edited fights. They even got batman right . I'm not the biggest supporter of batfleck , but with a little character tone down and a better 'not so buff' suit , he did great. Gal gadot was great as wonder woman and her screen space was right. Ezra miller was close to perfect as the flash , considering his new take being more like the mcu's current spiderman and him using the speed force was gold ! Jason momoa was good as aquaman , but he should have gotten more screen time . now the whole movie is very light hearted and is very different form the other dceu movies , but light hearted in a not so cheesey way . Steppenwolf wasn't such a great villain , but hey they're saving Darkseid for the best , and a less intimidating villain is what we need for the team to unite. The biggest problem with this movie is the CGI and that's probably due to switching between directors and stopping production in the middle , and cyborgs suit was pretty revealing , and that too was fixed in the end in a good way .Throughout the movie , there was just one civilian family and that was pretty annoying. Now the most important thing a team up movie needs is good music , sure there were quick references to the classic batman theme and the wonder woman theme , but the overall soundtrack wasn't that good as the album songs from white stripes and godsmack . This movie gave quick glimpses to the lanterns and Shazam and some real hype giving post and end credits scenes. So yeah , justice league had its flaws but it was so entertaining that you don't look much to pick on it. In the end , justice league came out right , with legendary characters , heart pumping easter eggs , fan screaming moments and one big ticket to the hall of justice.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The franchise has had major ups and downs in only four years so where does this one fit in?I'll start with the overall tone of the movie. After the depressing darkness of Batman V Superman, Wonder Woman and had a lighter tone to it; now I'm not saying it's gone all light & happy and copying Marvel but I mean they literally added colors to the screen and moments that made you smile and feel like justice was prevailing. So with that, I'll move onto the characters. who certainly added to my personal enjoyment of the film. this film took some cues from I really enjoyed the League themselves. Bruce Wayne/Batman has remained largely the same since BvS but seeing him here just felt different somehow, one of my favorite moments of the entire film is with him on a rooftop near the beginning; it felt really comic-booky and how I perceive Batman as a character so I really enjoyed that. Wonder Woman again is a joy to watch and continues to be a highlight of all of the films she's in; her wise and mother-like attitude is really nice to see in this threatening universe. The new members I really did enjoy too. The Flash, while not always funny, was entertaining quite a bit in both his powers and story-arc. Cyborg I thought was going to be really broody and boring the whole time, and while he is a serious character, his struggle with his situation and the power-set that he has was really engaging and unexpected. Aquaman was a really fun-loving brawler kind of guy and although I enjoyed his presence I hope more of his character is fleshed out in his upcoming solo film.Story-wise, Justice League is not deep or complex, and not too surprising. I think after the tangled mess of BvS, they took a safe route and a bit of a breather with the simpleness of the plot. I didn't mind that at all and welcomed it but I know many will not enjoy the ""nothingness"" of the story. Part of that has to do with the villain and to be honest, he's not a deeply developed character; another big CGI guy with an army of faceless expendable drones makes for uninteresting stakes. One aspect of the film does involve Superman though, and that's not a spoiler as he's in the trailers and it's no secret. Now I thought his initial return in the film was quite unsatisfactory and it definitely felt like some things had been cut but as the film went on I started to really enjoy seeing him again, especially towards the end. I'd say as far as overall plot goes, it's fairly generic but Zack Snyder's directing does make some interesting visuals along the way.Another negative I'll point out is the script. Now I know the unfortunate circumstances of why Joss Whedon was brought in to finish the movie and I'm glad he could, but some of the dialogue he injected just did not fit with the characters they were given to. Some of it worked, and I'm convinced Whedon did some good stuff in this but not all of it gelled for me.In the end, I'd say I personally enjoyed Justice League a lot more than I was expecting but it is ultimately a fluff movie with not much depth and some terrible special effects during the reshoots.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Suicide Squad was a generic blockbuster finished with atrocious editing and BvS was an insult to everything I loved about movies and DC Comics in general.Justice League doesn't have this problem. It fails in a ton other areas but I couldn't help but like it. I even liked this more than Thor Ragnarok, which is weird because Thor 3 is a much better movie than Justice League. I guess it came down to not feeling disappointed. I wasn't expecting much. I just didn't want to feel miserable and I wanted ""justice' for Superman. I had a fun time watching this movie and my favorite moments were the scenes involving Superman. They pretty much delivered for me.I can understand the flaws too. Steppenwolf was boring, the film was ugly to look at, and the last minute editing was very noticeable (although, I didn't notice the upperlip which is still an issue (why didn't they make Henry Cavil put on a fave beard for Mission Impossible? Did he really need the authenticity? )). As much as I hate his directing skills, I still feel bad that Zack Snyder's cut was butchered by Warner Bros.

Superman: Dawn of Justice, wasn't good but wasn't terrible either. With Wonder Woman coming out earlier this year and being a very fun time, you would have hoped the DC Extended Universe would get on track and continue to impress with Justice League. Warning signs were that the film somehow managed to look worse with every new trailer but I gave the film the benefit of the doubt. Yeah, this thing sucks.An ancient super being named Steppenwolf is trying to collect mother boxes to destroy the Earth and its up to a group of superheroes to band and unite to contain the threat. Batman and Wonder Woman attempt to recruit a hero of the sea (Aquaman), a cybernetically reconstructed former athlete (Cyborg), and an awkward kid who is very, very fast (Flash). Oh yeah, worst keep secret ever as well they also attempt to revive the recently fallen Superman.Here are some of the positives. I didn't have any problems with any of the casting choices. I obviously love Gadot as Wonder Woman, as she fully embodies the character. Affleck as Batman is solid. Momoa has a bad ass warrior look that works for Aquaman, and the comedic timing of Ezra Miller as Flash works. Actually Flash's fresh humor in this DCEU effort is actually the other strong point of this film. You would think that this film would be able to do a decent job of uniting DC's most popular characters but it really doesn't do a satisfying job of it.Justice League is one of the most expensive films ever made. Its hard to believe because the graphics look choppy and messy. Its almost as if parts of the graphics look like they were taken out of a video game. The battles also look fake because they are over done with graphics and it really looks ugly. Steppenwolf is a very generic villain, looks too computerized and isn't built well at all. The dialogue is horrendous sometimes. Some of the humor (mostly from Flash) works but the other moment's fall so flat. In contrast to BVS, Ben Affleck looked like he was just going through the motions.The film had a shorter running length than expected but it still felt too long. The exposition of some characters feels wasted at times, and other times you feel like they spend the wrong moments trying to just throw the characters in. It could have used much better writing. There were times were I was bored out of my mind. The action scenes are fairly grand but nothing epic (compare that to what we get in Thor: Ragnarok). I really back Snyder leaving the DCEU because this is a straight second misfire for him. It's unfortunate to say I have no interest in any film in this Universe aside from Wonder Woman 2.5/10","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

However I hadn't seen the preceding ""Batman / Superman"" or ""Wonder Woman"" movies and found I had a lot of exposition to catch up on, but I just about got there by the end.DC has been trailing Marvel, I think it's fair to say, in the movie stakes of late and even though in comicdom, the JLA predated the Avengers, obviously Marvel's two group blockbusters have stolen a lot of the prevailing thunder, both in terms of critical praise and box office success.I guess the big problem for DC is the perennial one, to paraphrase ""The Sound Of Music"", how do you solve a problem like Superman. The Man Of Steel is so all-powerful that you know that any team he's on really can't lose even if the super-villain the rest of the Leaguers are up against can beat them all to a standstill. About that super-villain, a giant cross between Loki and Thor (he even wields a mighty hammer) called Steppenwolf (rumours that he was almost called Iron Butterfly are unfounded), I found him to be rather unconvincing, not to mention unintelligible at times as he blasts and blusters all over the place.And as for the individual Leaguers, well, of the newcomers, I didn't recognise the Cyborg character (wasn't he a Teen Titan?) and felt he had the least presence of anyone on the team. For me, his place should have been taken by Green Lantern, one of the original comic book characters - frustratingly we see fleetingly a member of the Lantern Corps in one of the massed battles with Steppenwolf and his Viking-like hordes. My favourite DC character of all is The Flash, now starring in his own long-running, very enjoyable TV series but here portrayed as a callow youth, just learning about his powers. He's used for much of the humour in the film but I prefer my Barry Allen to be older and more confident than this. Aquaman, king of Atlantis I almost didn't recognise as a long-haired, bearded, tattooed denizen of the deep who when it comes to the big battle scenes above water makes you wonder why he's there at all. Debate will continue as to whether Batman, a non-super-powered human even deserves his place on the team but Wonder Woman makes a big impression, being the group's second most powerful (behind Supes) and frankly best-looking individual.Of course there are SFX galore, possibly too much as sensory overload is almost achieved, but the story is relatively easy to understand and those scenes where the five, later six, get to pose heroically for truth, justice if not the American Way, against the skyline, get me every time.Markers are put down for sequels although I'd prefer the League in the future to fight against their individual, better known rivals, sort of a league of super villains but I hope the film does well enough to get the follow-up go-ahead otherwise its back the comics for me.Oh and I loved the tag of the old Superman / Flash who's the fastest, after the titles.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

They're rarely great straight away but they stop shipping goals by the ton and looking like a disparate bunch of nobodies. This feels analogous to Justice League. BvS was an atrocious mess of bad decisions and rotten characterisations that would tumble down any league structure like a stone. Now WB have presented us with an unremarkable, but by no means bad movie designed to steady the ship and shore up the defence. Vaguely amusing with flashes of actual flair, I had a decent time watching the guys come together. Yes, the tone is a little awkward at times but at least there is a little light, and if Steppenwolf easily wins least effective villain in the history of comic book movies, and if the plot is as interesting as washing dishes, Wonder Woman, Batman and yes, even Superman, hit some relatively high notes. And I absolutely loved it whenever Elfman's score reprised the Bat's theme from the Burton films. You can have worse times at the cinema this year. Relegation avoided :)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was the reason also to go see this movie. Batman vs Superman was entertaining, but they tried to fit too many plots into one movie. It also had some level of depth, at least compared to Justice League. It has absolutely nothing. The fighting scenes are boring mostly there's no real choreography it's just smashing and swinging. The scenes were consisted on cheesy one liners and boring fighting scenes. There were no tension between the characters and they didn't even get to know each other that well during the movie, even though they pretended to after having known for like a day or two. So yes it was forced, big surprise. I wonder why couldn't they do the individual movies first and do Justice League with more depth after that. This was just bullshit. And I'm not a Marvel fanboy I think their movies are quite shallow as well and way too flashy. They're entertaining like BvsS was but there's nothing more to expect.

Something must be said, people must be warned. Something has to be done to stop those responsible and they have to be held accountable and tried for their crimes.At this stage it doesn't seem right critiquing DC's tired efforts of pulling of a cinematic universe. It's like making fun of a kid that just keeps on falling down flat on his face, at this point one really has to sympathize. So many millions, so many eggs in one basket...Hey who's excited about Aquaman: The Movie? The execs at Warner Bros sure hope you do! Remember when movies had a heart at its core? When they made you feel emotionally invested in characters and the choices they made? You felt there was something at stake, something to be lost, a sense of thrill and danger? I don't think this is asking too much of our movies cause these are the bare minimum of what a film requires. However today that might be asking too much.The ironic thing is, the Justice League cartoon, that used to air on Cartoon Network which was essentially aimed at children, met ALL of those requirements and so much more. The characters and world they inhabited were dealt with seriousness and explored in depth. So why does the movie supposedly aimed at adults treat the material so childishly, presenting the shallowest possible versions of the characters? With low brow humor like Flash asking Batman what his super power is, to which he responds ""I'm rich."" Sure it's cute and gets a chuckle, but interestingly enough something so juvenile wouldn't be found in the Justice League cartoon series, aimed at children.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

The review mainly addresses the mistakes in the movie from the beginning to the credits scene. Throughout the movie, they DC was trying to make a rip of Avengers part 1. With a very similar narrative. Three mother boxes like the (six infinity stones), sending a pawn (Steppenwolf) before a super villain. (Darkseid) just like Thanos sending his pawns. Assembling of Avengers were instead of Nick Fury, Bruce Wayne takes the initiative of assembling the Justice league. Readers, find a similarity yet? Hence this has been a very puny move from DC as well as Snyder, were clearly he could've just taken a different story line. Yes, getting back to the details in the movie, again the title shot was such a rip-off of Marvels new title intro with just DC at one corner. SOMEONE got to change the guy who wrote the goddamn dialogues. Most of it was such clich√© and made no sense most times. It was so awkward when Superman couldn't answer to a boy about the best thing he like on planet earth, it was followed by an awkward silence and cutting to next scene. However, Connie Neilsen's character Hippolyta and Jeremy Irons Alfred Pennyworth did their small yet brilliant on-screen time with some good piece of acting. The Amazonian fight sequel was the best fight sequence that stood out for me in the entire movie. The soundtrack was just good thanks, Danny Elfman.Ben Affleck's Batman was such a fail not just in buffed up looks, common in his 50's with that weight the world's greatest detective is going to be super slow. Also, Batman's character was shown helpless most of the time, whereas in comics he always dealt with his own thing. A lot of simple logic and science was omitted or gone wrong in the movie which is a major factor that pulls down the DC cinemas. These tiny details do count and lead to the success of a film. For example, A dead man's flesh shrinks and appear to have stubble and long hair, whereas Superman even after a year of death or more still look so damn fresh with his hair still shiny and slicked back. Even under homeostasis, he's got to have a beard and long hair. Also, a major scene that went wrong is the 'resurrection of Superman'. The guy who was seen wearing a blue suit in the coffin, is reprise with a ripped black denim, HOW? Not to mention the third bother box with horrible CGI which looks like a metallic hollow tin. Also, the color tone and gradient kept shifting in the last fight scene which made the overall scene dull and less appealing. The CGI of covering up a Mustache has definitely gone wrong for Snyder in a lot of ways. Not only superman's face look like plastic molded, it also made him look like a teenager. Also, the movie made him a little extra powerful compared to the comics. Which is stupid in my opinion. The act of bringing in Lois lane was a good move but at the same time, Sups having a thing against Bats looked like Snyder have amnesia and completely forgot the Dawn of justice story line. That was a major plot hole. The on screen time with Bats and wonder woman is definitely dropping some hints in their future relationship, which was a good and light aspect of the movie. Bruce Wayne bonding over Clark as well providing room for Justice league was a good point mentioned in the movie. However, the credit scene was unnecessary in my opinion and it completely messed up the science were Ezra Miller's flash is shown running with his arms thrown sideways, by doing so he's wasting momentum which is going to slow him down incredibly. Hence, in a nutshell, Good try! DCU (:","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

At first, I was a bit skeptical about the costumes and castings, but in the end, Justice League delivered some of the most comic accurate portrayals in DC's history. The build-up to the main conflict was great. It was easy to follow and it wasn't too slow. As I was watching the movie, it felt like only 15 minutes had passed! I was sucked in to my the story. There was no parts of the movie that was pointless or unnecessary. Everything works. What I would like to improve is the dialogue between the members. It felt flat and uninteresting. Flash and Batman is the only characters that pops to me.

"2","/10","Like the other DCEU Films, This just doesn't try.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3867100/?ref_=tt_urv","isaacandersonanimations","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur76915826/?ref_=tt_urv","25 November 2017","Let's face it, The only way for me to enjoy this film was just to use Nostalgia for the characters I loved before the movie. Sad that if this movie was just it's own movie with new characters without the lore of the DC universe, I would have been so bored watching the movie in the theater watching bland characters just getting along only to fight yet another villain who wants to (you guessed it) take over the world. Here are just some of my points to the movie I want to discuss.1. The movies tries too hard to be a Marvel-comedy movie almost as it tried with being a dark movie.To be fair, I can care less if a DC movie wants to be dark or a comedy, I have nothing against with whatever tone a DC movie wants, but the way the DC movies TRY to express the tone is the problem, It's not that DC movies are TOO Dark or comedic, it's that they're TERRIBLE at being dark and comedic. And it was done in a way that it ruins characters like Batman, Superman, and Flash. Because of BVS's way of being ""dark"" Batman just feels like a dangerous criminal other than a crime- fighter because he was portrayed as that. First we see Batman torture some man, frighten a bunch of citizens and police officers that see him as ""the devil"" than now we see him try to kill Superman, than suddenly change because Superman's Mommy. Wow, definitely the Batman I have seen before... Now how does the ""comedy"" work out in Justice League? Well, some parts in the movie did give me a few laughs, but the comedy whether funny or not, just doesn't work and it feels forced in the movie just as much as how dark was forced in BVS. The tone no matter what has to just be put into DCEU films that don't progress in the story, Flash is my biggest problem of this situation, He is just focused heavily on being a comic relief that his backstory and character doesn't work, seeing Flash talk to his dad in prison felt nothing to me because it didn't feel like this was a conflict between Barry and his father, I watched the CW Flash TV series and when I saw those characters in the same place, I actually felt something because it was actually something that Barry wanted to take care of, he wants to take his father out of prison, and most of the time Barry just cries to him every time he meets him because that's how much he misses him. For the JL, it's just starting with Batman saying ""Hey, here's Barry's backstory"" then we see Barry talking to his dad like ""Hey Dad how's it going"" type of stuff. Lets also say Flash just has no personality outside the fact he's always just confused and whatever. He wasn't funny, and even if he was, he still wouldn't work as a character like Flash from other TV Shows. People try to say Thor 3 has the worst comedy in attempts to defend the JL, Thor 3 was one of the funniest movies I've seen in theaters. And yes, I enjoy Marvel Movies, even though I am a big fan of DC Comic while I just don't really care for Marvel.2. The formation of the Justice League was lazy.So how does the JL form as a team? Easy, just get help from some other superheroes to fight a CGI villain that wants to take over the world. Than just become friends because um, we helped defeat a superhero. Bravo writing, way to really start the DC Extended Universe with all the beloved characters come together. I haven't really seen the Avengers, but I'm pretty sure for god that the characters had more to them than just superheroes who want to destroy Loki.3. Bruce and Clark's instant relationship now just pisses me off about the Martha scene even more.Okay, to be fair, I know what the BVS fans are getting from when they defend the scene, and most of the time the people who hate the Martha scene often use nitpicks to argue with the defenders like ""Why doesn't he just say ""mother"""" or ""Why not be specific other than ""find him"""" Here's my reason why I hate the Martha scene, I despise the scene because it forced the character development between Bruce and Clark. It's not just the fact that they stopped fighting, but then they instantly become buddies, why? After Bruce tried to kill Clark and doing it for reasons that are just offensive to Superman, They just then instantly become friends ignoring the stupid things Bruce was doing to Clark. And that was my main problem with Justice League, Bruce speaks of Clark's death like he was his friend ever since they were children. And it even forces its lines in the movie that tries to prove a point for the defenders on the Martha scene, YES, WE KNOW BATMAN WAS REALIZING WHAT HE DID WRONG TO SUPERMAN BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ITS STILL NOT FORCED FOR BOTH OF THEM TO BECOME BEST FRIENDS. Now knowing that this movie did so horrible at box offices, I am starting to become sure the next movies will probably suffer the same then the DCEU will die very soon.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

This is the same studio that gave us Wonder Woman and The Batman Trilogy. I was so excited after Wonder Woman. I went in with great expectation and thought that the movie would be great. Steppenwolf was just the worst. Too much CGI. And the dialogue and background score was a huge let down. Batman felt like a secondary character. They tried to make an Avenger movie without the plot. The humour in this movie was just forced. Snyder should drop out from directing any more sequel. Watch it when you have nothing else to watch or when it is on blu-ray.

And it was one of my favorite one's. When Marvel came with it's superhero movies i hoped that WB should also start franchise. Well ""better late than never"" this franchise is quite good. It's like a dream come true for a JL fan like me. I literally enjoyed it. First I was in a conundrum after reading the reviews. But I decided to watch and it paid off. Snyder really did a good job adding comedy and also making this film short not a pathetic 2.30 hours like ""BvS"". And this film was better than his previous two's. But I don't know why critics target his movie's ?? Whereas on the other hand each and every Marvel movie is getting rave reviews??Acting of the cast :-The acting of the cast was good; Ezra Miller as Barry Allen and Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry were really a great entertainers. I wasn't hoping that much good performance from Ezra as ""The Flash's"" TV series star Grant Gustin is phenomenal in this role. But Ezra really did justice to it. And I liked Aquaman's cool attitude in the movie !Ben Affleck as Batman was good as he was in the last one BvS. Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot and Ray Fisher did justice to there roles. Action sequences and tech's :-The best action scene in the whole movie was of Wonder Woman's in her entry when she saves the hostages ; she killed it !! along with the slow motions shots it became even more delightful to watch ; The Night Crawler tech of Batman was beautiful and Cyborg what to say?? ""A human computer"" ; Flash's and Superman's scenes were good. Overall I as a FAN of JL series enjoyed this movie and I will suggest others to go watch it. Don't miss your childhood favorite franchise's cinematic film just for the critics !!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Go for yourself to see how good the JUSTICE LEAGUE movie is. It is not perfect but than it is not at all that horrible and bad that these so called ""Critics"" and sites/blogs are rating. I mean there are moments when Superman comes back and people just stood up from their seats and started applauding and so much more. If the latest Thor Movie (Thor:Ragnarok) can get so much good ratings and good reviews from critics i really wonder what went wrong with critics to rate so low scores to JUSTICE LEAGUE. I mean come-on! JUSTICE LEAGUE is not a perfect movie either but it seriously does not deserves only 2 STARS out of 5 or such a low ratings. I mean seriously....!I my opinion Thor:Ragnarok was nothing but a comedy movie. I know I know many would argue but it doesn't come close to my favorite 3 Marvel movies which i mentioned down in the end.There is surely and surely some serious issues with critics that went to watch JUSTICE LEAGUE like ->So all the people out there who want to get entertained, don't listen or read these crazy, mindless critics and their reviews, or sites or blogs. Go for yourself and watch JUSTICE LEAGUE for enjoyment.Folks when you will leave the theaters after watching JUSTICE LEAGUE, you will go home with a smile on your face because of your dear characters of JUSTICE LEAGUE. And that's what your point is right? To get entertained.And wait till all the end credits roll up. There is a major post-credit scene waiting for you. Once you watch it, you will come to know from here-on how excited the DCEU is going to be now...PS: For people who think i am a DC fan, well I am a fan of good entertainment. I like both DC and Marvel whenever they serve me good entertainment. To list few:-Iron Man - 1, Guardians of the Galaxy - 1, Captain America: Civil Warare my ""THE BEST Marvel Movies"" till date.

Finally we are getting some entertaining movies.Today movie business has expanded with a vast range of audiences. Movies today are not only for the dosmestic market but targeting the whole globe as their audiences. So we need to understand that they are all speaking their mind and it is not possible to satisfy every single individual.As of this movie, I felt it was entertaining in its own way. It was great watching all the characters, that we have seen while we were growing up. For people who are fans, they will have a treat watching, but even if you are not a fan and not a critic, even you will be entertained. If you like watching movies, then I'm sure you will not be missing this movie. As for people who want to make sense in every single movie. Then it's not for you guys.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I honestly can't find one thing wrong with this movie. The CGI was good, the acting was fantastic, and the story line was exciting. Every characters side story fit well and made me so invested in each of them. The story made me excited for each scene along with all the action scenes. I loved seeing everyone's powers being used. One of the best scenes in the movie was the beginning. The music with Superman dead was heartbreaking but did a wonderful job showing the world falling apart. The chemistry and teamwork was outstanding. This movie did what I wish Marvel movies would do. It had teamwork and the chemistry I try to find in all Marvel movies. Overall, I loved every second of it.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

No, it doesn't have Hulk penis jokes and 10 year old level comedy. DC takes more pure themes about superheroes and actually shows them being heroes, not just quip-machines.One thing that stands out is Snyder's shots are still amazing to see. There are probably 5-10 cinematic shots in the first 10 minutes alone that show artistry over other comparable hero franchises. Story was pared down due to the need to introduce new characters, but everyone seemed to get enough time to establish themselves in proper form. Acting was solid all around. They didn't pollute the characters will fake angst or conflict as it felt fairly natural in the context of the story. Definitely a strong hero movie overall.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

In my opinion, it is one of the few movies that feel like an adaptation of a comic book, done in a right way! Aquaman is not a joke anymore, Flash is just like in the JLU cartoon, Wonder Woman is well.. wonderful, Batman felt a little underused (I honestly liked seeing Bruce Wayne more than I did Batman, but eh) and Cyborg is just discovering his powers, so give him time.. and the rest, let's just HOPE you'll see the movie.Contrary to what people have been saying about Steppenwolf, he wasn't such a bland villain. Sure, the whole ""I've come to destroy the world"" plot is way overused, but I think the movie does an alright job of showing the reason why he came to Earth.The CG was awful in some parts of the movie, but honestly if you're in the theater for the first time you're not going to notice it that much, only on further viewings and maybe once the movie comes to Blu-Ray you'll notice it more.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

Considering it's frustratingly downgrading ratings, I say many people had high expectations from this.On the opposite, it definitely as flaws about the points I've mentioned above. CGI is sub-par, no doubt. I'll admit I had some issues during the flashback scene and Flash's use of his flashy powers (pardon my puns). But not so intolerable as some are weeping about. Even after hearing the comment on Superman, I was like ""So wait? Henry Cavill had a mustache all these time?"" The story is straightforward and simple, gather the superheroes, beat the bad guy, save the world. It or any other plot elements are nowhere as confusing or convoluted as BvS to be naturally considered bad. Exact case for the villain, Steppenwolf, who seemed nothing more than an elite brutish thug and herald for upcoming bigger threats, imagine Suicide Squad's Incubus (remember him? me neither, at least not the name for which I had to google) being the major threat instead of Enchantress. So is he good? No. Forgettable? Likely. But still better by a few margins than BvS' Lex Luthor, or Suicide Squad's Joker and Enchantress. Actions, as I mentioned earlier, enjoyed them and didn't saw any considerable flaws.Enough justifying the faults, on the pro-side, the eponymous Justice League characters are energetic and enjoyable, so much that it's easy to forgot how stupid it felt that the Flash is basically Barry in Wally's name and personality, also that cringe outfit. His naivete, alongside the memetic Aquamomoa, a more optimistic Batman, the adorable Wonderwoman, and Cyborg (whose placement and roles didn't feel too less executed) all gave strong performances. There's jokes and one liners but they're not overflowing like the current Marvel films, for those that hate these. It also barely even felt rushed as a movie that had 1/3rd of it's runtime cut down, by that, expect it's full release (aka extended cut -_-) to be even more better.So yes the movie can be enjoyable if you're not an overly critical moviegoer and definitely so if you're a comic book fan, since there are a lot of easter eggs and reference decently done.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Justice League falls closer to Batman v Superman than Wonder Woman. I knew better than to get my hopes up too high for this one, though I was a bit hopeful. I loved the trailer's cover of Come Together, and Wonder Woman was great. Maybe Justice League could keep along the same pattern. Well, no such luck. 
The biggest problem was that the entire thing felt rushed. I know Zach Snyder was trying to avoid another long winded and bloated movie, but the fact that DC was getting antsy due to Marvel's success was obvious. The reshoots were also obvious, as well as the clashing tones of Zach Snyder and Joss Whedon. Also, there were some shots or sequences that were taken directly from Avengers, which was sort of funny because it wasn't in a parodying way. In the same vein, the humor (which was most likely Whedon's doing) felt forced most of the time. I liked the Flash occasionally, and I love Ezra Miller, but he was mainly annoying. Which made me sad. Along the lines of tone, which was pretty unidentifiable, the action would often come out of nowhere. This made it feel choppy as well as rushed. The CGI was either okay or terrible, there was no in between. It didn't feel like the movie was building up to anything, it was just...shallow. It felt like it skimmed the surface of what it really wanted to accomplish. There wasn't much chemistry between the members of the team, and no real reason that they should be a team. They just started doing things together and working together, and not questioning it. Unfortunately like Avengers, the one female character had a murky relationship with all the male team members, seeming like the creators of the movie are trying to broaden the possibility of a romantic storyline for future movies based on fan reaction. There were also too many sexualizing shots of Wonder Woman. 
Overall, it was an okay movie. There were some enjoyable moments like the lasso scene with Aquaman. I actually really liked Cyborg and Aquaman, which I didn't really expect to.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Also, a budget of $300M?? The CGI was really bad at times, especially for a film at that time. What did they spend so much money on?

"5","/10","DCEU ensemble film feels rushed! [+53%]","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3862292/?ref_=tt_urv","arungeorge13","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30872044/?ref_=tt_urv","19 November 2017","I'll admit this: 'Justice League' isn't the worst DCEU film out there (the worst one is 'Suicide Squad', in my books) but it definitely won't exude the kind of glee you'd get by watching a Marvel ensemble venture, even with 'The Avengers' helmer Joss Whedon doing some last-minute tweaking business. This is very much a Zack Snyder film in terms of tone, color palette, hazy character building, and CGI-filled action.Supes is dead, Batman feels guilty and before long, a bigger alien invasion looms. Snyder dedicates funky introduction scenes to each member of the League - we really didn't need intros for Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) as their characters were established quite capably in 2016's 'Batman v Superman' and 2017's 'Wonder Woman', respectively. Shouldn't the three newbies (Arthur Curry a.k.a Aquaman - Jason Momoa, Barry Allen a.k.a The Flash - Ezra Miller, and Victor Stone a.k.a Cyborg - Ray Fisher) be getting those extra minutes of screen-time for them to get acquainted with the viewers as well as to construct solid reasons for them to be joining the team.Also, the villain Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciaran Hinds) - sigh. What a mess they've made in shaping the chief antagonist character - his reasons (for even existing) don't come across as one bit worth the buy. Not once does he feel like a threat to humanity as such, or to the league. BvS addressed the issue of loss of human life as part of the superheroes' attempts to 'save the world' through plain human characters (the Director's cut is rather well-rounded). Here, we neither get to see the baddies from the eyes of the public, nor do the heroes seem interested to connect with their earthlings. It also doesn't help that, when it comes to the set-pieces, the spoils aren't apportioned slickly. In most cases, it's Barry Allen who gets the juiciest bit of the pie, comfortably stealing the thunder from the rest. And for those who haven't seen 'Batman v Superman' (or 'Wonder Woman'), 'Justice League' would pose a lot of questions, even though it possesses a narrative of its own.If you've had an eye for both Snyder's and Whedon's past works, it is quite easy to distinguish their individual contributions in 'Justice League'. Their styles are evidently poles apart, and when an effort is made to mesh Snyder's dark, brooding approach with Whedon's humanized character-crafting technique, the result turns out to be a mixed bag. Ezra Miller's The Flash seems to have gotten the maximum benefit out of Whedon's comedic intervention - he is quite like how Tom Holland's Spiderman is to Marvel. Aquaman and Cyborg, even with their separate 'I-save-everyone-else' scenes, don't get to leave a concrete mark. I mean come on, just look at the segment where Wayne asks Barry to 'save just one person' - where are such scenes for Curry and Stone? Simple answer - there aren't.Wonder Woman is criminally underused in this flick after her excellent individual outing in the Patty Jenkins film earlier this year, though I'd have to say I liked the idea of Supes (Henry Cavill) finally getting a well-defined sense of humor (even though he shows up quite late in the film - that isn't a spoiler, duh!). Batman/Wayne is less sombre in 'Justice League' than he was in BvS, and he kind of takes pleasure in reiterating his inability to lead the team (a not-so- subtle hint at Wonder Woman assuming charge in the near future).The mid-credits (fun!) and post-credits (story-forwarding tool!) do tease the DCEU's future in mildly intriguing fashion, but one is left to wonder whether viewer interest is still strong for further expansion of these story lines - the universe has been dealing with rough seas ever since its cinematic inception. Critics and audiences have both never held back from lambasting most of the ventures (barring 'Wonder Woman' which was an excellent standalone). 'Justice League' does have plenty of issues in its two hour run-time but there's one thing it somehow manages to do in between - engage. For an ensemble film with a $ 300 million budget featuring some of the most iconic comic-book characters ever, 'Justice League' falls well short of expectations.Verdict: 'Not-bad' just isn't enough for a movie like 'Justice League'. It needed to be ground-breaking!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The two movies aren't in the same league (no pun intended). In both movies Superman comes across as a sensitive new age guy. Hardly the 'Man of Steel'. DC needs to seriously rethink this character as well as the previously feisty Lois Lane who's now a sugar puff. However, in Justice League Batman gets an overhaul. No longer the deeply troubled troublemaker in need of a shrink, Batman is now funny and proactive - and still a bit disturbed. Wonder Woman dominated her own movie and she stands out in this one. Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman fill out the ensemble cast. Not the best movie ever made, but so much better than Batman vs Superman.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie a lot, even if it has a lot of problems. I enjoyed it because I am already a fan of these characters. Watching them come together had the inner fanboy in me squealing in joy added to the plenty of DC fan-service. But if you watch the film as a non fan who has no knowledge of any of these characters and their back story, you may or may not find it entertaining but would forget the entire film just as it ends.With WB putting a mandate of having the film be less than two hours, you can see easily that something feels missing. Its not exactly plot because the plot is nothing more than aliens invade, team assemble, save Earth. The thing that's missing is a natural flow. Editing feels chopped, the pacing feels rushed and the film lacks any sense of tension.This film had a rushed production and it shows. The CGI feels unfinished and wonky at times, especially Superman's face. They used CGI to remove Cavill's mustache during re-shoots but didn't do a very good job at it as his face looks distractingly weird a lot of times. It also seems like most of Superman's scenes were re-shoots. The villain Steppenwolf is one ugly CGI monster and a rather unmemorable one for the League to be facing. Hence the stakes don't feel huge even if the world may be ending. But the strength of the film that is entertaining is the team chemistry and watching them come together.Danny Elfman's music is more forgettable compared to the more grandiose and electronic themes Zimmer used in Man of Steel and BvS except for a couple of spots where he reuses the classic 78 Superman theme and his own 89 Batman theme. The music orchestrates the tone from the classic Justice League animated series which I personally liked since the animated series is amazing. This film overall does feel like sort of an episode of the series to its credit.Ultimately it seems like WB wanted to react to the criticisms of BvS. You thought BvS was too long, here is something short. You thought BvS was too dark and serious, here is something light and fluffy. You thought BvS was too convoluted with too many subplots, here is a simple story with no subplots. In the end this delivers an entertaining and accessible film that is unfortunately forgettable which is disappointing. But given the troubled production history of the film, I had expected worse.In the end what should have been an iconic film ends up being a wannabe second rate Avengers film.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

We see how they interact with one another with comedic jabs and how each is destined to save the world. That is the core of this film as we are shown. It has been said WB chopped the film up as they don't want a long run time, so they can show more screenings of it. This is the third out of four films that have gotten this treatment and it is getting ridiculous. Snyder has a good vision for this universe and he obviously enjoys making it as a fan. All WB wants to do is market and merchandise the product; they could care less about quality. This pieced together attempt is not good. Parts of the film had my attention but as a whole it fell flat with a poor CGI villain and an under-explained McGuffin that was the three mother boxes. The cuts were obvious as we were jumped around far too often which gave the scenes less significance. Some of the acting was pretty bad as well, mainly from Affleck and Gadot. The dialogue didn't help them either when they tried to joke about serious situations. DC can't just copy the Marvel model, they need to embrace their darker universe and give fans what they want. The highlight was the performances by the other actors. I was surprised how much I like Cyborg and the suit looked better also. Flash was a good comic relief even though they made him a little dumb in some parts. Aquaman was as expected pretty awesome but he didn't get a lot of screen time. Most of his scenes we already seen in the trailers. Superman was better in this movie as he wasn't doom and gloom the entire time. I had no problem with his character in BvS but he had to lighten up a bit or the team thing wouldn't work.I really wish some other company could take WB's place as they are ruining what could be a cool universe. I am sure casual movie goers would sit through a three hour DC movie if the quality was good as advertised. Star Wars: The Last Jedi will be 2 and a half hours and I am sure Disney will not lose money on that investment. I just don't know how many more screw ups WB wants to go through just for the sake of a larger profit.After watching this I might be done siting through these. If the directors have less freedom than Marvel directors I am not sure what to say about the future of this franchise. There is zero creativity and it might get worse from here.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

DC are trying to jump into the success that Marvel has spent years building up to with the Marvel Universe, without any of the build up or effort. They made a mild effort with Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Wonder Woman and thought that was enough of investment to give us Justice League. So ill give you the reprised DC version of why this film sucked...1. The dialogue is awful. Some of the character interaction is woeful. 2. The CGI is terrible. It is obvious that most of the Superman scenes have some, if not all, a CGI element. I suspect that Henry Cavil was unavailable for the script reshoots, therefore his dialogue had to be CGI'd in via his mouth movements. 3. The script is awful. The whole movie is just written to revive Superman. The backstory provided for the CGI villain is straight out of Lord of the Rings. 4. Pointless characters. Cyborg, The Flash and Aquaman have little backstory, it's been shoved in to warrant there appearance. While, as characters Cyborg and The Flash somewhat warrant their inclusion, Aquaman would would be hard placed to gain favour in the Sea Cadets.DC should stop trying to emulate Marvel. Their movies work when dark and brooding. Look at the success of Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy and build on that style rather than the B movie movie version of Marvel your heading at.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The only redeemable part of this novie is the cast itself, with every one being perfectly placed in to their respective roles, particularly newcomers Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller and J.K. Simmons as Aquaman, The Flash and Comissioner Gordon. However, literally everyone is not used well in their roles, no one's character feels substantial, they all have throwaway dialogue that simply helps the story move forward, without adding or representing them as characters, this comes down to unispired writing. A movie like this is only as good as its villain, and Justice League gets a hurrendous one. Steppenwolf is possibly the worse villain I have seen in any superhero film, he is formulaic, bland and never does anything interesting or breathtakingly evil. I am never given a reason to feel in danger or to think that the crew might not be able to take him down, he is easy competition, and Ciar√°n Hinds tries his very best, but he is given absolutely nothing to work with. It is simply unacceptable how bland and awful this movie is, they did not learn their lesson after Batman Vs. Superman and Sucide Squad, they did not see what worked with Wonder Woman. This type of an event film should have been handled with so much more grace, it shoud have been as big as the first Avengers, but the studio just threw it all together and gave us something that will simply float in to the abyss, despite featuring some of the best known, most recognised fictional characters of all time. Left me feeling hopeless and annoyed. Forgettable and regrettable, Justice League is everything a superhero movie should not be.Bruce Wayne must assemble a gang of heroes to take down an almighty threat.

The disgrace on the other hand can only be described as an unfunny parody. WB and writer/director Joss Whedon should be ashamed of what they created. That goes double for the behind-the-scenes abuse and drama. The only thing I like more in this version is the credit song Come Together which was a Snyder and Junkie XL element.Whedon and producer/ghostwriter Geoff Johns thus brought nothing to the table in 2017. Watch this after you have seen the real movie to learn what can happen if studios and focus groups take over an auteur-driven film but there is nothing here worth seeing for the sake of entertainment alone. I lastly can¬¥t believe how ugly and badly scored this version is and how well those key aspects work in the Snyder version.#RestoreTheSnyderVerse and wipe this travesty from the DCEU canon WB.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This movie feels like a fan edit that has been mercilessly shredded to fit under 2 hours because well, that's what has happened. If any film ever needed an extended edition, this does.

He is mourned and Steppenwolf pounces on this new vulnerability of Earth to achieve his evil plan.As someone who was thoroughly disappointed in Batman v Superman, I didn't really know what to expect from this movie. But I can say Justice League is an overall fun time. The most important job this movie had to fulfill was to make the viewers buy into this team, and I think it was a success. This team functions really well as a unit. I enjoyed watching them fight together throughout. The team chemistry is rocky in the beginning but gradually improves throughout, as it should. Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman are all pretty cool characters and I can't wait to see more movies with them. The tone of this movie is also rather relaxed and lighter than usual, which is a pleasant surprise. As for negatives, there are a lot but most of them can be overlooked. First and foremost, Steppenwolf continues the trend of these new DC movies and is not just bad, but awful as a villain. Never once did I fell he was a menacing villain. No development is given for him and he just shows up whenever he wants to. It just seems like the DC movies are whiffing on their villains and hoping the heroes can make up for their shortcomings, and that better not be the case once Darkseid is involved. Second, it's so blatantly obvious how much was edited here. The first half was much of a drag for me. The setup is handled sloppily, again because of the excessive editing. The action scenes, especially the finale, look like a giant video game. Another trend in Snyder movies, there is barely any regard for civilians. Honestly, I can pick this thing apart but I know it wouldn't be right because of the struggles the crew had while filming.What brought life into this movie is Superman. No Spoilers but his scenes are by far my favorite. This is the Superman that we all wanted to see all along, and Henry Cavill is amazing. If Superman was mishandled again, this movie would've been a disaster but thankfully that didn't happen. Everything they did with the character worked for me.To wrap it up, Justice League is a mixed bag for me. The characters work well as a team, which at the bare minimum is all I wanted, and this definitely a step in the right direction from Batman v Superman. The movie is good enough that I want to see more, but this universe needs much more work in order to shore up the plot and tonal issues. Good villains would help too.Justice League gets a C+.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Starring Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, Henry Cavill, Jeremy Irons, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, J.K. Simmons, Ciar√°n Hinds, Joe Morton. (PG-13)Turgid time-waster aims to do for DC what the Avengers did for Marvel, but while Marvel's all-star smackdown was less a home run than a solid base hit to left, Justice League is simply a strikeout where the batter's pants fall down after missing the swing. While struggling to cram several new superheroes (as well as one of the most generic and forgettable villains to ever appear in a major comic book film) into a movie that runs less than two hours, the story is so rushed and fragmented that it often makes little sense, and it's a chore to even pretend to care about the film's raison d'√™tre MacGuffin (boxes of power, or some such nonsense, a concept already done to death by Marvel, Transformers, and so on). Miller manages a few chuckles as the Flash, but his character rides name recognition only, and his hero-in-action sequences are just a rehash of Quicksilver's twaddle in the X-Men movies. Meanwhile, Affleck broods and grumbles halfheartedly, Gadot poses more than acts, Cavill cashes his paycheck, Momoa plays a gym rat version of the Little Merman, and so on. Even as a sensory-assaulting stew of eye candy, it fails to deliver excitement; it wouldn't have helped if the action had been directed/edited with more than the scintilla of skill on display here since the special effects are an ugly, cartoonish swamp. Much has been made of Cavill's rubbery alien mouth, but even more annoying is how literally half the film looks like cut scenes from a PS3 title. I wouldn't want to play such an uninspired mess of a video game; watching one on the sidelines is even more of a chore.22/100","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The animated stuff DC has been pushing out has been excellent but the films have been pretty horrid. For the Justic league movie we find more of the same. They lack actual character development, Ben Affleck feels like he is phoning in the performance half the time and the rest of the time they seem to be putting Batman in a useless light as if he's not going to continue on. A lot of the CGI for the Flash is horrid looking. While the actor and character are decent in the film they spent little time on making these moments amazing. Aquaman is in something of a similar boat, he looks great and most of the scenes with him are decently done but they still fall short. Wonder Woman is probably the best (again) making me feel a desire to see another Wonder Woman movie, but all of this combined we see a HUGE flaw. These are the A listers for DC and they are flopping so badly. While Marvel is swinging at us with some rather obscure characters and we are eating it up! This comes from the story telling more than anything. DC truly needs to step up that side of things... and if they would just do like they have with their animated stories we would be great I think.

Driven by nostalgia for simpler days, I went to the cinema and enjoyed every minute of the best team-up ever. Why isn't it a perfect 10 then? Because nothing can compare to those days you spent in front of a TV as a kid, watching JL. But they came very close to it. It's an action packed story about putting together the most famous superhero team in the world, from getting to know each other, to working together to save the world. The tone is lighthearted, permeated with feeling of hope. The movie is full of Easter eggs and big names. Two post-credits scenes just make the viewers excited for the next installments.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

It lacks any real sense of suspense or any kind of emotional stakes. They keep saying over and over about how Steppenwolf (Ciar√°n Hinds) is going to destroy the world and everything will be lost, but I don't feel it. Justice League uses a lot of blatant explanation and exposition in order to try to make you care for these characters and their quest, but it doesn't work. I feel entirely indifferent to what is happening on screen. I don't hate what is happening; I just don't care about it at all. The film certainly feels like it has undergone extensive re-shoots. For the first thirty minutes or so, the movie just moves scene to scene to scene. There is no real connective tissue bringing these scenes together; they all just happen one after another. I think this is where Joss Whedon tried to reshape a lot of the movie, and the result is a start-stop jagged feel that breaks any sort of investment I have each time the movie abruptly decides to move on to something else. It feels like there's a lot more to the story that has either been cut out, or re-shot to maneuver around, and it makes it all feel superficial. Because so much work has gone into reshaping and reworking this movie, nothing actually feels authentic. I am not immersed in the story, because the story is a Franksteined-together collection of two visions...","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The first shot of the movie made me die laughing and not for a good reason. Henry Cavil, aka Supermanwas in another movie where he had a mustache and the director would not allow him to shave it, so what does DC do? Well they spend 3 million dollars on CG to get it removed and it looks god awful. Anyways talking about CG it's looks absolutely terrible in this movie. Not one scene with any CG in it looked realistic, and this movie has one of the biggest budgets of any movies, ever! The plot honestly made me want to off myself. I don't want to say anything about except that it is so idiotic and will baffle you. And please don't start with the acting. The only believable actor is Ben Affleck (besides the fact that the DCEU has screwed Batman) and the actor who plays Cyborg. The villain is the somehow more forgettable than the villain from any man. He is so forgettable I honestly don't remember his name and he is supposed to be capable of deystroying the world. In conclusion don't see this movie don't support DC until they can finally make good movies, or please go back to making standalone batman movies.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Director Zack Snyder's well deserved reputation for masterclass quality spectacular action and visual imagery is on full display here with the constant onslaught of large-scale epic action & fight scenes.Highlights: -Wonder Woman's first action scene was ridiculously awesome. -The big action sequences involving the Amazon warriors were pretty epic. -A scene taking place at the memorial park was extremely thrilling (enough said!).Do not miss the experience of seeing this on the big screen! That said, there are a few caveats that aren't significant enough to affect my score, but I feel should be mentioned.-Lots of shots seen in the trailers somehow didn't make it into the final movie. Without knowing why those shots were cut, it's hard to tell if this is a bad thing, but it definitely feels like there's potentially a longer (maybe better?) version of this movie out there with additional scenes that we didn't get to see.-The big bad guy, Steppenwolf, was just kinda... bland. He's a fairly generic two-dimensional villain with limited uniqueness or depth, you know the kind whose whole story and personality can both be summed up with simply that he wants to take over and/or destroy the world. Before you cry foul at why this doesn't lower my rating for the movie, it's that at least his action scenes are still really good, especially his super-thrilling fight against the Amazon warriors - that was a big highlight of the movie - so that at least makes up for what's lacking in his story and personality.-Danny Elfman's Batman (1989) & Batman Returns (1992) musical scores from back in the day may have been legendary, but his work here was... serviceable at best. Something was missing. This music served simply to set the mood of the scenes, but I didn't find it particularly stand-out or memorable. I'd say it lacked the epic vibe and distinctive themes and raw emotion evoked by the other DC movie composers, Hans Zimmer, Junkie XL (Tom Holkenborg), Rupert Gregson-Williams, & Steven Price. He also repeatedly samples bits of his own past Batman music and John Williams's Superman music, which is questionable, considering how long Hans Zimmer has been composing so many superb DC Batman & Superman themes (since Batman Begins, 2005) and doesn't even get a nod here.Anyway, that said, watch it. I highly recommend it! Oh, and screw the critics and their snobby attitudes, as usual. If anything, pay more attention to overall audience ratings, such as right here on IMDb, for a 100x more honest consensus than any critics' ratings.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's everything I want a superhero movie to be. You could see REAL superheroes fighting the bad guys the way it should be. The movie has everything; fighting scenes, serious conversations and scenes (which Thor didn't have) and just enough humor you'd want in this kind of movie. Honestly, after reading critics I'm very upset because the movie is great and all the arguments there are putting are ¬Öwell¬Ö stupid and weak!

Batman/Bruce Wayne(Ben Affleck) is filled with hope by Superman/Clark Kent's(Henry Cavill) ultimate act of heroism. Batman asks for the help of his new acquaintance Wonder Woman/Diana Prince(Gal Gadot), to help him find more individuals with special abilities. Together, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash/Barry Allen(Ezra Miller), Aquaman/Arthur Curry(Jason Momoa) & Cyborg/Victor Stone(Ray Fisher), have to stop an imminent threat from destroying the world. Justice League is an incredible film. Director Zack Snyder has masterfully brought together, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman & Cyborg together on the big screen, for the first time. Snyder makes sure that, equal importance is given to each of the iconic superheroes. The action set pieces are fantastic, my personal favorite being the climactic one. The visual effects are awesome. The 3D definitely adds to the overall experience of the movie. The highlight of the film is the amazing performances of the main cast. Ben Affleck is brilliant as Batman/Bruce Wayne. It's nice to see Affleck portray a witty version of the Caped Crusader, this time around. Henry Cavill is spectacular as Superman/Clark Kent. When Cavill finally appears on screen, trust me, it's worth the wait. Amy Adams is great as Lois Lane. Gal Gadot is outstanding as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince. Gadot gives us another flawless performance, after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016) & Wonder Woman(2017). Ezra Miller is awesome as The Flash/Barry Allen. Miller's portrayal of Barry Allen, is on par with Grant Gustin's portrayal of the same character, on The Flash(2014) TV series. Jason Momoa is excellent as Aquaman/Arthur Curry. Momoa's unforgettable performance, has me looking forward to his solo adventure Aquaman(2018), which is releasing next year. Ray Fisher is amazing as Cyborg/Victor Stone. Fisher portrays his character's vulnerabilities, with ease & panache. The interactions among all the six superheroes when they finally meet, is an absolute delight to watch. Jeremy Irons is hilarious as Alfred. Ciaran Hinds is effective as Steppenwolf. Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J.K. Simmons, Amber Heard & Joe Morton are good as Martha Kent, Queen Hippolyta, Commissioner Gordon, Mera & Silas Stone, respectively. Justice League is a must watch for fans of the DC Extended Universe. Go, have a thoroughly good time!","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

They should have done movies with the story of the persons alone before throwing them all together. To me it was a very cheap ripoff of the Marvel movies. The bad guy was a Loki wannabe. Cyborg was a joke. But I guess an Iron Man wannabe. That's what he reminded me of. The story was a weak Avenger copy. The Super Man coming back to life was the best part of the movie. That and Flash telling jokes. Wonder Woman was okay in it. Aqua Man was bust. Reminded me of Moana. Batman seems brain damaged. He's supposed to be a genius, but not here. And his outfit, go back to the Michael Keaton one. The Movie was so so, okay not worth seeing in a theater with people talking in it.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Few problem were that it was short & was rushed at times in the sense of story line plus some CGI effects looked gloomy & mediocre moreover the villain was weak but apart from that this movie is boisterous, bad ass & a wild ride. The opening scenes was one of the best scenes ever shown in the comic movie plus the comic depiction of these heroes have been perfect especially of Batman & Superman moreover the visions and the cinematography was magnificent & seemed on point & was exactly depicted from the comic strips & the post credit scenes was one of the best ever shown in any movie predicting a great trilogy ahead Superman was great, Batman was cool AF, Flash was humorous, Aquaman was bad ass , Cyborg was captivating & Wonder Woman was of course gorgeous & was all positive All the heroes rolled very well together with a positive vibe & with an essence of heroism I LOVED IT SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I can definitely see this movie having a longer cut that maybe explains the mythos better. The exposition definitely felt rushed, and the team had to come together a little too quick. But my god this movie is likable and all I can say is finally. I don't know if Zack Snyder got the memo or Joss Whedon saved the day. Whoever it was, they listened and delivered. DC made a coherent movie that's not just about Wonder Woman. I felt like I watched a long episode of JL animated instead of a sequel to Man of Steel or Batman vs Superman. I'm totally fine with that. I feel like for someone not familiar with the DC mythos the exposition could've been fleshed out better in regards to the Mother boxes and the other civilizations like Atlanteens/Amazonian. But everyone was so much fun to watch my problems are just small nitpicks, and they really didn't bother me. Wonder Woman is perfect as always, Batman looked awesome, Aquaman was badass, Flash was hilarious, and Cyborg really surprised! I won't say much on Superman other then he made me tear up a little bit. Go form your own opinion, critics are tearing this movie apart and I think it just had too much to live up to for its previous mistakes. It's overall a fun movie that gives hope for the future of the franchise and I'm very much looking forward to what the DC verse cooks up next. Lots of great Easter eggs in this movie that just shows me they understand what the fans like. I had a blast and I walked out very happy. And that's all I could've hoped for. Don't let Rotten Tomatoes dictate what you should and shouldn't like.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

This one has laughs but moves right along with the plot. There is a lot from the comics in there. Overall, it was pretty awesome.

As a DC and Marvel fan, I enjoy both while seeing the good and bad in both. I feel like every review is trying too hard to convince you this was perfect or that it was utter trash, it is neither.Con's first,-The villain could've been more but to be honest, this is the problem the majority of comic book movies have so it didn't make a huge difference for me-Feel like a lot of important pieces were left on the cutting floor to meet the silly 2 hour restriction-CGI could've been flushed out a little more, it wasn't as horrendous as people are making it out but it wasn't perfect for sure-The story could've had a lot more weight considering this is a world ending type of invasionPro's now-This is the justice league, every character has their moment to shine and leaves you wanting to see more of them. There is some good development on all the characters and the dynamics between the members were great.-There was some comedic humor in the movie, not too much that it felt like a Marvel movie but enough to give you a good giggle here and there.-The action sequences were probably the highlight of the movie, visually rewarding and entertaining (expected from a Snyder movie)-End Credit scenes were brilliant, 2 different tones but definitely gives hope for the direction the DCEU is heading-A lighter tone while retaining a shade of DC, keeps the personality without becoming too light or too dark. Was good to see more daytime sequences and a better overall tone.-Flowed smoother than previous DC instances, it was a little on the faster side but didn't disrupt the flow. Previous outings it felt like you were playing catch up the whole movie... this one definitely flowed better.-Soundtrack was good, not great... we still haven't hit anything along the lines of John William's score type of level. Nothing too memorable but nothing which was painful either... it was good.Overall - The movie is a step in the right direction for DC, there will be those who hate with a agenda or overreact because of a single point. Truth is these are super hero movies, most of them are flawed but the key point is whether it is entertaining... this was entertaining, visually rewarding and gives hope where previously there wasn't. I would recommend you watch it yourself, if you are expecting perfect... no super hero movie really is but if you expect a super hero movie, then it is definitely one of the better products from both studios, not the best but definitely on the better side.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

She carries the weight of the movie for the most part, but also shares it with Ben Affleck. Both take turns in being the leader in the film.Flash is a welcome comic relief, very much like he is in the animated series, but not on the TV series. Its a different take which I actually like better. (And I'm a big fan of the Flash TV series)Cyborg was also a nice surprise. They cleaned up the CGI so it doesn't look as fake as it did on the trailer. I think he should have a little bit more of a back story, buy then again the movie would have been much longer.Superman is played exactly in the way I expected. He seems even stronger than when he fought doomsday. Its like he could have taken over Steppenwolf by himself, no problem. But there's more than just fighting the bad guy.Steppenwolf is the weakest point here, bad CGI, bad lipsync, and he just doesn't look that menacing even though he can single handedly beat almost all of the JL.As its pretty much given nowadays, the trailer shows several scenes that didn't make the cut. There's one that created several fan theories. Well that's not in the final film and it becomes clear why its left out.There are a couple of post credit scenes. The last one sets the path for the next film, but I'm not really sure if its for the next batman or JL2. From looking at it, I wouldn't be surprised is there is a JL3.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

You don't go into a Justice League film wanting a first class villain. You go into a Justice League movie wanting to see our heroes interact and fight. Oh my gosh it is so hard not to spoil this movie because it was so good. I think that DC made a good call when making this film because I didn't see any disappointing faces walking out of that theater.

This movie is a pointless and expensive CGI that even Gadot's Wonder Woman luminescent star power, can rescue. Given the generic state of the plot and how uninteresting the characters are, ""Justice League"" wasn't worth the trouble. For me this movie is the most mediocre, boring and pointless A-list superhero film going back through the nearly 40 years of modern superhero films. The problem is that it had the potential to be great, epic and exciting but is one big incoherent and loud mess that, unfortunately, has failed to deliver an unforgettable cinematic experience that the fans have been waiting to see.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Such was the case with the Superfriends kiddie 's show. I got off too Wonder Woman as a kid, but that was back in the Lynda Carter days. I liked it mainly because it was the first series that offered such a variety of heroes and villains. Watching it now though really exposed it's weaknesses. I realize it's a rehash of a 90s cartoon, but the lack of logic is unreal. For an extreme example of this, observe the episode involving the aliens from Venus. All DC follow the same simple formula. It opens with the baddies plotting a scheme. A combination of their members devise a plan. By the end of the show, the villains are caught, but always have a cheesy way to escape. On a positive note, Wonder Womans ""Dark Knight"" look comes off as XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS rehash. For me though, after the second of four episodes on the DVD, I watched the rest at double speed to save time and didn't miss a thing. The Legion of Doom bios in the extras are kinda neat but forget the stupid game option.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Other than Wonder Woman, each DCEU film has left me somewhere between ""meh"" and ""ugh"". Even when Joss Whedon (Avengers) came in to help a grieving Snyder finish the movie, their exponentially different styles worried me, and that worry was mostly found true. Yes, Whedon's wit does bring a welcome shine to the gloomy proceedings, and unlike Batman v. Superman and Suicide Squad, keeps this from being an all-out slog. Still, it's an awkward epic that can't overcome the franchise's dark doldrums. Just like every other superhero movie ever made, a charisma-less and bland villain with limitless power appears, bent on destroying Earth because of ""reasons"". Superman still dead, the world must depend on lesser heroes to save them. Affleck is still a pretty good Batman, Flash is light-hearted fun, Aquaman is kinda cool, Cyborg is dull and dour, and Wonder Woman is still the standout. There are still certainly some interesting moments between the characters, but they're mostly overshadowed by superhero-ethic clich√©s, stupid drama, bad CGI, and nonsensical logic (why are these guys such quick allies?) There really is just so much that doesn't work: specific jokes, bad visuals, interpersonal relationships, muddy action, plot predictability. The main problem, though, is that DC and Warner Bros. think, through their previous films, they've given us enough reasons to care about this universe, and they haven't. The positives here, mainly just seeing these heroes together on-screen, have left me mildly curious about the future of the franchise, but only barely. Otherwise, Justice League is easily the worst superhero movie of the year.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Sometimes, facts are upside-down in this real world. The theater was full house with adults and kids. The whole movie was a disaster - graphics after graphics, CGI after CGI - nothing, nothing, nothing was realistic or even looked like a movie. There was no ""SCALE"" in the movie - just a handful of superheroes - that's all - no other people. It looked worse than a video game with the WORST graphics and CGI. I was annoyed eagerly waiting for the silly movie to end so I could go and do better things - like digging holes in the ground and then cover them up again!After the movie was over, I was shocked to see people clapping and cheering and NO ONE was getting up from of their seats to get out. I was stuck in the middle and waited for about 5 minutes into the ending titles and to the end of credits but still, NO ONE was getting up from their seats! @#$%^&^*( And this is just an IMAX 2D movie. Is it because of Ben Afleck or the Superman role? Or is it the comic-book fanboys and fangirls? Obviously, they have never watched great movies. It is beyond me how such a disastrous movie could get 7/10 rating. I would give it a 0 if possible. 2+ hours of my life wasted I can never get it back.That applause did not happen for Wonder Woman or Thor Ragnarok which are some of the BEST MOVIES of 2017 with the best CGI and 3D. What's worse? Thor IMAX 3D was running with a limited number of shows - just 2 shows a day instead of more than 5 shows.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Cyborg in the old version looks more like an anime character; and flash was useless. In the cut version, cyborg seems to be more realistic; and was well made. Also, I like his gadgets that were added; to his robot-suit in the cut version, which I don't recall being in the old version. Also flash was well made and more helpful. The ability to rewind time blew my mind. Also, how the mother boxes came to life after superman's death; was well explained. The cut version was amazingly made, and Steppenwolf was much better designed which is an amazing upgrade. The old Steppenwolf version was horribly made. It looked more human than alien.

I loved the cartoons and comics, and DC really did a good job of bringing the cartoons and comics to life! With all honestly, there were some flaws, but overall the story is quite amazing. And I really do like stories that teach valuable lessons, and Justice League does that. I really thought Justice league lived up to my expectations and I hope it does the same for many other people.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

A very enjoyable ride, with great casting choices and perfect chemistry between the different characters. Thin, straightforward plot and bland villain but just watching the league slowly coming together was worth it. The interactions between flash, batman and wonder woman were especially endearing and heartfelt. Also, the cinematography and filming was visually stunning, especially for a comic book movie. When watching avengers in 2012, it was a nice experience watching superheroes assemble to form a team but Justice League pretty much blows it out of the water because you finally feel as though these are gods fighting and not a couple of human beings with super powers. I'm already thinking of re-watching this movie!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I am at a loss for words about this movie. I felt like I was watching a Marvel movie with a high fever and an overdose of cocaine. Nothin made sense, the script is so awful Joss Whedon should have been fired before filming even started and all the characters are antisympathetic to the point where I even considered turning off. The antagonist, Steppenwolf, is so badly conceived and laughingly executed, the enttie movie so videogame-esque that most of the times it felt more like a bad videogame with some actors appearing than a film supported by visual effects. The entire look of the movie was changed from the cool and dark appearance of Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman, both of which I liked very much to accomodate an artistically inept audience and does give the film a comic-like appearance which I absolutely despise. Even the soundtrack is both boring and massively stupid. There is absolutely nothing I liked about this film which is staggering to me even more so since I very much liked the DC movies up until this point. I sincerely hope that the series doesn't go down further this path or I'm gonna have to refuse to watch this moronic crap in the future...","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was my dream since a little child to see superman, batman and company in the big screen. As time passed by, obviously I grew up and my taste on choosing films changed. One thing I loved about man of steel, Batman v superman and Wonder Woman was the seriousness they took. It really differentiated DC from MARVEL it is important to realise that both universes are different thus the fact that WB copies them in making unnecessary changes and decisions is why i can't keep my mouth shut. I really HOPE that in the future with Aquaman, flash, Batman and etc. They take back the road they chose from the beginning(Zack Snyder). I love the way he paints his ideas onto the films. And makes us feel related with the characters. I know that for example superman should be more hopeful, and etc. But it is a universe that it's starting and the characters can evolve. But ONE THING I CANT IGNORE is the attempt to copy marvel in their jokes, and ways to do movies. I like marvel films, but they are not so meaningful for me as DC so I hope they figure things out.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Also, let's be honest here: it's a ripoff of the 2012 Avengers movie. No, seriously, compare them side-to-side and you'll quickly notice that Justice League steals a lot of stuff from The Avengers. Both feature an alien villain (Steppenwolf and Loki) of divine origin (New God and Asgardian) leading an army of mindless gray-skinned aliens (Parademons and Chitauri) to Earth in order to retrieve powerful artifacts and conquer the planet, requiring a group of superheroes to form a team and learn to work together to fight them back (after the heroes argue and butt heads with each other for a bit, of course). Additionally, the artifacts in question are both cube-shaped (the Mother Boxes and the Tesseract), and both would-be conquerors are servants of characters who are themselves Counterpart Comparisons from their respective comic book mythologies (DC's Darkseid and Marvel's Thanos). Also, both movies try to have multiple jokes in them to ""ease"" the atmosphere (Justice League isn't really good at it, BTW) and both superhero teams are being led by a ""badass normal"" type character who relies more on martial arts skills and strategy than anything else (Batman and Captain America). Plus, what happened to the colors in these movies? It's like some idiot decided to put a crappy color filter or something...the movie's brightness is so low that I sometimes have to constantly squint at the screen to know what the hell I'm looking at. Looking at the movie sometimes hurts my eyes. Also, some of the actors do a good job while others...not so much.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

After watching ""Wonder Woman"", I wondered (pun intended) how it got such a high rating here. So, I expected the same with JL. However, what I got was probably the first DC movie that I honestly enjoyed in a long time (after ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy). It was a lot of fun! Jokes are good, the story is good enough to keep me watching, the action scenes are done pretty good too. The star of the movie is definitely The Flash. Those who compare him to Lex Luthor in BvS are being mean for no reason. The guy made this film work! Again, the weakest link in this universe is Wonder Woman, that is Gal Gadot. Her acting and accent got better for this movie, but are still not at a level they should be to justify a major role in a big budget film (IMHO). Also, it seemed that the women in this movie are either an excuse for the men to talk about their feelings and not look weak, or to be a love interest. But that is just me nitpicking. Watching it in the cinema is a must to get the full experience, because the 3D is done really good. I really enjoyed it!

That's why I am coming with my voice to this and be ready because it is a positive one ü§© OBS! I am not a professional reviewer and for this movie I am happy not to be because my job is not to go there to judge the movie I am there to enjoy it. And with Justice Leuage I did and big time! The heart of this movie is the casting, the casting is just spot on! We love these characters because their take on it feels genuine. They screen well together. And seeing the leauge together for a few paning shots made me wish I was at home already to hit that pause button. Everyone in the team is needed and everyone has a moment in the movie. The pacing is great and for those that has been with the dceu from the starts gets rewarded because the dialog remindes us that we are still in this same universe. The music takes a back seat to the splendid action but has the iconic songs coming in just in the right time for you to get that extra feel. You will know what songs I am thinking of. The story is simple, a plot driver with a villain that gives more meat to the mythos of this world but don't steal any screen time and that's what I wanted. One minute less on the villain 1 minute more of Wonder Woman :) So what you get is an awesome JLA film stylish straight to the point and a honestly funny movie. This movie gets an 9/10 A must watch with a re watch for me, and a 100% must buy on Blue Ray I hope for an extended version. When we get the full version as it was intended 2:50h before studio medling then I am sure I will give it a 10/10","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

This movie is totally about the heroes. The chemistry and the way the heroes come together were fantastic. Batman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Aquaman and most importantly the Flash had incredible chemistry. And don't worry you will be satisfied with a certain someone's return and his whole transition into being iconic. The villain is not the memorable with Steppenwolf's CGI work not being the greatest but he does what he needs to do to bring the heroes together.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I don't count Wonder Woman in this list because it took place in a completely different setting, an entire century ago. It was more of a period piece comic than any of the other failures. And it used the period piece attitude to its advantage.This was the very first DC comics production set in our times that used humor properly, it might have something to do with Joss Whedon's role in the production, but it's not important ""who's to blame"", the fact that the jokes work is what matters. Bigger than life characters can either be able to laugh at themselves or they come out pompous. A pompous super hero is unattractive, and very hard to take in a film that goes for about two hours.Another big point in favour of this movie, is the acting. This one is an ensemble piece in the best way. Each part of the cast gives its share to the final outcome. Even Ben Afleck's stone face are made to work, when Batman is written to suit his limitations. Ezra Miller is wonderful as the Flash, showing the promise we all felt when we saw him in Fantastic Beasts is coming to fruition. Gal Gadot is improving as I predicted she would. She simply makes the role her own, and is much better than she was in Wonder Woman, where she was all right, and did show signs of the talent she has. Thing is, every one is giving his/hers share. Even the small roles are well written.There's is only one major fault I find with this movie - its villain. Steppenwolf, is one of the most one dimensional villains you could come up with. He'll do all right in a group of super villains. He can't carry the whole antagonist part of the movie by himself. Yes he does look strong and even scary, but that's not enough. There's nothing more there, and the potential did exist. He did fail to conquer earth once before, it's hardly mentioned. the special hatred that should be felt is neglected by the script. Steppenwolf simply hates everything, and shows very little emotion at all. I believe that with more attention to his character the movie would've been a better one.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Wonder Woman only had one, and it takes place years before the events of Justice League. Flash and Cyborg don't have an origin movie yet, while Aquaman got his well after release of trashy Justice League movie. Warner Brothers was so impatient in trying to rush and compete with Marvel, and this is the result... one of the dumbest movies ever conceived. They should focus in producing 1-3 origin movies for each individual DC Superhero (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, etc...), before finally rebooting for another Justice league movie. Stop competing with Marvel, for they patiently setup their cinematic universe, while Warner Brothers couldn't wait building theirs for at least 5 years.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

1. As usual with Zack Snyder (Director) films, there are some really impressive, and eye-catching, visuals.Cons:
1. There are a couple plot-holes. For example, Wonder Woman's (Gal Gadot) whip induces people to tell the truth. However, when she ensnares a henchman in it, he somehow avoids telling the truth by answering a question she didn't ask.
2. The acting is pretty terrible for the most part, but especially from Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck (Batman/ Bruce Wayne).
3. The special effects look absolutely awful, with stand-outs being Henry Cavill's (Superman/ Clark Kent) missing mustache, and Steppenwolf (Ciar√°n Hinds) himself.
4. The action scenes all just devolve into CGI schlock-fests that are wholly unengaging and boring to watch.
5. The humour falls extraordinarily flat, particularly with the character of The Flash/ Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) whose main role seems to be supplying annoying and inappropriate one-liners and jokes.
6. Steppenwolf has no motivation for his actions other than conquering. This makes his character bland and uninteresting.
7. The score is way too cheesy and overbearing at times.
8. The dialogue is incredibly clunky and mostly serves to force-feed the audience exposition.
9. It's obvious that the outside locations are all clearly filmed on a Hollywood studio set, and it's made even more blatant by the ugly artificial lighting.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This met my expectations but sadly it does not get a full ten stars. My one main complaint was the pacing, it just felt odd at times and this seems to be a recurring theme with Zack Snyder films. The humor wasn't overly done but seemed to be just the right amount. The flash's actor seemed to do well. The cinematography was great and the film looked great. The CGI at times felt a little off and could've been cleaner. Overall I enjoyed the movie and look forward to more entries in the DC universe.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

But let's say I'm lucky enough to have finish such mess.This review is for DCEU and at this so called movie which was a blocklackluster.Visually this movie is trash. Story wise this movie went nowhere and the CGI is so obviously bad in many parts.I didn't give a damn about the characters, the whole story arc was meaningless and DCEU failed to utilize on awesome characters like Flash, wonder Woman, Superman, Aquaman and Cyborg. And for everyone's favorite Steffinwolf was a letdown as a character and as a villain.The only good things about this movie is Cyborg he was cool and Galdot shouting ""Kal El No"" in the worse way ever. Another good thing is I didn't fall asleep to this movie like I usually do with DC movies.People will go into this movie as if JL will be a game changer like Avengers 1 was. You will be let down hugely. This movie and the DCEU is lackluster and a forgettable brain cramp. After Avengers Infinity War no one really will remember that this movie happened. Lets say it didn't so when the 1st Justice League movie happens it will be the movie of the century.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

But when it comes to this film alone we have two very different visions and even though both are good, they also have flaws. To start, one of those flaws was the VFX of Superman's upper lip. The visual effects were poorly done and the majority of Henry's screen time was short and dull, and though it was nice to have his presence it hindered areas of the film. Other than this, Joss's writing is among the best and this movie is a great exsample, the plot is strong and remains in focus throughout the film, the cinematography and screenplay is fantastic, the visuals are beautiful, and the choreography and dialogue is very well executed. What Joss's cut also does very well is acknowledge the tone and atmosphere of the DCEU. It's a fun, exciting, colorful and ambitious movie that fits very well next to the other movies such as Suicide Squad, Birds of Prey, Wonderwomen, Aquaman, and even others like even Jonah Hex and Green Lantern. Where as Zacks cut is much more like watchmen with a dark depressing tone. Many will say Zacks is better and use angry words to defend their opinions but the plain simple fact is this is a good, fun film and most people who get angry and defensive over movies are likely Snydercult or film trolls so do yourself a favor watch it with and open mind and decide for yourself.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I at least could with Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn Of Justice, but Justice League was empty writing, trash CGI effects with a horrible horrible hollow B grade villain. The CGI for Stephenwolf looked like PS2 graphics and he sounded like he had marbles in his mouth. Batman changed drastically from BVS. To a very dull and boring character. The Flash was super annoying and just a downright joke. Wonderman was also nothing like she was in her solo film. Cyborg was just useless. I think honestly the only character who shined was Aquaman. He was excellent. The story arc was also very lazy and very scattered. This movie was just utter trash and is one score I actually agree with on Rotten Tomatoes. I was so mad about the post credit scene with Luthor and Deathstroke. Now we won't get to see any of that.

Sure, it has its moments, but then it is sort of.. boring. The story picks up mostly from were it left in the Batman v Superman film, except that this time Bruce Wayne is not acting like a psycho. This time we are introduced to Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman. Cyborg is a very likable character, but there's not enough time to introduce him. So it looks like his story is quite an interesting tale, with an underlying tragedy, but we never get to really learn anything about it. We only know that he is supposed to be dead and this alien artifact was used by his dad to reconstruct him as a cyborg or something along those lines. Flash is mostly the comic relief. He is also briefly introduced, we learn that his mother is dead and his father was arrested in suspicion of her killing, but he thinks he is innocent. Aquaman is a bad-arse who likes helping poor communities in Norway. When Bruce Wayne approaches him he tell him he works alone and later on he joins the league for no apparent reason. We are quickly told that he belongs to the Antlantean people and he has some powers under water (duh) and that pretty much sums it up.So, Earth has these alien cubes which are.. powerful. And there is a bad guy called Steppenwolf, who tried to conquer Earth millennia ago with the help of those cubes. The Earth-dwellers (humans, atlanteans, amazons, gods, etc) amassed a huge army to stop him and hid the cubes. Now it seems Lex Luthor's adventures with the kryptonean ship somehow woke Steppenwolf up. He wants the cubes and wants to conquer Earth, because that's what a bad guy does. When all heroes realise there is a serious threat, they join Batman to fight him. But Bruce Wayne thinks they need Superman. Now, the league has one of the cubes because of Cyborg. Somehow Bruce Wayne comes to the conclusion that the cube can revive Superman and so it does. Superman temporarily goes really crazy because he can't remember who he is, but after a couple of hours with Lois Lane he is back to himself.The League then locates Steppenwolf in Russia or something similar, and he now has all the cubes. They fight with him. When Cyborg and Superman start separating the cubes, Wonder- Woman can fight Steppenwolf solo. She isn't the only one, everyone has a go and in the end they split the cubes with no serious consequences and Steppenwolf dies or something. And so it ends.As I said, it's boring. And it doesn't make much sense. The first time over they needed a massive army to stop the bad guy, and now six people can do the same job. Sorry, I'm not convinced. Someone got the story wrong here, either the villain is waaay weaker than expected, or the League is too damn strong.Either way, most main characters are very one-dimensional. DC has been repeating over and over again a huge mistake and it doesn't take much intelligence to pinpoint the problem: They should create a film for every single hero before throwing them together inside a box and selling it. I keep saying that The Dark Knight was a masterpiece of hero films and they were right to avoid making a new Batman too soon. But they are wasting time and huge amounts of money doing these crappy films. The only heroes with any kind of back-story are Superman and Wonder-Woman. Everyone wants to see more of them, we already met them, we already know about Superman's dad dying in the hurricane, his doubts about who he is and where is he from; we saw Diana's despair after she failed to stop the World War; we saw these characters grow and mature. We can relate to them because we know their story. Now, what's the story behind Cyborg? And behind Flash and Aquaman? What about Steppenwolf? We know nothing of these guys, just rumours. Nobody cares. The plot is too weak. So Steppenwolf wants to conquer Earth. Why? What's so special about Earth? Can't he conquer something else? Doesn't he have a plan? Don't we need more people to stop this guy? Can't it be more difficult? Say, get the League to recover one of the cubes or something, and continue the story later. Why all the haste? Show us small victories, difficult decisions, doubts, a bit of drama. This film doesn't have anything like that.So let me finish by stressing this: This film is boring! Boring! DC is living in denial. If anyone with sense from DC Comics one day reads this, put this into your small heads: DC's films are spiraling out of control. You are doing it wrong. Stop doing it wrong. Is not that difficult. Get a decent writer. Whomever is heading this madness, has no idea what s/he is doing. Sack this person.Wonder-Woman is a nice film. It stands by itself and is really cool. But Justice League... meh.Oh yes, CGI is passable. Sometimes is good, sometimes is awful. That's a minor issue at this point.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I would say Justice League is the best and right step for WB and DC Comics.Critics such as VOX, IGN and others are either paid to trash DC movies or they are simply IDIOTS who did not receive a party invite or some PR goodie bags by the WB.Pros:Ben affleck is again just real and catchy as Bruce Wayne/Batman (the best there has been) Gal Gadot is stunning period, Ray fisher as cyborg plays an integral part in the movie. I personally feel cyborg as an entity is quiet boring but ray does a good job on it. Ezra miller as Flash is beyond words, Funny and entertaining, i felt he brought the soul to the movie just like he did in the animated movies as well as the comics. Grant Gustin and Ezra Miller are both very unique and should not be COMPARED AT ALL!!! both are amazing in their respective portrayals. Jason Momoa as Aquaman finally shows that Aquaman is a real deal. A bit cocky aquaman but realistic on the live screen and finally Henry Cavil as Superman is light and what superman should be. I feel Man of steel 2 would be something to look forward too.Direction of Zack Snyder and Reshoots of Josh is fairly visible, at times you know the tone of the movie is dark but its still very much lighter than BVS. story is a bit rushed but it does touch the important issues like why stepen wolf would hunt these boxes. The overall tone and the occasional banters give you a feel good sense.Cons:The first 25 minutes in the movie and you start to feel it might be a bore show, but as the story progresses it fairly feels good and covers up for its problem, The main problem of the movie was the Villain, stepen wolf does not feel like a strong menace, he was weak and taken down easily by superman, i felt he could have terrorized a bit more at least could be a match for superman. even General Zod and Doomsday felt more dangerous than wolf, the CGI on him was a big let down. Rushed story and scenes of aquaman underwater could have used a more lighter tone. DC Need a STRONG Villain if they ever want to get absolute 10/10.Conclusion:On the whole i feel Justice league was a step ahead for DC and WB, Cyborg and Flash have good potential so does Aquaman and Superman. Wonder woman will get another movie, I would like to see Ben play batman in a solo movie to see its potential. Justice League is just light hearted and amazing. Money well spent, and i would desperately wait for the other DC movies to see their Vision. 7 stars for the amazing movie and +1 for the justice done by Josh.Final Verdict: Go and see it, Worth the money, 8/10.Just to add there are Two end credit scenes and a lot of Easter eggs especially in the backstory of Stepen Wolf narrated by Gal Gadot.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Some great things have been in their movies but the overall movies have been disjointed, unsatisfying or leave the audiences wishing for more of the things that worked and less of the things that didn't. Wonder Woman turned the tide and now Justice league has shown that there is a future there.The main characters are all well developed here. Some get more screen time than others but every one of them brings something different to the movie and the little bits they bring meld together well. Their interactions in pairs or together are all done well and in some cases you are left wishing for more.Things feel rushed in places but this is as a result of the studio insisting on a 2 hour running time. Ironically a longer run time here might have helped but it is what it is.The action scenes are impressive and enjoyable and we get some cool visuals.The villain Steppenwolf is pretty one dimensional and he lacks menace. He is voiced well but he's pretty uninteresting but I've decided that it's not such a bad thing - for these individuals to come together they needed a world threat to put aside difference and the way the Motherboxes are used to bring them all together worked for me. Now that the team have been established a more interesting villain or villains can come in.WATCH THE POST CREDITS SCENE - I promise it seems worth it and it hints where future movies might go. If they go in that direction for a future movie, I for one would far prefer it to another alien invasion story (save that for the third film.This is not a perfect movie but it is massively enjoyable and long time fans will get a few nods to previous movies and comic books which will make them smile.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

While I'm not holding out much hope for the Snyder Cut to be good, it has to be better than this misshapen eldritch horror.I wouldn't say it's definitely the worst film in the DCEU so far, but it might very well be the laziest. From beginning to end, I cannot shake the feeling that almost no one either in front of or behind the camera cares at all about anything they're doing.Sure, there are exceptions - most notably, the newcomers to this series. At the very least, I got the impression that Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, and Ezra Miller were trying to make the rubbish they were given work, but see if you can spot arguably the biggest problem with this film in what I just said.The n e w c o m e r s. This is the first time we've seen Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash have any substantial role in this universe, and they're just hastily shoveled in with almost no time left to give them any character, or in the case of Aquaman, reason to even be there at all. If there's one thing I'm positive will be an improvement in the Snyder Cut, it's that they certainly have enough sodding time to work with.Cyborg is easily the best of a bad bunch, they at least found time to give him some kind of a struggle, even if it does turn out underdeveloped and ultimately pointless, while Aquaman is so useless you'd probably forget he was in the film at all if he wasn't on the poster, and The Flash is the most transparent, unfunny, just there for the lol's comic relief I've seen in a while.That said, the returning characters don't fare all that much better. If I wanted to be technical, it's worth noting that Batman hasn't even had a solo film in this universe to this day, that he has virtually no personality at all, and that Ben Affleck is utterly snoozing through this whole film.So really, the only two characters that we have had enough time with to know them before they appear in this film (a la The Avengers) are Superman and Wonder Woman. Superman spends most of this film being dead, and is only brought back because they didn't have the balls to leave him dead and so made the villain too ultimate for the entire rest of the Justice League to take on without him. And don't even try telling me that's a spoiler, because just scroll back up and look at the poster. Superman's logo is on it. He'll be in this film.And Wonder Woman is just there to be the mum of the group and keep the rest of them under control, doesn't really do much else, and Gal Gadot is noticeably worse than she was in her solo film. I'm sure it has absolutely nothing to do with Joss Whedon being a creepy pervert, but there you go.But holy crud, somehow none of them can compare to the at this point legendarily bland Steppenwolf (what a stupid bloody name), who is the single worst villain I can remember in a superhero film right now. He wants to blow up the world because he's a jerk, and don't let me catch you expecting anything more.Which would be a good time to mention the effects...um...what happened?This is tied for 5th most expensive film ever made, with a $300 million budget, but it honestly looks like a cheap made for TV movie most of the time. From the lighting, to the effects, this is an ugly film, and it's got to be the most baffling thing about it to me. How can so much money end up looking so unrelentingly bad?While I will admit the tone is surprisingly consistent for a film that was likely destroyed in the editing room and the product of two different directors, it's clearly not what Zack Snyder intended. Not that I'm a huge fan of his or anything, but even if I don't end up liking it, I'm glad he got to release his version of the film in the end, because I cannot tell you just how slimy I find it to mess with a person's work to this extent for some deluded ploy at mass appeal. And that's before we get to the fact that he only couldn't finish it because his daughter killed herself, after which DC and Joss Whedon decided to spit in his face and release his film in this state while he was presumably still grieving. Writing this out I'm suddenly reminded of how goddamn furious that made me back in 2017, and honestly I'm still angry now.The directing, whether it was Joss or Zack doing it, is extremely bland and forgettable, the story is boring as hell, the dialogue sucks and the soundtrack doesn't have a single second of memorable music in it, and the editing is a total mess from start to finish.So screw this film, screw DC, screw Joss Whedon, the abusive pillock, and I hope you're happy with the film you eventually got to show the world, Zack. At least this tale had a happy ending.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Am I going to say Justice League was perfect; no. It was not. No movie is. Especially superhero movies. But I'm not going to see a superhero movie to see a well written dialogue with an amazing pace and plot I'm going to see a super hero movie to watch people with unnatural abilities that we don't have (like flight, speed and strength) kick ass like in the comics. This movie delivered. The action was impeccable. It blew Marvel's little baby fighting action out of the water, which is surprising for me to say considering I love Marvel movies. This is how true superhero movies should look.The 3 problems I had with it were 1) some CGI 2) pacing 3) duration of movie. I thought some CGI was off but that is understandable considering the amount in this movie, and it didn't effect my opinion of the movie. The pacing was off sometimes in the movie like in BvS, but that is only because Warner Bros set out a mandate that it couldn't be more than 2 hours. I love long movies and wished it would've been 2 hr 30 min like it was originally. Besides those issues, I thought it was fun, heart felt at times, and action packed. And finally they added post credits scenes which I will not go into detail about!! If you love having a good time, comic book movies and love watching your favorite childhood superhero movies on the big screen than go see Justice League! Hats off to Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon! Loved the music although I preferred Hans Zimmer because he is a legend.Last but not least, don't listen to reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. They hate everything DC and only base movies on plot and pacing. They don't watch movies like normal people would and their reviews are not accurate to how real people seeing a movie would feel. They only watch the movie as a critic would not a fan. They go to see the movie because of their job not their love for the movie. And to be quite honest, I think that they believe people care about their opinions more than they really do. Go see the movie and decide how you feel about it for yourself! Hope you enjoyed this!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Even the way Superman arrived due to some scenes in the trailer being different than in the actual movie which turns out being a lot more pleasant than annoying. Amazing movie. I wasn't convinced of Ezra Miller being the Flash, but he's so different from Grant Gustin's Flash, not better or worse, just different. Funnier, actually. But here he's not the team leader so he can take the role of the joker type in the movie. 10/10!!!

I understand it was supposed to be important bc It was the first female superhero..We want it to win...As an African American...believe me I get it. And I was rooting for it...But it was horrible.Justice League was just more Wonder Woman. It truly makes me sad. I was really behind Zak Snyder's vision. He was going for a different more adult oriented tone with the DC Universe as opposed to Marvel. But instead of embracing and defending Zak's vision Warners caved to fanboys and critics...People this is how creativity dies. When, instead of making things we're inspired to make...we make things we think people want to see.Marvel has their cartoonish characters...And they do them well. But I really identified and empathized with Zak's Superman and Batman. They were the most human I've ever seen these characters.Justice League was a cartoon. Like the justice league on cartoon network when i was a kid...only somehow cheesier. This movie was screaming PLEASE LIKE ME...PLEASE PLEASE LIKE ME! Like some desperate high school girl.Where BVS might've run too long...Justice League was WAY too short! Warner Bros is a completely a$$ backwards studio. I just wish they had the conviction to commit to making something we haven't seen...I understand they have a 200 million dollar investment...But i truly believe if they had stood up to these di*kless nerds and said NO! WE'RE MAKING BATMAN AND SUPERMAN THIS WAY! And if you want that childish garbage..GO OVER TO MARVEL!Again...it was sooo rushed! You have the biggest superheros in the world! They dwarf Marvels best...and they each got 5 minutes of intro time?!? Unreal. Even superman's return needed MORE time!..He comes back..goes beast mode on the team then he goes back to the farm WTF?!? DC/Warner's is a mess guys. I think we need..dare I say...Chris Nolan.

Who is the main target audience for superhero movies? Obviously teens, kids and people toward the young side. Now, lets get to the course of the film. I didn't get to watch batman vs superman, so i got a little bit confused. Now here is the thing. There is so much conversation that I would have had trouble memorizing the scripts of this film as compared to if i had to memorize an entire philosophy textbook. But don't get me wrong. The film is not too bad. Apart from the main course at the end which i will get to later, the whole film is just about Batman tryna get his 'JL' team together, and that process is longer than my mom's nagging ever! Not much action from each character especially from the Flash, who was my favourite during their introduction, but that is not what got me a off. There was this scene where Superman was revived and the 'JL' team tried to reboot his memory by fighting him. He actually manages to pin down Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Aquaman and Batman by himself. Hell, pretty strong! And then the Flash comes in, runs just slightly pass Superman's vision, and they fight right there, the 'JL' team still floating(Superman flung them). Supermna not only has more than all their strength combined, he has the speed of the Flash. What the hell? I'd like to end it off with this. In the ending, Superman threw a punch at the enemy and that somewhat was the way he got defeated. One...punch... What is the point of the title ""Justice League"" if you're gonna give the credits all to one character?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Your mind is going to explode. Words can not describe how bad this movie is. Acting, script, directing...you think they deserve 0 rating? This is where you are wrong, because the CGI used in this, opens a new dimensions here, and from now on we'll have to rethink what me mean when saying ""ridiculous, awful, joke, can not be true"", etc. 
Do not miss it, they've written history here.
You can discover a new range of feelings by watching it, feelings that you had no idea that they were possible to feel.
I don't wan't to go graphic, but I'm just not strong enough to resist:until now, my most uncomfortable experience was when I had my first Erectile Dysfunction...but this movie has changed everything. 
Make yourself a favour and watch it, I know it's going to be a roller coaster of ""Whether am I still a human? Is there a point to life? Why should I keep this going when a litre of bleach is a dollar, and could end this all?"" and whatnot kind of feelings, but!!...if you can sit this through, you are going to be a whole new person, and even if you killed a prostitute at one point of your life (I hope you didn't though) you'll be able to forgive yourself.

He needs those boxes to destroy the world and start over: his way. The boxes were hidden so evil could not find them and destroy the world. Bruce Wayne needs to field a team of super-heroes to combat Steppenwolf and make sure he doesn't get the three boxes. He does this with Wonder Woman's help, but feels it is not enough and the team comes up with a plan to revive Superman/Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) with the help of one of the boxes they have in their possession. This is the movie we have been waiting for. We didn't know how Superman would come back and this plan using one of the most powerful boxes in the world seemed like it would work mostly because no one really knows the makeup of Superman from the planet Krypton. The Justice League: Batman, of course, Jason Momoa as Aquaman/Arthur Curry; Ezra Miller as the Flash/Barry Allen, Gal Gadot as Womer Woman/Diana Prince and Ray Fisher as Cyborg/Victor Stone.There are two winners in here: the CGI as it is some of the best I have ever seen and the story about the return of Superman. Steppenwolf is a CGI creation and Ciaran Hinds is the voice of Steppenwolf. (Could have fooled me. I thought he was a real guy)Notables: Jeremy Irons as Alfred, Batman's right hand man; Diane Lane as Martha Kent; Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Connie Nielsen as the Amazon Queen Hiippolyta, Wonder Woman's mother; J.K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon; Amber Heard as Mera an Amazon warrior; and Joe Morton as Silas Stone, Victor's father. The story is very good and we knew it would have to be epic. (Destruction of the world would seem to do it) The acting all around is spot on. We see many interactions among our superheroes and we wished there were more. This is for us: We Believers who grew up on Superman, Batman etc comics and wished it wasn't fiction and when we read the comic book we snuggled into our private reality and wished the comic book story never ended. Actually, it never ends for us as like I said: we are Believers. Stay until some of the credits run to see a race between Superman and the Flash.This is a great story of the return of Superman and some of us Believers did have that box of Kleenex handy just in case. Now we can wish for more Superman movies with or without Batman, but with is okay, too. Now we can add Superman to the complete Justice League. This is what I have been talking about. Been too long. Kudos. (10/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: Yes. Banter within the justice League members. One of the best line is when Flash/Barry asks Bruce Wayne/Batman what his super power is. Wayne replies: ""I'm rich.""Language: One SOB and one S-word was heard. Rating: A","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

A grumpy, slightly older man dressed all in black has to gather together a group of superheroes in order to face this threat. But can they stand together or will their internal squabbling tear the group apart? What movie is this?If you answered The Avengers... well, right there is your problem. DC's Justice League is almost an insult. It's not like DC hasn't tried to emulate Marvel before with their films, but this right here is so blatant that it has to be deliberate. I mean, couldn't the MacGuffin have been at least some other shape? Every single viewer is going to be thinking of the Tesseract, so why even go there. You're doing yourself no favours with such a move.Aside from that the film suffers mostly from the same problems as the other DC movies, with the exception of Wonder Woman. Too much, too soon, with too many characters. With The Avengers we already knew all of the key players. With Justice League we know Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, but the characters of Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman are completely new to us. Aside from that brief cameo by Flash in Batman v Superman, but that was exactly like I said: brief.This means that this film has to introduce three whole new characters in its run time. Four, actually, if you count the villain. At least with The Avengers we already knew Loki. Thanos was a new one, but he was more of a puppet master behind the scenes and not the primary antagonist of the film. And I'm sorry, for a movie such as this, four new characters is too much. Something has to give.Not helping the matters is the fact that the film doesn't look great. Almost all of the backgrounds are CGI and it shows. I've seen better graphics in video games that are almost a decade old. The action scenes are choreographed somewhat decently, but once again I find it hard to get invested when I don't really know any of the players.DC is in too much of a hurry. Marvel has proven that the superhero craze is not going anywhere for the time being. They could have easily given all of these characters their standalone movie and then went ahead with the Justice League. This is too much, too soon, and quite frankly watching it made me angry.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What I don't like about either is ..the need to make Flash a stupid kid and Spider-Man also in the Avengers.
It brings the tone of the films right down to childish. The choices of actors for these parts can be to blame somewhat but they can only act as directed.
Thank goodness for the TV version of The Flash.
I do look forward to seeing the characters solo films, Wonder Woman was great roll on Aquaman & Cyborg.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Simple, straightforward plot without much social nonsens and preaching. Little in terms of the all too common whining and sel pitying by the heroes. They are heroes all the way without any nonsensical vendettas or moral stuff (mostly). There is an episode with a temporary memory lapse and some unnecessary slowdown but it is quickly dealt with.The movie was criticized for its ""overuse of CGI"". Well, go watch another movie then for Christ sake! News Flash: It is a Super Hero movie! There are supposed to be a lot of CGI in a super hero movie. Personally I enjoyed every second of the FX loaded scenes.I am quite happy to finally see a real Super Hero movie and especially to see Batman and Superman again after that utterly abysmal train wreck Batman v. Superman.I liked all the heros in this movie. The Flash was a bit silly at times but it was bearable. Gal Gadot is as hot (I had to say it) as ever as Wonder Woman. There are a few comical moments but luckily they are not overdone. Aquaman accidentally sitting on Wonder Woman's ""truth lasso"" was quite hilarious actually.The SF was generally great. I really liked the explosive action scenes. The colorful tendrils that invaded the land around Steppenwolf's lair was a bit si-so though. They should have kept them just black and red at least.
Steppenwolf himself was okay. From a distance he was pretty great but up close (and there was really too many up close scenes of him) he looked...not so great, especially when talking.There are a couple of stupid faults of course. Usually involving the good guys just standing around looking while the bad guy screws them. Leaving the, obviously, all important third mother box unguarded and the lust looking stupid when Steppenwolf grabbed it was a real low.Anyway, I really liked this movie. I do hope we get more like it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story is not good, it feels like it was inspired by the first Thor movie, Avengers and a couple of other Marvel flicks. And it was executed BADly. The jokes were not funny at all, it felt like they tried too hard to be funny.
Acting was not up to par either.
It felt like a rush project where they used talented actors ( apart from Ezra Miller who sucked and child murderer Gal Gadot ) in roles that didn't have any soul.

Everything that had to do with superman was beautiful. While the plot and narrative was simple it still have its smart writing moments. They didn't downplayed Barry Allen's brilliance to make it just comedic relief. And even cyborg who's the less known character was presented and developed in a fairly complete and satisfying way.

"5","/10","You can't do this story in two hours","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6235391/?ref_=tt_urv","davidmvining","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur110212703/?ref_=tt_urv","4 November 2020","The biggest mistake Warner Brothers seems to have made about their big team up picture isn't that they forced it too early, it's that they forced it to be two hours long. I have to imagine that part of the reason Zack Snyder left the project in the middle of post-production was that Warner Brothers was demanding a two-hour film and he knew he couldn't tell the story he had made well in less than three hours. After the loss of his daughter to suicide, he probably wasn't up for that kind of fight and simply tossed in the towel, allowing Warner Brothers to bring in Joss Whedon who ended up retooling the movie to such a degree that it feels like a lesser cousin to his own The Avengers rather than the next movie in the DCEU.The movie has six main characters, only three of whom have any previous screentime more than a couple of minutes in the franchise up to that point. Superman had two movies. Batman and Wonder Woman each had one. But Cyborg, the Flash, and Aquaman had nothing other than brief cameos in Batman V Superman, so the movie needed to really focus on these three, giving them time to grow within the film itself to help them carry their weight. The problem with the two hour runtime is that so much needs to be dedicated to the bringing together of this new group, setting up the plot, setting, and overall conflict, that there's very little time left for character building. According to Zack Snyder, Cyborg was (and will be in his cut) the emotional heart of the film, and that seems like the right place. He's the most ""outside"" of the group, dealing with his own problems of belonging because of his unnatural existence built from one of the Motherboxes hidden on Earth for thousands of years. Whedon seems to have moved the focus to the Flash, though, because Ezra Miller is quippy in a way that fits well with the way Whedon writes dialogue, but the Flash himself isn't that interesting as he is in the final cut.So, Superman is dead and Batman has a bad feeling that bad stuff's coming. He needs a team of super people, so he tracks down the three other people listed in the hard drive he stole from Lex Luthor in Batman V Superman. The first fifty minutes or so of this movie feels like it could be arranged in almost any order as it's all made up of the kind of set up scenes that don't really need direct connection to the events immediately proceeding and succeeding it to make sense. It's fine to have for a time, but when almost the first half of the film is built this way, that ends up making a rather tiring first half to sit through. Anyway, Batman tracks down Aquaman, gets rejected, the Flash who quickly accepts because he needs friends, and Diana tracks down Cyborg who seems willing to help but not join.The villain of the film, Steppenwolf, shows up in Themyscira and absolutely wrecks the greatest warriors on Earth, the Amazons (the second such beating they've gotten in this series) before stealing one of the three Motherboxes on Earth. The other two were hidden by the Atlantians under the ocean and by man, which man had rediscovered and used on Victor Stone to make him Cyborg after a near fatal car crash in a desperate move by his father who had access to it. Steppenwolf gets the second box from Atlantis just as Aquaman is swimming by which allows for a dull information dump about who Aquaman is and how he's important in the middle of a movie with an actual plot to get to. This somehow convinces him to get involved (really, this movie needed another hour at least of storytelling). Steppenwolf then follows a set of clues to Victor's father in his effort to find the third of the boxes, which leads to the first team up of the five living members of the nascent Justice League that leaves them with little to show for it.In the face of such an imposing threat, they decide to use the last of the three Motherboxes on Superman's corpse to try and revive him, which obviously works, leading to the single best sequence in the film (and, it seems, the only Superman scene preserved from Snyder's original cut without major reshoots from Whedon). Superman doesn't know who he is, and he's angry, especially when he sees Batman, his burgeoning memories pointing to him as an enemy. The five against Superman is a good little action sequence where the highlight is the Flash realizing that Superman is as fast as he is. It's quality stuff.And it's over too soon, but the movie suddenly does have a direction after Steppenwolf steals the last of the Motherboxes. He goes to an abandoned nuclear power plant in Russia where he will combine the three into one, a process that will ignite a terraforming process and turn Earth into a facsimile of Steppenwolf's planet. Sound familiar? So, the five go to Russia with an objective to stop Steppenwolf, get Cyborg to the Motherboxes so he can separate them (further evidence that he should have been the central character in this ensemble piece), and defeat Steppenwolf once and for all.The big action scene is big and well done (considering the size and scale, it's probably also primarily Snyder's work) with a Russian family thrown in to give the heroes a moment where they save people, most likely in direct reaction to people's thoughts on the first two Superman movies in the DCEU where the little people were largely forgotten. It's big and destructive and look good, so there's that, but it's ultimately kind of unengaging because the character work is so incredibly thin, all because a story that should never have been squeezed into two hours got squeezed into two hours.There are also tonal things with the movie. Joss Whedon and Zack Snyder are not similar directors. Snyder is kind of ponderous and self-importantly bombastic while Whedon is light and comic. Whedon as a choice to replace Snyder was an obvious attempt by Warner Brothers to distance the franchise from the stepping stones that Snyder had established. The break in tone would be less of an issue if Whedon had made Justice League from the beginning, but the material isn't really built to support non-stop quips from the characters. A lot of the fun dialogue (which I do find fun, by the way) seems to break from scenes to have a quip rather than be a rational extension of the scene in any way. It's a weird, Frankenstein's monster of a film that way.I'm prepared for Snyder's cut, to be released next year, to be a superior film, mostly because I expect the expanded four hour runtime will be used to fill in the character holes created by whittling the film down so much. I don't really expect it to be a masterpiece, but for the new cut to be in line with Man of Steel and Batman V Superman, ie, big, earnest, ambitious, and flawed. Whedon's cynicism doesn't really seem to fit in this universe.Still, the movie has its charms. Its second half works pretty basically after the flagging first half. It looks good, and there are winning performances all around. It's mildly entertaining, but nothing exactly special.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

DC even brought in Joss Whedon (the filmmaker behind the first two 'AVENGERS' movies) to co-write the screenplay, and direct $20 million worth of reshoots. Zack Snyder (who also helmed 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE', 'MAN OF STEEL', and co-wrote 'WONDER WOMAN') directed and co-wrote the film as well, with Whedon and Chris Terrio (who also co-wrote 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN'). The cast features Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot and Henry Cavill reprising their roles as Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman (from previous movies). Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher also costars as Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg (which they previously performed cameos as, in previous films). Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielson and Joe Morton also reprise roles from other movies too; while J.K. Simmons and Ciaran Hinds join the cast. The story deals with the superhero team forming, after the death of Superman, to battle a new supervillain named Steppenwolf, and his army of Parademons. The film has gotten mostly positive reviews from fans so far, and some critics even like it too. I was severely disappointed with the movie, and honestly found it to be mostly a bore (sadly). The story takes place months after the death of Superman (Cavill), and the events of 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN', when an alien army of creatures called Parademons are invading Earth. They're lead by a military officer from Apocalypse, called Steppenwolf (Hinds). Steppenwolf is on a mission to find the three powerful 'Mother Boxes', that are all hidden on Earth. Bruce Wayne (Affleck) teams with Diana Prince (Gadot) to stop the invasion. The super duo seeks out three other gifted superheroes to help them; Aquaman (Momoa), The Flash (Miller) and Cyborg (Fisher). Together they form the superhero team called 'Justice League', for the first time.The movie is really slow-paced at first (and for most of the film actually), and I was bored out of my mind at times. There's a lot of ineffective character development, in my mind, that doesn't really help develop the characters much. The action scenes are all uninvolving, and dull, in my opinion as well. This is coming from a fan who absolutely loved 'WONDER WOMAN' and 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN' ('SUICIDE SQUAD' and 'MAN OF STEEL' too, to a lesser degree), and I have been a bigger fan of the DC Extended Universe lately even (over the MCU). I have to admit this film just doesn't work for me though. That's not to say it's bad, or overly cheesy at all (that's why I'm still giving it 4 out of 5 stars). It just really let me down. I had really high hopes though, and I still do for future DC movies (especially 'WONDER WOMAN' films). Gadot is awesome in this still, even though she's not given enough to do, and she's the scene stealer (like always) definitely. I think she deserves top billing even.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

All can I say is about my feelings. After rewatching MoS, BvS, naturally I feel an urge to watch more about this universe, which is totally different in this so called Superhero genre. But everytime I get my hearts broken realising there's a default stop button after BvS. I sense an anger towards the DC executives that ruined this stand-alone franchise with their stupid decisions and let me, and million other fans down. They made us to lose hope in DCEU and the ironic part is that Superman, one of DC's main milestone, reflects the symbol of hope.In the end, I hope WB release tge Director's Cut soon. They already know their steps were inappropriate, now the sensible undo button is to give us what we deserved.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was just like a episode out of the Justice League animated series only thing it was motion picture and in 3D. Loved it so much. I don't trust the official critics people, something tells me they are paid to criticize about movies so the makers don't earn much and the movie flops. I could watch this movie anytime and the previous ones as well like BVS Man of Steel Wonder Woman etc. So tell me if I and most others can watch the movie over and over and still enjoy it like the first time is the movie actually bad? What's wrong with people? People have become accustomed to negativity and with the modern era of technology and free speech all they do is find fault with something and publish it to the world and stop others from even giving something a try. The movie is really nice. I love the cast as I did in previous movies and Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher and Jason Momoa were awesome with their debut with their characters. Looking forward to see more of the DCEU movies and hope Warner Bros. don't quit because of some few critics rather believe what the true audience have to say and make movies according to their liking.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

They should not have released this movie before Aquaman, The Flash, and a Cyborg movie (which may never happen now). Consequently, most of their talents went completely absent in this film.Of course this is hardly the only problem. Even if they had waited until all the characters had their own standalone movies, there are still many problems with this film.This movie completely lacks the suspense and intensity that previous DC films have. The music never really fits the scene.Also, the attempted humor was not very good. Humor isn't even necessary for a movie like this to succeed. It certainly did not fit the context of the movie.Warner Bros failed the DCEU.

They've been very uneven in my opinion and have lacked the fun and heart of some other franchises. They sometimes seemed to be more about big fights and ultra-serious dialogue than connecting with the audience on any level. With Justice League, DC finally really finds its heart and its sense of humor.Ben Affleck's Batman was okay in this movie because he plays more of a father figure to the group rather than action-fighting Batman. But Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman truly brings a warmth to every scene she is in, as always. And Ezra Miller's Flash is so entertaining, often speaking what the audience is thinking. He has so many moments that are laugh-out-loud funny that he humanizes the often too-serious Batman and Superman.I would highly recommend this movie to everyone. It's appropriate for any age that is not adversely affected by comic book type violence.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

With Justice League, I can't help but feel they've taken a huge step backwards in terms of quality because this film is an utter mess.After the death of Superman (Henry Cavill), Earth is seen as a defenceless and fearful target for Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds). With an attack imminent and a restored faith in humanity, Batman (Ben Affleck) enlists the help of other, more powerful beings; Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Flash (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), to fight to save the world. Justice League very much feels like a film made by two directors with differing visions for the final product. Extensive reshoots and additional scenes were written and directed by Joss Whedon after Zack Snyder's departure from the project due to personal reasons. You can really tell which scenes have been added late on, making for a film that ultimately shifts away from the tone established by Snyder in Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. I don't want to bring up studio interference again when talking about a superhero film but this really does stink of it unfortunately.This should feel like an event film but it just doesn't at all, which is really disappointing for me. The DCEU have blatantly rushed into Justice League and with a mere two hour runtime, they've crammed way too much into the plot. I get trying to streamline the film however, this is a case where the extra minutes are needed to allow the film to breathe.It's an unusual beast though this film as it feels like way too much going on in such a short space of time but it does certainly have it's entertaining moments, mainly when the team are together. There's a few decent action sequences, the finale sadly being just an overblown mess of CGI, and some of the characters really get their chance to shine but it's nowhere near as epic as it probably should and could have been.Coming to the performances, Justice League features a dynamic between the team that mostly works but also feels incredibly forced at times. The best thing about the film is easily Ezra Miller's performance as Barry Allen/Flash, Miller nailing the giddiness and unheroic nervousness perfectly, and he steals the whole film from all the other heroes. Look out for a hilarious first meeting between Flash and Superman which had the audience in stitches.Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot don't perform as well as they have in these roles before, which I felt might be down to the jarring shift in tone that doesn't serve them so well. Jason Momoa and Ray Fisher are served better by the film's tone however, Fisher falls into the background even when it feels like they're really trying to give him something to do.I had such high hopes for Superman in Justice League, particularly the moment of his return, but I can't help but feel let down by the result. Henry Cavill certainly deserves better than this, his lines being so awful and the CGI cover-up of his moustache being one of the most distracting things I've ever seen in a film. Unfortunately, weak villains are a bit too common in superhero films these days and Steppenwolf, played by Ciaran Hinds, is arguably one of the worst of all time. Not only a giant CGI atrocity, Steppenwolf doesn't really feel like much of a threat at all, which is bizarre seeing as he's supposed to challenge the team. Justice League is thankfully better than Suicide Squad however, when you stand it up against something like Wonder Woman, it goes down like a lead balloon. It's almost as if there's a lack of respect from the studio towards one of the great superhero teams of comic-book history.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Zack Snyder had to left the movie because of a familiar tragedy and that brought Joss Whedon on board, who did a great amount of the shots, changed the tone of the movie overall and did other changes. The final movie is far away of what I would loved it to be, but to watch all of those heroes together on screen is just wonderful.This movies tells us the story of how Bruce Wayne is trying to reunite a team for fighting against the forces of evil that are menacing the Earth. I like the way the story is told and I really like the idea of Bruce reuniting the League. My main problem is that the movie does not have time to set up really well all the secondary characters (Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg, not to mention the villain, Steppenwolf). The movie is so rushed that they are just introduced, given a bit of backstory, and that's it. I think this movie should have been longer just for given those characters and interesting background that would have make them more likable. Anyway, the actors are really great in their roles. Ben Affleck as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman keep their awesome job from Batman V Superman and keep showing us that their casting was really spot on. I really liked Henry Cavill as Superman in the previous movies, but in this, I don't know, I just feel it's character was underused and he could have bring an interesting dynamic to the group if used more. Flash was played by Ezra Miller, Aquaman by Jason Momoa and Cyborg by Ray Fisher. They did really great. Their characters at times felt a bit like background characters more than members of the League, but that's not problem of the actors. And then you have the villain, who was the most dull and stupid villain we have had in the DCEU so long. He just appeared at some parts and then disappeared and he had from little to zero background story for us to really understand what were his main purposes.The visuals were amazing as always, and at some shots you could really feel Zack Snyder's present, who might not be a great storyteller, but is a genius at creating powerful images. Although at some parts of the movie you felt Whedon (or maybe Warner) presence in the lighter tone (that was the difference DC had over Marvel) and the unnecessary jokes put all over the place. And my other problem is the music. At first Junkie XL was hired to compose the score but when Whedon came in, he was replaced by Danny Elfman. Elfman has a really great talent, but he decided to move away from the soundscape Hans Zimmer had created in the previous movies to provide a boring, flat and unmemorable score that is barely audible within the movie. Elfman is a really great composer but I was sadly disappointed with his work in here and I wish he had kept Zimmer themes from Man of Steel and Batman V Superman.Overall, this is an entertaining movie, but not a perfect one. If you liked Man of Steel and Batman V Superman, this might be a step down for you (like it was for me), but if you're a Marvel fan, I'm sure you will enjoy this one really much.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Right from the beginning, until the very end. Films which do not deliver to fulfill this premise somewhat inevitably fall behind in movie-goers' perceptions, however strong they may be in dramatic aspects or character development (At least that is how I personally see it). Many action movies, thrillers, fantasy films are regarded less favorably than they should actually be, because of this simple fact. And, in my humble opinion, Justice League may well end up becoming one of those flicks which deserve a higher accolade than that which will be attributed to it.In my opinion, the film balances action, drama, humor and character development in just the right way that befits such a huge comic dynasty, especially given the fact that half the characters were relative unknowns for those people who only go to movies adapting comic books, but do not read the respective comics themselves. In Avengers, this was quite the opposite, since all major characters were introduced in separate movies that came before it and hence provided a basis for story development.In Justice League, this is not quite so. Therefore the first half of the movie basically serves as a platform for introducing the characters while also developing the story in the process. The second half, however, really delivers all the elements that you may require from such a movie.All in all, this is an old school super hero movie, which pays a great deal of attention to story and coherence, and as such is the best DC Comics movie adaptation so far.You just have to sit back, enjoy the pace of the movie as it comes to you, and savor the different characters as they are presented to you. Just be patient, and do not treat the movie as a ""fast-food"" adaptation of a great comic book dynasty. You will be glad that you did in the end.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Aquaman was flamboyant, Flash was funny and steals the show all over. Cyborg did a pretty decent job. Batman was fantastic in bringing the team together and being the human link in the team. Wonderwoman shines every time and comes a close second to Superman. Superman is the man here and it was good to see him in a new light towering above all others. Overall, well done.

Why? Because the concept itself is flawed. The basic premise is that almost none of these characters (other than Batman of course) are strong enough to justify their own movie, however all put into one movie they should be fine. Only that doesn't really stand to reason. All that means is that we are getting less screen time for the characters that actually deserve it.'Justice League' has a ridiculously weak villain. 'Steppenwolf' couldn't be more boring or one-dimensional. The villain needs to be the strongest part in a film like this otherwise everything just feels completely pointless. Like what are they really fighting against? Nothing feels menacing or genuinely threatening. None of the main heroes had to sacrifice anything in order to conquer evil. Compare that to 'The Dark Knight' where the Joker literally pushed Batman to the edge in every way. Batman lost everything in order to save the day. What an incredible film that was. Compare that to 'Justice League' and you'll realise just how bad this film really was.The only real bright spot I could see was the character of 'Barry Allen'. He kept me laughing and nailed it with almost every one-liner he had. Having said that I didn't come to this film looking for a laugh. So while it was a nice bonus, it really doesn't help the quality of the film very much. The one-liners by the other characters were particularly weak I thought. Some very lazy efforts by the writing staff. Sadly, I fear the days of good Batman films like 'The Dark Knight' trilogy may be done and gone. They seem to have gone in an entirely new direction with the characters and that is very disappointing to see, because it is the wrong direction plain and simple.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There might have been reshoots of the movie, I'm not sure, but this movie should have been better than what we got.I like Ben Affleck as Batman, I like Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, I like Jason Momoa as Aquaman, I like Ezra Miller as The Flash, and I like Ray Fisher as Cyborg, but I did not feel any team comradery between all of them. They rush the origin stories for some of the heroes so they can hurry and team up quickly, with Bruce Wayne going to each hero and asking them to join and them responding fast.The villain Steppenwolf was not that interesting; all I know about him is that he is looking for Mother Boxes to destroy Earth in some way. The look of Steppenwolf is not exact to the comics, and the CGI effects on him are not that convincing when he is on screen, plus he just feels like a generic villain even though he is a big villain in the comics. The backstory to Steppenwolf was also rushed when they are giving the reason on why he fought gods to try and takeover the planet.The action scenes are fine, but it is hard to take it seriously because sometimes the CGI can be obvious, and the green screen can be noticeable. Some effects are cool, like when The Flash is running fast, but everything is in slow motion around him, or the effect on Cyborg is not bad to watch in action scenes. We see a bit of Atlantis underwater that could look better, and we see the island Themyscira which does look just as pretty as it did in Wonder Woman (2017).The third act climax has a weird orange grain filter over it which made the last third a little hard to watch because of how bright the filter was, especially with the destruction of buildings and explosions. The ending of the movie felt rushed, and a certain point in the movie involving Superman was interesting but not needed, it happened because the movie is called Justice League. Justice League (2017) was not as good as it could have been because of the direction and the script, but there are some entertaining moments you can get out of this movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This. was. Awesome! You know you're in for a fun time when ""Written by Joss Whedon"" pops up on the screen! It's got almost everything a Justice League movie should have. Humor, action, witty dialogue....It's almost on par with Marvel. Almost. Really, my only negative critique is the villain was really dumb. It's a Justice League movie and they give us Steppenwolf?! Really?! Even when Steppenwolf shows up, he doesn't do anything. The battle is over as quickly as it begins. The 3rd act and/or villain really should have been changed. But, hey, this movie managed to make Aquaman awesome! He's like a cross between a heavy metal guitarist and a professional wrestler. Everything about him is awesome, including the self-awareness that for the past 76 years, he's been a joke. He's the character that doesn't take no for an answer, doesn't care what people think of him, and is just awesome! The only character cooler than him is Batman, and that's because he's Batman. I did have one more problem with the story. If you're a casual fan without any knowledge as to who Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg are you may be confused as their origin stories are only glanced over or completely ignored. If they had given it another hour to take time to explain the characters' backstories that would have been super helpful. Instead we need to rely on context clues through quick dialogue. Hopefully we get an extended cut on the Bluray. It has some problems, but it's definitely a step in the right direction. At the end of the day, I was entertained, and that;s all that matters. By the way, stay ALL the way through the credits. There are 2 scenes.

It also works as a fun flick for general audiences who don't need to be hooked into comics to enjoy it. The characters are surprisingly fleshed out enough without having to resort to extensive dialogue or scenes. You can just tell from what they say and how they say it. Take Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) for example. As his first cinematic incarnation it's not hard to tell that he's the newbie in the group. The way he was portrayed was spot on to get that across. So was Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and his inexperience in his new body. It took a few lines during an exchange with his father to set his backstory down. Everybody else was the same, especially a certain someone we've all been waiting for. That whole sequence was amazing.Steppenwolf as the villain was adequate, not great, but it worked. Some may say he was disappointing, but again, none of his actions weren't already set up by a few lines of dialogue. From there one can ascertain his motivations. And the guy certainly didn't need a monologue to accomplish his mission, he'd rather act than talk.The action is spot on. Again, DC is unbeaten when it comes to showcasing power in their characters. And the team exemplifies their dynamic by playing to each other's strengths. Don't expect it to be like the Avengers where each member goes their own way to do what they do. Here you actually see the team work and struggle together all throughout. You would think a group with Superman in it would not be able to do what they're good at when Supes can just beat the crap out of everybody. I was surprised how they managed to utilize everyone's strengths and make each one work with the other's.The pacing is fine, it works here. If you come looking for BvS depth and subtlety, then you may be left wanting. Justice League did a good job on focusing on what it was set for without having to worry about too much universe building. It's not overtly riddled with philosophy like the previous films, and most of the things you will see and hear directly involve the plot itself. They went ahead and kept it going till the end.Forget what the critics say. They'll always find something to complain about. Take the plot for example. Calling it thin would imply expectations of something more grandiose, but it's not necessarily bad, and it works for this movie. Not a single turn wasn't explained in this movie, if you pay attention.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

My initial thoughts about this film weren't that bad but over the years I came to realise how big of a disaster this film really was.Justice League takes place after Superman's death where Batman and Wonder Woman recruit The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman to save the world from Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons.After the unfortunate tragedy in Zack Snyder's life, he had to step down from the production. That's the point where the studio interfered and Joss Whedon took his place which changed the film completely. This is one of the messiest films I've ever seen. I'm not a fan of Batman v Superman but even the people who liked that film hated this one. It completely tarnishes what Zack Snyder originally envisioned for the DCEU and as a result feels so missplaced.Even though Snyder got the directing credit, this doesn't feel like his film at all. Snyder tried to make the DCEU a dark, gritty and realistic universe which is why his films have a dark colour palette. It's clear Whedon and Warner wanted to change that and so this film looks much more brighter and colourful. Whedon tried to incorporate more comedy but the dialogue and jokes were so cringey and embarrassing to listen to. Even though I didn't think this film was THAT bad initially, I still noticed the bad CGI, the weak villain and Henry Cavill's strange face. This film has a $300 million budget making it one of the most expensive films made but it never felt that way. So much of the CGI is awful and unpolished. For a cinematic experience it looks so cheap. I also couldn't get past how weak of a villain Steppenwolf was. He's a completely CGI character, not very good CGI as well, that's so poorly developed. Thanos was also completely CGI but Marvel put in so much effort around his character, his motivation and backstory. We learn nothing about Steppenwolf and there's no indication of his motivation. It's the most boring and bland villain you could think of.From the very first shot, I could tell something was wrong with Henry Cavill's face and then I remembered the whole story about his moustache being CGI'd out. The CGI is extremely bad and is so distracting. I honestly could not take it seriously. The film has many continuity issues. You can tell which scenes Snyder shot and which scenes Whedon shot. The lighting, the changes in hairstyle and the angle at which the shot is framed are all different. Another thing Whedon implemented into the film was a Russian family. I genuinely don't know the purpose and significance of the family. It adds nothing to the story. The Flash and Cyborg were so uninteresting. It would have been better if the DCEU was planned out like the MCU so we could learn the origins of each superhero and get a clear understanding of who they are rather than rushing straight into the Justice League film.Justice League is a fail of epic proportions. From the troubled production alone, you could tell this film was going to be a trainwreck.

"5","/10","Feels more like a Marvel film rather than a DC film, which is both a good and a bad thing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3859263/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","15 November 2017","Justice League is the fifth installment in the DC Extended Universe superhero franchise. Directed by Zack Snyder, the film shows that along with Wonder Woman, DC may be experiencing something of a resurgence in 2017, but still has a fair way to go before they have truly caught up with Marvel.A short time after the events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck), along with his ally Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), decide to form a group of heroes to combat a new enemy. This team, in addition to Bruce and Diana themselves, includes Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a superhuman with aquatic abilities, Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller), a young man who can move at super fast speeds, and Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher), a cybernetically reconstructed former athlete with the ability to manipulate technology.Fast paced and generally lighthearted, Justice League feels more like a standard Marvel Cinematic Universe film rather than an actual DC film, which is both a good and a bad thing. It's good because it allowed the film to be more entertaining and fun with its action and humour, and it's bad because it doesn't exactly feel original in that sense. I believe Joss Whedon is the one responsible for this different approach. The musical score, composed by Danny Elfman, was quite impressive, almost as though he was referencing his days of composing for Tim Burton's Batman films. The villain, Steppenwolf, was nothing more than another forgettable CGI bad guy with generic world domination tendencies, which is pretty much on par with most early Marvel villains. The new heroes were introduced reasonably well, but it felt as though their proper backstories are being shelved for their upcoming solo films. Aquaman and The Flash provide some decent comic relief during some fight scenes but Cyborg felt somewhat underused. Like with Marvel films and unusual for a DC film, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.I rate it 7/10","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The critics are wrong. It was a fun movie and the actors were great! Some of the CGI is a bit wonky in places, but overall good. My brother didn't know about the facial hair problem with Supes and didn't notice anything- I knew and did, but it wasn't a deal breaker. Walked out happy to have seen Justice League.Now the gripes and it's all nit-picky: Ezra Miller is a good actor but they gave him too much comedy relief dialogue. He's the Flash, not the Boy Wonder. A lot of good dialogue/scenes from the previews have vanished and I did miss it/them. The lone ""family-in-peril"" was a waste of time - they added nothing and ignored others on danger. We needed more side character scenes. The Lois and Mrs. Kent scenes were good. Cyborg has/is going through a lot and his relationship with his father and who he was before the accident are given short shrift. It's there, but not enough. Barry's family life is skipped except for his dad and you can't do much more there with him in prison. We needed Iris. Jason Momoa was perfect, but the end fight should have been near water so we could really see what he can do. And if they're saving that stuff for the stand alone movies, then they should have made them first before gathering the team.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I grew up loving DC. So I had high hopes when Warner Bros. announced a DC Extended Universe much like the MCU. The entire time as people kept picking apart the DCEU, saying it was bad, I defended it. I loved Man of Steel. Hell, I even loved BVS (the Extended Cut, not the theatrical cut). Suicide Squad was terrible, but I was hoping with that movie that it was just a one-off misfire (like how Iron Man 2 sucks), and of course everyone loved Wonder Woman. As much as I loved MOS and BVS though, I felt that with Wonder Woman, perhaps the DCEU finally found it's footing and gained it's edge, and that Justice League was going to be the film to shut up all the naysayers.Wow, I couldn't have been more wrong.Needless to say, after this film, I've finally given up. I've given up on the DCEU. I've given up defending it, I've given up trying to make sense of this rushed world they're trying to create. I am simply done.First, let's talk about what I did like. The acting was phenomenal, seriously, it was. Everybody in this film did a tremendous job playing their characters and trying to do their best with the terrible dialogue (more on that in a minute). Even all the new additions; The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg; were acted wonderfully. They couldn't have asked for a better cast for this film. In addition to the acting, the fight scenes were very well done. Each time the heroes suited up and went out there to fight, I was thrilled and captivated for the entire length of each fight.Now...everything else.The story is soooo bad. Really bad. Trying to make sense of this story and what's going on is like trying to make sense of Watergate. It is a challenge in itself. There are so many parts that felt shoehorned in or scenes that were forced in just to move along the very loose semblance of a story that this film has. It was embarrassing to watch, especially to watch such a talented cast stumble through this themselves. The dialogue certainly doesn't help. Seriously, the dialogue in this film makes the dialogue from Batman & Robin look like an Academy Award winning screenplay, bad Mr. Freeze puns and all. So many bad jokes, so many moments thrown in that I feel they did simply because ""That's what Marvel would do here."" Combine an idiotic story with even worse dialogue, and it's hard to care much for what's going on.To make matters worse, the special effects were terrible. It felt like I was watching Terminator 3 or The Matrix 3 or name any other special effects driven film from 2003. It didn't look real at all, hell, most video games nowadays looked better than this.The villain is also very forgettable, which is a tragedy, seeing as how Steppenwolf is a great villain and the entire DCEU thus far has been building towards this epic showdown between Steppenwolf and the League, and Steppenwolf has no motive, barely any (good) dialogue, and dies a very, very forgettable death that, again, felt very forced.All in all, this movie is just a hair above Suicide Squad, a major disappointment, and I'll be giving up on DC movies for a while now, as I crawl back into bed, huddle into a ball, and watch The Batman Animated Series on repeat until DC can figure out what the hell it wants with it's movies. Until then, I'm done.A 3 out of 10","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The overuse of CG seems to make it more like a graphic novel if only contained within a dozen frames for the story.
By 3/4 the way through I had literally lost the plot, I couldn't figure out who was fighting who, for what reason they were fighting, and all these back stories.DC is trying too hard to be Marvel.

One dimensional-weak villain, rush in the story line, almost zero emphasis on how's the world dealing with the events...there are issues to get critical about it. But does that really means it's another entertaining mess of a DC film?! I definitely wouldn't call it a mess but yeah..still it was damn entertaining!! It's basically a superhero movie mostly about the superheros, from character introductions to all the fun & actions, JL was a triumph of DC's supreme superheros. The entertainment level was so high that all those critical issues didn't actually bothered me much; the heroes steals the show entirely, the villain & the crisis felt like minor issues or an excuse to bringing them all together. All the actors shines in their respective roles; Miller surprised me as Barry Allen, Jason Momoa was great & badass as Aquaman, even Ray Fisher as Cyborg was pretty adequately fits into the group. WW & Batsy have grown with their characters and man...Sup returned as the best of them, one of the versions of Superman that we've been waiting for. If you are familiar with the style & execution of Snyder & Whedon's filmmaking then I'm sure you'll see the difference here, the style of 2 different directors were somewhat quite visible throughout the movie but in a good way. In Justice League, we have somewhat got the best of both of them. I'm glad Whedon stepped in & saved the movie from being another Snyder's signature entertaining mess. His light & full of life & fun touches were noticeable and made this such an enjoyable ride from start to finish despite having several issues.DCEU still alive and I'm looking forward to see further installments.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The funny thing is, the complaints it is getting are some of the same exact things you see in other films of this genre, but for some reason those films get a pass. The cgi is actually pretty good, and just as great as the other popular superhero films you have seen. This villain is pretty generic though, which can be frustrating. He is just there to set up even more of the universe and provide a glimpse of the new gods. So he was effective in that sense. He is just like a normal superhero villain though (like a regular one you see in the MCU). Honestly, this movie is very similar to other team up superhero films, and should probably get the same scores as those films, but for some weird reason it isn't. The characters were great, every single one. The humor can be a bit much at times, but I found myself laughing a few times. There was quite a bit of fun action too. Unfortunately the movie is too short. WB wanted to cut down this film by a lot, and it shows. Most scenes feel like there was probably originally more to them, so hopefully we get an extended cut for Justice League as it definitely needs one. The soundtrack is also pretty generic, but I guess that's what you get when you get rid of Hans and Junkie XL. Danny Elfman scored a pretty bland, generic, un-epic soundtrack for Justice League, and that is really disappointing. Even though this movie had some obvious flaws, there weren't more than most superhero movies that have come out (and for some weird reason get a ton of praise). So I say watch this film. It's definitely worth the watch, and is quite entertaining. And I can promise you that each hero is, well, pretty heroic and definitely fun.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The action is really enjoyable and well filmed. Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot are great and newcomers Ray Fisher, Ezra Miller and Jason Momoa are all good but lack a ton of necessary depth. It's extremely satisfying to see Henry Cavill as a more hopeful and inspiring Superman but it's sadly undermined by the terrible CGI on his top lip. It's consistently attempting to be funny and doesn't always land but a few jokes work. The music by Danny Elfman has its moments but overall is forgettable and lazy.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But, they still give the audience a time to relax a little bit. This is understandable since they have to put so many stuff in the movie, from the characters introduction and its main story and even future easter eggs. For some people this might be very disturbing to have comic book movie with very fast pace and lot of action to follow, but trust me, the actual story is quite simple and its villain motivation is simple as well. It is easier to understand its motivation than, for example, batman v superman, or even the avengers 2: age of ultron, which i believe as the worst villain motivation in comic book movies.Now after i talk about it flaw, lets talk about what make it great! First of all, ""The Characters"". Every superhero characters in this movie plays important role, even for a Cyborg where most people think that he will play in a shorter time! No it doesn't! He plays very important part. The only superheroes character who play less than the other is Aquaman, but it's not because he has less screening time, it is just because his story is not fully revealed, and i believe it is because he will have his own movie next year. But still, during the final act he still have very important role. The chemistry between all superheroes are also awesome, we can feel how Diana feels about Bruce, how Flash with his awkwardness but feels really happy to be on the team and how every superheroes connected to each other. It is great and fun!Second but not least is how DC really lighten their tone without changing their dark scheme color. It is totally fun to see some jokes, but their jokes seems really on its place, you will not see any jokes during the final act, unlike other superheroes movie who always try to put any jokes even when their facing their main villain. As I mention before, DC does not change their color scheme, it is dark? Yes, with a lot of contrast color. Just like other DC superhero movie, most of their scene are still during the evening and i think it is better that way, but this time, their superheroes are no longer have ""bad mood face"". In the end of this movie, I can feel the hope rises, and smile are fulfilling this movie's atmosphere.I can't wait for the next DC's movie next year.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

If you want full stories of the characters wait for there solo movies. Unlike marvel in which gave many character movies prior to the avengers movie I see it as BvS was a prequel to justice league and that from here the movies branch out to solo movies and connecting back to Justice league 2. It is a different strategy and if people give it a chance they will see it as well. people wanted this movie to be way more epic then it was meant to be and to compare it to batman and robin is stupid.

Spiderman followed by the X men are my favourite super heroes.DC has produced by a distance the best DCU film to date and in my opinion the best ensemble Super Hero movie from any studio. By ensemble I mean cast of Heroes from individual properties rather than a team (so not Watchmen, X men, GotG etc).The pacing is possibly a little fast but draws you in. Nearly every hero gets a character arc (though Wonder Woman's is kind of tacked on and Aquaman doesn't get one). Steppenwolf actually carries a threat to our heroes (a real issue with all 3 Avengers films, yes 3 calling an Avengers film a Captain America film doesn't stop it being an Avengers film).The action is great. The acting is solid the characters have chemistry and the humour hits the spot without becoming force (unlike Marvel films of late). Each Characters special powers feel different and each gets a chance to shine.Affleck is really making a claim to knock Heaton off his perch as best Batman (though Bale still claims top spot of making the best Batman films).I really don't understand the negative reviews compared to other films in the same genre. This film is objectively better than Wonder Woman in every way and easily ahead of the first 2 Avengers films. This also marks the continuation of DC films moving in the right direction and hopefully they will continue. The negative reviews of this films coupled with the positive reviews of Marvel films that are heading in the wrong direction is just damaging the future of Super Hero films. Disney could learn from DC and their willingness to take risks with characters and plot for the good of the story (even when those risks don't work out like the endless dreams within dreams that ruined BvS). Hopefully Infinity War will take Marvel in a new direction though Civil War and this year's Marvel offerings have me very worried. However anyone that enjoys good comic book movies should watch Justice League. It has great entertainment and has me excited to see what they do with Darkseid going forward.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The plot revolves around the celestial villain ""Steppenwolf"" and his search for three magical MacGuffins that will ensure his conquest of Earth. Habitual loner and inadequate diplomat Batman assembles a team of 'enhanced humans' and the rest of the film, when the team isn't bickering amongst themselves, is essentially a fight between heroic CGI and evil CGI. As lead villain, ""Steppenwolf"" is an uninteresting, poorly-rendered, pseudo-classical character who wields a magical ax and has an army of flying 'parademons' at his beck-and-call. Other than the aforementioned Caped Crusader, the League includes a resurrected Superman (with a digitally-enhanced lip that has been the subject of much on-line discussion), Wonder Woman (the gorgeous Gal Gadot, who alone is worth an extra rating point), Aquaman (a grumpy, hard-drinking merman), The Flash (an awkward teenager somewhere on the spectrum), and Cyborg (a flying interface with half a face). Other than Wonder Woman, none of the heroes are very engaging and the film is full of tedious filler, such as the constantly threatened Russian family, who's purposes seem to be 1) putting a 'human face' to the victims, and 2) generating debate as to why parademons, who smell fear and can tear the miniguns off the bat-tank with their bare hands, can't overwhelm a wooden farm house protected by one man with a shotgun. We also have to put up with Superman waking up from the dead in a grumpy mood, requiring the rest of the team to take shots at him to bring him around (Cyborg's armor conveniently, and temporarily, develops a mind of its own and fires the first shot in this silly internecine scuffle). On the topic of ""Cyborg"": isn't building a massive, armoured hybrid topped off with half of a 'flesh and blood' face like leaving a womp-rat sized hole in your Death Star? The ending and 'ironic' demise of the lead malefactor is right out of a Saturday morning cartoon. Not much in this movie works: there is little that is novel or imaginative in the story or in the imagery, the inter-hero 'banter' is forced and predictable, and the CGI is unconvincing and unimpressive. Watchable if you like this sort of thing, but even then, ""Justice League"" is in the 'view once, criticise often' category of CGI extravaganzas.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Honestly, I believe it's a great movie that shows it's flaws but wears them on its sleeves.
Good: Ben Afflecks' Batman is always a highlight and brings to life the older and grittier Batman I never knew a cinematic movie needed. Gal Gadot is now a staple of DC and is very enjoyable, really that can be said for the entire cast of memorable portrayals. The story is actually very nicely thought through and does a good job of setting up this version of the Justice League- if only we could see the stand-alone movies starring the Flash and Cyborg. We get very solid character interactions and some great development from key players that deepen their characters for sure. Most of the vfx are immersive and work incredibly well with the shape and feel of the narrative while being very convincing in execution, honestly there's a lot to love about Justice LeagueBad: First-off is the reshoots helmed by Whedon - who thought of bringing back an actor late in development from another movie and rendering the hardest part of anatomy? Steppenwolf is a bit one-note and really is a big cgi villain. The Unity aspect should not be a terraformer, but the key to bringing Darkseid onto our world, this would've set up the next movie (if only) and back up the characters name drop early in and made it meaningful.

Justice League simultaneously feels like a solid live- action version of some of best moments from the excellent animated series of the same name. Ben Affleck continues to be a better Batman and Bruce Wayne them people want to give him credit for, and this is the closest we've seen him to true blue Batman after the murder rage of Batman v Superman. Henry Cavill is without a doubt the best he's ever been allowed to be as the Man of Steel, refreshingly sunny and earnestly heroic. He feels like classic Superman. Wonder Woman is both a clutch player and a joy of the film thanks to Gal Gadot and her irrepressible on-screen spark.Ezra Miller did a great Job as flash. Ezra's turn as the flash will no doubt earn a legion of fans, he's endearing in his innocence and gets the bulk of the good one-liners Cyborg was good and aquaman was just splendid. His dialogue delivery, his attitude were amazing. Each character gets moments to shine and make a positive lasting impression. There are some cons in the movie like the re shoots were clearly visible in Superman's mustache removal. The CGI at some parts were in necessarily excess like the last flight, CGI on Steppenwolf was not that good but Ciaran Hinds did a great job as Steppenwolf. But this film is a fascinating one, an entertaining one, and often, a fun one. Give it a try if you are avid CBM fan.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Their interaction with each other was very entertaining, similar to how the Avengers interact with each other in the first Avengers movie. They all were very interesting and I can't wait to see their future solo movies. And when Superman come out, whoa, that was amazing. Of the three new great characters-Aquaman, Cyborg, Flash-my favorite one I like was Cyborg, which was surprising because I thought from the trailers he was going to be the worst one. And they finally gave Superman a sense of being optimistic, hopeful-no more being depress or cynical.Now the bad-the villain. Steppenwolf is one of the worst, bland, colorless villain in modern superheros movies. I mean come on, I seen more grey statues with more color, life than him. He look awful, his dialogue was so generic, and all he did was spin his axe around. The parademons were okay for what they were being used for. And the plot is something we seen so many times before; an alien invasion and some big bad that wants to destroy the world. But in retrospect, all superheros movies plot have this issue. Its just the way they each execute their plots, villain, and in this movie, they could have done a better job on that.Overall, this movie was very entertaining to watch due to its characters. The movie did felt rush at times and some scenes just...ended. The villain was bland, the same old plot, and there was lot of cgi at the end of the movie. It was a good movie, not great, but it did its job. Which was making me looking forward to the upcoming DC movies. I give this movie an 8/a grade B.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's not quite ""epic"" as you'd want a film about the Justice League to be. It should on paper be, the biggest film of 2017-because that's how popular these characters are. But it's not, as much as it pains me to say it.I'll cut straight to the chase, the character dynamics are fantastic and that is simply the best part of the film. I feel they have done justice (pun not indented) in portraying the characters faithfully, albeit with very little development-but that was expected with the films two hour run time (something I will come back to later). However, my main problem with the film was the soundtrack. Some may question this, but the soundtrack really does make a difference in making a film memorable. BvS for all its flaws had a fantastic soundtrack from Hanz Zimmer and Junkie XL. I'm truly disappointed to have to say that Danny Elfman does not deliver in creating a single piece of memorable music for this film. His use of previous soundtracks of the characters doesn't even work for me. Part of the problem of having a weak score, is that it inherently makes everything less memorable, with some of the films biggest moments becoming less impactful. The narrative is simple, Steppenwolf and his parademons have come to collect all three of the mother boxes as part of his quest for power. After the death of Superman,crime is on the rise and fear is a prevalent theme. Bruce Wayne therefore, decides to create a team of superhero's who can battle this antagonist and that's where the other heroes come into play. I didn't have any problems with the narrative, but rather with the editing. This criticism derives from its two-hour runtime, a mandate set by Warner Bros. This meant a lot of footage was most likely cut and as such the pacing of the film is quite rushed unfortunately. Another problem I had was the CGI and more the fact that it was up there with Suicide Squad for having the weakest CGI in the DCEU. The film didn't stand out visually nor have a sequence that looked as good as the opening of BvS. I think the loss of cinematographer, Larry Fong, is most definitely felt in the film.The cast are fantastic and the chemistry between one and other made for a really enjoyable viewing. It was also the first time I felt jokes actually hit the right notes in a DC film. There are some really great lines, especially from the Flash. Steppenwolf is initially interesting, but his motives are not the most exciting. He is more filler for the actual focus of the film-the six members of the Justice League.A lot of the best moments of this film come from when the team are together. I think a lot of the criticisms of the films from critics should be placed on Warner Bros. I do think they are part of the problem here, and they really need to let DC sort out their vision for this universe, because at this point their schedule is a convoluted mess. With that said, there is hope indeed for the DCEU. With great characters, I see so many places the DCEU can go. They just need to make their films as character driven and unique as possible. Oh, and they need to make sure their scores aren't as bland as Justice League's.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"9","/10","While I can nitpick it, I had such a fun time with it that I feel disingenuous doing so.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3864539/?ref_=tt_urv","shurue","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur82571835/?ref_=tt_urv","21 November 2017","While there are things I could nitpick in this movie, it's really hard to bring myself to do so. The whole movie was a really fun experience and one of my¬†favourite¬†s this year. The banter between the various JL members was much more comedic than you would expect. The amount of times you'll catch the actors just grinning from ear to ear as the movie plays out helps to lighten the tone of the overall piece, which is thematically appropriate when paired up with the precursor of Batman V Superman. However, while the movie was a fun ride, it also knew when to reign it in for more serious moments, and how to weave the two tones together into the same scene to deliver character exposition while still being entertaining.¬†DC seems to have found their footing with this one from a storytelling perspective, but one thing I never expected to improve genuinely surprised me ‚Äì the music. While I've not hated the DC film universe's music, it's been far from a standout, which in comparison to other DC music outings, is a damn shame and something I'd pretty much given up on improving. However, the music composed by Danny Elfman blew me away. When it wasn't reminiscent of Batman TAS, it was pulling from Superman TAS, and, on very rare occasion, even the classic John Williams theme (which I would LOVE to see return). The music here is everything I could have hoped for in a DC movie with the one exception being that the Wonder Woman theme seemed to go unchanged. Which is fine really. It's barely in the movie. I just don't like it nearly as much as the other pieces of music in the film and don't think it fits in with the rest that well.¬†Since I mentioned the Wonder Woman music, I should probably go into the nitpicks that DID on occasion pull me out of the movie. Let's get the big one out of the way right off the bat - the CGI. There is just too much of it in the movie, and has a tendency to make certain shots that are supposed to look deadly serious instead appear comical. Usually this'll happen when Superman is fighting the big bad of the film, Steppenwolf, or in a scene where the aforementioned baddie enters into conflicts with large armies. The big battles here felt like they were trying to evoke something akin to Lord of the Rings, but since the armies in these scenes were filled with nothing but CGI, there was almost no tension there. However, every time the fighting got up close and you could tell it was real people fighting, the tension returned, so it wasn't too big an issue. If I'm sticking with my nitpicks, (and am willing to take the risk of sounding like a DC fan nutter) Flash's personality feels like a weird amalgamation of Barry Allen and Wally West, Aquaman acts more like an adrenaline junkie than Atlantean royalty, and Cyborg just doesn't fit in the Justice League roster when compared to the likes of Martian Manhunter or Green Lantern. It would have also been nice to see this lineup go to 7 rather than 6. However, as that could have bogged down the movie too much I would have been OK if a GL had been here in place of Cyborg and Martian Manhunter was established in his own movie later on. Basically I just don't like Cyborg being a Justice League member. It was a weird choice in the comics back in 2011 and it's weird here too.¬†Seeing as this is DC's first major team up movie, I feel like comparisons between this and the first Avengers movie are inevitable. To that end, imagine that 20 years from now, no one cares who ""got there first"". As both movies are a part of their respective cinematic universes, and are even both responsible for setting up the main villains of their whole series, it would make sense then, that both movies be compared based on which one managed the job better. To that end, I'd make the case that Justice League actually did a better job building up Darkseid than Avengers did Thanos. While it's true that JL has the assistance of BvS in this regard, even with this movie in a vacuum we get a sense of Apocalyptic technology, as well as a glimpse into that general world through the use of¬†parademons¬†and the like. The movie even had the sense to drop his name once, and only once, increasing the tension and buildup to his inevitable showing in a later movie, without jamming in our faces that he would be the big bad. By contrast in the first Avengers movie, while it is true that Thanos is technically the reason everything in that movie happened, we don't get any hints to this until that mid credits scene where he suddenly appears. It gets the job done, sure, but did we learn anything about him over the course of the film? Not really. We found out that he was connected to the Chitauri in some way. Those unfamiliar with the character have no reason to feel threatened or intimidated by him personally. I'm not trying to compare the two villains' portrayals as a whole. Rather, I'm just pointing out that DC's Justice League did a better job at setting up it's major villain than Marvel's Avengers did theirs, which is why I think that, down the line Justice League will age better than Avengers. One, while entertaining, leans heavily on nostalgia and memories of its initial release. The other is forced to stand apart from that emotional response, but manages to actually do more at the same time.¬†At the end of the day, I had a lot of fun with Justice League and am looking forward to adding it to my movie collection when it gets a¬†blu-ray release.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I didn't like BVS .I enjoyed suicide squad and i liked wonder woman. Just League is probably my favorite of all DCEU movies so far. Its very colorful movie with a much better villain than previous DCEU movies. The background music was great .This movie was very much character driven .But tHe visuals were slick as well. All the characters had moments to shine . Only Cyborg was given a little less important . The flash was great and Ezra Miller was great. Aquaman was a very cool character and i cant wait to find out more about him . There were some cool cameos . One thing i was worried about though while going into the movie was that it may show consistency of tones since it had two directors but the story moves smoothly along with a consistent tone . There is such a great dynamic between these characters.Dc finally gets it completely right. All in all , characters were great , acting was amazing especially by Gal gadot and Ben affleck, good script , good villain , lot of humor and overall a really fun time in theaters.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Makes me sickI feel like a lot of the plot and plot moving elements exist ""because movie"".There's some plot holes, and ""Deus ex machina"" esque things that contribute to this that make watching it a little jarring.Snyder makes us fill in his weird small plot holes with our vauge assumtions #dontlikeThe actors tho did their best, and there were a few laughs. The Flash was my favorite part of the movie, but I'm not sure why they didn't use the actor from The Flash TV series... You know an already established series with a fan base? IdkTL;DR
Justice League is worth a watch, at a discounted price. The freeness of my ticket plus the few laughs made it a decent time, but I have no desire to see it again.Still think DC needs to think about replacing Snyder & friends because this movie doesn't live up to the potential that I'm sure die hard fans wanted.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Its way better than the blunder BVS was for sure.Due to the WB's decision to cut the movie time from 2h 50m(iirc) to 1h 50m the movie lacks certain connecting scenes. Sometimes it feels like you are jumping from one movie scene to another. Despite that the movie doesn't feel disconnected. The villain is forgettable(which villain isn't , each superhero movie so far has one) and doesn't have screen presence might be due the edited scenes. Action scenes could have been better.Final thoughts - movie is worth watching. I would love to watch the ultimate cut or director's cut of the movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The Batman movies (not the ones with Affleck) were okay, but the villains and minor characters were more interesting than Batman. Green Lantern was ruined by silliness. Superman was a good start ruined by the introduction in Batman versus Superman of Affleck and the worst Lex Luther ever. Now JL the worst movie every made. Bad story, dumb villain and bad acting by everyone. DC for some reason thinks if they just made everything dark and video game quality that they will make a successful movie. Their wrong. Marvel has bested them because they care about the characters. Makes the audience care by letting you get to know them. Yes they have humor but its appropriate, not annoying. I feel sorry for Gal Gadot who is good as Wonder Woman and the Amazon women who are great. I also feel sorry for Henry Cavil who is a great Superman, but really wasted and acted poorly in this film. I wish DC would just stop. Wait a few years and find someone who really likes their characters. They also need to find better Batman and stick with a real good JL beginning story, maybe with Martian man hunter. Who ever they pick needs to go back and watch the animated series and not spend so much time on obscure comic books. Its the series that endured JL to its fans.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Two hours of non stop action and absolutely no messing around with Character introductions - in fact very little connections to other movies - but straight to the point. Some of the heroes/Villains have been seen before, DC currently have several successful TV ventures, but this film really raises the bar on the whole Super - hero franchise as far as action and FX go, and it deserves to be a smash hit, albeit the film could have been a bit more tense at time - although it works as a movie for all ages.Without Henry Cavill's superb performance - I would have rated this 2 stars less but he really did make this from a good film to a great one. This is the best Superman has been portrayed on screen. All round good performances with the best of the rest - Jason Momoa was also outstanding as Arthur Curry/Aquaman. Ben Affleck was OK but was much better in BATMAN VS SUPERMAN. The plot is wafer thin and simple - a threat to the world, Stepenwolf, seeks to obtain 3 boxes to gain maximum power to take over the world and the heroes of Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman have to reluctantly unite to stop him. But they just ain't quite a match with this combination alone, and the late Man of Steel is may be the only chance they have !! Despite the flaws, this is still a very enjoyable film, so go and enjoy this movie for what it is - a no - nonsense action superhero team up movie, and 2 hours that any DC comic book fan will love. The scenes with Superman alone should be witnessed on the big screen. I look forward to potentially better DC movies.Watch the movie till after the credits.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

To give credit to the movie, we all should have know this movie was not going to be great due to multiple reasons, the main being the movie going through two directors with two different tones for the movie and Warner Brothers forcing a runtime for this movie. I believe it was not fair to Zach who built the DCEU, to be fired and from Warner Brothers to hide it with the passing of his daughter. This movie had many problems, from the bland villain, to terrible character development. Superman was a CGI monstrosity, Batman was trying to be funny when he shouldn't be and was as useless as Slingshot in Suicide Squad, Flash and Cyborg were so poorly written, and SteppenWolf had no Villain backstory. The only true highlights of this movie were Wonder Woman and Aquaman, so here's to Aquaman when it comes out. I would give this movie a lower rating, but as a DC fanboy, I didn't have the heart to give it lower than a 6.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was hoping that WB will hire crew to Handle on doing the best at what Marvel Studio did. When Justice League Trailer first came out, I was beginning to have little doubt on this movie if I will truly like it. I decided to wait and see how movie critics have to say even movie goers. When I learned that JL received mixed review, I was little uncertain and not truly excited to see Justice League EVEN I wanted to have excitement within me to see this movie as same passion as Marvel Studio films. I decided to go and see it in open captioned and I sat down and I watched the whole movie. I am not IMPRESSED how the Justice League story line and also the cinematography wasn't this great. So I did enjoy it, but I am not awestruck by it anyway. My biggest disappointment of this movie is Flash's suit is not what I envisioned and also the lightning is blue which turned me off, Flash was suppose to have red or yellow lightning. So if you are not sure if it is worth it or not, my advice just waits for it to come out on DVD or Blu Ray. I felt so bad for WB, I wanted WB to have equal treatment as Disney handles Marvel Studio.

As a recent fan of the DC universe, after watching Wonder Women, I was thrilled by the release of this movie. The cast was especially promising. The stunning Gal Gadot (!!!) returns as Wonder Woman, Batman is portrayed by Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill as Superman. Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and Flash (Ezra Miller) are introduced. Together, they would form the Justice League.The movie continues the story from where Batman vs. Superman (2016) left off. Superman is dead, and the world is in danger. Batman, driven by remorse over the death of Superman, attempt to bring a team together to face the incoming catastrophic threat. With the exception of the Flash and Wonder Woman, other would be justice leaguers tries to avoid the incoming fight. Until the threat becomes too big for them to ignore. They would have to work together as ""you can't save the world alone.""After the movie, I was disappointed. Unfortunately, this movie wasted its resources and became a mess despite its 300 million budget and their amazing cast. Although this result probably is a reflection of a tragic circumstance. The film's director, Zack Synder, stepped away from the project earlier this year after his daughter's suicide. And Joss Whedon, the avenger's director for Marvel, stepped in for finalizing. Their styles are largely different. Synder tends to be dark and stark, while Whedon has humor coming out both visually and emotionally.When Whedon was stitching together Synder's footages, he added reshoots of his own with extra comedy. While his humor worked seamlessly in The Avengers, somehow it just didn't fit in Justice League. It feels fractured with scenes flying around without structure. Justice League has great potential, but now it just feels like a film with too many hands pulling in different directions. Is it a Zack Synder movie, or a Joss Whedon movie?The filmmakers made a heroic effort against heavy odds. Justice League does have its thrilling moments that are worth a watch. Especially if you are a DC fan.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

No. Is it better than Wonder Woman? No. Is it terrible? NO. Is it good? YES. Justice League is a very flawed, but very fun and entertaining movie. If you are a DC or comic book fan, you will have a smile on your face the whole time, guarantee. Everyone in the movie gives their A- Game: Ben Affleck once again nails Batman, Gal Gadot is amazing as Wonder Woman, Ray Fisher was surprisingly good as Cyborg, Jason Momoa was awesome as Aquaman, Ezra Miller has made the Flash his own and is good in his role. Even the side characters give their A-Game, with J.K. Simmons playing Commissioner Gordon, Amy Adams as Lois, Diane Lane as Martha, etc. Henry Cavill makes a great return, BUT there is something about him that will definitely be noticeable, as the CG for his mustache is sometimes hilariously bad. And thus we get into the negatives of the film, and there are plenty. The pacing for the most part, is off-centered. Everything feels rushed as we snap from character to character from place to place, it's hard to feel connected when you barely have enough to process what the hell just happened. It does feel as though large chunks of the movie were cut and placed on the sidelines, no doubt because WB wanted a movie under 2 hours. The CG sometimes can be pretty bad, the mustache-gate is one clear example, and might take you out of the experience. The villain is also pretty weak, as we don't spend enough time with him to really care about his motives. Also, because of this rushed pacing, moments happen in the film that should be cause for applause, but in the end feels a bit unwelcomed and weird. But do these negatives detract from the film as a whole? Yes, but only slightly, as the positives are able to outwit most of the negatives. The action is fun, exciting, and full on amazing to watch unfold on screen. The character interactions are also perfect and are exactly what you would expect from a screenwriter of likes of Joss Whedon. Also...DANNY ELFMAN should be commemorated for his work on Justice League as his score is able to fit things from old DC and new DC while also making it his own. In the end, Justice League might leave some disappointed with its flaws and rushed pacing, but I feel most will appreciate this movie for what it is: THE KICKSTART OF THE DCEU. I'm excited to see where they go from here, but until then I'll watch it, then watch it again.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And on that level it did not disappoint. The tone of this film has made a slight shift from the previous DC films. Yet not enough to be super out of place in the DCU. And I think that is in part due to the Fact that Joss Weddon had a hand in helping Zach Snyder push this production across the finish line. It does fit in nicely as a follow up to Wonder Woman. Although not to say as solid as Wonder Woman, yet a step up from Suicide Squad for sure and even BvS. So it is a nice course correction for the DCU in conjunction with the fore mentioned Wonder Woman. Now the story Does have some week points as it does get slightly lost but not terribly like the above mentioned Suicide Squad. Now where this movie excelled was in it's building of Character relationships, and not just one or two but all of them. it does it so well in fact that even when they switch up the pairing of Characters throughout the film, I found myself able to really enjoy spending time with them. It did suffer from some bad CGI in places throughout the film and I did feel the villain was week. But before someone goes ""aHAH! See they can't get that right!"" MOST of the time neither can Marvel. So in this case the Villain really only served as Plot device to unite the Hero's. And because of their strong interactions and very enjoyable screen presence, I can forgive that in this case. And I can find some forgiveness for the Bad CGI because the action is crafted in a fun way and again the moments with the Characters in those action scenes where so well done that it tipped the scales back to positive for me. So over all my first viewing of this film I would give it a solid 82% for solid characters, fun and re-watch-ability. I look forward more optimistically for the future DC Films now than I did before. Oh treat yourself and stay for both end credits scenes. They are worth it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Of the heroes, my favorite is Ezra Miller, who plays a very funny, very geeky Flash. And Gal Gadot is still a terrific Wonder Woman. I'm less enthralled by the rest of the cast - I found Affleck pretty bland after Bale's Batman and I can't get excited about Aquaman.There's plenty of solid action, fancy special effects, and witty dialogue. The pace is quick, although sometimes rushed, and the story is solid even if bits of it feel a little tacked on.It's not a perfect movie, but it's a decidedly enjoyable one, and a huge leap up from BvS. So ignore the fact that IMDB gives JL and BvS the same score, because that's ridiculous!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The seemingly obvious way to do this is have your individual heroes meet up and then jump into showing the newly formed team facing obstacles together. Justice League is a case study in why this is actually a terrible way to produce a team-up movie.A better way would be to build up the individual team members, and the relationships between them prior to the actual formation of the team. And if you're already on a tight timeline, because, say, you're trying to catch up to the competition, all the more reason to make good use of whatever few prequels you might have access to. So the fact that Zack Snyder squandered Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman on incoherent action sequences and epic slo-mo glamour shots really takes a toll on the misbegotten Justice League.Furthermore, a good team-up movie isn't really so much about the team facing the world, but rather all the dynamics within the team itself. What little attempt there is to show this in Justice League is equal parts superficial, cliched, and dull.Justice League was already going to be a heavy lift considering all this, but the basic film-making flaws complete the disaster.As with Snyder's other DC movies, the pacing is awful. The script is lifeless and flat. The CGI is absolutely terrible, a problem compounded by its reckless overuse. The action is loud and underwhelming.The low production value of Cyborg is inexcusable in a movie of this scale. He looks like something you might see in a arrowverse spinoff on CW (which in spite of its cheerful cheesiness, produces characters with way more spirit and chemistry than anyone in Snyder's DC-verse). There seemed to be a lot of critical commentary that Ezra Miller's Flash was a rare bright spot in the movie. I have to disagree with that. His character and his lines felt just as forced and predictable as everyone else.Then there is Jason Momoa's Aquaman. All I can say is that I hope the makers of the Aquaman film move away from the lord of the brocean interpretation here.Finally there is the villain, Steppenwolf. Sweet jesus, where to begin with Steppenwolf. Creating a solid villain has always been a challenge for super hero movies, including Marvel films. But it feels like in Steppenwolf, Snyder went out of his way to perfectly model every single complaint about poorly made super villains. I give Justice League a generous 4 / 10. The good news is that its lousy box office performance might force Warner Brothers to reconsider the direction of these movies.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I loved Wonder Woman and thought Suicide Squad was a crazy mess. I did like Jared Leto's Joker. Based on the internet reviews I was cautiously optimistic that Justice League was okay. It was more than okay. Very entertaining with a lot of genuine humour and great chemistry between the characters and a few really tear jerking moments. What I liked. Great characters. Adults with adult dialogue, understated and outright hilarious moments. That's a big change from former DC movies, and a welcome change. There were suggestions of backstories to some characters that have me looking forward to stand alone movies. Great special effects, except for one thing...mentioned in the What I didn't Like section below. I thought the battles were clearly constructed and the casting is uniformly excellent. Story wasn't too complicated, big bad threat and the team comes together to fight big bad. Standard super hero fair, and not too complex for this introduction to the League.What I didn't like. The CGI for the Big Bad. The excellence of the other special effects made Big Bad look even worse. The Minions (Para Demons) were very good, much better than Big Bad. Warner Bros..... You had a great character actor voicing this Demon. You need a REAL actor in the role. Action capture technology or the actor in full costume and enlarged as in Lord of the Rings. Never felt he was a threat, just a cardboard excuse for the Big Bad. Only blatantly bad aspect of this movie, but glaring in it's poor quality. If you bring him back or have Darkseid in a later film, do the RIGHT thing and have a quality actor. You had excellent actors in every other role so this bungle is a real puzzle.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I still remember those days, as a kid, when I first watched those Justice League cartoons & how I wished if there was a real movie about it. 15 years later, that dream of mine got fulfilled today, when I got to see this on the first day of its release in my country. I was overwhelmed by every bit of it & not a single moment was I bored from the start till the end. I am really thankful to the cast & crew for doing such an outstanding work on this project & I would love to see it once again before it leaves the theaters & then finally once more when the Blu-ray releases. Highly Recommended.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, the critics praised Thor and gave the Justice League poor reviews. Why are the so called critics so hard on DC movies? People, do not listen to the critics. We are intelligent, we can decide if we like a movie. By the way, Justice League was an excellent movie!My friend and I loved Justice League! I simply loved the time that's given to Wonder Woman. She totally did her thing in this movie. The introduction of the Flash was great! The Flash totally delivered the comedy. Superman was the best! The fight scenes were awesome. I wished they did more character development on Cyborg and Aquaman. By the way, ladies, Aquaman is great eye candy! That body! Okay I got off track.Everyone in the theater loved Justice League!

Team assembly part of the movie is happening very fast; 
We don't know a lot about the characters such as Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg. During the movie we get some info about them but that's not enough to build a relationship with the characters; 
Very lame villain about whom we also don't know much, almost nothing at all; Barry Alen aka the Flash was probably the worst character in the movie. Ezra Miller was not a good match for this role; 
CGI was at many points terrible. Movement of the Flash in the speed force was like I was back in year 2000. This one had a potential to be an epic move but came out just below average.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

That's the only reason I can think of for having such a dull villain, who basically becomes just a side show to the main characters. There's a fleeting mention of Darkseid - his nephew and considered the archenemy of the Justice League - yet Steppenwolf doesn't really have a big plan besides finding some mystical devices, that he had thousands of years ago and didn't get to use properly, and try to destroy the planet (edit: there is a deleted scene online that actually shows Darkseid, but for what ever reasons, it was removed from the original film).The League itself isn't much better. Jason Momoa pretty much channels the same style he had as Ronan in Stargate Atlantis; muscle bound and brooding. Ray Fisher gives a dark and menacing portrayal of Cyborg, as he comes to terms with his transformation, and as a fan of Eureka it was good to see Joe Morton back as a scientist (and there's the other connection to the creation of Skynet in the Terminator franchise). It might have been more enjoyable if they'd given them origin story films before throwing them into the group so this film doesn't have to run through their introductions. Having them join an already established character, like Batman, might make sense in other franchises, but they are established characters, with plenty of comic pedigree. Instead, we have to wait to find out more about them, then go back to Justice League to see what is going on.We've already had Wonder Woman's introduction, and Justice League carries on with the close up face shots and beautifully tailored outfits (even my wife thought Theresa May would love a pair of leather trousers like she wears).And lastly The Flash. I get it that DC don't want to integrate their TV and film universes, yet having four years of The Flash being on TV and obviously the comics creating an image of Barry Allen, Ezra Millers Flash is more like a take off from the new Spiderman; a kid with powers, but no direction to use them. Grant Gustins version is more together and focused, which he needs to be for a long running series. If anything, he ends up reminding me of Andy Samberg in Brooklyn 99. And the reason for that is Grant Gustin wouldn't work so well with Ben Afflecks Batman. He still doesn't have the presence compared to Gal Gadot or Henry Cavill, or even Jeremy Irons, yet he's supposedly the central character tracking down the members of the League. As he says, his superpower is money!Given their wealth of available backstories, DC do seem to be squandering their opportunities to make truly great films, in exchange for CGI nonsense.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This could have taken a few deadend turns along the way easily... BUT it didn't.Superman was the hero that actually cares about civilians, he had a sense of humor and he actually smiled here. A DC character that actually smiles without being holier then thou!!! Also and this is a big also, he's suit has colour! imagine that, a DC movie with colours!Unlike Suicide Squad that spent a full hour on character intro before throwing it away and going friendship is magic. This one allows the characters to introduce themselves for a few minutes before they each actually act according to that character. Be it joining the team full of youthful eagerness or just put up the middle finger and walk away. The movie was entertaining, bright and interesting from beginning to end. Worth the watch.It lost a star because the special effects where a bit distracting, especially on cyborg and at the very end. They needed some work however they weren't horrendous. Ben Affleck's Batman was a bit weird here but it was less the actor and more the script.

"8","/10","DC finally expands it's horizons bringing the league together on the big screen to lukewarm results.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3860436/?ref_=tt_urv","leeaf83","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1518650/?ref_=tt_urv","17 November 2017","Ben Affleck owns the cowl and doesn't disappoint. Both his interrogation techniques and fighting skills resemble something out of an Arkham game. Batman doesn't kill any humans this time around but he shows off his wonderful toys. Gal Gadot is on her game again, her character becomes just as important as Bruce Wayne especially early in the film bringing the team together. Her lasso becomes her version of a utility belt and doesn't go to waste. Superman is far closer to the character than his previous portrayals. Metropolis and it's Man of steel are portrayed lighter and brighter this time around, differentiating their world from Batman and Gotham. Henry Cavill really shows his acting range here giving us an altered version of the character from the last time we saw him Cyborg feels somewhat cut down, the character isn't fleshed out as much as he could have been. The scenes we get are a treat though, Cyborg's hacking abilities are showcased. Victor Stone has a complex relationship with his father which is hinted at but not fully developed. Aquaman is portrayed similar to his presence in the New 52. Far less comedic relief and silly, and more tough and edgy. Jason Momoa gives us a character we don't need to feel ashamed cheering for, of the six heroes featured here, one could argue Aquaman is the most badass. Barry Allen is still early in his career, learning what he can do. Nothing against the TV show but it is nice seeing the Flash have to make decisions on his own without having a team at S.T.A.R. labs in his ear telling him what to do. Showing a flawed and somewhat sloppy hero helps ground the story and allows the audience to relate more to the humanity of a character who possesses a power we can only dream off. Steppenwolf is less than impressive. Great name, mediocre character. He's not a bad villain but he isn't delightful and menacing the way Loki was in the Avengers, nor were his motivations as developed as Loki's. Instead we have another monster looking to take over the world because that's something he likes to do. Certainly a powerful and fearsome villain but not an overly memorable one. Overall I liked how every character meant something unique to the team. Some may question if Aquaman needed to be there. He does as Atlantis while rarely shown plays a key part in the film's plot as does the Amazon. Danny Elfman gives some nods to the classic Batman and Superman themes though the score is merely acceptable. Danny doesn't crank out any new scores likely to become part of his classics. One problem which has plagued every DCEU film without 'Wonder Woman' in the title is the uneven tones of the films. Man of Steel has a heavy Christopher Nolan influence at certain parts, Batman V Superman suffered from tonal shifts due to the editing, and Suicide Squad was all over the pace. Despite having two directors, Justice League keeps a steady flow, even if it is flowing slightly too fast for some moviegoers. Inevitably with this project cut down from two films to one 121 minute film, useful content will be left on the cutting room floor. At the end of the day this leaves many fans including me wanting more. Luckily we'll get our chance, either via an extended cut or sequel. Take your pick but either way I can't wait for more from these characters.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Mission Accomplished).Well, what a disappointment that was!I felt the film was way too long. It really was so boring at some places for me. If it wasn't for the tiny bit of humor the Flash injects in the movie and the couple of sarcastic comments from Batman and Aquaman, I wouldn't even have given it the 4 out of 10.

They showed and revealed too much in the trailers first, it was a mistake, big mistake! While watching the movie yesterday, it felt like ""I saw this before, also saw this, also saw that! Over advertising and introduction especially at movie theaters have sicken us. We have lost our desire to be excited. I always say trailers from 90s and 80s must be a lesson for producers and filmmakers in the industry. They have been in a rush to putting this ""team"" together, making this movie as soon as possible! Well, the result is pathetic. People in these days don't try to make a great movie, instead to make a great amount of profit. That's the problem. CGI in this movie is very cheesy like I couldn't believe my eyes. Especially the scenes with Steppenwolf are like a video game in medium quality. Henry Cavill's upper lip ""touch"" needs no comment. Batman/Bruce Wayne suffers from a character shift from ""BvS: Dawn of Justice"". He is a totally different man here and I have no idea they did it intentionally or unintentionally! He is not serious, not powerful, not intimidating and definitely not a leader in this movie. Flash is fun, but not the version that the character deserves. His jokes are mostly forced and pretentious. The catastrophic events are not handled well, there is a family who serves almost no purpose etc. Aquaman was very intimidating and cool in the trailers, but in the movie, it is meh! After a while, the character loses his charm, from the top, he goes down like Batman. I like and the most importantly were satisfied with Cyborg. He was the only character with Wonder Woman who gave me reason during the movie to enjoy the picture. The villain of the movie, Steppenwolf with a very poor CGI is no much different than that bland villain Ares of Wonder Woman which is a decent movie by the way. Wonder Woman is the star of this movie. She steals the show and it is wonderful, but the entrance of the character was more like a parody itself. Mostly, character motivations are missing and character development is poor. As for Superman, it was one of the biggest screen disappointments I have ever had in my life! No heart, no soul and it makes ""Man of Steel"" a masterful work of art or a great masterpiece! They cannot feel us the consequences of a world without Superman. Even Superman Returns was very good at discussing these issues. Batman and Superman here are like the parodies of their actual characters. What does Superman do in this movie? This means the comeback story isn't handled well. Is there any iconic moment which will give you goosebumps? Well, go and see it for yourself. We cannot feel his real power potential in this saving world adventure. Justice League is a two-hour popcorn entertainment with almost zero background, if you say that's enough for me, then there is nothing to discuss about. For example, the great Commissioner Gordon is just there.. We don't meet him yet. We don't know him yet. Humor is very forced at times. Action scenes are boring and we already saw most of them in the trailers which is a pity for us. I have no interest for Lois Lane anymore. I prefer to look at a picture of Margot Kidder on a wall for hours rather than watching the relationship between Lois Lane and Superman in these movies. The slow motion moments of Flash feels amateurish and it doesn't create any spark, thrill or even fun during the action. By the way, I am still not sure about whether this nerdy version of Flash is hilarious or pathetic? Finally, the second after the credits scene is better than the whole movie itself.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But it was still enjoyable.Batman(Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman(Gal Gadot), AquaMan(Jason Momoa), Cyborg(Ray Fisher), and The Flash(Ezra Miller) discover that a big threat is coming, and must team up to stop it.Not quite has epic has The Avengers, but still an entertaining film, a little bit over the top with CGI. The actors has the iconic characters really do well, all have a great chemistry. Although I felt that Ezra Miller was overdoing the nerd bit with his character. This has been getting mixed reviews by critics, pretty much all DCU films have been getting, except for Wonder Woman. I hope to see more Justice League films in the future.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

And late 90s CGI too. Should have just worn the hoodie throughout the entire film, it hurt watching what is an actor that did a stellar job playing someone that was hurting and at odds with his very being...made into a distraction because the CGI was absolutely horrid.Beyond that the movie was awful. Well, it was awful in a totally boring kind of way...and this was a superhero movie. They managed to make it boring.Part of it could be that, like Wonder Woman, it tried to be too dark and serious, but even then Wonder Woman was a hell of a lot more fun...even if they tried to make her film into yet another Batman movie. At least she had her moments.In Justice League, ONLY she had her moments. Seriously. The Flash, well, he really didn't do anything that wasn't forced, but then Aquaman, he had a moment...but it was forced.Everything seemed a bit forced. And the big reveal was revealed before hand...so you really didn't even get that wow moment.All in all, it kind of sucks, really bad.

There is plenty of room for character introductions, but Justice League suffers ludicrously from lengthy, obscure dialogue - mainly from the Flash - but one might argue the problematic misuse of this is due to writing issues of the movie. Like previous instalments: Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice and Man of Steel, Justice League - amongst the front runners in the DCEU - continue to suffer from poor direction. Plus, Diane Lane's brief presence as Martha Kent is weaker than ever, following her weak portrayal in Batman V Superman and Man of Steel. I believe her weak portrayal in these movies is the error of the writers. Arguably, one might expect to see the return of Kevin Costner and Russel Crowe, in their respective roles as Clarke's biological and earth fathers. Plus, Superman's return is nothing exciting, nor is the brief portrayal of Henry Cavill, which is a large step back from his portrayal in the previous movies. Though, the visual effects are mediocre and decent, there is enough writing errors to go around here that puts the movie down. Considering its poor box-office performance so far, it's errors and financial performance may very well affect the rest of the DCEU.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Batman vs Superman was okay to me, but it did have a bunch of nonsensical stuff in it and did tend to drag setting up the main event. Then add to that, the fact this one is not exactly going over well with critics and other people and I was expecting a train wreck on the screen, but I still thought I would give it a shot as I have enjoyed Henry Cavill's Superman and I did want to see how he was brought back in. Suffice to say, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the film. I am also surprised by the negativity this film is getting as it seemed well done to me. It was not perfect, but I had a really good time watching it and I thought it was better than Wonder Woman, which I enjoyed as well, but did not get why it was so praised as it played out like your typical origin story. This one is being trashed when it was a fun super hero team film, so what, does DC and Warner Brothers just not have the money to bribe reviewers like Disney does? Does the general public do everything they are told or what? I will be the first to say that I am more of a Marvel hero fan all the way, as I did enjoy Thor: Ragnarok more than this one, but this one was not all that far behind. That is, not to me it was not and my parents both enjoyed it as well and neither were super fond of Batman vs Superman.The story has Superman perished and the world kind of falling apart. Batman battles this strange creature that senses fear and he fears some sort of invasion is imminent due to material he has recovered from Lex Luther. He feels he must get a team together of super humans to try and defy the odds and beat back the threat which is a being known as Steppenwolf. This being strikes at the Amazons first and then the Atlanteans as he gathers these cubes together in an attempt to convert Earth into something else entirely. Soon the team of Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg battle the threat head on, but it seems readily apparent to Batman that more is needed and thus he begins to hatch a plan to revive the man of steel.I enjoyed the film, kind of wish I did not as I am sure I am going to take flack for it. The heroes were done really well as Ben Affleck's Batman was good as was Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. I enjoyed the Flash as he added some great humor to the flick and I liked how they did Cyborg as well. I was a bit skeptical of Jason Mamoa as Aquaman, but I thought he did a good job as well. The one that blew me away the most was Henry Cavill's Superman as he seemed the most like Superman in this one than in his other two appearances. He kicked some major butt in this film suffice to say! So, I enjoyed the film. I was expecting it to be a complete mess, but I thought the story was pretty easy to follow. The film had more light moments than did Batman vs Superman and it had a lot more action too. It also accomplished both feats while being a shorter movie than Batman vs Superman. Once again though it was not perfect as I thought the film could have used more Superman; however, due to his limited use it does make the scenes he is in more awesome. Not sure they will create any more DC films due to the fact this one does not seem to be lighting the box office on fire, which seems a shame as to me they seem to be doing a good job with their films. I would love to see Darkseid in a Justice League film, but at least I finally got to see Superman really be Superman!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

When this came out 4 years ago, I was on board with it and was entertained and probably would have rated it at 7 stars out of 10. However, with the new one out now, this pales in comparison and is really nothing better than a throwaway film.Superman has died, and in his effort to keep a promise to the Man of Steel, Batman is obsessed with assembling a league of superheroes to help defend life on earth as we know it - to keep the peace, to keep the balance from going out of whack. He enlists the help of Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, and the Flash - and just in time too, since an evil force has awakened and begins to wreak havoc in his search for three artifacts that, when combined, will give him ultimate power. Perhaps, if they play their cards right, they can bring Superman himself back as well.After I watched Zack Snyder's Justice League, I decided to watch this one again too, since it has been 4 years since I last saw it. My jaw dropped at just how different the two were. With very little, scant similarities, this original theatrical version felt choppy and watered down. In fact, at the conclusion of the movie, I realized that I had no desire to ever watch it again. The only reason I would keep it is for comparison points. This version is more colorful, plotted completely different, and definitely had a PG-13 feel to it. In fact, it was just silly in parts.I have lowered my rating from 7 stars down to a ho-hum rating of 5 stars out of 10. It is still just ""okay"" with a few amusing scenes that you won't find in the newer version (ie: the race between the Flash and Superman at the end). But, I cannot recommend you see this one. My recommend is that you watch Zack Snyder's version, since it is obvious that any forthcoming sequels will be based on that instead. Like I said, this theatrical cut is basically obscure now.","3 out of 19 found this helpful.

For those watching it alone, yes..it's not going to be a good experience. The audience LOVED it. And it became infectious. It's not a terrible movie as most have rated it. It's trying so hard for you to like them. So in that effort, it is a fine movie. Why did I rate this an 8/10? Because it is pure entertainment. Marvel is hellbent on spreading socialism and BLM agenda. Oh, I meant...authoritarian agenda. Disney is behind this. They are garbage people (child molesters and sexual assaulters) who have shielded these monsters for decades. Though they inject moral outrage into their films. Get bent. There is no message in Warner Bros./DC universe. And yet it suffers from (big surprise) poor critical reviews. Lap it up children.It seems this franchise chooses to treat movie goers as adults and not as spoon fed Leftist toddlers. Yeah, Ben Affleck was accused, but there isn't a morality tale in ""Justice League"" that would parallel the world they want under socialist regime. This is true Super Friends movie without idiotic Leftist rhetoric. But I suppose the critics/press lambast it because it doesn't mold to that message. For shame.

When it's done right, I'm able to digest it to a certain level but most of the CGI here was so 'cartoony' that I could never get into it. The direction feels like a TV production ( claustrophobic sets, unrealistic looking sets, etc). Since almost everything is CGI, including the surroundings, the film feels really cloistered. The lame story is about some Mother Boxes which can destroy the world. These boxes were introduced back in Antiquity by the main alien villain called Steppenwolf. We see a flashback of the events of the distant past with Wonder Woman (a wooden Gal Gadot) recalling the events to Batman (a wooden Ben Affleck). Though the set-up is totally uninspired,. I have to admit that I liked the scenes set in the past more than the modern period (and why I'm giving this 4 stars). As Wonder Woman brings up Batman up to speed about the 'Mother boxes"" we see an orgy of battles, of Amazons, Atlanteans, even of Gods such as Zeus, battling Steppenwolf and his army of aliens (they're from an unspecific alien world). In a brief but powerful moment, we see Zeus (bodybuilder Sergi Constance) 'neutralizing' the Mother Boxes. A defeated Steppenwolf is exiled from earth. Neutralized and with Steppenwolf gone, the Mother Boxes are kept hidden at separate locations around earth. Back in our contemporary time, with Superman 'dead', Steppenwolf shows up again, ready to find and reconnect the 3 Mother Boxes and destroy Earth. Desperate to stop Steppenwolf, Batman and Wonder Woman recruit other superheroes, such as Aquaman and the Flash, in order to team up and annihilate Steppenwolf.This is basically the gist of the convoluted story. The story makes very little sense. The action makes even less sense.My question is, if Zeus was able to 'defeat' and neutralize the Mother Boxes thousands of years ago, why didn't the 'Justice League' just try and recruit Zeus again? What happened to him? Was Zeus on vacation? Is he dead? Are the Olympian Gods not worthy of the Justice League? Is Superman the new Zeus?The weakness of the script is apparent from the start. It shows a solution to the problem the contemporary heroes face at the very start of the film (all powerful Zeus winning over Steppenwolf) but when Steppenwolf decides to cause mayhem again in 2017, suddenly Zeus is nowhere to be found. A poorly written script.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Characters: - like in Wonder Woman, Gal Galdot's a super model in action. She S doing most of the work and talking. She S like, ""look at my face."" - it did justice to Aquaman. Tall, bearded, long-haired dude, like Hemsworth, can produce such a macho man with unique humor. Jason Momoa makes me think it s great to get tattoos. Just think. - great pairing of Wonder Woman and Aqua man during the fight. I smell Flashpoint. - Ezra Miller as The Flash is likable but I still don't like the costume. - I feel so dissatisfied Amber Heard's Mera didn't have enough scenes. She a hot. - I still don't find Ben Affleck is effective as burned out Bruce Wayne. His Batman is OK but as Bruce is not. - I didn't like Sups new costume. He S a beefcake though. Like in BvS, I like it when they use krptonian music from MOS. Story: - the film doesn't have much substance. Take it like as the entry for the other upcoming JL films but it has the ""oh god no fu*** way"" part and ""Oh my god, they re in trouble"" scene. - the story S very simple. Bring the team together to fight. But I didn't feel the need for it. - I m getting the feeling that Joss Whedon didn't do or removed a lot of the intended scenes from the original script, or Zack Snyder failed to finish bcz of his departure from the production. - if you ve watched other Zack Snyder films, you re gonna feel it s missing a lot of things. - First half was really engaging and exciting, the other half's turned into ""what?

It mimics some of the best and worst of tropes from the Marvel Cinematic Universe- two after credits scenes, plenty of humor and witty banter between superheroes to satisfy fans who left feeling drained from Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, and a hopeful outlook for a universe that is repeatedly dipped in potential doom and destruction; much like the reputation of the DC Cinematic Universe itself.More so than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice; Justice League progresses the events of the DC Cinematic Universe, but more organically along with hints to a hopefully better sequel, and easter eggs that had my inner geek jumping for joy.However; it carries the burden of some set pieces being too hyperactive for most attentive viewers, awkward humor in serious moments, a mostly predictable narrative, and for this being one of the most expensive movies ever made; a villain as forgettable as Steppenwolf is poppycock on part of the writers and Warner Bros. or DC who could excuse a violation like this (especially considering this is a culmination of years of material Warner Bros. has been giddy to adapt, maybe these heroes deserve a worthwhile villain).If you're one looking for another joyride with some of the top dogs of DC Comics, or a fan seeking closure with years of anticipation; this is your excursion. But if you want something more fluid or meaningful, it's variable on how much this will fluster you (if you decide to watch it).

But the story that Snyder developed was something a lot different than the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Death of Superman is the quintessential DC Storyline. It's the darkest thing they've ever done. Whedon tries to lighten it up too much, but the scenes which Snyder had shot conflict with that. There certainly is a big difference between Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon. This was a story that deserved to be told by the original director, just for continuity's sake. But the theatrical version fails to tell the continuation of the same story from BvS. The Ultimate Cut Fanedit, however, does.The only issue with the Fanedit is of course, the fact that it's a fanedit, and you have to go out and look for it, it's not hard to find, but it is difficult to get. And the guy who edited it, messed up the continuity in a few spots. But it does give us a good idea of what would have happened had Snyder been able to finish the work he had started 7 years earlier. It would have finished his Man of Steel trilogy. I'm hoping at some point, Snyder will be able to make his cut of this film, we had to wait almost 25 years for Richard Donner to do his original vision for Superman II. And that was worth it. On that day when Zack Snyder is able to make his version of this, that will also be a great day. I hold out a great hope for this.An official Snyder Ultimate cut would explain why dreams are not really dreams and why The Flash has to say ""Is it too soon?"". Is The Flash mucking with Time in BvS? I did not really like Batman v Superman, until I saw the Ultimate Cut. I did not really like Justice League, until I saw all of the missing scenes that explain what's happening. Snyder's concept for Steppenwolf, shown in the BvS ultimate cut, is a lot more menacing. I've seen some Snyder previz footage that has a very frightening image of Steppenwolf. But the Steppenwolf in the film, I don't know who is responsible for it, some have told me this was Snyder's imagery. But it does not fit, so I have always thought it was Whedon's work. The ""Ultimate Cut"" has a continuation of this ""Dream"", but as if from Cyborg's POV. Something even worse, somebody even worse than Steppenwolf is coming. I hope that when that story is told, it is told as well as Man of Steel and Batman v Superman.I understand the immense disappointment with this film, it mirrors my sadness that the Filmmaker who created this vision was not able to complete it.I encourage anyone who wants to see how this film could have gone to search out the Fanedit. It's worth it.It occurs to me, if Whedon had treated this film more like his ""Serenity"", it might have worked better.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

While I was watching ""Justice League"" I looked for any redeeming qualities, and they are hard to find. The dialogue is awful, with unnecessary attempts at humor. The CGI is poor, with Steppenwolf looking like a rough first draft of a final villain. The acting is mediocre, mostly from Gal Gadot (""Kal-El, no!).Take all those elements and a disjointed storyline, and you get the disaster that is ""Justice League"". There were multiple times where I had to rewind the movie to see if I missed something, because the editing was so choppy.With poor relationship building and an incoherent plot, ""Justice League"" is an incredible disappointment. In the end, this movie is just a bunch of indestructible people hitting each other until the credits finally roll.Best Character: Barry Allen (I hate to say that)

But Henry Cavill does a just ok job with him he had his own movie in the DCEU so he does not need to much establishing.Wonder Woman is great as usual, she is great at fighting and also does not need to much build up because she has her own movie in the DCEU.Aqua man is cot drinking several times he is an insensitive person and he is also kind of shady with his feelings but all around that he does not need much build up because he has his own DCEU movie.The Flash and Cyborg are the ones who are the problems of the movie. They both don't have their own movies so they need build up. The movie doesn't give them any build up with results in the Flash just being there for a bunch of useless silly jokes, and Cyborg has no real pain when he gets his robot body and just brute for like 10 minutes of the movie.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

As far as I'm aware, this sort of interference happens to almost every director, but Snyder seems totally able to absolve himself of responsibility for continuously making steaming heaps of garbage movies with huge amounts of money at his disposal.If indeed there is a good film lying on the cutting floor, chopped out by Joss Whedon, it must make up an almost entirely different movie. And the same was said of Batman Vs Superman where a director's cut was released with the Blu-ray, which while it improved the film, it couldn't remove the terrible parts such as Jesse Eisenberg's depiction of Lex Luther or Henry Cavill's amateurish portrayal of Superman.And I'm glad this film flopped. The opening ten minutes was so filled with anti-white propaganda, as we see in all big-budget movies now, I was ready to leave the cinema. Maybe I should have because the next 90% was cheap-looking action CGI with stints of boring/unfunny dialogue.I won't be attending anymore Snyder/superhero movies.

Secondly there is no difference (except less quality) that separates this from the Marvel equivalent. They need to take their time and not rush these films just to compete with Marvel. This movie felt very rushed. Marvel/Disney has been setting this thing up for 10+ years....","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

That said, I also like a good film with a good story. To further explain, I liked Dawn of Justice. It had issues, don't get me wrong. But, I still found it enjoyable. The problems I had with the movie were not the same problems the ""critics"" had. To me, most of the ""critics"" issues in both Dawn of Justice and Justice League are trivial and even unjust. Good: Superman ended up being the Superman we all know, love, and deserve to see on the big screen. Humanity realizes after his death just how much they need him, and the hope that he gave them. Batman, Wonderwoman, Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman played their parts well. And, their roles were relevant to the story. Barry Allen (Flash) was the fitting comic relief. (I Barry wasn't really comical in the comics, it was Wally. But, I still liked it. We've had enough brooding already.) If you follow the comics (or cartoons) even a little, you will see Steppenwolf ended up being written in a way that accurately portrays him as the head of minions (nothing more.) His main goal is to ""ascend"" to a higher level by conquering humanity. Bad: The villain could have used more explanation. I think some of the confusion around Steppenwolf's character would have been resolved by at least revealing in more detail the hierarchy. But, it didn't impact the story for me.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Not DC's Avengers, THE Justice League. The unification of Detective Comics most powerful heroes into one entity to protect planet Earth from threats within and without. The force that many wanted to be a part of growing up, that hit children's TV shows have been made of and that comics have been running for years with iconic and best selling story lines. Like Batman V Superman, this should be one of the biggest films of the year. It should easily blow out the competition in the Comic Book Film market and should be going for the Number 2 spot in the Highest Grossing 2017 movie list.But like Batman V Superman, it's going to be a rough time.Critically ""eh""'d at by both fans and naysayers with many giving it a ""Not as bad as Batman V Superman"", they've really set the bar low on how good their films can be. And after having watched the film about 2 days ago, upon writing, I can say that those that have gone ""eh"" are right.This film is not a masterpiece. It is not the film that echoes the Justice League Unlimited of the past and it is not the film that even comes close to Wonder Woman. This film is boring, badly paced with bad jokes with badly performed punchlines. It's a visual sensation, but that was never a problem, the problem was the sheer amount of visuals to wrap your head around. It has the depth of a paddling pool and if you think about it for too long you might get a headache because this once again does not make sense.The story is a copy and paste from The Avengers, which got boring with Age of Ultron, Suicide Squad and other various Superhero films that all end in the team having a big CGI fight with the villain where they have to stop them from destroying the entire world so they, or someone they work for, can rule it for all of eternity. Collect X item at Y location for Z outcome before A Team come and stop B Villain.DC has just a wide range of villains that it can pick from, why they went for someone as obscure and underdeveloped as Steppenwolf astounds me. Take away the fact that he does nothing in the entire movie, I hadn't even heard of him in the comics before and even though I haven't read Issue #6 of Detective Comics, I know enough about the characters and their respective villains to know EGGHEAD. But add in the movie spice that takes a layer away, and you're left with Malekth but with even less substance, because at least Maleketh was actually doing everything because Asgard killed his ENTIRE RACE. Steppenwolf is doing it ""For The Unity"" and ""For Darkseid"".So the plot and the villain are terrible and the writing with jokes is on and off with most of them not landing and only some situations where they attempt to make jokes actually working. What are we left with? Character interaction!Batman - The complete opposite to BvS because people hated it and they didn't have the guts to show him actually change from wanting to end crime through the permanent means of death to going through the system and trusting that one day humanity will actually sort itself out.Wonder Woman - See Wonder Woman the movie now out on Blu-Ray, it's pretty good and people thought that so go see it before seeing this mess.The Flash - Watch the TV Show for the actual Barry Allen and pretend this is Wally West instead.Aquaman - See Aquaman 2018, sorry we didn't get the film out in time but it'll be good we promise.Cyborg - He's here too!Superman - Sorry we killed him in the previous film in the most disrespectful way we possibly could, here, we'll get him to almost kill the entire Justice League and make you think that we'll go down a route that makes this entire universe the universe that it seems like it is but then pull one over and have him be a Superman you can actually like without us having to make an entire movie to build him back up and make him like an actual character or give him any characteristics from the comics and have him smile more YAY WE DID IT!There are some good things to the film though. The Superman fight, while boring, did have the shining moment of Superman's speed compared to the Flash which made me laugh and the use of Superman's Frost Breath actually gave me an erection because HIS FROST BREATH IS NOT USED ENOUGH GOD DAMN.Apart from all of the things that I just said and the ones I've left unspoken, including the way they handle Superman's resurrection and how it's the literal worst way they could've done it, this film doesn't leave you with a bad taste in your mouth from the amount of excrement you just ate while watching it.It ends on the note of, we're trying guys, we just don't want to copy Marvel too much and have these films be their own thing away from the corporate machine, before giving up two post credits scenes that make you realise that they're lying and that once Flashpoint happens we are getting a full Marvel DC film.At the end of the day, once you've seen the film and you're walking out the cinema trying to wonder what is going on with Deathstroke's beard and why Arrow has a better Deathstroke and how that is even possible.Justice League isn't as bad as Batman V Superman.And that's all we can hope for in this Age of Heroes.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's a team build on the same scale as the Avengers, just without the added benefit of backstory.Going in, my thought was that Aquaman was going to steal the show, but that honor goes to the Flash. Ezra Miller offers a different take on Barry Allen from the Grant Gustin version, and it works well within the team's dynamic. Every scene he is in is better for him being there, and his wide-eyed viewing of many of the events he is privy to adds a comedic element that could have easily been overlooked.And once again, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is the star of the show. She holds the entire movie together on her own, and while Batman is the one whose brainchild the team is, she is truly the driving force, and the character with the most happening as the film develops. Gadot came right out of the solo movie and into this one without missing a beat, even though the writing lets her down.Joss Whedon's hands are all over this thing. Fans of his work will notice his style, particularly the snappy dialogue, and he tries to overshadow Snyder, and pull the movie away from his clutch into something that is more enjoyable and lighter than Batman v. Superman, even though the stakes are infinitely higher. He doesn't completely succeed, and it's easy to see there were two different creative visions at work here.Steppenwolf is not well realized, nor the ideal villain for this scenario. He is clearly a precursor to the inevitable arrival of Darkseid, a stronger, more complex character that is also pure evil. The film gets a bit bogged down in the Mother Box piece, and they almost feel like a MacGuffin of the highest order.The film tries to be fun. Maybe a bit too hard. And while it never falls flat on its face, it stumbles so much, it might as well have.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think Man of Steel and BVS were great, and I could tell Snyder definitely understood the characters but how to tell a story. He had a 5 movie plan or arc, and I was so excited to see the story continue with JL. If you're any kind of fan, you know the tragic story and what happened. Whedon has done some great things so I don't blame DC/WB for bringing him in to ""finish"" the movie. What followed his arrival was pure trash though. The two directors are polar opposites and you could tell Whedon just wouldn't or couldn't work with Snyder's material, or his overall arc. The more I read about this situation, the more I lose respect for Whedon. When I saw JL in theaters, I didn't hate it. I've been a Batman fan since I was 4 years old so I'll watch anything with the character. I think it was obvious watching this movie that the cast/crew kind of gave up after Snyder had to leave and they were just going through the motions. Whedon basically reshot the entire movie, changed the plot, tried to make it funny like the Avengers, etc. I'm not sure that Whedon can handle the darker DC characters or tone and he was just out of his element. Fans had a right to be mad about this train wreck and they spoke up. Fans wanted to see what Snyder had envisioned and #ReleasetheSnyderCut was born. Even the cast supported the movement.Fast forward to 2020 and it's been an awful year for everyone. We did get some good news though when it was announced that the Snyder Cut will be released in 2021 on HBOmax as a mini series event. Snyder was also given an additional 70 million for a few more reshoots and other work. The once dead DCEU is back alive baby. As a fan I'm thrilled this is happening. It's clear that HBO Max realizes this is a great way to compete with Disney Plus, and even though it hasn't been announced yet, I think this version will finally lead to JL2 and Man of Steel, and more.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Certainly not a 10 star film by any stretch, so ignore the studio PR social media teams. I wanted to like this movie for a whole host of reasons; I like all of the characters, I like and respect the original comics and I loved the visuals from the previous films, but this was a lame effort on the part of the writers, directors and really the actors. Watching this film, I was struck by the lack of enthusiasm that all involved seemed to have for the opportunity that they had in its making. None of the actors really seemed to take their roles seriously. The acting, for the most part was atrocious as were the lines that the actors were expected to deliver. The scenes were poorly written and poorly directed and didn't seem to flow coherently. The entire movie is a forgettable mess that just leaves me sad for DCU fans. Here are just a few things that ruined this film: Hipster, tattooed Aquaman portrayed as a UFC style ""bro-dude"" spouting lines like - ""That's what I'm talking' 'bout!"" and ""..I dig it"". Whiny, anxiety-riddled Flash constantly complaining throughout the movie.The Cavill/Gadot sex symbol show. Yes, they are both extremely good looking people but that's not really why I paid to see this movie. Thanks for working Gadot's ass into so many shots, but I really wanted see a movie with a bit more substance. Product placement from Mercedes that was so obvious it was laughable. Smuggled-in politics, from the scene depicting the white-power skinhead dude screaming outside of a Moslem owned store while a Moslem child gazes on in fear, to quips about global warming between Bruce Wayne and Aquaman. I get it, all this stuff is bad, but I didn't come to see this film to be preached to. There was more, but as I stated, the movie was pretty forgettable.","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

Another BvS thrill! Again?Why, I just don't know why. They keep the dark so far, because the super amazing Dark Knight's success? Move on, guys! Checking the foe, for how fun everybody there, so you try to have some too? Come on! Be yourself. You order Flash to be the funny naive cutie character? No way, that is sloppy. We all think, ""oh, they have bla- bla-bla, he is so funny, and so you have Flash?"" I didn't laugh for how jokes or funny scenes were thrown, only few spectators laugh as I recall last night. Producers don't bring anything new for the idea of bunch of heroes or good guys, one or few of them are funny. You just join the club, just like that, ignoring the noble idea of up to date Superman and Batman, how you all started it. Bet Box office is always the main reason. Yeah right, we know.BvS has Batman as savior for entire movie, this time no savior at all. Everyone is lost. Perhaps I breathe in quite a relieve on Superman reborn scene. I like it.Few notes: 1. CGI used has a low quality. Specially imitating faces of actors on action scenes did not go well. We can distinguish which is CGI and which is actors themselves. To be honest, the CGI quality reminds me to Matrix trilogy way back then.2. Small things are neglected as goofs. Like janitor scene in Star Labs. When Silas left, then drove home, talked to Victor, the janitor stays cleaning the same spot all these times, for hours, until he got kidnapped.3. Flash's costume designed for dealing the friction with air or everything else while he moves very fast in the speed of lightning. But his daily outfit is okay too, right? Check out when he runs around in Bat Cave, lightning appears, and his jacket, pant and sneaker shoes are still intact after. Just another goof. 4. So Martha left the house because of foreclosure, and leave all Clark's clothes for him to wear it again someday he resurrects? Martha has super ability to see the future I believe.5. Amy Adams looks older while Cavill does not. This one issue to deal with for next Superman-Lois movies.Producers, please decide, be dark or be fun, if you want to combine them, think about it like hundred times.What I feel from BvS and JL (also count in Suicide Squad), like entering fancy restaurant, with well known chef, but they only serve scrambled egg and coffee.","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

"10","/10","The MOST Inspirational, yet Entertaining and Thoughtful Superhero Movie since Wonder Woman.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4220702/?ref_=tt_urv","autisticsophist","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur88435984/?ref_=tt_urv","30 June 2018","This film might not have the dark and complicated theme like The Dark Knight, a blend of clumsy humour and irriating jokes like The Avengers, or even the mind-boggling plot of Watchmen or the mind-blowing philosophy and action sequences of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but it's CERTAINLY worth watching. First things first, the heroes all have feelings for each other, and it's a relationship that EVOLVES over time, which The Flash could manipulate with his charm. For instance, both Flash and Cyborg gradually developed a steady friendship through their backgrounds and how they accidentally got these ""gifts"", Bruce and Diana learn not only to respect each other but also to take care of one another. Superman was Earth's beacon and Bruce was that of the team. Wonder Woman inspires people, making everyone strive to become their better selves while Bruce inspires Diana to do so. Batman, who now uses much less violent guns, is a great mentor to the Flash, and even got his back, with grabling hook in a stunning visual style. Aquaman, who initially refused to join the team and did not like Bruce, Barry and somewhat despise Cyborg and adored only Wonder Woman, learnt to reevalute their friendship with a teeny help of her own magic. 
Even Bruce was worried about Clark's life after a heroic moment, proving to the audience that the vigilante cares about him more than just his abilities to save the world, Clark was then officially Bruce's friend. Diana binds the team togheter and at one point leads the team. Everyone, at the end of the movie, was a family. Unlike The Avengers, who are just partners and teamates or ""a chemical mixture that makes chaos"".
The villain may be a bit disappointing but not generic, our antagonist doesn't simply wish to terraform our lovely planet but has a motivation to do so for he's decided mankind was worthless and beneath him. Even the alien henchmen called parademons, who feed on fear, are terrifying, whereas the Chitauri, bots from the two Avengers films or clowns from the old Tim Burton's film and thugs from The Dark Kngight Rises are just ridiculous and annoying.
The jokes are more hillarious and meaningful than crappy quips vomitted at the audience as in Avengers 2, but instead did the best of jobs at relieving the intensity of the film. Speaking of which, this film successfully evaded all the gloom in BvS and The Dark Knight, but still creates an enjoyable feel with all the authentic humour that was all well-placed, and when things need to get dark, the film still offers a genuine feeling of fear and tension, reduced afterwards by mild to extremely relaxing jokes. It's a film filled with optimism and hope, when most Marvel movies, excluding the first one ever, Captan America 2, Thor 3, Guadians of the Galaxy, Spider-man: Home-coming, and Avengers 3, are just over-the-top superhero films, full of explosions, deafening sounds and furry, signifying nothing.
The pacing of this epic movie is brillantly fast enough to keep things exciting all the time, unlike X-men: Apocalyse or The Dark Knight Rises, where people have to sit through two thirds of the screentime to see some interesting things. The plot is thick enough to make sense, while it could have been better if the good guys' plan was more thoughtful. Anyway, it was well-executed. The deeper meanings of this film rise above all else, and the acting performences, especially of the Flash, Diana and Bruce, deserve praising. 
Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon produce really satisfying and stunning visuals, whether. it's practical or CG. All except for the mustache removal, which honestly wasn't too distracting.
I would highly reccomend watching this movie in a lifetime.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

Shame that WB had to mandate this film and trim it down to 2 hours. A lot of stuff is missing, there's no emotional weight but i thought the return was Superman was cool. Yes the characters except Flash were really good but that couldn't save this film. CGI was left unfinished and introductions felt rushed. Flash's introduction with him especially with Flash. Overall, movie is a mess but i am still hoping that this movie get's an extended cut soon. Avoid it, don't waste your time.

Batman looks like a Fatman in an uncomfortable funny leather suit, even the suit from '90 looked better. It felt like Ben doesn't know $hit about batman of any type of combat (or acting, I mean acting as an act!).
Wonder woman here looked like a bimbo in a bimbo dress. I don't know why... I mean, she's hot, but she's not an acting material. She laughs with her eyes almost all the time.
Aquaman was made like a macho. Comparing ""his coming to be"", he's gained a huge a$$ self-esteem as huge as batman's face. WHY? I don't know. Arthur (with capital A) from animation was a proud king! Here this arthur is like a lazy thug with powers.
I can't believe how CGI looks absolutely terrible and unrealistic judging by the movie's budget. And keep in mind that this movie is ALL about CGI.
I don't want to rate this movie lower than 3. Because if I see Barry as a chinese I will lose my $hit.Edit:
I'm sorry, A movie with BLACK AMAZONS doesn't deserve a good rating. What's next, a jewish hitler documentary?Summary:
Is this a movie? Yes.
Is this a good movie? Kinda, yes or no.
Is this a bad movie? No.
Will I recommend it? I will NOT recommend it if you are a fan of Batman, JL and other DC members. This is HERESY!

Almost,equal amount of screen space was given for all the characters. The story screenplay was lucid. The continuity from one frame to another was seamless. The characters had retained their originality. Although Batman himself looks a little weaker physically, given the age he is portrayed and that the rest of the folks are superhuman, it is definitely a good logic to show him that way. Nevertheless, the whole movie runs on his intellectual genius, strategy and the muscle power of the rest of the team. The cast is perfect. BATfleck is great, Cavil eases in, Gal Gadot is steaming, Aquaman and Cyborg were just fine. Flash was shown a little weak and childish (may be the CW Flash effect). May be there is a back story explanation. No prejudice, we should wait. The writers and the producers have remained true to the original Justice League comic book spirit. BGM was fantastic.Second, place within DC and comparison to Marvel: This stands out as one of the best DC movies so far. Given that this is the first movie where we get to see so many of the DC superheroes together, this adds the OOMPH. The villain of this movie is formidable. But this also shows that there is definitely going to be bigger justice league movies with mush bigger villains. The scope is huge. And the post credit scenes set the stage for the next JLA movie.And being a Marvel fan as well, I can already see Marvel movies going down in class, content and being true to comics (like how Thor has been handled is one example). So, looks like a upward tick for DC. Some movie fanboys try to draw parallels with Avengers and say that DC is trying to fit in the parallels. But the comic history of characters beckons, almost all of the DC characters pre-date their Marvel counterparts. Marvel's were adapted versions of the DC characters. In majority cases, the DC ones came first. So, for moviebuffs, try reading the comics before concluding. Prediction, going forward, DC is going to be trending up.. it might be the reverse for Marvel.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie is OK, but no Avengers. The film seems like a bunch of scenes filmed separately and then put together to resemble a movie. The plot is weak and the villain is a CGI mess. Once again they gave Henry Cavill very little to do or say in this movie as well. Three movies into playing Superman and he has a total of about 60 lines. The good things I can say about the movie is that the individual characters were pretty decent. (However Ben's Batman leaves something to be desired. It seems he was just there to get a paycheck. Glad he is leaving the role.) There is a good fight sequence with the Amazons, and Ezra Millers Flash was entertaining.

It seems as if it's cool to whack Warner Bros movies, and most of the adverse criticisms seem to come from people who are just trying to make a name for themselves and their websites. As for the Rotten Tomatoes ratings, these seem to be be as a result of the same genre of critics producing the reviews. Okay, so rant over and onto the movie itself. I took my 13 year old daughter to see this film and, whilst Man of Steel marked a huge change in the way Superman was presented but was still a good movie, BvS in it's theatrical release form was sub par, although the DVD special edition atoned for this, in my opinion. So we were hoping for a movie with a brighter and more optimistic tone; and that's what we got. People who criticise the plot, clearly have an attention span deficit or maybe just one of a gnat. It may be that they are too busy prejudging the movie based on their biased take on Zack Snyder movies and a general dislike of praising anything worthy from DC/Warners. Ignore the skewed box office predictions, talking down of the box office performance, and derogatory comments about facial hair. This film deserves watching more than once - I certainly intend to! The final act should have had the audience cheering, but I guess people generally are more cynical these days. However, the audience we were in were constantly laughing at jokes and witticisms in the movie, both visual and verbal.If you are a Justice League fan or just a wannabee one, you wont be disappointed and Warners would be mad not to be fast-tracking sequels.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"4","/10","This may be better than some DCEU titles, but being bored into submission shouldn't be the standard for superhero entertainment of the non-Marvel variety.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3863587/?ref_=tt_urv","Pjtaylor-96-138044","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26820801/?ref_=tt_urv","20 November 2017","'Justice League (2017)' is not quite as boring as 'Man Of Steel (2013)' or 'Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice (2016)' mainly because it's far shorter and far simpler, to the point that the story itself can be boiled down to one surprise-less compound sentence. It's devoid of development or detail even at the most basic of sub-surface levels, but at least it doesn't last too long. It also isn't as much of an abysmal assault on the senses as 'Suicide Squad (2016)', mainly because it is, for the most part, legible and competently constructed on a technical scale. Still, this latest entry into the DCEU is a dull and joyless experience that somehow still all seems like set-up when it should feel like some form of pay-off, a culmination of what's come before. There's also the undeniable fact that almost nothing ever feels tangible and the action sequences are so obviously digital that you'll be wearing a squint for most of the piece just to see what's going on, which isn't helped by the fact that most of them are infused with Zack Snyder's signature speed-ramping style. It's made even more visually confusing because a few core characters can move incredibly fast - which leads to some wildly speed-ramped slow-motion segments, 'slow-mo-ception' if you will, just to make things absolutely crazy. The characters are all practically invincible, too, so you're never inherently invested in their survival. Plus, the feature never does anything to make you care about the key players (whom almost all seem as though they are desperate not to be there) or, even, the world at large (which is oddly sidelined save a couple of 'save the world' lines). In the end, the movie just comes across as incredibly lifeless, relatively dull and just about as false as a certain special someone's CGI-enhanced upper lip. 4/10.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Candy tastes good but it has no nutrional value and is bad bad for us. These movies are soulless. There is no humanity in them. If you look at the best action movies - the Bourne trilogy and any Jason Stratham film - we are invested in the humanity of the leads. The fight scenes are thrilling because we care about the characters outcomes. The fight scenes in all of these comic book movies, even in Black Panther, are indistinguishable. There's so much 3D and special effects it looks plastic. Justice League is the worst of the lot. 3D characters interact with green screen characters. There are explosions and fire, superhero's and villains thrown into walls. Walls collapsing. Buildings collapsing. Light streaks. Lens flares. Sparks falling from ceilings. Yet, as a viewer, these are great times to go make a sandwich. I find myself wishing that all of these characters would die off in a fiery explosion. Another key point is that these films reek of fear. The fear is that none of these characters can carry a film by themselves - you have groups of these gayly dressed men and the occasional woman all fighting a villain that really no one cares about. John Wayne hated High Noon because the protagonist was a coward. He was a coward who couldn't stand up and fight by himself without the help of the villagers to support him in his own weakness. Wayne and many other famous directors thought that a film hero, especially a western hero, is obligated to overcome his own weaknesses and fight alone against the forces of injustice and evil. The reason for this is that men must face their own problems and injustices in their own lives alone. If you are underpaid and you feel it necessary to confront your own boss for a higher wage you don't bring your wife, your buddies, or your dad into the office to make the case for you. You do it alone. 
I watched The Apartment, the great Billy Wilder film last night. Jack Lemmon is a superhero in that film and he doesn't throw a single punch. He fights for true love and magnomity. He fights the corporate machine. He Fights peer pressure. In the end however his fight is with himself. He has to come clean with who he is, and he does it mostly by deciding who he is not. He's not a playboy or a ladies man though there is tremoundous cultural pressure to be so. He is not a corporate climber though that ethic was instilled into him. He falls in love with a girl who loves someone else. That someone else is a man of power who he fears but doesn't respect. In his fight he loses his job, his true love and his apartment. Yet he gains his self respect. He becomes a ""true man"" not what culture has decided a man is. Of course being a true code hero, he does get the girl in the end. He does this by transforming her as well. She sees the hero in him which opens her eyes to her own shortcomings and bad decisions. That is what a hero does. There is nothing transformative about these comic book films. Maybe there was in the begging of all this. There are not any character arcs or growth. I propose that you are not even entertained by these films. So to me these superhero movies all lack one thing.
A hero.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The proof is in the bland story, wasted characters, an extremely long film where the introduction of the heroes is unnecessary, the dramatic conflicts are clumsy and insipid, the relationship between the characters is pathetic and the villain (with a great actor behind) hardly even navigate within the general mediocrity. In technical terms, it's good, but a film is essentially entertainment and surprise, and in this case, both are conspicuous by their absence. It is a mediocre film, with characters well below their potential. Leaving Darkseid out was a blunder. Bad film.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I have been reading the reviews most people leave and I am left wondering if they watch the movie at all. If the movie didn't flow well with previous movies that is because bat v sup is a dumpster fire that this movie was trying to put out. The graphics weren't bad and it wasn't there fault that Superman's upper lip was weird. See he was contractually obligated to keep the mustache so they had to match a CGI face to a real one which is really really hard.The villain of the story on the hand wasn't so great, but lets be real. The Chitauri in the avengers was pretty lame. Way worse than these. Loki is far better then stephenwolf, but even then we are talking apples and oranges. They aren't comparable. The movie was good well done. With developed characters, and reasonable reactions. It was consistent with itself. This has been the first DC movie to impress me. Keep it up DC and do the comics I loved justice! :D","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

A lot of people have the same opinion because there were some problems between the direction of the movie and the producers, something that created some plot holes and misunderstandings. The interpretations of both Ben Affleck who played as Batman / Bruce Wayne and Gal Gadot who played as Wonder Woman / Diana Prince were very good but not enough to save this movie. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Henry Cavill's who played as Superman / Clark Kent. Finally, I have to say that ""Justice League"" is an average movie that ruined its potential of becoming a great movie.","2 out of 28 found this helpful.

Justice League is not awful by any stretch. I have complaints, but to hear it from every blogger with an axe to grind, you'd think it was the worst movie ever. It's not.It has a fantastic cast. The story, though not wholy original, more than sufficed. The action sequences are very engaging. And it ends on a note that makes me want more, which I think was the objective, yes?Now to the less than great. You can most definitely tell there are two director's hands in there.

My biggest worry going into it was:
""Oh no, they've got to introduced three new characters, a new villain, revive Superman, beat a villain, and be a good movie - all at once.""Fortunately, the introduction of the The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg were all great. They didn't feel forced, they weren't introductions like ""Suicide Squad,"" they were great. Along with that, the interactions between the characters of the Justice League worked really well also.There was more comedy in this film, much like ""Suicide Squad,"" except this was actually funny.The thing I didn't enjoy as much was the plot. Steppenwolf wasn't an awful villain, he just wasn't a major villain. Considering the fact that the film was supposed to setup Darkseid and actually use him as the main villain, you can kind of see what we're missing here.And it's kind of unfortunate. After the great film that was ""Wonder Woman,"" we were all expecting a great ""Justice League.""

Although this might not have affected the box office collections of the Justice league much, it made sure that this movie didn't break any records. I am writing this review after having read most of the reviews and quite few many days into the release date. Just like Batman V Superman, I liked Justice League and in fact I loved it.After the stupendous success of Wonder Woman in July, there was quite a decent platform set for the release of the Justice League. The Batman v Superman movie set the foundation for the collaboration of heroes and Justice League brings the concept of heroes teaming up (or should we say forming a league), to save the world. Batman leads and brings new recruits into the team in his own style with the help of Wonderwoman. And by now most of you would have already known how Superman gets involved. This movie is has a very tight running time and it wastes no time in setting its agenda straight. The villain is introduced at the beginning followed by the new heroes and then they all involve in an epic battle. The visual effects have a slightly different tone from a regular superhero film, but I am not complaining. The scenes involving flash are a treat to watch. The film has many moments of good humour and sarcasm compared to previous Snyder's movies (did it have something to do with the fact that Joss Whedon partly directed the movie?). The short duration of the movie left me wanting for more.The movie does lack a strong or rather well defined role of the antagonist. Comic book fans can probably give a better review of the SteppenWolf character voiced by Ciaran Hinds. Portraying an aging and least dominating Batman suits Ben Affleck like fish to water. Although Jason Momoa doesn't have much to speak as Aquaman, he surely ups the humour level of the film which is already set at a higher bar by Barry Allen aka Flash played by Ezra Miller. Ray Fisher has a decent debut as Cyborg, but the role doesn't test much of his acting skills. Gal Gadot is classy as always with her portrayal of Wonderwoman. Other top billed actors like Amy Adams, Diane Lane, J.K Simmons and Amber Heard doesn't have much to do. However, they would probably be playing vital roles in upcoming individual Batman and Aquaman movies.At some point one might feel like DC may have tried to play catch up with MARVEL in a hurry as far as building a cinematic universe is concerned. I would have loved to see separate movies for all of these characters before the Justice League which would have given this a very good build up. This doesn't affect the fact that Justice League is still one of the best action movies of 2017 and is a very good watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","A movie you've already seen a thousand times.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4014875/?ref_=tt_urv","MaxHuskins","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54854525/?ref_=tt_urv","27 December 2017","First of all, full disclaimer: I'm not a fan of DC, I have not seen BvS but I have seen Wonder Woman and Suicide Squad.I honestly don't even know where to being with this mediocre overly generic movie. It wasn't good, nor was it bad. It was ""meh"". The best way I can describe is by calling it the ""Spy Kids 3"" of this film era. Kids love it, mildly entertaining with lots of crapy CGI that already looks dated.The biggest problem at work here is the genre itself, we as viewers are so fatigued by the same superhero films that I'm gonna gouge my eyes out if I see a few more of these. We've got our boring two-dimensional heroes, going on a pointless quest against an evil CGI space dude who is out to destroy the whole world (or even galaxy) with his generic army of minions who make a big CGI explosion/thingy that the heroes fight at the end at night with a bunch of bright (usually red) CG particles (lava, goo, magic, the source of life in the universe, you name it).This movie has some of the weirdest pacings I've ever seen, it's confusing, one second we're here, next second we're there. The editing maybe even worse, often the jarring cuts take you out of the scene/movie and make absolutely no sense. I think this partially has to do with the fact that like 90% of this movie is CGI, all the camera angles are whack, actors aren't in the same room and the set is just a green screen, I mean what can you expect? I honestly don't understand this masturbatory overuse of CGI, why can't you drive to a damn cornfield and shoot on location? Why does it have to be all made inside a WB warehouse? Yes, I'm gonna complain about CG a LOT because it doesn't need to be that. DO we really need to shove dust/ambient fire/water particles into every scene? I understand that it's not supposed to be realistic but at a certain point, your brain hits a sensory overload and just zones out during the most crucial moments. It's basically like showing a baby a clip of a bunch of nonsense bright colours and they'll watch it for hours. This movie honestly feels like someone put together cut scenes from a video game.Besides the bad camera work and editing, we have my personal favourite - awful dialogue. 
Most of the jokes are completely flat with a few exceptions that are failed by the absolute worst delivery in the world (as well as the awkward cuts that I mentioned earlier.) Also, I don't think I've ever heard humans talk like they do in this movie. One of my favourite dialogues in the movie was (Mild spoilers that aren't really spoilers because everyone knows this): 
Superman and his GF finally reunite, she says to a shirtless Superman ""You smell nice"", to which he replies ""Did I not before?"" proceeded by an awkward silence in a wide shot and they begin holding hands. What the hell, who does that?! 
Another favourite stupid moment of mine was when Aquaman skates on a dead body similar to the infamous Legolas skating scene in LOTR.The whole thing feels like a fever dream of an Artificial Intelligence machine generating a movie that hits every demand of the studio executives.I would give this movie 6.5 out of 10, however, I have a special personal rule for point deduction - bad Russian. Yup, this movie just like every other one has horrible Russian accents, balalaika music in the background when showing us the unimportant Russian characters AND they drive a truck! There are no flatbed trucks in Russia. Do your god damn research Hollywood. Is it really that freaking hard to find 3 people who speak fluent Russian?Overall, I expected nothing and I came out of the theatre with nothing. I didn't waste my time nor did I really enjoy it. It was kind of like I went to sleep for two hours and then woke up from a weird dream. To summarize, we had an unemotional soundtrack, bad pacing, flat acting, horrible dialogue and atrocious editing. With a couple of cool scenes.Justice League leaves me with one question and one question only: Why does Superman leave chem-trails behind? HahaMy verdict - Instantly Forgettable 5.5/10P/SWith all of that said I would like to acknowledge all the VFX teams because certain shots did look pretty damn incredible. VFX artists are some of the most overworked, underpaid, abused and unappreciated team members of a movie production, but without them, this movie wouldn't be possible. You guys did a good job.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Aquaman, Batman, Robin, Superman, and Wonder Woman. (Turns out Apache Chief, not a core member. I know, I know my youth is ruined.) Of course, Superman is pushing up the Kryptonite and Robin does not um exist so we need two additional recruits and Justice League chooses Cyborg and the Flash. Not the worst choices on paper mind you. Hawkman and Hawkgirl might be hard to put into live action, Green Lantern isn't allowed to appear in another film till hell freezes over, and nobody remembers Black Vulcan.Originally this was supposed to be a direct sequel to Batman vs. Superman but that film Green Lanterened all over the screen so rewrites galore happened in conjunction with the director leaving due to family tragedy and you have all the earmarks for yet another disaster in the DCU. It isn't that bad overall. Which is strange because I really think it destroyed the Justice League forever. I will attempt and fail to explain below.The Players:Superman: I know he is dead but therein lies the rub. Zack Snyder's Superman was awful. He was awful in Man of Steel and he was awful in Batman vs. Superman. Others have put out extensive essays and youtube video series explaining why Snyder's Superman was so awful. It is practically it's own cottage industry now. This isn't nostalgia for Reeves Superman mind you, I remember Superman 3 and 4. My rose-colored glasses are not on here. Snyder's read on the character is just wrong. He writes Superman as a creepy alien who views humans as insects and that is not the character. It is a character just not one called Superman.Justice League finally realizes this and tries to change the history to make dead Superman a much nicer guy than the live one ever was. There is some truth in television here as often celebrities that were the worst people in the world are suddenly lionized in death. Michael Jackson was a creepy child molester the day before he dies and was nothing but a lost child saint the day after. That said this is clearly a late in the game rewrite and it shows. Making Snyder's Superman a little schizophrenic and well as his previous sociopathic tendencies.There hasn't been a good Superman movie since Superman 2 and this film doesn't change that. One thing that has changed is people are no longer blaming actor Henry Cavill. After his delightful turn in Mission Impossible Fallout, he is fully redeemed. As long as he sports a mustache.Batman: Ben Affleck plays Bruce Wayne/Batman as a fat alcoholic man in a bat suit going through the motions cause he really doesn't know what else to do. It is a great characterization that deserves a much better movie. More importantly, it deserves a movie without distractions like other superheroes or even really supervillains. Certainly not CGI space villains. I say chuck it all a do a proper version of The Dark Knight Returns set in the eighties. Affleck's Batman would be perfect for that. (Yes I know that Batman vs Superman was basically a modern version of that so I am simply wrong here. He just seems like he would be great. Maybe he can get his back broken by Bane instead? I am spitballing here). Affleck's Batman just seems the wrong kind of Batman to be putting together a Justice League. Nice suit though (His business suits are really spot on in this.)Wonder Woman: If there was ever a woman that needed to upgrade the men she hung out with this is her. She is very good. She clearly belongs with a better class of hero. Perhaps The Tick or Booster Gold.Aquaman: I mean this guy is a joke. C'mon. His scenes in Aqualand or whatever in this movie are four guys and Amanda Heard in a fish tank. Seriously this is the next movie from DC. This ridiculous of such a movie was a plot point for an entire season of Entourage. I doubt they will ever make an Aquaman stand-alone film let alone release it. Oh, it already came out? It is the highest grossing DC film of all time with over a billion dollars of box office? I like Jason Momoa and you can really see in this film he is a breakout star.Cyborg: I learn so much for writing these reviews. Did you know Black Vulcan was a scab? It's true. The actual African American electricity based superhero Black Lightning could not appear on superfriends due to a contract dispute so Black Vulcan was hired as his non-union replacement (I am really not making any of this up). In the realm of African American superheroes, the DC universe does not have that deep a bench. Plus the kids love Cyborg due to his membership in the Teen Titans. Too bad he is so bloody dull in Justice League. Of course, there are worse things to be than dull which brings us to...The Flash: Hey kids lets hire an annoying millennial stereotype (Ezra Miller) to play an annoying millennial stereotype. That could not possibly ever get old. Good news Gleek you are no longer the most annoying member of the Superfriends.Many people blamed latecomer Joss Whedon but The Flash's character was established long before he took the helm. I have a feeling this is a disaster by committee job. The idea of a standalone film with this character is downright exausting.Steppenwolf: While Flash may be the most irritating Justice League character he isn't even the worst character in this film. That would be our CGI baddie Steppenwolf. Why do you need CGI for a tall guy with horns? I do not know. Does he have an army of non-descript CGI mooks? You betcha, Is he seeking some glowing things hidden on earth so he can take over the universe? Darn tootin. Steppenwolf is after the three Mother Boxes. (Not Martha Boxes which would actually be kind of funny). The Mother Boxes are hidden in Lesbian Island, Aqualand and at Cyborg's dad's house. Hidden may be the wrong term to use here now I think about it.Is Steppenwolf the worst Superhero villain ever to appear on the screen? No. He is the third worst villain to appear on screen tied with that CGI Masters of the Universe reject at the end of Suicide Squad. The second worst villain is the Sun Superman Luthor creates in Superman IV who could be defeated by evening or perhaps a heavy cloud cover and the worst is the villain from Thor: The Dark World whose greatest ability is that no one can remember who he was even if they had just seen the film. (Magic Dark Elf I want to say.)Steppenwolf is a non-event. Yes, I read his Wikipedia page and apparently, he is a New God created by Jack Kirby and Darkseid's uncle but none of that makes the screen. He isn't scary, he isn't funny and he doesn't have a decent theme song. I mean at least have Born to be Wild or Magic Carpet Ride play when he attacks.In Conclusion: Bill Mahr attacked geekdom in general when Stan Lee died. It was tasteless and inflammatory but he did have a point or two. I can't help think that walking through his HBO offices every morning he saw Steppenwolf grabbing the glowing Mother Boxes on the monitors there and it painted his world view. He blamed Stan Lee but once again it was Jack Kirby that deserved the blame.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was hoping for something that was cohesive, something that rocked the house like Wonder Woman...and it didn't happen. However, all is not lost. While the film had flaws--big ones--it was enjoyable enough for me to give it this reasonably high rating.First, the bad news. The film is disjointed, as badly cut up as BvS's theatrical feature was. You can blame this on the writers or the studio executives or both; it doesn't matter. What matters is that the film looked like patchwork. I haven't seen the extended version--assuming that rumor is true--but it might be an improvement...might.Point two is the lack of individual character buildup. I think most people know the origin stories of Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg, but here, they're reduced to a few lines of exposition to explain how they got that way. While Marvel did the smart thing, that being giving their superheroes their own origin flicks and then bringing all the heroes together, DC seems hellbent on just tossing in their heroes all at once. Bad strategy, IMO, and while it won't kill the franchise, it will limit them unless they change their thinking.Now, to the good parts. The acting is excellent. Affleck is Batman and does a very credible Bruce Wayne, Jason Momoa reminds me of Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage--""ooooh, yeaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!""--and Ezra Miller as Flash is appropriately geeky/goofy. All Gal Gadot has to do is to smile, but she gets her part. She KNOWS what being Wonder Woman is all about. At turns tough and sweet, she IS Wonder Woman. Ray Fisher as Cyborg is quietly effective, and really, there are no slackers, acting-wise or relating-wise. They play off each other perfectly. Ciaran Hinds as the voice of Steppenwolf is also good. His character has always been sort of two-dimensional, but Hinds does well with it.The action sequences are dynamic, and the music (by Danny Elfman) is effectively retro, with riffs from the Flash TV series and also the Batman movies of the late '80's and early '90's. All of these good points were enough for me to give the film a rating of seven. I know the DC faithful were/are disappointed. I was, too, but the fun factor was there for me, as well as the thrill of seeing the superheroes of my youth team up. I can only hope JL 2 will be worth it. Time will tell.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Man of Steel was awful and the same goes for Batman vs Superman.I decided to give this a shot after finding it had been edited by Joss Whedon so went to the cinema to see it today.All I can say is, two different people got up and left half way through. The first time I have ever seen this happen.The film was just so run of the mill and soulless. There is no other way to describe it. The film had no spark to it.The soundtrack for the film had short pieces of Tim Burtons batman movie and Richard Donners Superman. And all this made me do was realise this film is nowhere near as good as either.I honestly feel the fault of this lies squarely with Zack Snyder. He does not know how to make an interesting superhero movie. Give Joss Whedon the directors job for the sequel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I grew up surrounded by these heroes who first mesmerized me with their power, character and integrity, with Superman as the leader of the pack, he is always my number one superhero of all time, no matter what :).When i heard Justice League will be made a movie, I burst up with joy and anticipation of how excited it's gonna be, all I can think of the ""real"" scene of a fight, battle or drama from my childhood reappeared, I follow the instagram account, watch every trailers and somehow remember some of the dialogue.But when I can finally watch this movie, I almost fell asleep after the first half of it!! The story does not worth the hype and anticipation, the solo movies are far better than the mash up. The story simply made for kids, simple storyline with no element of surprise, no thrill, average comedy, unnecessary scenes (plain Russian family), even the special effect is not special at all.Good to see Superman is alive though, he can pull out the Superman we have and love from comics, but the others are plain, poor Wonder Woman, she has no enough stage for her, lousy Batman, he can have more limelight, boring Cyborg. Aquaman and Flash are OK anyway, they are like the ice cream in the dessert for this pack.I sadly have to give 5/10 for this movie, hurts..... :(. And what a waste for a 300MM movies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Direction: 1.00
Pace: 0.75
Acting: 1.25
Enjoyment: 1.00TOTAL: 4.75 out of 10.00The one thing DC should have done is let their band of talented writers loose with the movies. These guys know the heroes inside and out, so you wouldn't get the travesty that Chris Terrio and Zack Snyder give us.After destroying Clark Kent's childhood and turning him into a killer instead of the Boy Scout, he should be, we now have new basic origin stories for The Flash and Cyborg. Maybe they'll get their own bleak overhaul in their movies, though I hope not. To be honest, the story isn't too terrible; it's just that our heroes' personas are wrong, except for Batman and Wonder Woman, that is. Barry Allan has become the squirrel from Over The Hedge; just keep him off the caffeine. But it's the poor old Cyborg I felt sorry for; the guy is like your computer, just there when you need it. I'm amazed the boys in the gang didn't have him constantly streaming PornHub. Even the villain of the picture, Mr CGI face, had more personality, though little more than the Hulk's ""SMASH!"" nature. To be honest, the story only appeared to be there to weld together the CGI segments, and that was probably the reason for the narrative's simplicity. Once again, the comic book writers do better than this on their worst days.As for the direction, it can be broken into two sections, real and animated. The real is okay. Snyder has a good eye for composition and varied camerawork, but everything is too damned dismal. He overuses his grey filters to the extreme. Is there any colour in Snyderville? Even when he chooses the motor vehicles, they're either silver or black. Superman and Wonder Woman should be beacons of Justice. Their outfits should be bold and challenging. The colour is so toned down that you have to look closely to make out the red, white, blue, and gold. However, I do have to give him respect for steady cam fight and action scenes. Though in Justice League, these are mostly CGI'd to death.And onto the animated, oh my God, the CGI is terrible. It's not too bad when characters are displayed far from the screen. However, when they get up close, which is the case with Steppenwolf, they had me longing for my Nintendo. Another bad thing was the scope. You see everything clearly, no matter if it's two feet away or three miles distant. The animators should have thought, focus. By making everything clear, they give the segments an unrealistic feel, which is horrendous as this is a real-life action film. Had it been full CGI, the unrealistic vision would have been with the viewer from the start, allowing them to adapt. But having two dissimilar styles draws the viewer out of the story.The main thing wrong with the film is the pacing. It's too reliant on the action, and these fight scenes, though cleverly constructed and superbly cut, do become boring pretty damned fast. In the end battle, I wasn't rooting for either the heroes or the villain; I was checking my e-mails. That is how bored I was with it all.The cast is perfect in their performances. I especially liked Ben Affleck's Batman; he seems to be getting stronger with each picture. And Jeremy Irons gives good soldiering-cum-butlering as Alfred.Justice League is better than Man Of Steel and Batman V Superman but hasn't reached the heights of the Marvel films. So I would happily recommend any of Marvel's features before you watch this. But then you'd probably be as disappointed as I am since I'm a DC fan first and foremost. Worth a watch, should there be nowt else on.Please feel free to visit my The Final Frontier and Holding Out For A Hero lists to see where I ranked Justice League.Take Care & Stay Well.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was definitely good but certainly not a ground- breaking super-hero flick.Batman is building a team comprising of Wonder Woman, The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman as the world is threatened by new enemy,Steppenwolf, who plans an attack on Earth by unraveling three mysterious Mother Boxes.Together, Justice League with new members must fight the evil to save the mankind. It would have been really challenging for Zack Snyder, director of 300, Man Of Steel, Batman vs Superman, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a pretty good job and turned this comic-story into an enjoyable fun ride. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half boast of some path-breaking action sequences. The introduction of each superhero is astounding. 2nd half loses the steam with so many stories interwoven under the same umbrella. Couple of scenes that easily stands out - return of Superman, Flash getting a surprise of his life when he realizes that Superman is faster than him. Climax fighting is well executed. Screenplay is good along with punching dialogues. Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast. Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline and lovely performances. It definitely misses the mark when you sky-high expectations but do you even care when you have the privileged to watch all the superheroes under the same umbrella. GOOD 3/5","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The action is all fairly good and exciting, but everything in-between is paced poorly, it certainly feels like it was re-written, re-shot, and then re-edited to fit under two hours by some stupid studioheads.I've seen a lot of complaints about the CGI, and personally, outside of Cyborg and Steppenwolf, I don't really agree with them. It's about the same quality as most recent Marvel movies, along with the same generic copy/paste bad guys.The whole deal with Superman's moustache removal really isn't too noticeable outside of a couple scenes. I feel if we didn't know it had happened, we might not have noticed anything was up.The plot isn't very interesting at all but I suppose it does work exactly as intended for our heroes to join up. The character introductions are nice, and I do really like the actors that have been chosen for each role,with Erza Miller being the highlight. He is mostly around for comic relief but I am really looking forward to seeing him in a standalone movie.. whenever that comes to fruition.There isn't really anything worth seeing again outside of a particular scene involving Superman, and overall I don't hate it, but I don't love it. I think most of the issues it has can be attributed to the fact Joss Whedon took over during post-production.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

His follow up of Batman V Superman was a giant mess, saved somewhat by the extended cut of the film. He had to leave JL during production due to a family tragedy. Joss Whedon (Avengers/Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was tasked with taking over. What happened next was two conflicting visions of the DCU and studio interference. The film became a mess in terms of story, visual effects and tone.It's a well known fact that some Warner Bros executives pushed for the film to be released, despite visual effects being substandard, so that they could earn money bonuses within a set time frame. This resulted in the butchering of Superman's face. They had to CGI out the actor's moustache and the results were laughable. Superman looks like Desperate Dan throughout the film. It's embarrassing on so many levels. Superman is an icon and this film has single handedly destroyed the image of this inspiring comic book god.The villain is weak and generic, with nothing appealing about him at all. Ben Affleck's Batman is underwhelming and the rest of the heroes are pale shadows of what they could have been.DC/WB will continue this current DCU but with less dedicated fans due to this disaster of a film. They should have left Superman six feet under.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Writing-- I think the writers fail to effectively bring the individual super heroes and respective story lines together in this one-- not so much a product of poor writing as it is a byproduct of having too much material with which to work. In particular, the current Superman and Batman, and to a lesser extent Wonder Woman, have very extensive backgrounds and story lines that have been intricately chronicled in several films. Similar to the Avengers, the ability to write all these respective stories into one film and to effectively incorporate such an overwhelmingly large amount of material into one cohesive script is asking a lot. It appears that the writers of Justice League struggle with this daunting task as it feels like the material from different movies is thrown together, coming off disconnected and distracting. CGI-- While Zack Snyder's style is uniquely tied to CGI and offers beautifully mesmerizing experiences, it appears that this movie just got too comfortable with digit effects. It goes without saying that Superman's CGI face was extremely confusing and distracting. The Snyder-esk action scenes are already heavily dependent on special effects, but even these scenes seemed too animated as they were quick-framed and tough to follow. The slow-motion Flash and Superman portions were the best because they provided more detail and time to digest.Finally, the dialogue was just not quite there. A lot of short, one-liner type exchanges lacking substance and emotion. Not sure if this movie suffered from budget issues or other production-related problems, but it definitely came across as a very AVERAGE comic book movie on my end.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

improvement on Batman Vs Superman Vs Common Sense, however, its a step
backwards from the very good Wonder Woman stand alone film. The problems are numerous; the most obvious being the films troubled
production seeping into the final product. The film feels rushed and
lacks polish and even Joss Whedon's magic touch has deserted him here.
The light relief has been crow barred in and is forced rather than
natural. Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot sleep walk through the events of the
film and the more interesting characters of Cyborg and The Flash are
left on the sidelines without exploration. And I wouldn't say it to his
face but the less said about Jason Momoa's Aquaman the better (good
luck with the stand alone film - you're going to need it!).Despite this there are small ledges of hope for the executives of
Warner Bros to cling on to. As already mentioned Cyborg and The Flash
might have traction and the failure of this film at the box office
might force said executives to re-think the whole DC universe to the
benefit of everyone. I can't conclude this review without mentioning the villain.
Steppenwolf (who I hear you ask?) is a lesson in how not to do CG
characters and the ending is ridiculous and we are left pondering the
question; what is the point of Justice League?What is the point indeed?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The pacing is weird, backstories are cut out of some characters, plotholes, etc. It isn't a completely awful movie but it is bad. I went into it finally hoping to see a decent rendition of the Justice League finally that isn't animated (not that anything is wrong with the animations) and was sorely disappointed. The Snyder cut pretty much revises most of my complains and while it still isn't what I would call a perfect movie, it is significantly better than this. It gives characters like the Flash a more filled out backstory and introduces characters like Iris, fixes the pacing (albiet the movie is 4 hours long), and sets up characters like Aquaman for his own movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

DC strikes our screens again, and following the death of Superman, chaos is gaining the upper hand and Bruce Wayne aka Batman (Ben Affleck) starts to assemble a team to take on the newest threat. DC films are darker and more gritty than Marvel and while this may not suit everyone, I find them quite refreshing. This particular offering was definitely a film of two parts.....the first being laid out to give a back story to each of our superheroes and the latter half focusing on the team working together. All of our characters have issues and it's those issues that make them pull together and conquer their adversaries. I think my favourite character had to be Barry Allen aka The Flash played by Ezra Miller. Here is a lad who is very uncomfortable with his powers, he's not sure of his position in the team yet he suits up and jumps into the fray with no real clue as why he's there. You can really see him grow by the end of the film and assert himself as a real player and not just some tag along fly by night. An extremely watchable film which I'm sure will be appreciated by all ages.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I have many unpopular opinions so watched this movie to see if I thought it was as bad as everyone says. Spoilers, but it was. I don't understand why it was so hard for Warner Bros just to wait until Zack Snyder recovered so he could make his movie. Although Zack is credited as the director in the opening titles, this is clearly Joss Whedon's movie. It is completely out of place in the trilogy, and focuses more on bad jokes (imitating the hugely successful MCU) than meaningful subtext shown in 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman v Superman'. Steppenwolf brings the movie down further than I thought I would - a completely meaningless villain who says stupid comic book villain things like ""This world will fall"" and ""You will all suffer"". The Flash, for being a hero with super speed, really drags the likes of Batman and Wonder Woman (who were done okay in this movie) down to the ground. I don't even have the energy to talk about Superman's portrayal. This whole movie is just an attempt to recreate Marvel's charms, and fails miserably.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

DC comics tries to create their own superhero universe, like Marvel has done with their comic super heroes. Basics are ok in Justice League, but poor script and too many characters makes it too fuzzy and thin. With massive 300 million dollar budget viewer expect much more than this. Maybe too many actors with too big salary is reason for this. Some special effects feel quite poor unfortunately.DC comics should have use their resources to introduce us some less known super heroes like Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg with their own movies before they rush to dump them all in the same movie. Now there are simply too many stories to tell and focus does not have enough of room to breath. Jack Snyder's replacement with Joss Wheadon at the movies finishing, many screen writers and last but not least some re filming has made the movie too unfocused.Justice League is mediocre comic book superhero filming. We shall see how many flops like this DC comics can afford, before they hang Batman's and Superman's rope conclusively. Maybe DC comics should concentrate their own movies and leave Marvel's movies not to mimic.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So, this should have been the most important movie in the DC Extended Universe, it should have been something different, original and with charismatic and memorable characters.The plot is always the same, an evil mastermind wants to destroy the Earth and conquer the universe. I don't even want to criticize this, obviously if Hollywood keeps doing movie with a story seen already many times, it means that is a formula that works and sells. So let's take a quick look to characters, I really liked Batman and Wonder Woman, for me the best two heroes in the Justice League. Flash was just okay, he just add a little bit of comedy in the movie, but that's all, he never stands out. Comprehensible, being his first ride as a superhero, but honestly you forget him easily. Cyborg is the guy that is taking care of all the technological stuff, basically a war machine. Aquaman, a useless character, the final battle is in fact located in a complete dried location, so he cannot even use his powers at best. And last, but not least Superman, that will come back, just to be in some filler scenes and in the last 5 minutes of the final battle and only because all the other heroes were struggling.In the end I've understood that everything could have been solved by Superman alone, so all the other characters are basically useless. Honestly from this movie I was really expecting more: I am a fan of the DC Extended Universe but, in this case I just watched the average superhero movie pumped with CGI and very few practical stunts scenes. A big step back from ""Batman V. Superman"", which started to give me hope about this cinematic universe.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Too much effect for too simple and basic story (the same as always)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4044780/?ref_=tt_urv","DaniHM","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur42179074/?ref_=tt_urv","26 January 2018","It is very likely that the movie Justice League is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. Two hours of absolute scandal, a storm of special effects that sometimes even feels too much. Besides the movie does not have a single drama scene that lasts more than two minutes and I really feel the director did this to avoid the viewer from falling asleep. When other drama sci-fi like Blade Runner 2049, Ex Machina or Minority Report have a silent, we wonder, we believe, we brainstorm, we try to get what's going on and what is about to happen, but in Justice League it just makes the lack of this movie more evident, lack of any drama beyond 'let's save the world for one last time (again)'. The issue here is that director Zach Snyder seems to have given up on this and still rely on the fandom to score the box office promised to the producers. DC Comics was looking for its Avengers series, and I believe they have done a movie that needed to be done, but it is sad that the only thing this has done is to fill a blank space. The story begins with an astonishing Gal Gadot, pushing again for women in superhero movies, saving people from being killed by an armed bank robber. I wasn't expecting that. Then Ben Affleck, who I don't know why he is still Batman, tries to play the cool but serious guy with a Jeremy Irons that just seems too much for Alfred, an old and smart butler, please don't do this to Irons again. Then, this unnecessary fit, tattooed and mentally disturbed Aquaman plays the 'get out of my lawn' role, until, of course, he doesn't. It is great they added 'The Flash', because it is really the only light in this, he is the only unpredictable character. Maybe because we have not seen him in ten other movies. Oh, and they bring Superman back to life, perhaps to make another three movies of him saving humanity, we'll see. I am not going to go over the plot because it is quite easy to guess and it will be unlikely to fail. Spectacular visual effects need to have a bit of a story and this feels like the same but in a different container. And this is really upsetting me because it is becoming a popular practice.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

You can see how Joss Whedon transformed this movie from a Zack Snyder hackfest to something actually watchable. I thought this was much better than Thor Ragnarok. My only qualm lay with Steppenwulf, one of the worst villains of all-time, absolutely boring. His CGI rendering is totally ugly too. You can see that this film was edited quite a bit, but it's definitely a positive improvement from what we've seen before. Just replace Batman, try again with Whedon completely in control and see what happens.I don't even blame the failure of Avengers 2 on Whedon. It was Disney that interfered and ruined it.Well done. Improve Wonder Woman too, maybe hire a real director?","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

But even taking that into account when watching it, I could not enjoy the film. On the technical side the CG is off, it doesn't feel immersive at all. To be fair, I avoided all media before watching the film and I didn't notice Henry Cavill's (Superman) mouth was CG. The colour pallet looks like someone has drink half a litre of Fanta and thrown up the screen it's that Orange. The plot is just disappointing, and the characters fell flat. Batman especially felt like the child the group, who had to babysat instead of a badass Superhero. I was overall disappointed. On one last note, the posters and promotional material for this film looks awful and tacky.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The CGI is top notch, but with very few exceptions overall just lacks originality, just like the musical score, which isn't anything special. It's same old, same old Hollywood and it definitely is getting old. Story-wise, there isn't much to Justice League either; a pretty generic ""defeat the villain"" story, with a pretty generic villain.The heroes are mostly known to us and they are just doing what they do in order to move on to the next scene. The new heroes hardly add anything new and interesting to the table and seem to be on screen only to get us warm and ready for some spin-off movies. How lame.All in all, It's a very uninspiring movie that could be so grand. 5/10, and I'm being generous there.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With now the extended universe taking place with only 4 films established, it has finally happened and was it worth the long long wait? We say it was, but if you were expecting more of an epic piece of film that sticks close to the original material you may be left out or just wanting more.With what it gets right, it's the chemistry between the heroes that form the league. With mixes of wit, epic solo moments and dialogue from the animated series (it kinda felt like it at times so nostalgia kicked in) they made like a likable team. The acting range from the cast were all great and there was no cheesy moments, in which speaking the tone of the film is certainly not dark or gloomy as BVS but it does try to convey a message of hope for the franchise (and possibly fix those mistakes that critics had signalled out). The scale of the action is great and the climax was decent, the CGI effects were great and didn't seem as bad as some critics have said to be and the humour was good. The bad though is basically that the story itself is thin with no major room for character development to expand further (though some small amounts were included), the villain is a 'muah ha ha' kind of baddie with little purpose but no backstory (though it as said in the film he serves for a much greater foe that will surface in a sequel). Overall, while it's certainly worth a ticket price to watch on the big screen we can't help but feel there could have been so much more if the studios haven't rushed it and let it build up from the solo films I'd they had stuck to that schedule. But then again, Zack Snyder had family issues and reshoots took place by Josh Weldon so you may see or wonder how the tone and running time were affected. Though it's fun, action packed and well acted, JL is a good movie but it's not something that is picture perfect (neither are the Marvel films at the moment) as it has its flaws, but now this should be the turning point for the DCEU to bring out more solo films and freedom of creativity and focus on the team up on a longer scale to make it a worthy build up. 2.5/5 stars.

The reviews were bad so I had low expectations, but it's worst than I thought it will be. I have no more words to describe how hollow this movie is.

After four years and four movies of universe-building and origin stories, the heroes of Warner Bros.' DC Universe are finally brought together to face down a common foe and unite under the Justice League banner for the very first time on the big screen. Such an impressive roster of supers in a time when superhero mania is at its highest should have been a safe bet at the box-office, especially since Marvel's B-list characters like Ant-Man and Doctor Strange have been pulling in $500-600 million worldwide. How Justice League limped to just $700 million worldwide on the back of little to no fan anticipation speaks volumes about audience investment in this DC Universe. Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman won back some faith, but returning director Zack Snyder has learned nothing from the criticism and backlash Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice received.This is the same turgid, ugly and CGI-infested world started by Man of Steel, complete with one-note characters, headache-inducing fight scenes and plain bad storytelling. Yet, due to Snyder leaving the project in post-production as a result of tragic family circumstances, this makes up roughly half of the movie. The rest is purely Joss Whedon's input, after The Avengers' helmer was brought in to tighten up the film, re-write certain scenes, and take charge of the necessary re-shoots. Reports have surfaced recently that Snyder's rough cut was simply unwatchable, and sensing another critical panning, Warner Bros. simply cut their losses. Even the re-shoots were news worthy, as Henry Cavill, sporting an impressive moustache for his role in the upcoming Mission: Impossible - Fallout, was under contract to keep the facial hair, and so his upper lip would need to be altered with special effects. Naturally, the final film - which had a reported $300 million sunk into it - is a catastrophic mess.Superman is dead, and the world has sunk into a state of despair. After taking down an alien scout during one of his crime-busting jaunts, the ageing Bruce Wayne, aka Batman (Ben Affleck), senses that a bigger threat is coming to Earth. A rich man in a stealthy suit won't be enough to tackle such an enemy, so he proceeds to round up his new friend Diana Prince, aka Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), and hunt down those meta-humans glimpsed on Lex Luthor's laptop in Batman v Superman. There's Arthur Currie, aka Aquaman (Jason Momoa), the long-haired, tattooed Prince of Atlantis, Barry Allen aka The Flash (Ezra Miller), a motor-mouthed, incredibly annoying young man whose superpower is to run really, really fast, and finally Victor Stone, aka Cyborg (Ray Fisher), a half-human, half-machine hybrid who was created by his father with the help of a mysterious artefact called a Mother Box. There's two more boxes, and a giant alien warlord named Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciaran Hinds) hopes to snatch up all three.You can work out almost on a moment-by-moment basis which segments were filmed by Snyder and which by Whedon. One second, were in the dour, unattractive world of Snyder's mind, where every character broods and walks in slow-motion. The next, we get quippy Batman and bright colours. Justice League became such a farce in post-production that I get the feeling the heads at Warner Bros. simply wanted rid of it, as this simply isn't the finished version of 300 million dollars worth of input. Steppenwolf's appearance changes from one scene to the next, and Cavill's moustache-removal is one of the most unnerving things I've seen on film. ""We're not enough,"" claims Batman, and so Superman is dug up and brought back to life for the final act. Despite his weird CGI face, Cavill is actually one of the few pleasures of Justice League, as we finally get to see the hopeful, unstoppable Superman we have been waiting three movies to see. Sadly, his comeback is far too late to save the movie. For all its plot-holes, poorly-constructed action scenes and many other flaws, Justice League's biggest crime is that it is, inexplicably, just plain boring.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

First i will start with the pros. The film is overall very fun and exciting, especially when the heroes get together. There is also comedy for the first time in a while in the DC films, thanks to Ezra Millers Flash. The jokes and laughs in the film land for the most part, even though its kinda weird to see batman's serious character take part in the comedic scenes. The conversation and teamwork between the Justice League is extremely entertaining and cool as well. The developing bond between the league is something to behold and takes place mostly in the second half of the film, which is the half that shines the most. Just seeing my favorite comic book heroes getting together and fighting side by side is something that is amazing in itself and is satisfying in the end. The action is quite good and i wish that the film had more of it. the character development, while short lived, is still enough to give all the heroes equal spotlight and attention. Now to the Cons.The main villain was way to over hyped and ended up being your average run of the mill villain. Stepenwolf doesn't do much in the film. His boss fight is decent but was kinda short and didn't have any innovative challenges or twists for the league. The CGI was kinda off in a few scenes as well, and took me out of the film a bit. And the story wasn't that engaging and was forgettable.even though these cons are mostly major, i still enjoyed it. Overall this film was a fun time and was for the most part worth the wait.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not too dark not too funny, with heroes who do heroic things and fight epic enemies and battles. I stress this point because to me it seems that most critics don't understand what a super-hero film is about. The epic is not a clich√©' it's a requirement. That's why I hated Logan - I couldn't bare a pathetic Wolverine whining all the time. Regarding the characters: Most are good even a touch cool, and I think Aquaman and Wonder Woman rule in this one. Batman is also good, but I really didn't like the Flash. Barry Alan is a really annoying super-geek who can't find the sun to know where East is, and doesn't bother to ask. The villain Steppenwolf was criticized thoroughly and mostly for good reason. There could be many reasons for why he's come: revenge? atoning for previous failure? but we are left with just ""I love power"". Bottom line, it's a great movie, with great potential for the future. And a final good word for Cyborg. The character and the his future are both worth investigating and are well described.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film plays like a live action cartoon and some of the action scenes are incredible with amazing visuals.The film is about antagonist Steppenwolf sourcing three boxes scattered around the globe, that will give him absolute power. This might seem very cliched, and yes, it is. Steppenwolf itself is entirely a CGI creation. Blending CGI with reality is easy nowadays. Making it realistic is an entirely different matter. Although they did a great job with 'Justice League', the CGI overload renders most of the film completely unbelievable. There really is not an inch of reality during the action scenes. It is maybe a bit too fantastical an unrealistic.Just like Marvel's 'The Avengers' there are too many protagonists for one film, resulting in some of them having limited screen time. Superman, for example, doesn't show up until past the halfway mark. Batman carries the film, but then, this is not a Batman film. I therefore have mixed feelings about the film. If you're in the mood for action overload with CGI effects galore, then this is the perfect choice. If you're looking for something more substantial, well then, this might not be the wisest choice.Would I watch it again? Not sure.https://paulsmoviereviews.wordpress.com/2020/02/09/justice-league-2017/","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie proves how superior DC is to Marvel. Watching all of Marvels movies you begin to realize that all of them have the same issue, they are just confused about what they want to be and are rushed in order to hit big holidays. But DC does the exact opposite, they plan every scene down to the dust specs in it. And they don't feel the need to rush their movies just for profits they care about what the fans want. Personally Zack Snyder has made these movies excellent and him leaving has only made the movies worse. But beside that the acting in this movie is phenomenal. I have never seen a movie which has put so much effort into making sure the actors are in role before filming. And once they develop the strong connection between the characters and the audience they move into great action scenes. Once you see the action in this you realize how awful every other super hero movie has been. Over all I would recommend this to everyone I meet I hope everyone else does as well in a last ditch attempt to get Zack Snyder back into the DC universe.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For those who like comics, it's a bit offensive to our favourite heroes and for film fans, it's just a boring time.The entire experience felt rushed, almost as if someone was trying to catch up with another cinematic universe. Wonder woman had some prior development due to her film but at this point, Batman, Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman have no real character besides what they tell us in this one movie and it just makes it a bit of a trainwreck.
Visually it wasn't that impressive, the villain looks like a PS2 era boss, cyborg looks like he's still in a closed beta, and *that moustache*. Nothing really left me impressed. 
From what I can tell this movie mostly does adapt one specific comic (which I will leave out for the sake of spoilers) but both that comic and it's animated counterpart told the story far better while still having some fun with the characters. 
Overall, this certainly isn't the worst movie in the DC cinematic universe but it isn't the best either. Hopefully this is just a small stumble while they're still attempting to establish their individual identity and the movies inevitably coming out in the coming years will bring heroes to the silver screen in a far more faithful manner.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I will go as far as saying that it's my favourite DC film since TDK. I wasn't bored, didn't fall asleep, didn't ask is it almost over. If you haven't seen it go check it out. No award winner but definitely a great time and a huge step in the right direction for the franchise.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is no where near the number of movies developing the characters as Marvel had and in my opinion the JL line up chosen for the movie contained two characters I've only ever been Luke warm over. So coupled with some of the less than complimentary reviews I'd read about this movie my expectations weren't great. Thankfully I was very pleasantly surprised. I thought every aspect of this movie was excellent. Casting was definitely on point and I loved each actors portrayal of their characters and the interaction between them and look forward to future stand alone movies further exploring and developing these characters. I also thought the story was epic in its scope. To me it made sense that it would take a threat of the magnitude they faced to bring such independent and disparate heroes together for the first time so worked really well. The special effects were amazing and I loved the sound track and thought it appropriate. I can imagine someone that hasn't followed the DC universe prior to this movie could find it a bit overwhelming (most critics I'm guessing) since it covers a lot of ground but if you're a fan of the DCU I can't see why you wouldn't love this movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The world is in danger from a big CGI guy (Steppenwolf) and his faceless hoard (Parademons), so a team must be quickly formed. Very quickly.Justice League went through so much production hell its a miracle it works as well as it does. For those that don't know: the director Zack Snyder basically finished filming and had to pull out of editing due to personal tragedy. So Joss Whedon was brought in to edit and direct the reshoots. Not only are these two directors styles complete opposites but Warner Bros put a strict time limit on JL; it could not got over a 2 hour run time. Constricting and stifling any background or character backstories to a minimum. Cyborg (Ray Fisher) is titular to the films plot but little is really revealed... He's essentially a big USB. With this time limit every aspect feels rushed- the 'we can't stay in the same place for more than 2 minutes' kinda rush; which is where you can kinda see that JL was directed by 2 people. Scenes don't flow together well and feel more like a collection of clips. This might come as a bit of a surprise but the villain was not very good. Try as they might Steppenwolf was not an overly effective threat nor did he have much presence despite being built up as a menace.But putting the problems to one side Justice League has fun moments and shows promise, it's also an incredibly easy watch (that could mean it ends up forgettable however). The characters personas are good and, mostly, work together. I just wish I saw more of that and less ""quick we got fight that big dude"". The actors are good; Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) and Ben Affleck (Batman) are on mark and still super enjoyable. The new characters, although underdeveloped still showed their potential. And Henry Cavill has given his best portrayal of Superman yet. Though during the reshoots Cavill was filming Misson Impossible and had a mustache which needed to be edited out off JL, which is noticeable at times. Nothing severe but you can tell that's not a real upper lip.Justice League has some story and pacing issues but nonetheless this is definitely a step in the right direction for the franchise which hopefully carrys forward. It would've been nice to see several other films prior to this to set things up a bit better. And Warner Bros definitely need to take a step back; thus far all major issues with the DC cinematic universe can be traced back to the executives.I give Justice League a C+","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first scene of this movie was horrible. They did try to keep the movie fast-paced and compact but what the hell did I just watch. It feels like a softcore version or a parody, given the gritty feel of Batman V Superman. The background score was really bad and made me miss Junkie XL's music. The music at times sounded like ""The Avengers"" for sure. Computer Generated Imagery was horrible as the film's prime antagonist Steppenwolf, looked like a love child of Mutated Malekith and Jar Jar Binks. There were fair amount of explosive scenes which looked somewhat good but felt very ""Un-Snydery"" I don't know why it felt like that. ""I would like to see an Extended Cut"" as Zack always loves to make a Director's Cut . And about the 3D, it was okayish. Final verdict : I found the movie to be very less entertaining and also felt like I've just flushed 150 bucks down the toilet. For me, MOS>BVS>WW>JL.

Being hyped since years before it's released and with further expectations after the release of Wonder Wonder (which was great), Justice League doesn't deliver and feels forced, dull and just not worth the wait.Weak and uninteresting plot and an unmotivated and forced villain. Some cheesy and off dialogue. The chemistry between the lead characters didn't seem right: Ben Affleck's Batman was dull, Superman (who isn't in it much) is a boring character, Wonder Woman was easily the highlight, Flash was awfully annoying, Aquaman was decent but wasted in screen presence, and Cyborg is a pointless character (we barely know much about him).Overall this film didn't have a great tone, some decent action scenes but off looking CGI.

Sure there were a few raised eyebrows throughout and some beats being skipped but I suspect that was more to do with studio meddling in the cut than anything. I really appreciated the dynamic of the characters and actually felt like there wasn't the same sense of inevitability about the team winning like in the Avengers. I particularly enjoyed Superman and Cyborg's arcs and would have loved to have seen more about their stories in the plot development. Aquaman was great but I felt like they were trying too hard to take him away from his stigmatised appearance in the comics. Some of his one-liners were a little cringeworthy and unnecessary given how his actions proved his worth time and again. I was also pleased that, in spite of their much more sexualised outfits compared to the WW outing, the Amazons and WW herself were portrayed with the same dignity as before. The Flash was great, I thought they nailed him well and Ezra Miller did a far better version of him than Grant Gustin. I sincerely hope that another JL is rolled out and the story arc is continued.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The pacing in the first half is at a minimum ""earnest,"" seeking to establish the backstory so that the rest of the movie can occur. The villain is one dimensional, with a motive of ""destroy things"" and power that's never reaaaaalllllyyyy fully defined. However, this is a fun and rewatchable movie. The CGI (moustache CGI) is noticeable but not bad in the scenes where you can tell, and you can't tell in other scenes. The plot is very straightforward, and the characters definitely develop a chemistry initially but also increase it over the course of the movie. The themes of the main characters and their personal motivations are well fleshed out, and the action is fun and easy to follow. There are multiple moments that will blow the socks off of even the most rudimentary comic book/comic character fan, and you walk out of the theater smiling and content with what you just saw. There are two after-credits scenes, the first one is enjoyable regardless but if you've seen any DC comic or read any wiki or have any knowledge of the CW/DC universe the second one is soooooo amazing. The Flash in particular steals the show in this as well as cyborg, and I honestly can't figure out a reason this movie has been so poorly reviewed. Yes, there are tone shifts caused by the shifts in between directors, but a lot of them flow quite well. This is a fun movie, and anyone above the rating of the film (PG-13) will find it a fun watch.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Whenever a new movie comes out that features the Caped Crusader, the old comic book fan in me gets really excited.

After the, for lack of a better term, disaster that was Batman vs. Superman, it left a bad taste in the mouths of critics and most fans. Even though Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman was fantastic, the rest of the movie is just downright BAD. Leading into Justice League, there was a lot of skepticism. In short, I think this movie is an absolute turd to the superhero genre and cinema period. No, I am not a critic being paid by Marvel, I am just an avid cinema fan who enjoys good movies. This movie fails at almost every level: storytelling, characters, editing, pacing, and even CGI. Steppenwolf is just another grey villain to add to the catalog for the DCEU, he is not intimidating whatsoever. During the climax of the film, my friend and I started laughing during the whole ""big-CGI-destruction"" on the town or wherever they were, because it was just so flat out ridiculous and stupid. I also thought the whole Henry Cavil mustache being CGI'd out was just awful, yet hilarious. The only thing I can say that was somewhat ""good"" was Jeremy Iron's Alfred, he was very charming and likable. It's a problem when the most likable character in this six-hero team-up film, is a side character butler. Quick side note, what is it with Zack Snyder constantly zooming in on Gal Gadot's butt? The film is a disaster, re-shoots really doomed this ""film"" even more than it was already doomed. I honestly would rather watch BvS then this colossal waste of time and money. But, if you're drunk enough with your friends, and wanna laugh, then you could consider this movie to watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are also wonderful action sequences with some fun moments to lighten up the tension and excitement - something this film delivers in spades. What more could you want from a superhero movie?!?!

Where the restrictions come from is anyone's guess. Maybe it was due to Snyder being unable to complete shooting due to personal circumstances. Maybe it's the Hollywood comic book formula in trying to get all these stories to coincide with each other without some main characters even having their solo outing first. Where this film suffers most is lack of story development and a extremely weak villain in Steppenwolf. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table, it's basically a linear one dimensional storyline where Steppenwolf is in danger of taking over the planet using the energy he collects three motherboxes. These boxes have been hidden for centuries to keep out of the wrong hands. Meanwhile Bruce is assembling a team to stop him on a suspicion the end is looming. The actors do their best but they can't save a weak plot. Gal Godot reprising her role as wonder woman is solid and Ezra Miller brings the humour. But the tone of the film is all over the place. Something tells me Snyder's version will be a lot darker than what Whedon finished off. It's evident that this film was completed by two different men with very different visions. Whedons comedic light-hearted tone juxtaposed with Snyder's more serious outlook on the comic world and much darker style. Even the score was all over the place, Danny Elfman came in late and probably tried patching things up, but again for the most part things just seem out of place. This is close to a Batman and Robin blooper in terms of cheesy god awful lines and ridiculously inconsistent characters. Something is bleeding and it's bleeding awful. Ben Affleck done his best but he really didn't have the writing for this interpretation of batman. Why is he so obnoxious in this? Lines like when he mentions Steve Trevor seem so out of character even as a motivation tactic, his ideology seems mixed in this follow up of bvs. At times it feels like watching somebody play a video game especially towards the end where the battle scenes are full on CGI. Unfortunately this superhero film ended up in a league of their own and they definitely didn't do this film justice!!!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

(1) Do not be afraid to tell a story of more than 2 hours. If the story is good, people will watch it again and again in Cinema halls. Period!
(2) Do not mess up the storytelling so bad, that the villain's motive is not at all clear or relatable to the audience
(3) Do not mess up the storytelling so bad, that the main characters are not properly developed 
(4) To ensure points 1, 2, & 3 are properly addressed, keep your under-qualified studio executives (including the Head) from making creative decisions. The decisions & assumptions they made regarding cutting down the movie to below 2 hours - they were totally wrong, which has been proved by 'Infinity War'. The studio executives could not understand the audience pulse or the market, and thus they proved themselves under-qualified for the job. Fire the whole team!
(5) Don't try to play a short term 'catch-up game' with Marvel. Each of their major characters got at least one movie to tell their story. That's your homework. Do that properly! Make a WW type 'self-contained' movie for each of your main players, then come to the game with Marvel. Play the long game. Don't throw in your strong assets (heroes like Batman, Superman, The Flash) cheaply like you did in Justice League. Play the long game. Build each character, THEN put them together. 
In summary: keep patience, play the long game, give directors creative freedom to tell a self-contained story, and fire the whole bunch of meddling studio executives including their head honcho - they failed!!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film stars an ensemble cast of Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, and J. K. Simmons.Batman seeks the help of Wonder Woman to recruit and assemble Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman to fight the powerful new enemy.I have read mixed reviews of the film with mainly criticizing the direction and in my opinion is that the film is entertaining but too a very limited extent and majorly disappoints. The biggest disappointment is that the characters and the story doesn't compliments each other well and mostly looked forced on. Another problem is that there is no proper character introduction of Cyborg and Flash and it seems that the director (Joss Whedon) was making the film according to his own convenience.Acting in the film is average and despite of a huge talented star cast none of them looked impressive and looked forced upon. The screenplay of the film is just average and doesn't keeps the film afloat. The soundtrack of the film is terrible and action scenes looks unconvincing.Overall in my opinion the film is very partially entertaining and majorly disappointing. Typical DC fans may like this film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This was the first I have ever seen a feature film in this medium, I have always avoided it like the plague. I found the experience extremely jarring, and it kept knocking me out of movie. I will definitely view this one again in 2D, the way nature intended. Now I know all the stories, all the re-shoots. The rewrites, the CGI problems, the Snyder lynch mob, rotten tomatoes, Marvel bias and mustachio Cavill. And you know what I really don't care! That's not why I watch these films. I do it because I love the characters, I have read them since I was young. And this film is really good, it's not terrible as some people are saying. Is this a cinematic masterpiece? NO! Is it trying to be? NO! Is this a boring film? NO! Is Zack Snyder a hack? Certainly NOT! Is Zack Snyder going receive a honorary Knighthood for his contributions to the arts? NO! Does he want a knighthood? I don't know, maybe! But do you understand my point I'm trying to make, this is just fun, positive movie about people with people with super powers. It doesn't deserve anyone's hate or anger, it's a just a comic book movie. Now to my actual review. The plot is simplistic which is a good thing, this is a character driven story. And that's what truly shines, the characters. Each have a moment in sun, each of them achieve something wonderful. Not one character is forgettable or dull, each have there own arc. Some are shorter than others but when you have team of people this always happens, it's a acceptable flaw.The editing is okay, everything is coherent. This movie moves fast, it jumps all over the place. It reminds me a lot of the rebooted Star Trek which did a similar thing. Again a team oriented movie, and it's not a problem as it's very easy to follow.The action is good, standard blockbuster fighting. The team assemble pretty quickly, going into there first battle. The Flash has a great moment which is so beautiful, true Snyder slow-mo at its best. Something that should be enjoyed on the big screen. Also in true Snyder form there are shots ripped straight off the page, with the some more great moments given to batman.The score is not really memorable, only the original Tim Burton Batman theme sticks out. The beautiful Han Zimmer scores for Wonder Women and Superman are present, but used sparingly.The CGI is okay, I didn't really notice to many problems. Superman's face is a little bit of a issue but it's understandable, your generating a image over someone's face.The villain is also okay, he really serves as a ""Mcguffin"" that forces the team to form.The run time actually helps keep you entertained, as the story just flies through. I'm sure we will see the true Snyder cut one day.Now the stand out character for me is Superman, he so good that I felt like I was 5 watching him. He encapsulates the character perfectly, like for a better word HENRY CAVILL IS SUPERMAN! He steals every scene he is in, especially when he first returns and he demonstrates his true power! Also the final shot with them all together is wonderful, the original comic book team on the silver screen for the first time. I'm ready for the next chapter, I'm a believer. I hope you enjoyed my review, I contemplated my thoughts over a couple days. If you disagree with me it's okay, remember this is just my opinion. I am a single person voicing my thoughts, am I wrong? Am I right? It doesn't matter as art is subjective, which means formulating you're own opinion is the key!But I will say one final thing, I can go to my local supermarket and buy: Captain America Civil War, The Avengers, BvS, The Dark Knight, Apocalypse Now, The God Father part 2 and Transformers for a 5 note. In the end this stuff doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, so just enjoy it as it all ends up in the bargain bin.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","In a League of their own","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3877552/?ref_=tt_urv","jc-29071","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66155439/?ref_=tt_urv","9 December 2017","I want to say that the first comic book I ever picked up was the Justice League and it was a special moment for me and have kept me interested. I invite people to watch this film despite the negative reviews, because it is the first time we ever see these characters together. I think Batman should have led the group, after all he brought them together. I think he needs a better costume, it just looked too bulky for him to move around in and he is all about agility, DC creative teams take a look at the awesome superhero mech armor ideas for Batman on Pinterest, and also at Deathstroke the Terminator. Have the female, teen Robin (Stephanie Brown) with short blonde hair in the new Batman movie, she's electric! the red vest, black legging, black and yellow cape -costume rocks. I agree that the main villain's costume needed much improvement as well as the CGI (although Doomsday was all CGI and was awesome in BvS which I loved) Is Darkseid in this movie? even just at the end to tease us? What happened to the founding member Green Lantern? Justice League 2 must be made but first let's see all the other characters in their own movies. Aquaman steals the movie, he rocks (except for the Triton, it could be done away with altogether he doesn't need it, his water powers, strength, agility suffice). Cyborg was great, the actor did a fine job, we get a feeling of his presence throughout the movie keep that momentum up, along with Aquaman's tempestuous, wild, chaotic and unpredictable nature, it works wonders so does his humor. Superman's costume needs to be re-designed less of those bands on the leg, it could look like chain mail, smoother, I like the light blue color and it was good to see him, Justice League needs Superman. Just out of curiosity why not try him in a black T-shirt with the red and gold superman symbol and jeans and sneakers, I think it would be awesome to see him like that saving people in a city, a tribute to smallville's Superman who was awesome (not that the current isn't). Flash's costume should be a little less mechanical after all he's supposed to be fast, mercurial, light on his feet, isn't that what he's about? I understand some of the armor on his suit is for protection against friction and attacks, but the shoulders and the rest of the suit should be more aero-ergo dynamic, it should be something to see! think Lamborghini on feet. Wonder Woman continues to be a little too tough, lets see a friendlier side, let that charisma shine through and stand side by side with man, not judging him. I love Wonder Woman's magic lasso, I love her strength and speed it's amazing and thrilling to see her in action, gets the blood pumping. Show her in situations where she's putting herself in danger to save common people caught in the crossfire of battle scenes and their reaction, their awe, it's always fun and shows why she's the greatest super heroine. Have Linda Carter appear as ongoing supporting character, a wise Amazon mentor and dear friend throughout the films. Follow through on what happened in BvS, the post-apocalyptic world where Batman is in a desert, thrilling stuff it was going to continue in this movie,that was mind blowing and that is what Justice League needs to be to take off and never stop. Lex Luthor's return is greatly anticipated (this time more genius less psycho), the promise of Darkseid must be realized but with great care and in the hands of someone who is passionate about the Justice League for the fan's sake. If this means the Justice League 2 needs a little more time to be properly made then do so, get this script going, build on what you had in BvS finish it, Snyder's ideas were on the mark. Whoever Takes the reigns must be passionate about the League, the story, the special effects, the CGI as good or better than BvS. If Darkseid will be CGI he must not only look impressive, he must be impressive, a force to be reckoned with, and a story to blow our minds. The League of Injustice should include Lex Luthor, Deathstroke, Black Adam, Sinestro, Superwoman from Earth 2 (as a tie in to the whole post-apocalyptic world from BvS! when they get there the other evil League doppelgangers will be waiting!) and Black Mantis. I would really like to see Man of Steel 2 with the same and better intensity as part one, as well as Brainiac and an intro to the Green lantern Corps and the whole Spectrum war (all the different color lanterns because the whole history and story line is really cool). Finally how about putting Supergirl, Flash, Green Arrow and Superman from the WB T.V. (include Martian Manhunter he's great he's great just increase his powers and the new Green Lantern!) show to cameo as a Justice league version of another earth. You should also include the Smallville -Superman and the other Superman from 'Superman returns' appear to prepare for Crisis on Infinite earths, this would be a treat! This is the kind of thing no one would see coming and the first time something like that has ever been done. This is exactly what the League is about, situations that go way beyond what you would ever expect and challenges that go beyond what any single hero could ever hope to overcome. This in mind go the full gamut, have Powergirl make her debut and the Justice Society members including an older Superman with grey hair, original Flash with the mercury wings and helm (look at Alex Ross art for inspiration, make him look cool), a new Wonder Woman, the original red and green, blonde haired Green Lantern, and the Spectre (larger than life) to take on the Anti-monitor, someone even Darkseid will fight against!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Affleck, Gadot, Cavill, Momoa, Miller, and Fisher do well considering what they ended up with. In the right movie this League would shine - but this isn't that movie. I loved Man of Steel and Wonder Woman, and enjoyed Batman v Superman, but the tonal shift here and inconsistency from one scene to the next - an obvious result of the well-publicised director change for reshoots - jar so badly that the movie looks like it doesn't know what it wants to be. In addition, some of the CGI is really, really poor to the extent of genuinely looking unfinished. The animated movie Justice League: War (2014) tells pretty much the same story, both being heavily inspired by the New 52 comic arc Justice League: Origin (JLW is actually a direct adaptation), but whilst JLW may not reach the top tier of DC animations it's still far better than this. THIS is the first ever live-action, big-screen, star-studded Justice League movie. And it's heartbreaking. 4/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In other words, it's a movie with a team that tries so hard to be good, but ends up failing miserably.The story? Fueled by his restored faith in humanity, and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists newfound ally Diana Prince to face an even greater threat. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to recruit a team to stand against this newly-awakened enemy. Despite the formation of an unprecedented league of heroes in Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and the Flash, it may be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.What the film has going against it is that there has only been a couple of prior films to set up this movie, including Man of Steel, Batman vs. Superman, and Wonder Woman. The problem with Batman vs. Superman is that they jumped right into the crossovers without properly setting up Batman, and same applies to this movie. Batman, Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash haven't gotten their own origin stories yet, and even if they will have some in the future, this is right now, and we don't know their stories in film. Because of this, it fails to feel like a big and popular event in cinema history, unlike in The Avengers, where the origin stories have already been set up for a big cinematic crossover to happen, proving that Marvel is capable of setting up their cinematic universe before going into the big crossovers. DC, on the other hand, makes their movies solely for the profit, caring little about the quality and more on the gross, and because there were no prior setups from this film, it wasn't the huge hit DC hoped it would be. Of course, the biggest problem with this movie is its runtime of only 2 hours, while the average Avengers movie is in the 2 hours and 20 minutes mark. If this is the ultimate cinematic dawn of the Justice League, then why is it so short? Does DC know audiences have a low attention span for their films?Justice League, in conclusion, is a mess of a superhero film with a rushed focus on going into the big action and caring little about the storyline or the character development, and when we do get into the action, the visual effects are poor and the excitement is kept to a low. Not all superhero franchises can be like Marvel, and DC definitely proves this statement true.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's a comic book film. It's meant to entertain, and that it does.I have seen BvS several times, and still both enjoy and hate it. I loved Wonder Woman. This film falls short of the latter, but is far better than the first. The action is fun, the dialogue is amusing when it should be, and the characters have a range between them. Are things fully fleshed out? No - you're dealing with new characters for the screen, new villains, and a new shift in how they all deal with each other. What I liked was that balance. The movie never tries to be more than it is - entertainment and fun. With that, it wins. Sure, the Amazonian armor is misogynistic given the designs were changed AFTER Wonder Woman was a hit (as seen all over the web last week). Sure physics is tossed out the window. It still stands well even with those flaws. Go see it if you'd like some fun.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I am a huge Batman fan. There was always the question, after Christian Bale who and Ben Affleck was a fitting replacement but unfortunately did not have a fitting script or director to match. Even in this movie he is just like a brooding boyfriend who lost his best friend and the guilt of what happened in B vs S and with the only superpower he wields in this is that he is rich. What a let down for one of the coolest superheroes in comics.
Wonder Woman - Still the best in the franchise and always wonderful to watch onscreen, fights n all.
Flash - Good but a bit goofy provides the laughs we 'll see more character build up in the solo movie best year.
Cyborg- Just in the movie to kick start machines that's all major scenes were cut out of the movie 
Aquaman - Jason Mamoa looks good again short but will have to wait for his solo outing next year.
Superman - Well he is back no spoiler here does what he does good to see him back. Wished he wore the black suit and had a darker character as the comics.
The villain is the weakest here who is a CGI mess and just does not create that villiany required for such a genre and just does not connect.
As for the movie what can we say about it when it changed directors in between, the final product cut by 59 mins and tries to be funny a la Marvel and removing all the character build ups, It just does not meet expectations. DC comics are dark and should stay so in the movies too, look at what Nolan did to the Batman series. We need something like that but the only positive is the team is together with scope for more additions and hope to see a better outing once some of their solo movies come out in the coming years.
Catch Thor Ragnarok instead and have a good time at the movies.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Even bad superhero movies like Batman Forever and Batman and Robin -as horrendously stupid as they are - had impressive set pieces, camp value and some standout moments.This was just painfully boring. All of the newcomers (Flash/Aquaman/Cyborg) have rushed introductions and I wasn't given much of a reason to care about them. Even Batman and Wonder Woman lacked moments emotionally resonated with me, despite them having appeared in previous DCEU films. The big problem is that there are simply not enough screentime dedicated to fleshing out the Justice League's relationships with one another. By the end of the first Avengers film, all of our heroes felt like a team. At the end of this movie, they still felt like acquaintances at best.There was no real ""story"". No character journey. Just a haphazard excuse to throw these characters together. It felt almost like a video game. Except the action scenes, for the most part, sucked. I liked the fight against Superman (who was easily the best thing about this mess), but that's about it. The villain was bland, with a generic take over or end the world plot, and he had no real relationship with any of the Justice League members (to be fair, most of the Marvel movies suffer from this as well). I suspect Joss Whedon was responsible for adding in the humorous scenes, probably in hopes that they would distract the audience from how tedious and grim and slow the rest of the movie was. While the Flash got a few laughs, most of the jokes did not land. And even if they did all land, they would not be enough to save this miserable excuse of a movie. It's such a shame too, because the cast is REALLY GOOD! I like Batfleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher and Henry Cavill. They are all great choices for their characters. But the script and the directing and the editing let them all down.I didn't see Batman vs. Superman in theaters because everyone acted like it was the worst thing ever. While I think that movie missed the mark and I would only give it like a 5.5/10, I was never constantly looking at my phone to see how much time had passed like I did with Justice League. I thought Batman vs Superman was an ambitious movie with a lot of good moments. Justice League was just a poor attempt to capture the success of the Avengers. Here's a tip Warner Brothers: Seeing several superheroes team up is only cool if we care about the superheroes in the first place!Worst superhero movie of the year. It joins the ranks of Green Lantern/Superman 3 and 4 as one of the worst superhero movies ever made. It's worse than Fantastic Four 2015 (which was compelling for at least the first half of the movie), and worse than Catwoman, which is enjoyable on a ""it's so bad it's good"" level.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

We might be under the impression that we want that new, shiny thing, but when that thing is finally ours we regret wanting it, start finding flaws in it and try to discard it. Because we are primitive beings and I know this because I experienced it, in myself for the first time and now I know. The feeling of satisfaction is only an illusion till the next shiny,new thing arrives to replace the old one. And once that happens it's difficult to go back. It is only by creating something new and completely different can one make a difference and establish a false sense of satisfaction amongst people. The first time I saw Justice League I was brimming with excitement, I don't even remember the number of years I had waited for this to happen so I went in hoping to see,... I don't know something cathartic, maybe. Something that I could compare to the works of other directors that I love. So needless to say I came out of the movie theatre feeling a little disappointed. And as I lay in bed that night and I thought about the things that I disliked about the movie and except for #MUSTACHEGATE and some choppy editing to make the movie under 2 hours. I could not think of anything else. Just the fact that it seemed to resemble a few marvel movies and did-not have the dynamic storytelling of David Fincher or Darren Aronofsky cannot make a movie bad? And that too a movie that has characters that I adore. So decided to watch it again and now I understood why WB wanted it to be under 2 hours because it's easier to rewatch. Which seems like a dick move, but works, anyways I saw it the day after and I was waltzing out of the theatre. Now that I did-not sit there comparing it to other movies and complaining about some scenes resembling other marvel movies. I f***ing loved it ... laughed at every joke and had the neardiest time of my life. Seriously this is a movie that will give, comicbook neards and superhero geek, the biggest orgasms of their lives. And will provide non comicbook buffs with ample entertainment through its visually stunning action pieces, inspirational characters and witty humor. And credit where credit is due, Zach Snyder, love him/hate him you cannot deny his visual language of creating ""moments"",well choreographed stylistic slow-motion scenes, is both unique and awesome. These ""moments"" are used elegantly in long action set pieces that are amazing to witness. The only people to dislike this movie will be so called ""movie critics"" who are pretentious enough to dislike a movie just because their lives are sad . And seriously, you don't wanna be that guy? Do you? See now, I know people will jump to conclusions and say stupid things like, the first scene of the movie was a total ripoff of Spiderman Homecoming and Steppenwolf had that Loki scene like in the first Avengers movie and why is DC making funny movies now? As if the creators of MARVEL movies are the first people on this planet ever to implement the ""found footage"" technique and add a few narcissistic dialogues for the arrogant bad guy.But if you are a person who says these kinda things then you missed the whole point of the movie. It's not about that... it is about restoring hope, order, peace and harmony in a world without Superman. It is about the coming together of meta human(s), Demi-God(s) and a person who dresses like a bat, to save the world and restore the hope that was lost. Hope that the age of heroes is here and mankind will be safe even without Superman.And boy was I digging the dynamism and the interactions of this team. Bruce and Diana being the senior members got all the others together and lead form the front. Cyborg was all business and had his guard up in the beginning, as one may expect him to be after the changes that he goes through, but he found his ground and was comfortable in the end. I enjoyed every second of The Flash this movie gave me and Barry Allen was my favourite character in the movie. We're shown the traumas that these characters have faced. Some of it is beyond our understanding just because we've never had to face something that horrible but we can relate to some of it. We've all had to face the loss of a loved one and that emotion of grief always changes something. And it is shown beautifully, it gives these larger than life characters a sense of humanity and morality. Aquaman was given less screen time than the rest but he shined in the moments he was given.And that brings me to Superman. He was, I think, out of all the 3 DCEU movies he's been in , the closest to his comicbook self in this movie. The love he has for Lois, the concrete almost stupidly stubborn belief, in the good that humanity can do. He's Superman. If you can just focus on his eyes instead of his upper lip. You'll be fine. Which brings me to the flaws. The CGI in some scenes could've have been better or just maybe unnecessary. The way they bring back Superman was a little... I don't you'll see. Even hardcore marvel lovers should love this movie because if you don't then why do you like marvel movies? And if you don't like marvel movies how are you a marvel fanatic? A nice ""Paradox"" to have DC.Enough said. PEACE","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, this is the first film in the franchise that I liked. I read about the controversial nature surrounding the finishing of the film after Zack left production due to his family emergency. However, the changes demonstrate a great improvement over the bad films that came before it.The premise is simple, as it follows Marvel's work by dropping hints throughout earlier movies, including cameos, that certain people of supernatural ability would gather together to face a threat. With Superman dead after the events of BvS, Bruce Wayne uses his resources, and friendship with Diana Prince, to bring together Aquaman, the Flash and Cyborg to face Steppenwolf. Now, I know a lot of people didn't know who the villain was, but I am familiar with Jack Kirby's work on the New Gods comic book back in the 70s, and I found the reference as a nod to the fans.Another nod to the fans occurs with the Flash's race against the revived Superman to see who is fastest. This is also a nod to earlier comics where the two of them faced off as well, in friendly competition.The action scenes are well filmed, and contain less of the awkward and unimpressive slow motion leaps through the air. Batman is treated properly as a man with no powers of his own, and even teased about it, even though his gadgets are of great use in the fight scenes.There is a lot of humor in the movie, which helps with character interaction, and a reminder that these are still people. They all have different motivations to be of use, and they use those differences to help balance the team. Gal Godot did another amazing job as Wonder Woman, helping remove the embarrassment of her solo origin movie, as her dry wit was fun when bantering with Bruce. Ezra Miller was very funny as the comic relief in the Flash, and also helped diffuse tension. The movie is a comic book adaptation, but does not need to be very serious like some of the preceding movies.This is not to say that the movie is perfect. The CGI used to mask Henry Cavill's mustache was atrocious, and it made his face look so different that it was painful to look at. Steppenwolf was completely CGI'd when it wasn't necessary. It reminded me of cut scene graphics from the ps2 and xbox 360 era. For a $300 million film, I expected better. The villain himself is a bit obscure, and I can see casual moviegoers being disappointed when there are plenty of other villains to choose from.Overall this is a gigantic improvement in the series even though it took 5 movies to get it right. I will watch Zack Snyder's cut eventually, but I don't believe this film needed any further work. I loved it.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"5","/10","A huge mess but with still some fun to be had.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3877923/?ref_=tt_urv","breheneyjames","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66043521/?ref_=tt_urv","9 December 2017","At this point, 'Justice League' has already been torn to shreds by most critics and rightly so. It is a mess of epic proportions and features some outright bizarre creative and technical choices. However I still felt compelled to give my two cents on it in a sort of post-mortem if you will. In a way we should have all knew this movie was doomed when WB announced that they were switching directors three quarters of the way through production. Although this is not always an automatic nail in the coffin of a film, it rarely ever turns out for the good especially on a tent pole project. Also given the previous incompetency of the people running the DC Extended Universe division at WB, it comes as no surprise that they couldn't make the director switch a smooth transition. But then again they may have been dealing with an original version of the movie by Zack Snyder which was already mediocre and so they tried (and failed) to patch it up. So when they brought Joss Whedon on board, a director with a style completely different to Snyder's, it's a possibility they were trying to prevent a ship from sinking. However this is all speculation and the way they got to the finished product is rather irrelevant to a review of said product. So now to the reasons why the movie is mostly disappointing but with some enjoyment to be had with these iconic characters. The structure and plot of the film is predictably generic and par for the course as far as team up superhero movies go. A superhero team comes together, superhero team fights big bad, superhero team eventually defeats big bad and saves the world. In this case the team consists of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) and Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) who are, in continuation of 'Batman V Superman', looking to assemble a team of people with special abilities to combat a huge alien threat that had been alluded to by Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). The newcomers are Barry Allen/The Flash who has super speed, Victor Stone/Cyborg who is well... a cyborg and Arthur Curry/Aquaman who is a half man half Atlantean. And in this case the big bad is Steppenwolf (not the rock band) who is unfortunately just a walking CGI punching bag. But he does have a cool voice thanks to Ciaran Hinds who does his best to deliver some menacing monologues as the character. The baffling thing here is why they didn't just do motion capture instead of a full CGI character that looks like something out of a PSP Lord of the Rings game. But I digress, so essentially Steppenwolf comes to Earth to retrieve three items called mother boxes for reasons that are poorly explained. The movie flashes back to the first time Steppenwolf invaded and shows the forces of Themyscira and Atlantis fighting him off to prevent him from getting one of these mother boxes. He needs them in order to and I'm paraphrasing 'unify the realms of evil' or something or other but the reason ends up being pointless and completely inconsequential anyway. So we have a movie of the team assembling and trying to figure out how to defeat Steppenwolf and then eventually doing so with the help of a resurrected Clark Kent/Superman (Henry Cavill) . This is not a spoiler as is it virtually common knowledge at this point. As far as the performances go everyone is fine and give serviceable turns particularly Aflleck and Gadot as the leads. Momoa is also very cool as a surfer dude type. Ray Fisher in his first big screen role impresses as a man who lost his limbs in an accident and had to be put back together by his father using bionics. Ezra Miller as talented as he is eventually becomes annoying and almost cringe worthy in his role as Barry Allen. However this isn't entirely his fault. In fact the writing of his character is the main culprit as most of his screen time is comprised of forced jokes and childish humor. There are some pluses to his portrayal in how he represents innocence and vulnerability as kind of the 'kid' of the group dynamic. Th main fun to be had with this flick is the interactions between the characters who all get their moments in either funny moments or downright awesome moments. However that leads me into another way the movie falters and that's focusing on moments rather scenes. Scenes are not allowed to breathe and develop, it just feels like you are constantly being told 'ok this happened' and it then cuts immediately to the next scene or moment more appropriately. This is the same problem that 'Batman V Superman' had and it really needs to stop if the film makers of this cinematic universe want to replicate the success they had with Wonder Woman. It is very apparent that this is what happened here when you realize the original cut was 165 minutes long and they managed to shave it down to 120 minutes. Clearly a lot of footage is missing from the finished product as one can deduce just by watching one of the trailers for this movie. It's also sad that this run time was a mandate set by the head of the studio. Apparently it was a response to audience criticisms that 'Batman V Superman' was too long but ironically in 'fixing' this issue they have arguably made a worse product. In conclusion, if you can tolerate the scattershot comedy, the often distracting CGI especially Superman's top lip- They had to digitally remove Henry Cavill's mustache due to his role in Mission Impossible 6 which prevented him from shaving it- and the derivative plot and villain then you might some fun with this one if you are already a fan of these characters and the DC Extended Universe. Let's just hope 'Aquaman' is much, much better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unfortunately it does not, if anything it heightens the folly of the movie and the desire to compete directly with Marvel in a race they've already lost.Wracked with guilt about his part in the death of Superman, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) discovers that the earth is under attack from scouts for an alien race that would rule the planet. He works to pull together a team of powered individuals that can mount a resistance but before he's ready, the villain Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds) arrives to secure and reunite three long forgotten energy sources.It's not so much that ""Justice League"" is irredeemably awful; like an artistic idea that didn't resonate with the audience for example, or is just undone by one aspect of that undermines good work elsewhere. The film is just so staggeringly mediocre, in every aspect. A dull fetchquest story, punctuated by a number of uninteresting fighting sequences. Tepid banter between the cast. Generic CGI villain. It's all so bland, so uninspired and now has the added bonus of not being worth it as ""road to somewhere better"" as this appears to have been the final nail in the idea of an extended universe, with DC now looking to the much more sensible approach of asking interesting filmmakers to do what they want with the characters.Having said earlier that there isn't one particular aspect that lets the film down, there is actually one that drags you out of it whenever he's on screen. The CGI work to erase Henry Cavill's moustache is always, staggering and distractingly awful. You can look at literally nothing else whenever he's on screen.It's hard not to acknowledge the tragic circumstances that forced a change in director and for Joss Whedon to complete filming reshoots and editing. I appreciate that people would like to see what Snyder's true vision for the film was, however, I can't believe that there's some magic way to reedit this film and make it passable. The ""bones"" of a good film just aren't there for that to happen.A waste.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some people say that superheroes are the mythological stories of this era. In fact, DC heroes are more ""divine"" and more like gods than Marvel's. Specific to the story of the Justice League, the fall and resurrection of Superman, and the assembly of the Justice League, this can be told (or even supposed to be) a story about the annihilation and remodeling of faith. There is much to talk about here. The constructed conflict can profoundly shape the character image. But Warner always has the ability to smash a good hand. It perfectly wastes all the above mentioned, and makes a movie whose plot is comparable to the animation.The words ""deep"" are the advantages of DC comics and animations, and the advantages of the Nolan version of Batman, but they are never the advantages of DCEU. Because in fact, DCEU movies have never shot ""deep"", and all of the shots are ""although everyone knows that I actually have no connotation but just pretend, but I still have to make a deep look"" The question of DCEU is never whether it should be deep or funny, but that this group of creators has not told a story that is reasonable and conflicting, the characters are credible, and all aspects are not rigid.Even if it's a laugh, it's not so good. This is normal, and humor requires IQ. There are a lot of laughs in this film, some of them are not bad, but the overall feeling is too hard. Some of the laughing points are actually destroying the existence of the drama. For example, when the Super League later said to the master: ""I know you don't like me"", the master likes a little girl to support my incoherent words, so as to create a laugh and ""sweet ""This joke is too low-level, this rot is too low-level, because it comes at the cost of destroying the image of the old man. The most fascinating way to make a group of ""CP"" must be to never just show it off. Because the attractive premise of ""CP"" is that the two images that make up CP are charming. It's stupid to show off CP's image without sacrificing image.There is another huge problem with this movie: it portrays Batman very badly. The master is a very special character. He is the only mortal in this group of gods. His absolute strength and other people in the Justice League have an insurmountable gap, but he has a core position in this team. This point is actually very important. Here you can fully dig into how a mortal man has found his place among the gods, how to view his own value, and can even create a very wonderful conflict from this, and perfect it by solving this conflict. The character of the old man. Even if you are limited in space, you can't talk about it deeply. However, no, there is no intention to write a deep article at all. The movie finally shows that the Flash is very funny, Wonder Woman is beautiful, the Neptune muscle is very good, Batman is very weak, nothing more. The audience's expectation is ""Look at how this film prevents Batman from appearing embarrassed because of his weakness"", and the movie was shot out as ""haha, Batman is so embarrassed, we even made it a laugh!""I have always been angry about DC movies. It has a lot of good stories, extremely profound characters, and all the actors are beautiful in appearance and good in business. Unfortunately, Warner has never let people down. After I watched Thor 3, I felt bad because it completely gave up the slightly pursued opportunity and was willing to make an excellent assembly line product; while the Justice League's badness refers to it as an assembly line product, and it is not good.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Sadly, it just falls into the deep pit of every other work from the DC Cinematic Universe. 
I strongly believed in this movie before it came out, especially after the rave reviews of ""Wonder Woman"", this should have set a new ground in terms of quality for DC.""Justice League"" centers around a team of superheroes formed by Batman, played by Ben Affleck, in order to stop the menacing force crowned as Steppenwolf. Batman enlists the help of other people with special abilities, such as Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman or Cyborg. Despite shaping up Earth's first line of defense, Steppenwolf withstands the mighty team. Now Batman is forced to find a new way to stop the menace and only one person could face up to the task at hand, Superman.The plot is a classic comic-book story that feels to have entered a little late in the superhero genre. If the movie was developed and released in the early stages, pre-Iron Man era, then I would have given it a pass, but in this age of ever-pouring comic-book movies year by year, it just doesn't stand up to the standards.
Aside from the main story, the script has been revised by Joss Whedon who's hand was seen throughout the movie, giving it a lighter more comical touch. This was a slight improvement to the DC Universe, but not enough to save the movie.Steppenwolf was really just a bland villain bringing absolutely nothing new to the table. The villain is an important part of the superhero movie process and they misfired once again after ""Suicide Squad"".Instead of following the Marvel formula by having each individual superhero origin story told first and only then connecting the storyline unto one epic stage like the ""The Avengers"", DC rushed production by postponing several key characters' own films. There may have been slight hints in ""Batman vs Superman"" of The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman but not enough to make they're involvement aware to the audience. There is no true indication that Marvel's way is the only path to success and even so, DC still did not take the right approach.The casting and acting was great, Ben Affleck does an amazing job as Bruce Wayne, probably the second best live-action Batman portrayal after Michael Keaton. Ezra Miller, Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa also fit well within their character's personalities.""Justice League"" had serious development troubles with two months of re-shoots and script rewriting, not to mention Henry Cavill's digitally removed mustache.Famed composer Hans Zimmer did not return to score the soundtrack after ""Batman Vs Superman"" and was replaced by Danny Elfman, who in one way or another brought back the enjoyable theme song from 89's ""Batman"". Elfman's work matched the pace of earlier parts of the movie very well, but in the latter half, just like the script, it started to not amount to anything.I know that an 8/10 is a high rating, but even with all the above being said, I actually enjoyed the movie and I truly hope DC is going to learn from its mistakes and turn it all around with ""Justice League 2"". Marvel needs a big competitor and DC needs to step up its game.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Would have been nice for Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman to have had their own movies prior to Justice League but hey... I hear they're working on it.The story didn't really have any depth, its your typical bad guy wanting to take over the world and become more powerful while Bruce Wayne tries to assemble the Justice League team. Plenty of cheesy lines and predictability throughout. I felt that the pacing of the movie was too fast and next thing I knew, the movie was over. There was little to no backstory to the main villain so I didn't care for him either.Over all, Justice League was just an average eye-candy popcorn flick. It is nowhere near the level of The Dark Knight trilogy... but it isn't the worse movie I've ever seen either.I hope WB works on developing these characters much better for future movies, along with penning a script with more depth, to avoid failure should a sequel be made.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I wasn't overly impressed with BvS, but thought perhaps JL would save the franchise. Nothing in this film feels natural, everything seems dis-attached. Its almost as if this film was made by separate teems working without any kind of correspondence. The score is abysmal, it feels completely separate to what is happening in the picture. As if someone is playing generic ""movie music"" in the background without looking at whats happening on screen. The Sound effects production is poor at best, with certain spot effects feeling completely out of place, and others feeling generic, as if just placed there to ""get the job out of the way"". The CGI is difficult to swallow, the quality of Steppenwolf's CGI character animation is as bad as the infamous end scene in Scorpion King. Badly animated, rigid and that stupid expression on his face makes the character difficult to identify with. Questionable effects quality plagues this film, sets look like sets, and some of the green screening seems very obvious, with backgrounds too contrasted with the foreground, making the character feel disconnected to whats happening in the story. Lighting also feels too ""set like"". Dialogue feels too close and disconnected to the picture, the ADR work is too obvious, with the general audio mix being the worst I've heard in years. I also found Barry Allen very irritating. Stupid attempts at a comic relief made his character annoying which I quite frankly found repugnant.I know I am ranting on about tech stuff, I dont claim to be an expert, but as a consumer, I have become accustomed to a certain level of technical quality, and at 300 million budget, I really feel that a lot more could have been done here. Its a half arsed attempt. Did everyone working on this picture decide to give up on it half way through making it? It seems that way. ""Get it out the door so we can do the next Disney film"" must of been uttered by someone as some point during the making of this film. Having said all of this, I did enjoy small segments of the action sequences. The fight between The Flash and Superman was well done, hence the 3 stars.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's clear that there were major changes, including all of Superman's scenes (re: CGI upper lip). For what they had to work with, it was a damn good film. I honestly think people want to dislike the film for a number of reasons. Mainly being overshadowed by Marvel and the stumbling start of the DC film franchise. I think the DC film franchise suffers from lack of direction, a la Kevin Feige-esque producer to control the direction of the franchise. Also, Zack Snyder directing MOS, BvS & JL. Share the creative process with other writers and directors. That's what makes the MCU strong. Hiring Joss Whedon definitely pulled a rabbit out of the hat. The tone was lightened, the story line was reinforced, it was funny and action packed. It made for an enjoyable experience. Don't put too much weight in the critic's reviews.

Its very clear that its not the actors or the director. Its the studio. DC has stood on its own for decades with Comics, the best animated series/movies of any superheros, video games, and TV Series. So its not DC its the studio. They studio want to direct with the directors believing that they got their positions by being creative directors. You got your jobs from knowing the business. They rushed the story line and I blame the CEO for a stupid mandate. I'm glad it backfired. You now know fans aren't going to continue to take your mismanaging of the characters we love. MoS was a strong start from WB then they jumped the gun with BvS. Again that's the studio's fault. DC does not have a separate studio or creative control on the movies. They have to consult with the executives. You can't make a movie like Justice League without a solid script. I think it may have been there in the beginning but so much of the film is cut and you can tell. The CGI was incomplete. Say what you want about Zack Snyder his CGI is the great. However two directors with the studio telling you to do this do that. Please establish your main characters, and the secondary character can come later.

The only highlight is a brief battle scene involving Superman that is the only reason I didn't give this a lower rating.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I accepted Batman vs Superman as good even it is a mediocre movie because I considered as a transitional period. and I belive adapting strong heroes with Batman is tough. threrefore I understood previous movie but not this one. Why did they hold their own athmosphere?For me, addition to unneccesary jokes,there were three problems about movie.First thing is All chacacters except Batman are too strong and their opponents seem not challanging. Second is we dont understand evil's motivation.And lastly, It shouldn't be look alike Marvel.Beause of these, I can't say the movie that I was expected.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Seeing your favorite superheroes coming together in the same universe is supposed to be the biggest movie event, but all we got was a movie not big and not exciting at all. It's no surprise since DCEU didn't even try to build-up their characters and manage to be worst than BvS.The jokes in the movie felt force, we only know 2 characters with development, the visual effects and colors is bland as hell like I'm looking at a PS4 graphics if it was downgraded. The villain of the movie is just forgettable and his goal is generic and boring. MCU made 5 movies about it's characters and had some good side characters throw in there and had a movie with them in there that become universal praise. DCEU had 4 movies, but one of them is rush and the other one has nothing to do with Justice League.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Once again potential positives are frustratingly squandered in the hands of a director incapable of handling anything deeper than a video game intro sequence. And sadly too often that's exactly what Justice League feels like, an over-long, incoherent trailer for the computer game merchandise. There's some great additions to the (already stellar) cast. Ezra Miller is an eccentric, excitable Flash, who thankfully injects a great deal of humour into proceedings (he has virtually all the best one liners). Jason Momoa's arrogant swagger as Aquaman added an unexpected dynamic (and is surely deserving of his own origins film). Gadot's Wonder Woman, the true leader of the League, just about held the whole thing together, but far too many elements that these days should be mere hygiene factors for such blockbusters were missing. The premise of the film was nonsense, a barrage of gobbledygook which failed abysmally to generate any sense of peril. Any attempt at credibility was repeatedly undermined by sloppy exposition or infantile writing (seriously who's going to tremble at something called a Mother Box?!). The villain a bog standard rent-a-baddy (again with a stupid name) interchangeable with a dozen or so others from similar movies, here made all the worse with shockingly cheap-looking CGI. I mean come on, if you're making a superhero movie with a multi-million dollar budget we at least expect you to put some effort into the visual effects! Anyone hoping for this franchise to redeem itself after the wonderful Wonder Woman are going to be left sorely disappointed. Again despite some valiant efforts from a game cast, the production team behind DC has let them down. At least there were plenty of topless scenes this time, which almost made it worth watching.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I liked the internaction and chemistry between the heroes. Batman was brooding and cynical, but played off the waterman and Supergirl quite well. Supergirl was the voice of reason it seems, the more mature one in a boys club. She felt like a mother of the others, sort of.
The red guy seemed to be the comedian of the group. Similar to the running guy in the Marvel movies, he was mostly just situationally funny. The bad:
It was a regular bad guy story. And the bad guy wasnt all that impressive. Usually such movies rise and fall with a good bad guy .. cause he is the one the good guys are measured against .. but this guy was rather lame and most of all .. boring. He was the archetypical evil guy that would talk in one liners and degrade quickly from being near invincible to rather weak in the end.There seemed to be a lot of plot points that were hinted at but never explained .. at the same time a lot of exposition that felt out of place. What really shocked me were the terrible (and i mean really, really terrible) special effects .. that were worse than some home computer cutscenes. Actors being superimposed into a background .. but standing out worse than the weatherman at the forecast in front of a greenscreen. Muddy ""textures"" on some of the CGI environments and actors failing to properly interact with it. All in all.. it felt almost like a movie from the early 2000. 
But maybe i am missing a point here .. and the director WANTED it to look fake and comic book like? But as a random movie .. it was actually quite a joyride. Not much story or meaning .. but a colourful and hectic journey of what was it? 2 hours or so. I do not regret having seen it, but i would not see it again - having the choice.I can understand that people who actually do read comic books have very different feelings about this movie. I am sure there is more to the chracters than shown in this storyline","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The balance of good and bad aspects is slightly on the positive side but overall it comes down as quite average.First the bad: the story starts with a very mishmash style of introducing a lot of characters so fast that you don't know what's happening. This is something that will hopefully be fixed in the forthcoming Snyder cut version. Secondly, the villain is not memorable, and the apocalyptic special effects are the same romp as in every other superhero flick. I'd like these heroes for once fight some more ordinary criminals and not always some mega-gods. About the effects, well, there have been worse, but I just don't like a lot when a movie looks like a video game. I'm not only talking about the cgi monsters itself, but it seems like the trend is that everything on the screen, including the suits of the human characters, must have some digital enhancement which makes them look more shiny. That kind of style distances me from the characters. I want flesh and blood. I liked more when Bat-suit looked like actual leather or something.Then the good: Ben Affleck is again a very good Batman. His mere presence raises the entertainment value. The other heroes aren't quite as charismatic but not annoying either. Generally I liked them as a group, and would have liked even more would the story be better.Despite the flaws it was a watchable movie and had some cool moments. Don't judge too hastily, watch it yourself.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I find that the critics are very hard on DC Extended Universe films. Whereas Suicide Squad is not very good, I find that Man of Steel, Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice (specifically the Ultimate Edition) and Wonder Woman are all wonderful, solid movies.Justice League is no exception. This movie is fairly solid, I just wish Warner Brothers didn't get so specific on their run-time because this film could have been much better without Brother Eye watching over the length. The action scenes were amazing and jaw- dropping (for both comic and non-comic book fans alike). The Justice League has a comedic factor to it but not to the extent of (dare I say) Thor: Ragnorok or Doctor Strange where the comedy often feels forced upon you. I disagree with the critic score and favour the audience score a lot more. The plot of the film made sense and served as a cohesive story through and through. I am happy and proud to say that I love this movie and plan on watching it again in theaters and buying it on Blu-Ray as well. Spend the extra dollars for IMAX as well if you can, it's definitely worth it. The characters will grab you, the visuals will keep you and you will surely leave the theater with a smile on your face (just make sure to stay until the very end of the film).","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Justice League was better than the last DC movie, but it did not fulfill our expectations.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3863740/?ref_=tt_urv","aayushkharby","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur82280849/?ref_=tt_urv","20 November 2017","So DC fans were kept waiting for over a year and a half after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice for the newest addition to the DC Extended Universe. Director Zack Snyder was being counted on by many to light up the DCEU with Justice League after a showy yet hollow prequel in the form of Dawn of Justice.The movie picks up from where its predecessor ended; the world in shambles after the tragic end of Superman (Henry Cavill). The human race still isn't over that yet though, and Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) and Lois Lane (Amy Adams) still seem to overly brood over Clark Kent. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) is her charismatic yet mortiferous best, dealing out justice with her sword and lasso of truth.Enter Steppenwolf (Ciar√°n Hinds), the big bad guy with the alien army, who aims to milk the opportunity presented to him in the form of Earth after the demise of its Kryptonian protector. Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince immediately set out to recruit their very own fantasy dream team.The plot progresses with the expected bumps and falls associated with the formation of any team (no matter how super it is). Speaking of super things, DC played their hidden card well and kept a heavy cloak of suspense over Kal-El's return.As far as the characters are concerned, the introduction of the new age meta-humans saves the blushes of the DCEU. Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) lightens the mood with his wide-eyed innocence and waggish one-liners, but his character, on the whole, gives out a sense of over-the-top irritation. Aquaman (Jason Momoa) is shown as a stand- alone badass in a perpetual bad mood (it's not as bad as the Hulk's), which fits his character.The real horror, in my opinion, was the ineffective and lackluster performance put up by Batman. A drastic drop in the bat vigilante's character coupled with his struggle to lead this newly formed team points fingers at the actual importance of his role in the DC Universe. Put bluntly, his superhero r√©sum√© would only read the word ""billionaire"".The characters of Jim Gordon (J.K. Simmons), the Police Commissioner of Gotham, and Alfred J. Pennyworth (Jeremy Irons), Bruce Wayne's glorified butler, satisfy, but find only a minimal role in the midst of this inter-galactic battle.However, despite Snyder's best efforts, the morbid and droopy undertone that dominated Dawn of Justice infects the core of Justice League as well. A generic plot coupled with a predictable storyline take away the X-factor we all hoped the movie would possess. In most scenes, the doomy look bears a resemblance to the Upside Down from Stranger Things, and no, that's not a compliment.The monotonous punch fest DC glamorously promotes as the center stage is a melee of overworked CGI and an almost saddening visual wreck. Music director Danny Elfman was able to engage the audience with his enthralling soundtrack, but the ghost of Hans Zimmer looms over the DCEU and his absence was notably missed.Another set of complaints any superhero fan may have with Justice League are the blatant similarities that can be drawn to the MCU. The relationship Bruce Wayne shares with Barry Allen eerily resembles the one between Peter Parker and Tony Stark. Moreover, the concept of the Mother Boxes is quite like the fabled Infinity Stones of the MCU.Although Justice League was an assortment of disappointments, the silver lining was the widening of the plot for the forthcoming sequels. The DCEU is being shadowed by the vibrant and diversified MCU, and they need to seriously up their game if they wish to move out of the second place spot. The DCEU is a far cry from Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy, and the class of Nolan's Batman seems like a distant fairy tale.I give Justice League 3 stars out of 5. I'm unimpressed, but most certainly hungry for more.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Namely Clark Kent's goony CGI mouth. I would rather have the mustache. . . seriously. If shaving is so far beyond out of the question, witch is ludicrous in and of itself, don't do what this movie did. Superman looks like a living flyer for a long missing child, age progressed into adulthood. Other than this most effects were passable, and some pretty cool.Little Flash Person isn't very good, and his part just sucks. The kid is mostly there for unnecessary comic relief in a cartoon of a movie featuring Superman's digital face, looking like somebody microwaved a Bruno Mars action figure. The film didn't need relief, as it never approached serious. Also unneeded is Little Flash Person's entire subplot about being a good boy, and trying to help out his Pap-pap.
There is a point where Little Flash Person claims he is working 5+ jobs. We are to assume his speed makes this possible. . . though only if we are as stupid as Justice League believes we are. Sure. . . use your powers to cut down your work hours when your whole purpose for working is to try to get money. Every aspect of this character is just as stupid, except for the Speed Force effect which is pretty cool at times.Batman sucked, aside from select moments.Aquaman had moments. . . of unintentional comedy.Cyborg was the most interesting character. Too bad he was practically wasted.Wonder Woman was there. Her first scene was fun. . . and she's pretty.Speaking of pretty. . . why is Ma Kent hotter than Lois Lane? I don't fault the movie for that, but I do find it confusing.Jeremy Irons can do better.You got Joss Whedon in my Zack Snyder.Final verdict is five out of ten. A safe middle of the road score for a painfully average film about a digital faced Superman, who's upper teeth look like pillows, fighting a generic enemy with a popular name. I'm disappointed, and Warner/DC should feel bad.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I genuinely appreciate DC films for what they are and how gritty they can be. However, Justice League to me was a big flop and misrepresentation of DC films; it wasn't that good. The story was so wishy- washy that it was hard to even comprehend what exactly was going on. There was this story between a villain and heroes but to me I felt like it was too clich√©. It wasn't a bad film in terms of its choreography but there were a lot of CGI effects used that almost looked too noticing. It was hard to keep your eyes off of Superman's top lip. Regardless, it wasn't awful, but it DEFINITELY wasn't good either. The film dragged for way too long with no real show for action until the climax of the film, but even then, it was still lame. I feel that Justice League let down its fan base to such an extent that it was disgusting. In the end, I found Justice League to be a big disappointment (an expected one as well) and I wish it would have proved me wrong. It's worth the watch if you're into corny hero films, other than that, not too good.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Just Bad. The special effects are straight out of a video game, not fit for the big screen. This is awful. The only thing that saves it is Gal Gadot, if your into guys I guess looking at Aquaman might float your boat but you sure aren't looking for acting , decent story , or script. This just bad. Even the parts with Superman were epiccally bad from the dialogue to the costume itself (are we back to leotards?). Why hire Amy Adams if you aren't going to give her anything to act out? You could stack up all the Avenger character movies (including the first Captain America which was as corny as they get) and each one would likely be better. I did give this a 3, not a 1 or 2, so I am being kind, but it was a ginormous disappointment. Please don't sink Gal Gadot's career on this crap, get some writers, use better special effects (or special effects people) and for god sake ditch Ben Affleck. Hiring him is like buying your kids birthday present out of the bargain toy bin at Kmart when you can afford an entire toy store. Stupid, phoned in junk.

Very very bad work, i hope they will rework on this on the BlueRay release. They can do it.3)It was getting a little bit tooo Marvel/Cartonish with all the jokes on the 3rd act.4)Superman resurrection plan...not so good executed...the outcome thought was amazing!Positives: 1)i want more! 2)The heroes have nice introductions but could be more. 3)Amazing actions scenes! special the 1st few acts (you can feel the Zack Snyder DNA in them i love them!)

Yeah ok the whole killing people thing I get... Same as the Batman issues in BvsS. I had the fortune of not seeing it in the cinema and so I got to watch the extended edition first which again, I didn't think was that bad...

I'm not even going near Suicide Squad as I've managed to expunge it from my memory, good score again though..Anyway, expectations were very low, I'd seen the fan boy reviews before watching it, didn't bother seeing it in the cinema, basically, I could have managed to get by without watching it, but meh, I did. Oh my god how bad are the effects!?! In a bloated big budget movie like this, how does it justify it's budget when you get moustache removal that deforms a face so obviously...

Superman and Suicide Squad I was not expecting much, and I've rarely liked any of Zack Snyder's work. I had slight hope after Wonder Woman, but it was worse than I had expected. The first part of the movie introduces us to a bunch of characters, but the half-assed way the movie tries to gets the viewer to care about new additions to the DC movie universe, The Flash and Aquaman and Cyborg, by introducing some parent issues which have nothing to do with the plot at all for the first 40 minutes or so of the movie was absolutely awful and boring. It didn't help that I knew about these backstories from previous DC knowledge, but friends of mine who have barely any comics/ CW tv show history didn't care either. It's like the filmmakers thought it was just another thing to cross of their list of things that are supposed to be in a movie like this but didn't actually care about. It certainly did not work.We also get introduced to the villain, Steppenwolf. What a waste. Every single line was laughingly bad, B-movie quality. Nothing original or intestering whatsoever. This is a problem other comic movies have at times, but this might be the worst villain I've seen in a long time. Then there's the acting. Ben Affleck just simply gave up after the last movie, didn't he? It really seemed like he hated being in this movie. No emotion, no confidence, just apathy. Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa did their best and were fine, but everyone else... although it's tough to be too hard on Ezra Miller when you look what he was given, absolutely awful jokes and no-one to even react to them. No chemistry at all with any of the other main actors, which is pretty important for an ensemble piece like this! I'm not even getting into Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons and J.K. Simmons who were simply wasted and didn't care at all, just getting a paycheck.Zack Snyder's direction with his usual habits like way too much slow motion for no discernible reason what so ever are present which certainly did not help. Likewise that so much of this movie was obviously shot in front of green screens and Henry Cavill's CGI face and his CGI removed moustache, wow, just atrocious.Also the OST was really bland and boring compared to the rest of the DCEU movies, which at least had notable scores from Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL. In summary, it hardly seemed like anyone involved with this cared about this movie. Hopefully Warner Bros either decide to get some people in who do care, for their sakes and the viewers'.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"2","/10","This ""film"" does everything but justice to the Justice League!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5197138/?ref_=tt_urv","TheHonestCritic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66610649/?ref_=tt_urv","19 October 2019","*The ""movie"" that I'm going to review today is called: ""You Can't Save the World Alone"". Wait, what's that? This ""film"" is called ""Justice League""? You would never know unless you look at the poster with magnifying glasses! Wow, even the poster designer was too embarrassed to acknowledge that this was a ""Justice League"" film. That's pretty bad, isn't it? What a lousy poster, and they don't even have the lousy excuse for Superman on the poster, or Green Lantern! Wow, did they get one thing right?! Film Making 101: the poster should match the concept of the movie you're trying to express, it should not be designed to infuriate people! That's not a good sign when the poster aggravates you before you actually watch the ""movie"" itself, what little there actually is!*""Justice League"" (2017), this was one of the most highly anticipated superhero films of all-time. People have been waiting for years to see a live-action ""Justice League"" film, and this is what we get. They blew it, again! How is this possible?! Warner Bros. Pictures, you own the rights to all of these phenomenal comic book characters and stories, and this is how you express them?! Terrible acting, boring sets/locations, cheap special effects, and an underwhelming soundtrack. The only real passable performance in this ""film"" is from Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. She seems to be the only actor who's actually trying. Everyone else is lackluster, and they put on surprisingly even worse performances in this ""movie"" than in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016). How?! Ben Affleck is boring, Ezra Miller as The Flash is cringeworthy and obnoxious, Ray Fisher plays a dull Cyborg, Jason Momoa is overrated and cringeworthy as Aquaman, and of course Henry Cavill is an insult to the real Superman; Christopher Reeve. Spoiler alert, not that there's anything worth spoiling in this ""film"" though. They bring the ""Superman character"" back to life, but they really should have brought Christopher Reeve back to life rather than Henry Cavill! Also, there is no Green Lantern, who is supposed to be one of the original members of the team. That made a lot of comic book and movie fans furious. Film Making 101: if you're making a movie about a group of people, then make sure all the characters are included! The sets/locations are dull, and are obviously filmed using either blue screen or green screen. It's pretty bad when you can actually tell that the backgrounds are fake! The only real sets used are just plain dull and unoriginal. As for the special effects, I don't even know where to begin with those! To keep a long story short, I've seen more realistic special effects and animation on Playstation video games! Another thing, The Flash does not give off lightning when he runs. I can understand breaking the sound barrier, but he does not produce lightning! Who approved of that idea?! But probably the worst effect is Cavill's CGI face to hide his mustache. The reason he didn't shave was because he was in the middle of filming a real movie; ""Mission: Impossible-Fallout"" (2018). He made the right move choosing to stay 100% faithful to that movie rather than this embarrassing ""Justice League"" parody! The soundtrack has good moments, but overall it's just underwhelming. Danny Elfman is one of my top 10 favorite music composers in cinema. But this one is just feels jumbled and generic in most places. Even the most perfect film makers and music composers have to have at least one dud, and unfortunately this was one of Elfman's worst. The opening credits song is one of the most cringeworthy and out of place songs I've heard in any movie. But the biggest insult is the use of John Williams' ""Superman"" theme when Henry Cavill in a poorly made Superman costume shows up. That just added salt to the wound! How dare you use that music in this travesty of a ""movie""?! That's an insult to the real Man of Steel, Christopher Reeve! This ""film"" is not worth that theme in the slightest. There is one good thing I can salvage from this diarrhea dump of a ""film"", the story. That doesn't mean it's good, but it had a clear focus and stuck to one storyline, with very little to no subplots getting in the way. Overall, ""Justice League"" is yet another dull, boring and unpleasant viewing experience in the sorry lineup of modern live action DC films. Maybe we'll get a real live-action ""Justice League"" film someday. I give this ""movie"" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. One thing I figured I'd point out is that this movie effectively had two different directors overseeing the production; Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon. The reason why is because Snyder's daughter committed suicide during the making of ""Justice League"", R.I.P. Maybe she was embarrassed to be related to a terrible film maker? Hmmmm..... With the ""movie"" unfinished, Joss Whedon stepped in to finish it. Wow, he switched from Marvel to DC? Bad career move! With two different directors, the ""movie"" had an inconsistent tone. Snyder has terrible taste in directors by choosing Whedon, he should have been aware of the failure known as ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015), directed by Joss Whedon and set out to find a better director! Bottom line is, ""Justice League"" does not do the original superheroes justice. Hopefully if they reboot DC, which they should, we'll get a proper ""Justice League"" movie. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this ""film"" as possible. You'll really be doing yourself justice!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

But one of the main problems is the characters.I was unbelievably disappointed to see that; Aquaman was an ass, Batman was depressed, Cyborg was miserable, Superman attacked everyone then had a personality transplant, Wonder Woman had no definitive characteristics, and I still can't decide if the Flash is charismatic or annoying.However, when they try to change this towards the end and make them all buddies, it doesn't seem genuine at all.I understand that sometimes characters need to be miserable, either for the plot, or because that's just who they are, but A: I find it a huge turn off in a movie, and B: you can't have them suddenly be best friends and joking around after being horrible to each other for the whole film! If they wanted to pull that off then a lot more character moments would need to be injected into the script. Even then, I'm just not sure you can build up the Justice League like this in one film.Apart from that, the cgi is some of the most visually unappealing that I've ever come across, the story has been hacked to bits by the editing and is almost incomprehensible, especially in the first act, and the dialogue made me wince at times.Overall, this movie certainly didn't do 'Justice' to these characters. Anyone that has a craving for the Justice League should probably just stick to the animated version, because this one isn't worth your time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Just when you thought the DCEU couldn't get any worse after Suicide Squad","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4027781/?ref_=tt_urv","hunter-friesen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45060413/?ref_=tt_urv","9 January 2018","After directing the disappointing and critically panned Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Zack Snyder has returned with interim director Joss Whedon to make DC's answer to Marvel's The Avengers. Unfortunately, this film reeks of desperation to be lighter than BvS and also keep the high intensity of Man of Steel. The film gets neither of these right and what we are left with is a film that is more annoying than funny and more melodramatic than intense. Apart from the awful Suicide Squad, this the laziest and most disappointing superhero team-up film to have come out in this new age of high-quality comic films. 
Evil has begun to invade Earth since the ""death"" of Superman. Both Batman and Wonder Woman have been trying to make sense of what exactly is going on and what it all means. They find out that the source of this evil is from the villain Steppenwolf, who has come to Earth in search of three Mother Boxes that hold almost unlimited power. Combining all three will unleash apocalyptic power that will destroy all life on Earth. Batman and Wonder Woman must quickly the remaining heroes and create a team to stop Steppenwolf's plan for world destruction. 
While having a very simple plot, Justice League is still very hard to follow. It's easy to understand on a basic level, but hard to comprehend any deeper because of horrendous editing and dull exposition. The plot is also underdeveloped in many key areas, specifically the introductions of the new heroes. Aquaman and Cyborg are barely given any backstory and are very one-dimensional characters. They each behave the same way throughout the film and don't give me any confidence that their future standalone films will be pleasant to watch. The Flash is given a moderately good story, but his character is so extremely annoying that I didn't care at all about him. A whole film around him is something I never want to see, but unfortunately, we will get in 2020. 
Steppenwolf is also one of the worst on-screen comic book villains in recent memory. He is very one dimensional and doesn't have a single memorable trait as all he talks about is death and how is superior to humans. He feels like an eighties cartoon villain that should never have been considered for DC's biggest film. There is also the problem that he looks like a cross between a billy goat and a dead tree. 
Interim director Joss Whedon came aboard the project after Snyder left in order to deal with personal family issues. His goal was to lighten up the film with more humor and boy does he miss the mark. His attempts at comedy through one-liners go over horribly and make the film feel so disconnected from the previous DCEU films. You can't go from the serious Man of Steel and BvS to this and expect things to feel like they are part of one big narrative. 
For a film that had an almost $300 million budget, the money was not used well on the technical aspects. The cinematography, editing, and visual effects are some of the worst I have seen in a big budget film. The camera is never in the right place during a fight scene and the editing is overly quick. A one minute fight looks as if it had fifty cuts and makes the whole thing disorientating and unbearable to watch. The CGI is substandard, especially for characters like Cyborg and Steppenwolf that both rely heavily on visual effects for their look. Both of them can't be taken seriously as they look extremely fake. Aquaman's underwater battle sequence also looked startlingly bad, which makes me worried about his standalone film that will take place completely underwater. 
The fight choreography is also uninspiring and is recycled from previous films as Wonder Woman literally does the same moves from her solo film. She smashes her bracelets together every time she's getting beat and immediately starts winning again. This happens three or four times and each time it gets more and more boring to watch. By the time the final battle comes along you've already seen all the moves that are going to be done. 
The acting overall is bad and every returning character has gotten worse since the last time we saw them. Batman isn't cool anymore and never lets up on how old he is. The one thing nobody needs is a Batman that tells jokes. Affleck couldn't look more bored and tired of playing this character. I feel ashamed to have said that I liked Affleck's Batman better than Bale's after watching BvS. 
Gal Gadot does a pretty good job reprising Wonder Woman but is still underwhelming compared to how she was in her standalone film. She doesn't feel like the leader of the team and doesn't interact well with any of the other heroes. 
Jason Momoa portrays Aquaman just like his character Khal Drogo on Game of the Thrones. He's buff and over manly, but isn't exciting to watch or listen to since he never really does anything interesting except throw his trident from time to time. 
Cyborg is barely present in the film and is not played that well by stage actor Ray Fisher. He's too grim all the time and is tonally way different than the other versions of the character we are used to. There isn't much to remember him by and overall it's questionable if he even should have been in the movie, let alone get his own future film. 
Last and definitely least is Ezra Miller as The Flash. He is downright annoying and immediately ruins any scene he is in. His jokes, relatability, and action scenes are just plain bad. The perfectly adequate Grant Gustin should have been cast instead as he has proved on television he can make The Flash both funny and emotional. 
The DCEU is now zero for five when it comes to adapting its heroes to the big screen and have astonishingly gotten worse as time has progressed. This film had everything going wrong for it and gives me no confidence that any of the future standalone films will be good.

"2","/10","A Product of a Broken Franchise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4098322/?ref_=tt_urv","slicedbread117","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26777495/?ref_=tt_urv","20 March 2018","I never in my life would have thought that the release of the first live-action Justice League film would not have me up in arms with excitement. But even with the stellar 'Man of Steel' that kicked off the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), the three atrocities of film that have followed over the last two years have made that never-having thought a reality. Even with nearly zero interest and the lowest of expectations, getting my own opinion is a must for these films, and there's always a sliver of hope that DC can right the ship that is this mess of a franchise. Not to my surprise, Justice League (JL) met my incredibly low expectations with ease, producing yet another abysmal film and proving that the DCEU is still stuck in a state of desolation.You could say Justice League is an apparent result of two directors and two visions, because, well it is. Initial director/writer Zack Snyder, whose vision for the DCEU has utterly destroyed the franchise, had to step away for personal reasons, leaving Avengers director Joss Whedon to fill in the blanks. This dual vision pulls the film apart, creating a tug-of-war feeling between Snyder's story and tones and Whedon's. For better or worse, Warner Bros. should have made the executive decision to either have Whedon fully execute Snyder's original intents, or to completely scrap it in favor of Whedon's ideas. Even if Snyder's full cut would have made it through, at least it would have had a consistent tone. The divisiveness creates a misdirected narrative which is unoriginal, unfocused and ultimately bland. DC can't seem to hit the sweet spot of proper pacing either, as JL continues the trend from 'Batman v Superman' of an incoherent, poorly edited script, which in turn for me, was often simply boring. I'm not sure who's green-lighting the story decisions at Warner Bros., but this script is another completely uninspired narrative full of plot holes and an enormous lack of vision, but the greatest tragedy of all, is the writing of the characters.When I think of the Justice League, there's one thing that immediately comes to mind before anything else; a team of seven iconic, defined and developed characters at the forefront. JL has many flaws, but hands down, its dearth of compelling, well written characters is the wound that cuts deepest. The writing of just about every character is deficient. They lack, sophistication, lack depth, with little heart to make you care about them. There was little to invoke any sort of inspirational, emotionally engaging response to the characters, which creates major disconnect and in turn gives a response of weak interest. Most characters weren't given proper screen time, or enough meaningful screen time, while some side characters (Commissioner Gordon, Mera) were awesome but wasted in their DCEU debut with no room to develop them, since there wasn't even enough room to develop the main characters. Worst of all, nearly every character felt hopelessly dumbed down. Batman was turned into a comedic Tony Stark rip-off, Flash is given too many corny one liners to count and though I wasn't a huge fan of Wonder Woman's solo outing, she felt infinitely more empowering than she did here.What's not missing is sincere acting talent, but most of it is wasted on the dreadful writing. Some of the actors do their best with what they got; Ezra Miller (Flash), Henry Cavill (Superman) and Jason Momoa (Aquman) are still enjoyable while other high-level stars like Amy Adams, Jermey Irons and J.K. Simmonds are sorely unused on screen. Ben Affleck seems as though he's already given up playing a compelling Bruce Wayne, a major downgrade from his admirable performance in BvS while Ray Fisher's portrayal as Cyborg was terribly one-dimensional.The absence of proper character development can be traced back to DC's initial decision to seemingly rush their franchise's progress to play catch up with Marvel's success. While Superman and Wonder Woman have had their own films, JL proves that well known characters can't just be thrown together without the audience having any reason to care about them, and have their movie sell on namesake alone. It's shameful, because there are bright spots. Most notably Superman, who, when he's actually in the movie, is accurate to the comics and is easily the most enjoyable character. Aquaman and Flash have moments of humor and awesomeness, the former more so than the later, but no dedicated story arcs to provide anything of substance. Had they gotten solo films before this team up, that could've panned out much differently. Batman falls under the same category. His character direction is the most disappointing by far, and as my favorite superhero of all time, he was lackluster. We hear about Batman's 20+ years of crime fighting before JL, but how beneficial would it have been to this franchise to see some of those stories with appearances from other characters before this film. It would have added a level of character development and chemistry that DC just doesn't have. The absence of a seventh member is a dagger as well, with no dedicated Green Lantern being a noticeable hole in the team, but in retrospect, his addition could have further convoluted the script.Then there's the villain. Steppenwolf is the definition of a lifeless cardboard antagonist. Generic motives, the cheesiest of dialogue, and by God, the worst eye sore I've seen since Dr. Doom in the latest Fantastic 4 film. He's presented to be a big bad but isn't entertaining or threatening in the slightest. Steppenwolf makes Malekith from 'Thor: The Dark World' look good, and that's really bad. Not boasting a meaningful set of characters, primary or secondary, buried JL before it could even get going, and as far as Cyborg goes, let's just say he's not only the worst hero in the movie by a long shot, he's one of the worst heroes in superhero movie history.Batman v Superman may have been a hot mess of film, but one thing it had going for it was high-octane action scenes. Justice League, for the most part, can't say the same. There are some cool action sequences no doubt. When the team works together, especially with Superman, it's at its best. There's also an awesome but quick flashback battle scene and an impressive underwater action section that makes me more excited for the upcoming Aquaman film. But at large, most of the action was sluggish and some characters (Batman, Cyborg) were underutilized. The third act in general just didn't deliver the action on the level a film of this grandeur should. What's most shocking, however, is the baffling awful CGI. Like, ridiculously bad. It starts right off the bat with Superman's mustache removal, which was laughably terrible and a major distraction through the film. I already touched on how awful Steppenwolf looked, the backdrops and atmospheres looked thoroughly unconvincing and then there's Cyborg who sticks out worse than a sore thumb, whatever that analogy might be. Batman and Superman look amazing in costume and it delivers minor appealing spectacle, but even with a massive budget, JL is not aesthetically attractive whatsoever.I love DC at large just as much as Marvel. The Dark Knight remains my favorite film of all time, and I discovered a new-found love for Superman following Man of Steel. But the DCEU is in chaos. Iconic characters are being put to shame, a potential juggernaut franchise with excellent acting talent is being wasted with deplorable writing and decision making. Of course, I want to see DC movies succeed but at this point, the best option seems to hit the reset button. Justice League has slim moments of redeeming entertainment value, but overall represents a shining example of almost everything that is wrong with this film universe. The DCEU is a broken franchise, a tidal wave of misery, and Justice League is the latest to suffer from its wrath.3/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Having recruited the best in the business, the team must band together to battle against the evil Steppenwolf and his army whom are trying to find 3 mother boxes which are securely hidden in various locations. However, given the sheer power of their enemy have our band of superheroes perhaps bitten off more than they can chew?I haven't seen Batman vs Superman prior to watching this film and therefore was unaware that Justice League linked back to BVS so you may have to bear with me here, but here are my thoughts on this film...As I've said in my summary, this film is quite entertaining; it has plenty of action in order to try to keep things moving. The character introductions were done in a steady fashion again without being overdone (no unnecessarily elongated back stories). At times there is some good camaraderie between the characters; unfortunately this isn't a consistent aspect of the film and there are many occasions when the film is a little dry and serious - The Flash is clearly there to offset some of this and is one of the best things about this film.I think the main problem with this film is just how unmemorable it all is whether it be the acting or the story; I haven't seen Batman vs Superman, but for me Affleck just is not a very good Batman; I think Affleck is partly to blame as his performance is not great, but I think what makes things worse is how little is done with his character. Gadot is not the best of actresses, but as Wonder Woman she does at least have some fire about her (plus a pair of legs that go on forever and a few shots of her rather nice derriere). Cyborg is just a miserable git (understandable to an extent given what has happened to him), but his character is pretty bland and fails to make any memorable contribution to the film. As The Flash, Miller is at least fun and as I mentioned earlier, I think Snyder used him here to counter-balance the serious tone, but Miller can't really do this on his own (although he does his best). Momoa is OK, but again his is not a particularly memorable contribution.Even if you look at the action scenes which are entertaining to a degree they don't have much imagination (with the exception of Wonder Woman everyone seems to fight by throwing each other into things which becomes repetitive). The story is serviceable, but again isn't all that interesting and at times I found myself waiting for the next action scene (which clearly means there's a problem).So yes it's entertaining & humourous in spots with occasional moments of good camaraderie between the superheroes, but with a number of forgettable performances and a pretty unmemorable story it doesn't really cut the mustard. Give me The Avengers any time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I've had it up to here with just about enough of more than I can stand of super-powered fistfights. I never realized that my comic heroes were actually too stupid to fix things otherwise.
Time for my favorite review line:However, I did take notice of Ezra Miller, who I couldn't place until I looked and realized that he was the monster in what I still contend is a very good horror film: 2011 ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"".

Of course all the issues that came with this production pretty much means that nothing good could really come of it.Two directors, massive re-shoots that changed the plot halfway through. lousy special effects and a bloated budget pretty much meant that this would never make a profit.Supposedly Zack Snyder was fired from the production halfway through and they brought in Joss Wheadon to continue. But that's just creating a mosaic of different styles and tones. You can tell where the Joss Wheadon bits are and where the Zack Snyder bits are. The tone is completely different which makes the movie feel disjointed and trying to tell two stories.The FX ranged from good to absolutely terrible. Superman's upper lip? It looked awful considering they had to digitally remove his mustache. Now you'd figure a big FX company could do it but it made it look all weird. The worst part about it is that some amateurs on youtube actually managed to do it and make it look more natural. The main bad guy Steppenwolf? He looked like a cartoon. And I'm sorry but the Flash when he ran looked derpy as all hell. When the show on the CW actually does a better job of this you know your FX are messed up.The characters ranged from good to bad. Henry Cavill as Superman is good. Gal Godot as Wonder Woman really works. Jason Momoa as Aquaman shows that he can be a badass character even if he's more dude bro than King of the Sea. And the new guy as Cyborg? Not bad. I'd like to see more of what he can do. But Affleck as Batman? I don't get it. He does a good Bruce Wayne which is one half of the character but as the dark knight he just feels wrong. And then there's the elephant in the room namely the guy that plays the Flash. What happened? They turned a light hearted character into a Jewish guy with Aspergers or something. But the running and the derpy look on his face I just couldn't take him seriously in the role.And honestly they're trying to tell too much story all at once. While Marvel took their time to introduce all these characters DC just rushed the whole thing in a vain attempt to catch up. And that's all they've been doing is playing catch up ever since they started.Supposedly there's a Zack Snyder workprint out there that I'd really like to see to see if it's an improvement over what we got. But I doubt it will ever see the light of day.Hopefully DC has learned from their mistakes and will start pumping out the hits but I feel it's a little too late. We're nearing peak super hero saturation now. It won't be very long before people are just sick of it. With luck DC will make a couple more good movies before that happens.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Haven't seen one for a long time, at least weeks.So, the origin story no. 6,389,393 is about forming the Justice League which includes Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, this black cyborg-guy called Cyborg and comic relief guy who looks nerdy but is really fast. The Flash.They will face a demon lord or something, whose army feeds on fear. Yes.If you are keeping up to date with the superhero movies, then you know that Ben Affleck plays Bat, Henry Cahill is Super, Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman, and Jason Momia is cool-looking Aquaman.Ezra Miller as The Flash is perhaps the only intriguing one out of the five main ones but he doesn't have much screen time, so it's easy to be memorable with his fine line between humorous and pathetic, which the actor handles extremely well.With this being an all-star project, you also meet loads of stars from previous superhero movies returning as supporting characters, such as Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen from ""Wonder Woman"", Diane Lane and Amy Adams from ""Man of Steel"", and so on. Nobody really has anything interesting to do, so don't buy the ticket just to see them.Ciar√°n Hinds is somewhat more intriguing as the main baddie, Steppenwolf, maybe thanks to looks which surely must remind the video game lovers of many fantasy epics they have spent countless hours on. But he doesn't have anything interesting to do either, which doesn't surprise, because nobody here has.So... this surely must be one of the more aimless and soulless money-grabs of the whole wave of superhero movies attacking cinemas since the end of 1990's.it's not clever, it's not funny, it's not original, there's never a palpable sense of danger, direction or suspense.Action is heavily edited, over-stylised and over-coreographed, thus not looking very exciting or lively. And the fighting tiredly copies the same blueprint seen over and over since 2008's ""Iron Man"" first introduced it.It means characters mostly flying through air and punching each other, destroying buildings and structures as a result of getting punched so hard that they fly away like rockets. Yes, it was new and original ten years ago but not after having seen it 5000 times or so.The best thing I have to say about ""Justice League"" is that it's marginally better than DC's previous all-stars superhero movie, the dismal ""Suicide Squad"".But it still sucks in every conceivable way. Better avoid. You live only once and can't get those two hours back, feebly waiting for something interesting to happen.There are two ""hidden"" end scenes, one in the beginning of the end credits and the other one right after. I liked them a bit more than everything preceding them. But they are, of course, also short, not lasting 120 minutes as the whole movie.""Justice League"" doesn't deserve neither your money nor time. It often does not even feel like a proper, cohesive movie. More like a good looking trailer... which sadly lasts seemingly forever.The project has had a long and arduous way to the screen, but this doesn't justify the sheer poop they have produced for piles of money and with hundreds of people involved.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

On the whole, I think the Snyder Cut is comparatively better (but far from flawless). From here on, I will do my best to judge the 2017 theatrical version of Justice League on its own merits (or lack thereof).Justice League is, to say the least, a mixed bag. All things considered, I personally hated Man of Steel. I found Batman v Superman to be only *slightly* improved. And Justice League, honestly, was a little better than Batman v Superman, so at least it the franchise is moving in the right direction.There are some things that enjoyable in the film; Ben Affleck is actually really good as Bruce Wayne/Batman and gets what is definitely the best line of the theatrical version. There IS an effort at lightening the franchise a little some knowing humor. Jason Mamoa is really charismatic as Aquaman in both versions, but seems to be having the most fun among the cast with the obviously Whedon-helmed scenes. Whedon also, bad lip CGI aside, actually succeeds at making Henry Cavill's Superman actually act like and have the proper personality of Superman. Also, from a technical level, the film is put together as well as circumstances will allow. There are definitely some editing issues (see below), but the story is told in an economical manner. The opening credit montage actually sets up the entire film pretty well. Also the music of the film is pretty good; Danny Elfman's score is something of a ""greatest hits"" package, using cues from his own Batman score, John William's Superman march, Hans Zimmer and Junkie-XL's Wonder Woman theme, and I'm fairly certain that the ""Hero's Theme"" is borrowed from Jerry Goldsmith's Shadow score. However, every musical cue fits its respective scene perfectly, and the pop songs included during the opening and closing credits also fit the film well.Things that drag it down though are that, while there are Whedon-helmed scenes that actually buoy the film up, others, unfortunately drag it down. There are very obviously shot-by-Whedon scenes that are inserted into other scenes to ""bring humor"" that fall a little short. And while, on the whole, I think that Whedon did a good job of bringing human stakes to the action, there is one scene, where tension has been building through the film and it cuts to a gag that will make the audience groan and groan hard. And the thing that I truly hate about the film is Ezra Miller's ""adorkable"" schtick as the Flash. With the exception of one scene, where honestly Batman comes off as the better hero, it just becomes grating.On the whole, the movie is... okay, It's entertaining enough for a Friday night in front of the TV. It won't go down in history as a great superhero film, but it is as good, if not a little better, as the circumstances around its production would allow it to be.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Besides my personal opinion, this film had no memorable moments, the cgi was horrible when it should have been great considering it is one of the highest budget films ever made. The characters introductions were rushed so there was no character connections with eachother, no one had a good relationship with anyone, hey all just seemed to 'know eachother' not have an actual relationship. This film seemed like the hero version of suicide squad, exactly the same with an introduction to every character. The introductions didn't really give us much information either. Let's take marvel for example, they had many films leading up to the first avengers film, so we would have time to form our opinions on certain characters which is the way films like justice league and avengers should be.
I can't believe i'm saying this but I actually preferred Suicide Squad which shows how bad this film was.
It wasn't the worst film ever but it certainly wasn't a good one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is noticeable efforts to make it lighter in tone with the superheroes giving smirk whenever there is a chance and almost every slam being preceded by a one liner. Though the one liners are all funny, they could have brought that down a notch because at some point it starts looking like they are trying too hard. Some scenes, even Batman has been happily sacrificed of his dignified stature to accommodate one liners.Though the repeated rolling of eyes and the playful childishness essayed by Ezra Miller wasn't even close to the charm of the Marvel equal, Spider man, it was nevertheless a refreshing addition. Aquaman does offer some dude laughs and Wonder Woman looks prettier than before. Cyborg could have been used more and Superman as Clark has added more colors to as a person in this film than he did in his previous two films.
Some scenes had a straight from the Tim Burton's Batman feel with the cinematography and music, especially where all the superheroes land on the roof after Gordon calls Batman with the Bat-signal. The tone is as we have been hearing, inconsistent, from fresh natural light tone to almost nothing-visible-dark, from fresh open corn fields to a reddish-orange palette, I am still not complaining.But one thing I am complaining, would be the villain. According to multiple sources it is one of the costliest films ever made and still if they couldn't get Steppenwolf right then they didn't negotiate well when making the deal with the VFX 3rd party. The action choreography was almost below average, not one scene where one would go wow for a punch or a kick. Zack as a director seems to have a changed a lot in his style, didn't notice any trademark style slo-mos or poetic close ups, a lot to do with his last film I suppose. The run time impressed me, it didn't brood, and concluded even quickly, a fantastic move by WB right before the release amidst huge spotlight.Overall the film is far better than what we have been reading, may be we are all getting too critical about the DCEU and hence they have to work twice as hard to reach the same success of Marvel. Expect nothing but a thorough pop-corn entertainer and you will end up getting much more.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I never saw it until today. I don't hate it as much as some people, but it is a hot mess of a movie. While I didn't dislike every second, there are just some baffling decisions made here (mainly when it comes to editing and writing) that you'd think would be easy to avoid.For the positives? I thought the action before the final incoherent battle was passable. The first act or so really isn't terrible, and when the garish colours aren't too distracting, some of the visuals look alright. The story beats work, but the scenes are generally strung together quite poorly. The special effects, on the other hand, are very inconsistent. Some scenes look like they're from a PS3 game, some from a PS4 game, and some from a PS5 game. Occasionally, it looks like a movie and not a video game.The pacing is relentless and that stops it from being boring I guess? But it is exhausting. It just doesn't feel coherent, overall, and the way some scenes just end so jarringly had me yelling ""what??"" at the screen. And the quips are pretty bad here, for the most part, and this is coming from someone who usually likes the increasingly unfashionable Joss Whedon style of banter (which, given the screenplay credit he gets, he's likely responsible for them here).","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is coming from someone who loved Suicide Squad. But this just didn't do it for me. It had its moments sure, but I was left extremely underwhelmed.I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I'll just rattle off a few negatives.
This was a 300 million budget film. Yet, it just did not feel like one, CGI in areas was actually really poor, but it just didn't have the feel of a huge superhero movie.
The villain. Comes in and makes a huge entrance, but that's it. Doesn't really give us any info on the guy other than he wants to destroy the world and we don't really see him until the end. It was just a poorly done character in my opinion.
Jokes did not land. The limited comedy in this was very forced and just not very funny. The humour was almost to entertain a 5 year old.There are some positives, some of the fight scenes were pretty good and shot well and the main characters were likeable enough. But yeah, it's a bit of a miss this film.

Saw this in 2D in the theater. A good movie to watch on the big screen. Not sure if it would be worth paying for 3D as there was enough good action as it is. I originally decided to watch this because Gal Gadot would be in it, and she's on a roll, even though the Batman vs. Superman movie was probably the most stupidest comic book superhero movie ever. So, this movie exceeded my expectations. Very smart for them to start off with Wonder Woman in action and then slowly develop an origins-based introduction to the less known characters. I really like Miller's take on the Flash. His earlier movies play to his choices of quirky and troubled teen roles. Here he is a kid who feels so lucky to be in the presence of all these super-heroes. I also like his somewhat PG-13 adoration of Wonder Woman. All in all, the Justice League is off to a promising start. If they can try and keep it a little more serious than cartoon-y I think potential Justice League sequels will do well,. Although I still find it somewhat strange to see Affleck as Batman, although he is much, much better in this one that in the previous stupid one.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It feels like they've compressed six hours of script in a two hours flick to pair with the current Marvel's movies. Due to this, there's no character development, and the whole movie runs in such a quick pace it's hard to understand what's going on, leaving a lot of plot holes.Also, the inspiration on the current cinematic Marvel heroes is so obvious that it makes this film a bit insulting to the DC fans. Bruce Wayne tries to overpass Tony Stark's reasonable improvements ‚ÄîVeronica, suits, etc.‚Äî with bizarre gadgets just because ""he's rich"". The Flash is the average teeny buffoon as a copycat of the last Spiderman reboot. Cyborg just looks like the 2.0 version of Vision, and Aquaman... well, it's Aquaman.The worst aspect of the movie is the ""downgrade"" of Wonder Woman. From the Goddess rable to destroy Ares to some kind of female squire who can't deal with a lame villain as Steppenwolf.As a whole, this movie is entertaining, but it has so many flaws it doesn't get lower than 5/10 because acting is more than OK.

""Justice League"" has imitated this with, virtually, the same storyline (saying that, they're all virtually the same) where the world is powerless to this seemingly invincible alien invasion, only to hopefully be saved for those few gifted individuals...except for Batman, who is just rich. Written by Chris Terrio (writer of ""Argo"") and Joss Whedon (who co-wrote ""The Avengers"") have produced a mediocre, recognisable script (alien invasion and what not) but, unlike ""The Avengers"", this film didn't have the superheroes or acting talent needed to create something of that quality despite the characters' potential. The Flash is an interesting hero, having the power of super-speed, produced by DC, but his character comes across as almost unnecessary and powerless some of the time. Not only that, Cyborg's CGI-ed body is poorly executed in scenes, Aquaman is obnoxious (which, paired with cringe-dialogue, gets tiresome), and Batman is the weakest of the lot, when he should be (not necessarily the strongest, physically) not having to reuse the enemies weapons. That's just low and sad, especially for Batman. Even worse for the film's reputation is what it must resort to to stop an powerful alien who just wants to destroy the universe. DC has the heroes capable of standing up to the likes of Marvel, and, despite the lacking optimism of the 2011 film adaptation, Green Lantern would have made a great contribution to the film. But, this predictable, mediocre story makes the five heroes seem utterly hopeless, save Wonder Woman, who is the the only one who actually manages to show a little power, just watch the way The Flash runs, but, saying that, it is still entertaining and watchable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Justice League is leave your brain at the door entertainment; call me a simpleton, but I like movies that are easy to follow; where I don't have to rack my brain trying to work out what it's about (unlike movies such as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy where I had absolutely no idea wtf was going on). And the production design in Justice League was good. Justice League wasn't brilliant but worth seeing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
