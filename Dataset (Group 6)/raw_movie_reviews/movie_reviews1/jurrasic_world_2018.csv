-- Go back to the island.-- Wow, look, dinos! Aren't they...still...amazing?-- Dinos chase humans scenes.-- Evil person tries to implement exploitive agenda.-- Dinos eat some people and roar.-- Don't forget the dino eyeball close up!-- Will the main characters survive to make yet another movie? Perhaps, as I see one is slated for 2022. And yep, I'll probably watch it as I've seen them all.The tension and thrill of the original has never been replicated and nothing new is really ever brought to the table in terms of story or thrill.

Then, in 1993, Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park proved to be a game changer, amazing audiences with realistic prehistoric monsters created inside a computer. The problem since then has been in delivering that 'wow factor' - how can Hollywood keep on thrilling audiences when Spielberg's original set the bar so high? To be honest, I don't think they've found the answer yet.The special effects in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom are technically brilliant, but the film doesn't really do anything that we haven't seen before, making the film as a whole yet another underwhelming experience. In desperation, the film-makers have resorted to more outrageous set-pieces, as well as inventing bigger and badder dinosaurs that never actually existed, all of which requires way too much suspension of disbelief.And talking of pushing the boundaries of believability too far, the notion that velociraptors were intelligent enough to be trained is quite preposterous: they had pea brains, experts rating their intelligence on a par with a rabbit. Anyone stupid enough to try and become a veloci-whisperer would wind up as a meal for the ravenous lizard (except, of course, for the fact that velociraptors were, in reality, only the size of a large chicken!).Other things that had me rolling my eyes: Chris Pratt becoming an MMA fighter to plough his way through countless bad guys; a dinosaur that pretends to be asleep to catch someone off-guard; velociraptor Blue knowing only to attack the villains; the transportation of numerous ginormous dinosaurs to a mansion in the US without the knowledge of the authorities; and obligatory child Maisie (Isabella Sermon) ultimately releasing the captured beasts into the wild because she feels sorry for them. Duh!5.5/10 for the special effects, rounded down to 5 for annoying comedy-relief tech-geek Franklin Webb (Justice Smith) and for Toby Jones. There's never an excuse for Toby Jones.","44 out of 55 found this helpful."

The moment Claire lands on Isla Nublar and encounters mercenaries that should have tipped her off that ghere was a real problem. Nevertheless, she blithely goes along and so does the hero. And are we to believe that the mercenaries show up on a dino hunt armed with standard issue military issue rifles (5.56 mm and or 7.62x51 mm) and sleeper dart rifles? Granted, they didn't intend killing the animals but those guns aren't powerful enough for modern big game animals let alone animals with hides thicker then rhinos, hippos, or elephants. Mercenaries would know this. I don't understand why the film makers ignore such minor details. The fact that they get so many of them worng is annoying,","14 out of 18 found this helpful."

Far from perfect, but surprisingly good, and it includes some of the most beautiful scenes in the whole franchise. There are moments brought real tears to my eyes, and that has never happened to me before in a JP movie.The animatronics are back, and they are superb. They used them carefully and wisely to tell the story. T. rex is awesome. She is the most magnificent creature in the movie, and she got some really excellent appearances, in which she became a menace again.The movie starts with a great opening sequence, and it builds up tension slowly, then all of a sudden it turns into a non-stop roller coaster. The acting is well held this time, and there is little to no cheesiness at all.The nods to the first two films are subtle but well played. The movie is brimful of classic JP set-pieces and atmosphere. Bayona nailed it with set-pieces.As for the cons, the movie has got too loud sometimes, and this made me feel that I need a break. It also dragged for about ten minutes in its third act; these were the main two things that bothered me the most.All in all, it was worth waiting. Not great, but good, and really fun. It's suspenseful, scary, heartbreaking, wonderfully filmed, and visually resplendent. There are three scenes here any fan can consider them some of his favorite scenes in the franchise.Mister Bayona, after careful consideration, I've decided to endorse your park.Long live Jurassic Park.","25 out of 36 found this helpful."

I was a fan of the classic Jurassic Park and even read both books by Michael Chrichton. But i was positively surprised by this newest release of the series.Whereas the first reboot just tried to copy the original movie with a theme park idea and brought not much new into the series and was very boring overall, the second reboot makes alot different. For once the setting is different and not again on a secluded island. It is also alot more exciting with more suspense than the first movie. Also I liked the ending...I would give it 8-9 out of 10.","63 out of 90 found this helpful."

In the end as you can see, heart always prevails. Realistically, the movie has some flaws but deserves at least a 6.5/7. The initial setup is even more absurd then the usual while the connection with the first movie gives you a vague sense of déjà vu, at least for the first half of the movie. The pacing between the first scene and the beginning of the action is slightly tedious and abound of poorly written dialogue. Sadly, the new dinosaurs still have no feathers. Again, the bad guys are evil businessmen who this time around, seriously, and I mean seriously undervaluate whatever they're trying to sell. The movie kicks off with a questionable ethical decision and ends with one that is even more questionable. If you can see past all of that, Jurassic Park 5 is a fun, abate slighty stale ride.
The dinosaurs look amazing. The setup for the closure episode is good and plenty of people get dismembered. What more could you ever want ?","96 out of 162 found this helpful."
"7","/10","Another successful addition to the dinosaur fantasy which treads the oft taken path for the narrative","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4203512/?ref_=tt_urv","akhileshms","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur89144247/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2018","Much like its predecessors, the theme of the movie is still the same. 'It's man's greed that he wants to control nature, but he ultimately fails miserably'. With the enormous budget at their disposal, the narrative could have been far superior, yet in the producers opinion, milking the already exhausted cow is a safe bet! This has to be the single most infuriating aspect of an otherwise wonderful movie. Contrary to the popular belief about that the narrative follows a dull plot-line without much excitement, Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom does have its highs and lows. The movie began with the most scariest entrance to the franchise, but gradually fizzed out as the movie progressed, however a few exceptions peppered in-between, gets the audience to jump up from their seats and makes great efforts to grasp hold of the audience's interest even when the movie deviates from its actual plot. All this added with the technological advancements ensuring that we are served with a wide spectrum of colourful dinosaurs, does make it a wonderful movie to reckon.
In the end, Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom, would definitely end up as a super hit, both commercially and critically with a better narrative, amazing performances by the complete cast and of course the actual Jurassic Kingdom. However, it might not end up as being the best Jurassic Park movie not just for the generation that grew up on dinosaur fantasy but even the generation that has been catered with a wide range of CGI movies.","28 out of 42 found this helpful."

None of the action thrills any audience in cinema hall. Some character are always meant to end their journey which is understood right their introduction in the movie.

I think what bothers me the most is that a lot of the writing is just lazy and not well thought through or truely creative. Instead we get more of the same themes from the original JP films plus some more from JW. (Mutant dinosaur + evil corporate guys)All of the main characters stories are pretty unbelievable and there isn't enough investment in developing their individual personalities / backstory so we understand why they behave the way they do. Sometimes I feel like the major action scenes were thought up first and then the story was just sort of inserted between them as a glue so we have a way of getting from one action scene to the next.If you go and see this film you will probably enjoy it and it will most certainly entertain you for a while but after the moment has passed I am not left with the sense that I have seen something truely groundbreaking. Unfortunately I can't help but compare it to the original Jurassic park film and consider how it doesn't even come close to the terrifying moments of suspence and the brilliant portrayal of the different characters we got in JP1.Given that there are so many 9+ reviews on here maybe i am in the minority but I just feel like we are letting Hollywood get away with lazy writing, which contains numerous plot holes just so we can marvel at some cool CGI. We really should'nt be satisfied with this state of affairs. We should all be demanding better, more creative writing that continues to offer us something new and exciting. This will only happen if we stop rating these mediocre generic blockbuster films so highly. Was it was entertaining? yes without a doubt, but this is nowhere near a 9/10 film and you all know it. When rating these films please be honest with yourselves and send Hollywood a message. Don't let them think that lazy writing is ok. We aren't idiots and we do value a well written and interesting story.","663 out of 1,111 found this helpful."

The tension created in one scene where a dinosaur is creeping up on a child was fantastic. There were a few other moments inspired by the horror genre. I wish there'd been even more. I enjoyed the action sequences in Fallen Kingdom. The frustrating thing however is that the use of CGI was still too often an unwelcome distraction. Not all of the dinosaurs were convincing. As far as the storyline is concerned, that was a real let down. Enough time wasn't spent on the island. I think the idea behind the conspiracy was not very convincing. There was a subplot involving a little girl that I didn't think was necessary; but given that it was included, I'd then say that enough time wasnt spent on it. The creativity of the writers as for the need to create a brand new dinosaur to be the big threat is questionable. Creativity in general was kinda lacking actually. The performances were definitely better. Howard was better than last time. Chris Pratt also improved. There was a scene where he was coming out of paralysis, his physical performance was hilarious. He was also great in any of the scenes that involved Blue, his pet-like velociraptor. It shared a little similarity with the relationship between Dwayne Johnson and George the gorilla in 'Rampage'. As far as the villains are concerned, they failed to make much of an impression. Rafe Spall was ok at best. Toby Jones was sinister, but in more of a cartoonish villain sort of way. Also Ted Levine looked like future dino food from the moment you met him.
In conclusion, this movie was slightly disappointing. However, there were some individual moments that's enjoyable. There were some really impressive action sequences; and most of the dinosaurs looked great. the acting much better; and most of all, the elements of horror in the movie were fantastic. These darker scenes were the highlights.","22 out of 32 found this helpful."

"7","/10","Part 2 is improved by new, interesting action scenes, and impressive set pieces - gotta experience it in the theatre!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4325779/?ref_=tt_urv","TYContact1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur89225840/?ref_=tt_urv","7 September 2018","The original Jurassic Park is iconic, so let's not compare this to that: it's a different era with different technology, and different actors available.Most Part 2 movies have the pitfall of rushed dialogues (assuming all audience have watched Part 1), recycled action scenes (using Part 1 props save $), dragging philosophical review or weepy flashbacks of Part 1 (padding screen time), bizarre sudden change in characters' casting/ personality, or a confusing head trip into the future or some incomprehensible scenarios that makes you wonder if this ""Part 2"" is related to the original Part 1 story at all.Fallen Kingdom manages to avoid most of the pitfalls: the gyrospheres feature again, but under water; this time, dangers on the island include volcanic eruption - it's not just dangerous to humans, dinosaurs have to flee as well (stampede alert!). Without specific references / spoilers to particular scenes, let's just say volcanic eruption has played a role in some intense, touching and/or hilarious scenes. Some plots are predictable, such as ""evil scientists"" shipping off / selling / researching on dinosaurs, an environmental subject explored in Part 1. However, Part 2 spins some humour into the rescue mission. The new characters Webb and Rodriguez are welcome addition to Grady's team.I do not find the plot twist near the ending forced, because I picked up the hints from the scientists' conversations. Part 2 did a good job carrying on the events on the island from Part 1. The storyline is actually more defined and all the missions and side characters have a clear purpose, whereas Part 1 felt experimental, loosely focused, and took awhile to kick into action (no one knew if the reboot would succeed, so understandably Part 1 couldn't afford to make a tight script with non-stop actions). I look forward to Part 3 - hope it won't be a messy ending with mindless explosions...","40 out of 63 found this helpful."

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was a fun enough sequel, but in my opinion it is not as good as the classic Jurassic Park, The Lost World or Jurassic World, but I thought it was way better than Jurassic Park 3! There were a lot of elements of Fallen Kingdom that I appreciated and others that I didn't appreciate and most of that has to do with the 2nd act of the movie and the characters. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are good in this movie and honestly Bryce Dallas Howard has a lot more things to do in this film! I could've lived without some of the new characters they decided to throw into the film, but they were fun enough and some of them were useful and others were just there to be a comedic coward, but the villains.....WOAH let me tell ya about the villains in this movie! Not good, at all and they honestly feel almost like cartoonish villains in a PG-13 movie. However, I thought the Indoraptor was pretty cool and a little better than the Indominus. I liked how the film didn't go to overboard with showing the genetic hybrid that much and only showed in the scenes that it should be in. And I also like how the film's called ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"" because there are elements of this movie that give this movie the perfect title and I'm not spoiling any of these elements! And in my opinion, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is not going to be for every Jurassic Park fan or even everyone in general. Because of the choices the creators made in this film and the direction by J.A. Bayona, this film is it's own story that knows it's not similar to the other Jurassic Park movies, so there will be a mix between a lot of people who love this movie and a lot of people who hate this movie. I personally enjoyed Fallen Kingdom and I can't wait to see it again and I actually would recommend watching it, even if you think it might be bad, because I think that EVERY movie deserves a chance to be seen by audiences before its judged.

She talks Owen (Chris Pratt) into going with her but soon they are forced to make some decisions about the dinosaurs and especially when they realize that they've been double crossed.JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM isn't the bomb that some are making it out to be but at the same time there's no question that it's the weakest film in the series and that's really too bad because there was an interesting story here that director J.A. Bayona just couldn't reel in. It's really too bad because this very well could have been the best of the series but the lackluster direction and lack of suspense really ruined it.I thought the best stuff happened on the island when our leads must try to rescue the dinosaurs as well as survive the volcano. I really enjoyed the scenes dealing with the volcano and I must admit that I think the film would have been much better had it stayed on the island. It unfortunately heads back to land and we get into the second half of the film that deals with poachers and an auction sale of the dinosaurs. The entire third act just didn't work for me due to a number of reasons.I understand movies like this need the viewer to follow the ""suspension of disbelief"" but to me this only works when what you're watching keeps you glued to the screen. You're so caught up in what's going on that your brain doesn't think about some of the things that you are watching. If you're bored with what you're watching, as I was with this film, then you mind starts to wonder and you start picking apart what you're seeing. I mean, how did all of these dinosaurs fit into this one mansion? Wouldn't their weight destroy this place? There are countless other examples where I was just rolling my eyes.Pratt and Howard are in good form but it's Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS) who steals the picture playing bad as only he can. He was certainly very entertaining and I'd say he easily stole the film. As you'd expect the CGI was wonderful looking as was the score and cinematography. Technically speaking the film was good for what it was.However, the problem remains that the direction was rather lackluster and the lack of any real suspense just killed things. I really didn't think the second portion of the story worked and at the end of the day there's no question that this is a very flawed film that is also the least entertaining of the series.","59 out of 97 found this helpful."

There were several plot holes and moments that left me very confused - I left the theater with an empty, unfulfilled feeling. The ending was rage-inducing and it's certain that a third Jurassic World is on the horizon (much to my distaste).

This all changes when the island's dormant volcano starts to slowly erupt, which threatens to destroy the occupants of the island.We are back on the island along with Claire played by Bryce Dallas Howard, the heroine of the previous film who is no longer wearing heels in this flick and is ready to do anything to save the dinosaurs from the dying island. We also have the raptor wrangler Owen Grady played by Chris Pratt, who is trying to reconnect with the raptor Blue. Their rescue mission of the dinosaurs from extinction results into a double cross, a few twists and turns which eventually leads to bringing the expected chaos and disruption to the natural order of the entire planet. In Ian Malcolm's words, ""Life has found a way, again.""This second chapter of the Jurassic World series is an interesting contribution to the overall arc of the series, where we have the known concept of genetics which helped give dinosaurs new life but this time, we see creating a human. Spoiler free alert, the human person who doesn't know they were made in the science lab, makes this very intriguing. Pratts performance is again solid but is shown more of an Indiana Jones mixed in with a human super hero like character. He has an awesome scene with dinosaur other than Blue, which makes you think - is Owen a dinosaur whisperer?? Great comedic timings with his co-stars and great to put him in the action from escaping the volcano erupting to interrupting a black-market campaign.We have a cool cameo with Jeff Goldblum returning briefly as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who keeps telling everyone the risks of mucking around with mother nature but as usual since the very first film, no one listens. The CGI in this sequel is amazing and I am not just talking about the dinosaurs but the whole volcano eruption scene was entertaining with the filmmakers providing stunning visuals. The sequel continues this line of uneasy relationships between man and predator, which isn't bad and we can see this with how the franchise is leaning on Blue, the heroine of this film. On the negative side, as mentioned there are a few surprises however you can tell them by a mile away, but this shouldn't sway you away from the movie. The movie ends and leads the story arc to new possibilities by finally bringing the prehistoric animals with the current animal kingdom. That scene with the lion and T-Rex was awesome.A fast-paced action with a few cool emotional moments, which rushes character development however what more can you do with so many characters and so many plot threads? The filmmakers did well with the execution of the film with great imagination along with the ethical question of cloning. Overall, 7.8/10","21 out of 31 found this helpful."

But as the lights dimmed and the Universal logo faded to ominous sonar sounds, the hairs stood up again and I thought J.A. Bayona (""A Monster Calls"") *might* deliver something really special here. Ultimately though, I left the theatre disappointed... but only slightly so.With extreme topicality given what is happening on one of the Hawaiian islands at the moment, Isla Nublar - home to the now derelict Jurassic World theme park - is in serious trouble due to a volcanic eruption. Swayed by chaos theory expert Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), a US senate committee decides to do.... absolutely nothing, letting the dinosaurs face re-extinction. This is much to the fury of our heroine from the first film, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas-Howard), who now runs a ""Save the Dinosaurs"" group. When all seems lost, help comes from the wallet of philanthropist Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell, ""Babe"", ""LA Confidential"") and his ops manager Eli Mills (Rafe Spall, ""The Big Short"") who propose to fund a private rescue mission: a mission that requires the involvement of Velociraptor-wrangler Owen Grady (Chris Pratt, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", ""Passengers""). But are their motives truly honourable?The film has its moments, with some well-executed action scenes, some nice munching of bad people and a few scenes that are truly touching: shots of a brachiosauruses' last moments is a memorable piece of cinema. But that said, the film is extremely patchy. An exciting (but not particularly logical) pre-title sequence seques into a very wordy and action-free first reel, headed up by Goldblum (always seated: did he have his legs chewed off by a raptor?) droning on no doubt for a huge fee but not for much purpose. The early part of the movie is good however at introducing new characters: specifically the geeky Franklin (Justice Smith) and the pre-requisite 2018 'Times Up"" kick-ass female character Zia ( Daniella Pineda), who is actually very good. As a whole though it's not terribly engaging, leading to even the reveal of the derelict theme park - which should have been a high point - falling somewhat flat.The much trailered volcano scenes that follow are impressive but should have been left to impress in the film. Things ratchet up again though when the action moves to the more confining environment of Lockwood's estate, bringing in arch-villain Gunnar Eversol played by Toby Jones (""The Snowman"", ""Atomic Blonde""), who really should have taken the stairs, and Lockwood's granddaughter Maisie ( Isabella Sermon) who is excellent as the 'child in peril'. Some of the character's actions don't make a lot of sense but they do generate some memorable scenes, supported by Michael Giacchino's stirring soundtrack.So, it pretty much works as an action film, but in terms of character development it doesn't go anywhere in particular: Claire and Owen come out in about the same condition as they came in. I was expecting something deeper from Bayona (with his ""A Monster Calls"" being my personal No. 2 film of last year) than just a 'running and screaming' film.It's also difficult to avoid the fact that after five of these films there's nothing much new under the Isla Nublar sun. Some of the plot here is a retread of the genetic shenanigans of the last film, mixed with the 'off-island' antics of ""The Lost World"". And most of the action scenes are just stripped and re-painted from the earlier films. By the way, staying through the endless credits is worth it not just for getting the full force of Giacchino and Williams' majestic themes: there is quite a nice end-credit scene, illustrating that gambling might involve more than just money in the future!","21 out of 31 found this helpful."

Thanks to 2015's Jurassic World, a film that smashed all sorts of box-office records, the franchise is well and truly alive, and the reason why dinosaurs are back on the big screen in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), both former employees at Jurassic World, agree to travel back to Isla Nublar and rescue a number of dinosaur species before the island's dormant volcano decides to erupt.The idea of evolving the franchise ensures that we don't just sit through the same film of people being trapped on an island with dinosaurs again. You could sense from Jurassic World and the idea of training Velociraptors to follow human command that they wanted to take this franchise in a bold new direction. Events that unfold in Fallen Kingdom certainly confirm this and, for the most part, it's executed rather well.This film has a plenty of cases of smart people doing dumb things but when has there never been a dumb decision made in one of these films? I mean, John Hammond's decision to actually bring dinosaurs back to life is pretty dumb but hey, if he didn't do that, we wouldn't have a franchise right? So, while some of these characters and their actions may be quite irritating, I advise you to just go with it and enjoy the ride. J. A. Bayona throws back to previous instalments with certain sequences but this is most definitely a film with his fingerprints all over it. He delivers plenty of thrilling action but he combines it impressively with elements of horror to ensure that kids may find dinosaurs scary again. The opening scene of the film should be enough to convince you because it genuinely had me excited at what else Bayona had in store for the rest of the film.The effects are expectedly magnificent for a film of this stature, coming to the fore rather brilliantly in a pulsating sequence that sees the volcano on Isla Nublar finally erupt. They really do make settling into this type of film rather easy. What didn't feel as settled was Michael Giacchino's score, which felt bizarrely intrusive at times, not like his work on the previous instalment.Coming to the performances, as they did with Jurassic World, Pratt and Howard serve the film well. Pratt just has that charisma to make just about any role he plays insanely likeable, which makes it clear to see how he's forging such a career for himself. New additions to the cast will neither make or break the film because most people are there just to see the dinosaurs, and in Blue the Velociraptor and the new dinosaur named the Indoraptor, children will have a new favourite action hero and nightmare respectively.I've come to the realisation that they will never be able to make a film that matches Jurassic Park in terms of quality in what remains of this franchise but I'm ok with that. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom entertained me from start to finish and that's what these films should aim for. From the last shot of the film, if they're going with this franchise where I think they could be going, I'll be damned if I'm not in the queue at the cinema.","133 out of 236 found this helpful."

Unfortunately too many plot holes to get on board with.I like Owen (Chris Pratt) and his trusty sidekick Blue the Raptor. CGI is much improved from the first three Jurassic Park's; however the animatronics were so awesome and well used in the first two. The time on the island was beautiful and my favourite part, but of course too short.A few gripes... I wished they would have at least attempted to explain what happened to all the dino's on Isla Sorna. The truck literally jumping itself onto the ferry... at least put some kind of visible ramp on the dock so that it's not so ridiculous. The Indoraptor is extremely poor at its job; prototypes I tell ya. I guess we are suppose to believe about 20 dinosaurs or so, most of which are all different species are going to repopulate and live among us now? And lastly, do raptors have tear ducts? I genuinely would like to know.","25 out of 38 found this helpful."

Somehow, Spielberg made a cup of water and the sound of footsteps far more suspenseful and engaging than anything in this movie. The dinosaurs are just sort of... there. Same goes for Chris Pratt, who features in scenes but only mildly forwarding the story with a few rescues or whatever. There are some cringe-worthy moments - firing a gun underwater to break glass, everyone being submersed but having perfect hair/makeup after, a horribly acted young girl who has the most shoe-horned and pointless subplot ever (as well as a nonsensical, cringe inducing climactic line). So much of the story makes no sense, a hybrid dino is basically produced and supposedly trained to follow laser sighting overnight. Yet has no buildup, suspense or point whatsoever. The whole thing is stranger than a David Lynch movie. Its like a string of bland cutscenes to a dull videogame.","550 out of 974 found this helpful."

'The Lost World' has its admirers, but for me it was a major step-down and one of Spielberg's weakest films, and 'Jurassic Park 3' was even more disappointing.'Jurassic World' was not a patch on the first 'Jurassic Park', but for all its faults and uneven parts it was a massive improvement to me on the previous two sequels and was an entertaining film in its own right that did more right than it does wrong. Seeing the bigger, bolder, darker (generally) and grimmer 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' a few weeks ago but have been behind with film reviewing and with being busy it has taken until now to review it, personally found it to be a better film but can understand the mixed critical reception.First things off, 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' is an incredibly well-made film, it's beautifully shot with scenery that's both colourful and atmospheric and the dinosaurs look wonderful. The dinosaurs also steal the film, not just their designs but also that they're lots of fun and are scary, their scenes are great to watch and there could have been even more than there were. This is especially true with the Indoraptor, who is chillingly bloodthirsty, when attacking it's enough to be glued to one's seat and then jump out of it. Blue's role also has a lot of touching heart. Michael Giacchino's music score is positively stirring, and even includes themes from Williams' score for 'Jurassic Park', which was just a lovely homage and fits within the rest of the scoring beautifully.'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' has a nostalgic quality, some of it is savvy and funny and while not as much as the original there's still a good amount of thrills and fun dinosaur action (especially the scary opening sequence) to be had. Parts are thought-provoking in primarily the first half and the darker and grimmer tone is handled mostly with a good amount of suspense. The direction is neat and while the acting is uneven there are charismatic performances from Chris Pratt and particularly Bryce Dallas Howard, as the film's most developed and evolved character in a film that expands on themes and ideas from the previous 'Jurassic World' and Isabella Sermon like Blue provides some heart. Liked the relief characters, especially Zia and James Cromwell and Jeff Goldblum are nice in small roles.Sadly, the film is not without its drawbacks. The villains are underdeveloped pantomimic stereotypes with confused motivations. Ted Levine is especially wronged as a mere underused cartoon, while Rafe Spall is completely flat and Toby Jones is wasted.The final third, after such a great opening sequence and intriguing first half, has suspense but also gets repetitive and silly with behaviours so face palm-inducing that the character is begging to be eaten (Levine's character especially). Furthermore, the story could have done with a less is more (with elements that over-complicate the proceedings with inconsistent motivations and plot points and ideas not used to full potential) and less rushed approach. Some of the dialogue was less than great with some cheese and verbosity going on.In summary, decent and entertaining but not mind-blowing. 7/10 Bethany Cox","49 out of 81 found this helpful."

Not super dark, but it's definitely not the fun thrill ride the first Jurassic World was sporting. There was too many real life human issues going on. The whole movie is basically about was man kind right to bring the dinosaurs back and sometimes man kind's attempts to advance itself have lead to disasters because All we know how to do is exploit stuff. A marriage of messages that was in all the other films in the franchise, but did not feel so knife in the gut as this one.Though I loved Jeff Goldblum's cameo as Dr. Malcolm, cause it was cool seeing him there, I admit it was preachy, and set that grim tone.I feel like Chris Pratt did not get to shine the way he's good at. Did not use his humorous personality as mush in this film, same with Bryce Dallas Howard. They still have what they have in the first film, but unusual for a sequel it seems more tone down than boosted up.Overall, as cliche as it is to say Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is not as good as Jurassic WorldIt looks like the franchise is going the way of the rebooted Planet of the Apes franchise, in that case I am looking forward to seeing the next movie.","46 out of 76 found this helpful."

The movie is fast-paced, flashy and has more dinosaurs than it has time to properly show. It does stray from the formula of the original movie, but it probably has to. That doesn't mean the movie lacks depth, or that the story is bad. Sure, the story is nothing amazing and it recycles some of the ideas of older movies. But it shows a deeper level of human nature and it places Jurassic World into a bigger picture. It also manages to make you sad, probably more than any of the other Jurassic movies. The locations are gorgeous and the movie breaths a lot of atmosphere. One thing I can see people dislike is that the movie is split in two, with two completely different settings. It's spectacular, it has a lot of dinosaur action, it's pretty, funny and sometimes terrifying. I can't wait to see it again.","115 out of 205 found this helpful."

Take the best moments of the 4 Jurassic films and, put them in a blender. You have the Greatest hits, the best of the best.

The original is a Magnum Opus. this is the BEST sequel in the Jurassic franchise, because of the structure the use of themes at the right time, the direction, taken care of to show all the emotion of the scenes, characters. Subliminal foreshadowing to have you guess what the 3rd will be and how it can top this. Wait for the record breaking, likely 5 weeks at number 1.

Chris Pratt again goes a really great job as Owen, he is funny, entertanting and always delivers the best lines.

There is one scene in particular that is extraordinary well done, you just feel empty and want to tear up during this specific scene. This made for a great first act, but unfortunatly the movie just falls flat after this. So let's be negative now!The main storyline in this movie is well done in the first act, but they never further explore it after that. You just see action scene after action scene and you never have a chance to breath. There is never a scene with a long interesting dialoge. The third act of this movie is just to long to watch with joy. You forget the second act of this movie and the third is too much and too long for you to like.Although I think 2 out of 3 parts of the movie is bad.

I'm certain this fallen kingdom's script was written in under a weekend and never edited.So, you liked the nostalgia from Jurassic World? Well, let's shove an unwanted ten times more down your throat. You like environmental messages? I believe you still have room to shove more down your throat. And you love that young, Spielberg-type comic relief that'll ensure laughs even in the tensest of times? Oops, sorry, the ""comic relief"" in this movie is criminally unfunny.""Taking dinosaurs off this island is the worst idea in the long, sad history of bad ideas. And I'm gonna be there when you learn that,"" predicts Dr. Ian Malcolm from The Lost World: Jurassic Park. And, boy was he right, in many different ways, but in regards to bad ideas, take the volcano.You seriously built the second park on a potentially island-ending volcano? Or was that just a convenient plot device for Part V...oh. Never mind.The fourth Jurassic movie ripped off the first one, so naturally, the fifth installment would rip-off the second Jurassic sequel. It's all about the same characters tricked into going back to the island they barely survived previously and the most obvious evil businessmen who want to take the dinos off the island.I spent a good 60% of this movie viciously shaking my head at actions/reactions that would surely never happen and even going as far as to say outloud, ""Nope. Nope. Nope."" I understand you should have to suspend your disbelief for a movie about genetically engineered dinosaurs, but I'm talking about the impossible stunts, simple physics and increasingly dumb mistakes no human would make but these characters did oh so frequently.This movie was so horribly written, edited and paced, overlong to the point 20-30 minutes could've been cut, darker and yet more dumbed down for kids and not a single character stood out or had an ounce of chemistry with each other. Oh, okay, I'll give the character of Zia Rodriguez some credit. I did like her character.And I loved the special effects in the first third, which is what you would've seen in the trailers. It's just the last two-thirds that progressively fell-apart with the worst message to give. In fact, I kept refuting that dumb environmental decision and added that to my head-shaking exercise throughout.Well, I can say, if you're impressed with what you saw in the trailer, come, stay for the first third and just leave then. Nothing else is worth staying for.***Final thoughts: Can't believe I'm saying this, but Jurassic Park III is no longer the worst movie in the franchise. While III was terrible, this one is incomprehensible. III at least had direction, Fallen Kingdom certainly had fallen.","66 out of 108 found this helpful."
"7","/10","The best 'Jurassic' film since the 1993 original.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4233105/?ref_=tt_urv","domtaylor","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26820808/?ref_=tt_urv","10 July 2018","'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' is, in my book, the best film in the 'Jurassic' franchise since the 1993 original. Sure, the story gets pretty stupid, especially in the third act, and the whole thing is extremely predictable, but director J.A Bayona is the first director in the franchise since Spielberg to be able to craft genuinely tense and exciting sequences. I think that his background in horror really helps him to understand how to craft what are essentially horror and not action set-pieces, and this somewhat captures the spirit of the original. The film also plays with different environments than we have seen before, which adds something fresh to the franchise. It's by far better than its immediate predecessor and, although there is exposition aplenty, the visuals and Bayona's staging of the tense sequences help to elevate this entry to the second best in the franchise. Saying that, it's nowhere near as good as the masterful original and is definitely still a modern popcorn blockbuster. The difference then between this film and the other 'Jurassic' sequels is simple: it's entertaining. 7/10","40 out of 66 found this helpful."

A. Bayona and stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rafe Spall, Justice Smith, Daniella Pineda, James Cromwell, Toby Jones and Isabella Sermon.The plot of the movie might be repetitive and nothing fresh is been offered in terms of story but still with good execution and strong CGI makes the movie quite watchable and entertaining.This time a volcano has got active on Isla Nublar a group of people are chosen to save the dinosaurs from extinction.Acting is great and Chris Pratt again shines in his role of Owen Grady the velociraptor handler and you will start liking him more and more. Bryce Dallas and Rafe Spall were equally impressive, Justice Smith and Daniella irritates in some scenes.Screenplay is predictable but still entertains, the director has been successful in getting sympathy for dinosaurs irrespective of their type and how brutal they can be because they have been created due to the greed of human.The CGI of the movie is certainly praiseworthy. The climax of the movie is predictable but still gives a satisfying feeling with giving a glimpse of now confirmed sequel in making. The movie is brutal in some parts but still this is a typically family movie which can be enjoyed with everyone. Typical Jurassic park lovers will love this movie for normal viewers this movie will not disappoint you if not been able to fully entertain you.","25 out of 39 found this helpful."

Can't think of any others off-hand? ;-)But this was actually fun and moved along quite nicely if you blinker yourself form the history of the previous titles. Action sequences lead into each other with enough pace and nicely interlaced humour that I managed to empty the popcorn bucket without noticing. I does amaze me that no matter what predicament a carnivorous species is in ALL the Jurassic Worlds, their immediate concern is to eat a human. Being hunted, exploding island, falling through trees. Any situation in fact, even when there is a few tonnes of defenseless herbivore nearby. They certainly have a grudge against homo sapiens! I'll take this film at face value and just say it was very enjoyable and refrain from getting hocked on how it came about from the previous title.HOWEVER - and not a spoiler. Please, please Hollywood! When a container of liquid Helium is ruptured, it wouldn't explode in a fireball! Even if you do put a flammable gas sticker on it below the letter ""He"".Of course, the rest of the science is totally sound.Other critics .... Looks.

While ""Jurassic World"" was a great reboot/sequel and an absolute nostalic flashback this sequel had nothing of that and was just more or less milking the cow. Now don't get me wrong, its far from an awful movie but it is sad that it had so much potential and opportunities and missed a lot of that. 
The opening scene was absolutely AMAZING. I was thinking, wow this one will be stunning. Unfortunately that did not last long. The first half of the film was really rushed. No time for character development or even action development. It was like ""okay we have done this stunt, now the next one ... quick!"" The second half was better and served a nice setting for a Dino film ( kind of ""Night at the Museum"" atmosphere) One of the biggest reasons for why the film is not perfect is the really terrible screenplay. So many logic errors, so many loose ends. Not even a c-movie suffers from that. The only saving grace of the writing was the great development of Bryce Dallas Howard's character. While she was rather annoying and useless in the first part she really got something to do here and had some nice material to work with. Also her performance was quite tolerable. Chris Pratt however was boring and really uninteresting here. Justice Smith was a nice addition, while he appears to be annoying at first he really had some scene stealing moments. Daniella Pineda was also fine and it was good to see James Cromwell. Ted Levine was an absolute underdeveloped stereotype. Isabella Sermon was the absolute MVP in the acting area. Rafe Spall gave us an awful villain character. Poor performance. Toby Jones and Geraldine Chaplin were totally wasted. And dont get me started about this short and forgettable Jeff Goldblum cameo. 
Now to the most positive aspect: J.A. Bayona. He made the best out of the material and created a really amazing atmosphere. His images were absolutely great and he was able to create a true old fashioned monster movie. Really scary at times with some unforgettable scenes. 
The effects were also very good. I was a bit disappointed that the music score had almost no references to the original and not even to the first ""Jurassic World"" theme. That would have helped a lot. The editing was sometimes off. But the ending was really good and shows in what (potentially great) direction the third film will go. Its a nice watch and quite entertaining but missed the characteristics that made the other films so great.","25 out of 40 found this helpful."

Nothing in this film is worth your time other than Jeff Goldblum's 3 minute cameo which book ends this film and reminds you on why Steven Spielberg's first two Jurassic epics ( The original ""Jurassic Park"" and Its true Sequel ""The Lost World"") were so damn good.

While I will never tire of seeing really cool dinosaurs on the big screen, I'll probably never avoid frustration from a poorly written and poorly acted film. On the bright side, I got to see this at the Grand Opening of the beautiful new Alamo Drafthouse in Denton, Texas. A 66 foot curved screen with the best available sound system made the dinosaurs that much more impressive, while simultaneously exposing the acting for the disappointment it is ... especially the almost impossible to watch Bryce Dallas Howard.J.A. Bayona directs this follow up to the 2015 JURASSIC WORLD, but he's saddled with a subpar script from the writers and director of that previous entry, Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow. The creatures of the late, great Michael Crichton deserve better. In addition to the aforementioned Ms. Howard (as Claire Dearing), Chris Pratt also returns as the smirking Owen Grady, and this time he flashes some fighting skills that would make Jean-Claude Van Damme proud. Not sure how his experience training baby dinosaurs and building a cabin in the mountains prepared him to single handedly take on an army of armed mercenaries, but such things are possible in a cartoon ... which is exactly what this plays like: a live action cartoon with high dollar special effects.We have a spoof of a villain in Eli Mills, played by an over-the-top Rafe Spall, a quivering techie played by Justice Smith (PAPER TOWNS), a tough Paleo vet in Daniela Pineda (MR ROOSEVELT), a dying billionaire former partner of John Hammond played by James Cromwell, a greedy capitalist who should be twirling a mustache in Toby Jones, a big-gun toting badass by Ted Levine, and a good-hearted housekeeper played by Geraldine Chaplin. Mr. Cromwell and Ms. Chaplin add a touch of class in their all too brief scenes. BD Wong is back doing things with dino DNA, and sadly, Jeff Goldblum probably filmed his two courtroom scenes in a couple of hours. One nice addition is young Isabella Sermon, in her screen debut. She is part of the only decent twist in the story.Despite the disappointments, it remains awe-inspiring to see the dinosaurs on screen. If only those moments weren't ruined by such superfluous bits such as a close up of Ms. Howard's footwear to prove that she's not wearing high heels in the jungle this time. Director Bayona has three very fine movies under his belt: THE ORPHANAGE (2007), THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012), and A MONSTER CALLS (2016). He's likely to make more good films during his career, and this will surely be a box office smash because people love seeing the dinosaurs, and are willing to overlook the people. As a frequent movie goer, I'm just unable to cut slack to a mega-budget film that expects us to overlook shoddy writing and laughable acting. We don't expect to recapture the (25 years ago) magic of Steven Spielberg and composer John Williams in the stunning JURASSIC PARK, but we do expect a better effort than this.","30 out of 47 found this helpful."

Reason 1: first of all, press the button is not the hero and heroine who have deep feelings with dinosaurs, but the little girl. Who is the little girl? Knowing her father's inhumane business, she was mercilessly treated by her father, witnessed the death of her only grandfather who loved her, and finally realized that she was cloned. Isn't that what happened to dinosaurs? At the beginning, it was recreated to meet people's needs. It was also ignored and treated mercilessly on the island. The little girl is brave in nature. She loved the story of dinosaurs since she was a child. After suffering from multiple blows, she thought that the suffering of dinosaurs had much in common with her own. If you are a little girl, you can bear to see the ""same kind of people"" struggling with death by inhaling poison gas? Even though the protagonists and heroines wanted to protect the dinosaurs, they held back. And the little girl can't bear it, because unlike other people, she and dinosaurs are the product of people's recovery for their selfish needs and against the laws of nature. If the reason for the recovery of dinosaurs is that the little girl released dinosaurs is a fruit. The iniquities of man's own making will be borne by himself.
Reason 2: I want to make it clear to the audience that it is the Jurassic world, not the Jurassic Park. Now the Jurassic world has taken the second film, the key word of the world must be cited. The setting of releasing dinosaurs is just right to take the audience to the Jurassic world, rather than take them back to the Jurassic Park for sightseeing. People will be tired of this series after watching many ""Parks"", and the setting of releasing dinosaurs will give new vitality to the Jurassic series, and the story of dinosaurs in the whole world will be more shocking and attractive.
So please don't spray out the dinosaur again. These settings are not added casually.","14 out of 21 found this helpful."

The movie is divided into two major parts. The first half is where our heroes are trying to rescue the dinosaurs off the island before a volcano erupts killing them all. The second half is a bunch of dinosaurs being sold in a black-market auction, only to have them escape and chase people around a haunted mansion. If you can't tell from the description of those two halves, I will just tell you: This movie is insane.I've never understood why the characters are trying to save the dinosaurs. It makes even less sense for Claire's character to be doing this. I guess they're hoping that no one remembers her character from the first movie, she might as well be playing a different person. At its core, Jurassic Park was a ""Frankenstein"" story. It is a cautionary tale of certain things man was not meant to create. But as opposed to trying to destroy the monster and learn from their mistake, the people keep trying to save these scientific abominations. The only man talking sense is Ian Malcom. Which, I hope you weren't expecting much Jeff Goldblum in this movie. What you see in the trailer is basically all the screen time he has in the movie.I understand that Jurassic Park is a science fiction series, but there is some science nonsense they say in this movie that goes beyond any suspension of disbelief. And there are some truly idiotic decisions characters make that no one would be stupid enough to make. Here is a quick list of examples of dumb things that happen in the movie:
1. A dino hunter keeps a collection of dino teeth. A dinosaur pretends to be sleeping so the dino dentist will try to extract a tooth. The dino then winks at the camera and eats the fool.2. A man asks someone to call the police on themselves. The man does not turn himself into the police and instead kills the man.3. The scientist makes a dinosaur programmed to eat people designated by a laser pointer. If they could hit them with a laser, why couldn't they just shoot them?4. The auctioneer shows criminals the designed dino and tells all of them that this dino isn't for sale. They were just showing them it because reasons.I could go on. The stupidest decision happens at the end of the movie, but I won't spoil that one. Oh, how the once mighty have fallen.","6 out of 7 found this helpful."

And I have to be careful not to be writing a rant against ignorant revievers instead of an actual review. So, to get it out of the way: It's interesting to note that most negative reviews on this film circle around unrealistic premises and plot points - even the eloquent reviews, and eloquence should be a sign of wisdom. Seems it isn't. People, how many times over do we have to state it: Films like these do only EXIST because realism is not core of the story. These films need to be plausible - or at least probable -, but not realistic. That's at the core of the genre. If they'd left out everything unrealistic in the film, there would be no film. And no, the first Jurassic Park movie was in no way more realistic. There are no more dinosaurs walking the earth, and there will not be any for a long time to come (if any). And it's absolutely OK for such a film to stretch suspension of disbelief from time to time, to show stupid behaviour of people and technical inaccuracies. I really don't care that the wailing Brachiosaurus is probably too heavy for the dock he's standing on. Seeing it being left behind and facing its death breaks my heart, and what kind of person do you have to be to rather be facepalming yourself during that scene instead of immersing yourself into the story? The little technicality with the presumably weak dock is by no means distractive to the story, and it is very clear why people need to point it out, along with a scathing sneer: It is more important to have a reason to join the nitpicking contest with narcisisstically motivated ranting than approving of obiously very good overall work. The story is so old: Someone took a long time to build a beautiful sand castle, so let's destroy it with one quick blow. And why do those haters keep complaining about sloppy and unimaginative writing? In a world with 8 billion people and after a long storytelling history, there is only a finite number of very intelligent, surprising and new plots left to be written (if any at all). So what do actually want? Films like this not being made anymore? I have another suggestion: Just stay away from film genres you don't like. Yes, there are expensive yet stupid and wholly uninventive and sloppily written blockbuster films out there, but JWFK is by no means one of them!And now straight to the point: JWFK is one big surprise. It ups the ante of the series significantly, and I found myself being surprised that this is my second favorite of the Jurassic Park films (right after the first one). And that credit goes primarily to director J. A. Bayona. His vision and the capability to bring it on screen is just remarkable - and that's not easy to achieve. It's not a surprise that NOT everyone is a director these days, despite contradicting claims. The staging, framing and lighting of the dinosaurs (the auction and the confrontation on the glass roof in particular), Bayona's timing, his work with actors and imaginary creatures is just great. At no point of the film I felt left cheated, bored or even insulted, as some other people say. It was just one impressing, thrilling, aesthetic rollercoaster ride. And it's also the first time in the series (which I have been an avid fan of since 1993) that I really feel with the dinosaurs. Despite earlier tries to make them (in part) the victim, the previous films where centered more on the people being the victims of dinosaur-related mayhem. But this one made me think for the first time that it was maybe wrong to un-extinct the dinosars for their own sake (yeah, yeah, you guys figured that out long before, I know), and the character of Maisie Lockwood plays a pivotal role in that realization.I could go on and on with positive traits of the film, but there are other reviews here to find them. I have turned 46 recently and seen too many action-adventure, sci-fi, mystery and thriller films. I am bit bored by my own inability to find impressing films anymore and would love being able to start over. But I vividly remember, JWFK made my cinematic 2018. It it the best action-adventure I have seen this year. J. A. Bayona and his team have built one very beautiful sand castle. If you think you can relate to my self-characterization: Watch it. You won't be disappointed. By the way, if you are interested: I' am one of the people who loved 2017's KONG - SKULL ISLAND. I'm confident that if you liked that one, you will like this one, too - or the other way round.","60 out of 91 found this helpful."

They spoil way, way too much. Many of the movie's best sequences, or at least fragments of them, are shown in the trailers. Several times I found myself thinking while watching the movie, ""I know where this is going because I saw a clip in the trailer."" Now I'll give a quick plot overview of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. After witnessing the carnage, chaos and death that ensued during the theme park's meltdown in the last movie, you may be wondering why any human would ever set foot on the island again. It's a very reasonable thought. In brief, all the dinosaurs on the island are going to become extinct after the island's volcano erupts. Nature is clearly trying to tell us something, right? Just let nature correct the mistake humans made in bringing back the most dangerous predators to ever exist. While we're thinking about the volcano, I'm also curious about why the founders of the park ever chose to build on an island with an active volcano that could wipe out all nearby life. Seems like poor planning. Also poor planning, is endangering human lives with a rescue mission to an island with an erupting volcano.Against all logic, operation: Save the dinos has its supporters. An animal protection group, headed by a less steely and less robotic Clair Deering (Bryce Dallas Howard), convinces a billionaire to fund a mission to rescue the dinosaurs. But, oh no! The team needs help tracking Blue, the last surviving raptor. Cue raptor trainer extraordinaire Owen Grady (Chris Pratt). Those two are joined by a paleo-veterinarian (apparently a real thing) and an annoying tech guy who is afraid of absolutely everything, including bugs and planes. As you can imagine, he does not hold up well around dinosaurs. I'm not sure why the scaredy-pants character was ever written into this movie. He's meant to provide comic relief, but isn't that why Chris Pratt is here? Pratt is actually funny, and he's wasted in this movie, relegated to a puppet of a character, who showcases none of the charismatic cool he demonstrated in the prior film. Beyond the obvious character development flaws, there is one unavoidable issue: I don't agree with their mission. How can I root for these heroes if they're doing something indisputably foolish? I love animals, but these particular animals have killed countless humans and will surely kill more. I cannot support risking more human lives for this mission.That's not the movie's only problem. For one, the directing is spotty. A few sequences will wow the viewers, as long as they haven't already seen these clips in the trailers. Director J.A. Bayona has a background in horror that becomes evident in this movie. He creates dingy lighting and makes clever use of shadows as dinosaurs approach their victims. When the dinosaurs fully reveal themselves, Bayona knows to focus the camera on teeth, claws and eyes--the scariest parts of the creatures. Some of the action is legitimately scary. Other times, it's cartoonish. One scene in particular feels like something you would see in Scooby-Doo. The issue with the action, other than being occasionally cartoonish, is how often in leans on callbacks to past Jurassic movies. Sure, the concepts are fun and well-executed, but we have seen them all before.Here we are at the fifth movie in the franchise, and the filmmakers are clearly out of fresh ideas. They're banking on fans flocking to see the movie solely because it has dinosaurs. I demand something more from my movies, and you should too.","99 out of 177 found this helpful."

In doing so, director J.A. Bayona and screenwriters Derek Connolly and Colin Treworrow covers wide range of contemporary social issues, and this is the most curious aspect of the film. It's safe to speak now that ""Fallen Kingdom"" clearly attempts to be thought-provoking story, even it's still a big, bright popcorn blockbuster with dinosaurs.Be sure, dinosaurs are here: they're big, they're fast, they're deadly! You'll see a lot of action-packed sequences, and witness the fall of the prehistoric kingdom under volcanic ashes. But this film is probably the first in the series which clearly centers much more on humans interacting with other humans, and relatively rare using traditional ""humans vs dinos"" theme. It's not a perfect choice to make, because due to lots of human affairs something feels missing in the story, and dinosaurs play lesser part in this than in any of previous movies. What is also surprising is the social commentary. If ""Jurassic World"" was the film about greed for fun, ""Fallen Kingdom"" is the film about corporate greed. Its lust for money that drives bad guys here, and this point has a great illustration during the story. The film also has several references to environmental issues, such as preventing the extinction, and questions probability of a coexistence between man and dinosaurs. The main question, however, is about should people ever save what already extinct and was re-created? The answer Is given, but not in straightforward way, this is a pleasant surprise in such kind of films.I wouldn't say this film is the most interesting part of the franchise in terms of entertainment, and it certainly has a lot of minor flaws, but it's still an enjoyable ride into the world of Jurassic Park.","83 out of 166 found this helpful."

After the astronomical box office of the fourth film in the franchise, making it the fourth most profitable in history, it was reported that the Jurassic World sequel was already in development. For the sequel, Trevorrow is only a screenwriter and executive producer alongside Steven Spielberg, leaving the Spanish J.A. Bayona in charge of this second part. Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, B.D. Wong and Michael Papajohn reprise the roles that brought life to Jurassic World, while Rafe Spall, Toby Jones, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Daniella Pineda, Isabella Sermon, Kevin Layne, Geraldine Chaplin and James Cromwell arrive at the franchise.In Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, three years after the closure of Jurassic Park, a volcano about to erupt puts life on Nublar Island at risk. There is no longer any human presence there, with the dinosaurs living freely. Given the situation, a decision needs to be made: should one return to the island to save the animals or abandon them for a new extinction? Determined to rescue them, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) summons Owen (Chris Pratt) to return to the island with her.The series tries to circumvent the danger of exhausting the theme. ""Fallen Kingdom"" is the return of the franchise to its greatness, without relying only on its past. In the hands of J.A. Baoyna, the film quickly leaves its characteristic of adventure to embark on a science fiction that, even with light moments, gains aspects of horror thriller. The photograph gets darker and leaves aside the tacky moments that existed in the 2015 film. The director brings a new look, closer to the fantasy horror, but the repetition of situations and the frank precariousness of the dramaturgy again indicate that the series has difficulty reinventing itself. The director's ability to deal with the dimensions of a catastrophe film, already attested in ""Lo Imposible (2012)"", guarantees the necessary pace and urgency in all sequences on the island. In the same way, the sensitivity to terror exhibited in ""El Orfanato (2007)"" results in some scares and moments of decent tension. In addition, the filmmaker manages to give personality to many of the scenes, which represents a considerable leap in relation to the bureaucratic direction of the previous chapter. The advance, however, is only from a technical point of view - however competent he is, Bayona is stuck with a weak script. Although he does not have the same obsession with the self-referring fan service of Jurassic World, this sequel cannot escape the consecrated turns in previous films. When the film builds on its original trilogy, Jurassic Park, bringing features like Jeff Goldblum's or quotes from earlier times, she makes sure not to leave the new audience out. Everything is quite explained, although the film takes time to start.Here, the director is competent to show the arrival of dinosaurs in the world of men, as seen in The Lost World. The entire first half of the film takes place with the exposures of the motives and the capture of dinosaurs on Nublar Island, about to be hit by a volcano of enormous magnitude. This first part yields great moments of tension. The initial scenes showing a T-Rex chasing one of the employees who was sent to the island to obtain the DNA of the Indominus Rex, being preceded by a suspense created by a clever lighting game in the vegetation that revealed the T-Rex's sneaky approach phenomenal. Subsequently, the flight from the island of the protagonists and the dinosaurs also yields exciting moments, especially in the scene of the fall of the movement capsule, seen in the first film. The sensational aquatic sequence-plane that occurs during the volcano's eruption, proof of how comfortable the director feels with his camera for manipulating the images. And tributes to Spielberg's classic, of course, are not left out.After capturing the animals, when the action leaves Nublar Island and is transferred to the world of men, the film manages to maintain its suspense and the viewer's interest. The mansion's climax setting is reminiscent of a medieval fantasy castle - complete with large windows, parapets, an almost dragon and the moon's backlight on a cloudy night - and Bayona once again performs a contemporary horror that dialogues with European horror fables. The happy choice to combine animatronics and computer graphics makes the animals more convincing than in the previous feature. The care in the design, however, as well as the submerged sequence shot and the bold upside-down cameras, are not enough to denote the lack of subtlety in some moments: it must be the first time in the cinema that a dinosaur cries. The filmmakers dedicate their attention to symptomatic issues and not to fundamental problems, making gender and generational dynamics more current.The script tries to create a breakthrough in the evolution of the protagonists in a less likely way. Right away it is understood that the characters of Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, for example, are not the same. The directors seem to believe that Chris Pratt's charisma is enough to push the protagonist, who has no dramatic arc: from the beginning of the previous feature film to the conclusion of the new one, Owen remains the same. Claire, in turn, is undergoing a transformation as radical as it is unlikely: from workaholic who refers to dinosaurs as ""items"" to the activist in favor of the rights of creatures. At least the flirtations between Claire and Owen, something that stopped The World of Dinosaurs, here is relegated to three or four scenes, which even allows Bryce Howard to get rid of the shadow of the figure of Pratt, taking a more active position in the script.The arrivals of Justice Smith and Daniella Pineda bring new, fun and effective characters to the feature. Ted Levine also looks great on the scene. Even with light scenes, this time the children's participation, characteristic of Steven Spielberg's films, is much less cliché. The participation of the young Isabella Sermon is much better justified than just a commercial issue, and the issues surrounding the discussion about family run away from the clichés found in most Hollywood films and would gain a much deeper aspect if the script knew how to explore better. Unfortunately, the film still wastes talents such as Jeff Goldblum, Toby Jones, James Cromwell and Geraldine Chaplin, in brief and unimportant appearances.It depends on the level of abstraction of the audience and nothing else, some flaws in the script, specifically in the development of the characters, are notorious. In addition, although the scenes are well done, the danger does not seem extremely real. Some humans run more than dinosaurs, but this time, they are at least not in high heels. Nothing that will hinder the use of the feature to the general public, but a more demanding spectator may end up bothering with the ""armor of protagonist"". No moment in the film is really surprising, but that is not uncomfortable. After the last twist - a subplot that the film overvalued from the start with the mystery of photography - is delivered by the villain without any consequence to the plot, it is definitely clear that this Jurassic World 2 is not a character film (human).There remains hope for new looks with some particularity, such as that of Bayona. On this hook, the film even makes some ethical reflections about endangered species and humanity's responsibility for animals, bringing, above all, scores about the consequences of genetic advances and the risks of the lack of legal regulation on the subject - even for it is a new field of science - which makes changes in the image beyond the possibilities of monitoring and inspection by the authorities, leading private institutions to extrapolate barriers without a previous analysis of the moral perspective.Spielberg's dinosaurs, unfortunately, have not yet found the renovation they are looking for, and even though this new adventure does not pass with indifference (and it is the first to achieve such a feat after the original), the smart and economical way is still needed, without that excess of noise and lights, with which Spielberg brought Michael Crichton's book to life. Jurassic World continues to fulfill all the requirements of past franchise resurgences, and has a lot of fun during its two hours.However, ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is an entertaining film, which entertains in a much more mature way than Jurassic World. Dynamic, when the feature gives you time to breathe, it is usually to move you. The problems of the previous film are gradually erased and its novelty is not only the aesthetic change, but also the script and its future implications, which should give an even more new face to the franchise. Even those who are not excited to know that Jurassic World would win a sequel, should end up hoping that the franchise does not end there. And speaking in sequence, the end of this film is very open, and makes it clear that we will have a sequel, which will probably show a planet where humans have to learn to live together and, who knows, compete for space with these new / old species.","9 out of 13 found this helpful."

The dinosaurs are threatened with extinction by the pending volcanic explosion. Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is working to save them with her NGO. Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda) and Franklin Webb (Justice Smith) are two of her workers. She receives a call from the Lockwood estate. Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell) with his assistant Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) plan to relocate the dinosaurs to roam free on another island. Ben is caring for his granddaughter Maisie. Claire recruits ex Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) to find his raptor Blue.This movie is basically divided into two sections. The first section is similar to a Jurassic Park sequel. It's been done before. The Claire Owen pairing improves a little if only she's no longer wearing heels. There are a lot more nagging tiny issues. I don't think the morality debate serves much for the movie and sounds quaint in the present environment. It should be taken out of the tired congressional hearing forum. Even with Goldblum, it can't help but be tired. It's really questionable that the trio remained free after crashing the truck onto the ship. Time and time again, the bad guys ignore the obvious move to kill them for some unknown reason to let them live. The motivation to find Blue is also problematic from the start and it does not stop being problematic even after the twist. That brings the second section which is a monster in a house movie. As a monster in the house story, this has some thrilling action sequences and horror scenes. Looking behind the facade, there are the silly dino for military side track, the weird unconnected clone story, and one obvious tranquillized twist. Both these sections work to some extent, but all these issues and more contribute to dampen any enthusiasm.","9 out of 15 found this helpful."

In this continuation, Owen and Claire set out to save the dinos from Isla Nublar's now active volcano. However, the men backing them have more sinister motives behind this venture in mind, leading to a nail-biting confrontation with a new hybrid, the Indoraptor.The studio heeded the fans as practical effects are much more prominently used in this film than the last one, allowing for more effectively intimate moments between humans and dinosaurs and, boy, do they look fantastic (the CG is good too). As always, we also see new species in this series from horned predator Carnotaurus to bone-headed Stygimoloch with Rexy and Blue back to dominate the spotlight. The way the action was handled is interesting, going from the grand scale of a volcanic eruption to the smaller, claustrophobic tension of the new facility with the animals. The Indoraptor, while more-or-less a smaller version of the Indominus Rex, is a little scary, has more personality, and isn't as ridiculously overpowered as its predecessor, though it's pretty flawed as a killing machine compared to its larger predecessor. Creds to the music as some tracks stuck out like the grim choir singing in the hybrid's scenes. JW also managed to muster a few powerfully moving scenes, one of which nearly made me cry. The cast all did their jobs well given the material at hand, though Justice Smith annoyed me and it's a little jarring that Owen and Claire's relationship has taken a step back when the film begins.I have some few bones to pick with this one (no pun intended). As usual, there are slimy corporate villains which, while competently acted, aren't engaging/entertaining to watch. In fact, they are by far the worst, most 2D villains in the series. There are a few idiots that make such obviously dumb, illogical decisions that lead to very predictable outcomes. The one thing that nagged me throughout is that the film doesn't acknowledge the second island Isla Sorna, which is full of dinosaurs, which made the rush to save the ones on Nublar exaggerated. This led to much confusion about the continuity of the series. The film also throws many nods to the first two films to the point where it gets distracting; in fact, the basic story ideas are copied from ""The Lost World"". The volcano's existence also throws the whole concept of the park into question. Perhaps the biggest missed opportunity is a plot twist involving Isabella Sermon, which, while an interesting idea for the franchise, isn't explored nearly enough as it could've been and has little to no bearing on the story.""Fallen Kingdom"" is a step down from the last one in many respects despite a few improvements in certain areas. It delivers on thrills, likable-enough protagonists, and does ask a good question about the dinosaurs' rights of simply existing. On the other hand, the writing is terrible with many plot holes, uninspired villains, and there are too many nods to the older films. Dare I say, ""Jurassic Park 3"" is better put together.","37 out of 63 found this helpful."

I have to say that this was not my impression of the film, in the context of the previous films the plot was plausible and followed nicely on from the last film.
 Of course the plot is somewhat predicable, but that as been true of all the Jurassic films, why expect anything else?. While the first film was a roadshow for the latest in visual effects. this treats the dinosaurs as almost ordinary, in that there is no only a little 'awe' in their presence.

"","","Make Dinosaurs Extinct Again","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4333085/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","11 September 2018","Do you remember the first time you saw a dinosaur on the big screen? It was like a miracle. We all had read about them in books, some of us had seen the bones in museums but it wasn't until Steven Spielberg took us on that unforgettable adventure that was 65 million years in the making that we actually fell in love with these extinct species.Now, the park is gone. The once realistic-looking dinosaurs are gone. That sense of wonder is gone. That sheer joy felt when seeing a dinosaur on-screen is gone. In fact, everything that was good about this saga went away when it was revived back in 2015. Riding purely on nostalgia, Jurassic World broke box-office records yet everything about it was meh. And this sequel is even worse.Set 3 years after the events of the last film, the story of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom follows Owen & Claire as they return to Isla Nublar in an attempt to rescue the dinosaurs from an extinction-level event after the island's dormant volcano becomes active. Believing that the species are being relocated to a new island sanctuary, they discover a conspiracy that can disrupt the natural order of the world.Directed by J.A. Bayona (best known for The Orphanage & The Impossible), the second chapter in the Jurassic World trilogy actually makes its predecessor look good. Easily one of the most lifeless & soulless blockbusters to surface in recent years, Fallen Kingdom is pathetic on all levels and suffers from same set of issues that plagued the first film. While there is an attempt to go for a darker tone, the end result is indiscriminately dull.Not a single person in the story is worth caring about, except for Jeff Goldblum who returns as Ian Malcolm but his is a cameo so it doesn't count. The few twists it has in store are revealed in such dull manner that it doesn't even add anything to the experience. There's no atmosphere, no build-up, no suspense, no danger, no feeling of awe or amazement, and whatever little action does exist in the final print, it comes off as superficial & superfluous.One thing I remember complaining about Jurassic World is that despite years of advancement in VFX technology, the dinosaurs in Spielberg's films looked much more realistic and Fallen Kingdom only reaffirms it. Our stupid antagonist isn't even remotely intimidating. Performances are just as terrible as last time, if not more, so I wouldn't even talk about it. And Michael Giacchino contributes with a tonally fitting score but the images betray the seriousness of his tracks.On an overall scale, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom fails at even the basic aspects of storytelling and is a bland, tedious & uninspiring entry in a series that ran its course a long time ago. Best suited for those who would buy everything as long as a dinosaur is thrown into the mix, Fallen Kingdom is one hell of an eyesore I never ever want to visit again, for it manages to do what none of its predecessors could: make dinosaurs boring.

As the movie opens, we are on ""Isla Nublar, 120 mi. off the coast of Costa Rica"", where the previous movie was set, and site once again of all kinds of problems. We learn that a volcano threatens the entire island, including its dinosaurs. Should they be saved? Dr. Malcolm testifies before the US Congress about it. Meanwhile, we learn that Claire is now president of the Dinosaur Protection Group, and determined to save the dinosaurs no matter what... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: the movie is directed by Spanish director J.A. Bayona, who 5-6 years ago brought us the terrific Tsunami disaster movie ""The Impossible"", Here he goes even bigger, working from a script by Colin Trevorrow (who directed ""Jurassic World"") and Derek Connolly. When ""Fallen Kingdom"" works, it is sheer fun. This is particularly the case in the first 45 min. of the movie (dealing with the active volcano). After that, not so much. You can just sense the filmmakers working way too hard to try and come up with a story line, ANY story line, for the last 75 min. of the movie. But what they came up simply does not work all that well. Not to mention that the movie is simply too long: cut about 20 min. of non-essential stuff, and we'd have a better film for sure. Bruce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt are fine, but frankly we go see this not to see them, but to see the dinosaurs. Apart from the overall weak narrative, the dinosaur action scenes are terrific from a technical perspective, with ever-more life-like details.""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" opened wide this weekend and over-performed at the box office. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was sold out to the very last seat. The viewing public's appetite for dinosaur action is seemingly insatiable... Already the next sequel is being planned and in the works.It will be released in June, 2021, yes like clockwork, every three years. If you are a fan of the ""Jurassic"" franchise, you definitely will want to check this out, warts and all, and hopefully in the theater, as a movie like this begs to be seen on the big screen. If you are new to the ""Jurassic"" franchise, this should be your last point of entry in the franchise..","5 out of 8 found this helpful."

Isla Nublar, the home of the dinosaurs for many years is about to fall apart thanks to a volcano that has apparently gone active on the island. As such, it is up to Owen and Claire from the previous film to work together with a mysterious group to help bring the dinosaurs to a safer location before it's too late.I like the first Jurassic World, mostly. The characters outside of Claire and Owen may have been on the bland side, but I still thought the effects and story were still pretty good either way. When it comes to the effects, they still are really good. The CGI from the dinosaurs to the volcano eruptions look incredibly convincing, and the production design of the movie looks beautiful. Some of the dinosaurs weren't even created out of CGI, some were done through the means of animatronics, and I couldn't tell much of a difference myself.The story, however, was a mixed bag. There were some elements that I really liked, particularly the dark and thrilling scenes. A large majority of the previews and trailers of this movie take place on the island, where they all begin their escape. That takes place in the beginning of the movie and puts the movie onto a great start. However, I feel like the plot begins to go downhill, where we get some very dumb cliches, the main villain, for instance is a walking cliche. After the whole escape from the island, the next 45 minutes or so become very tedious. We don't necessarily learn anything new about the concepts in the Jurassic Park franchise. Instead, it mainly involves bickering about money. There is a concept that does feel like it was rehashed from Jurassic World which I won't get into for spoiler reasons, but at the very least it elevates the conclusion and makes it enjoyable to watch.Something that also bothers me about this movie is that there are certain times where it feels like it tries to set up a sequel. The ""twist"" after the beginning feels like it's trying to derive from the main plot in order to set up and continue the plot from this movie into the next installation. I know I'm not necessarily alone on this because there is a Forbes article talking about this.Despite my criticisms with this movie, I still enjoyed it. I already talked about the visuals. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's performances were really really good. I loved the darker and tense moments that kept me on edge during both the beginning and the climax. In general, I genuinely enjoyed the experience despite my flaws with this movie's storytelling and I wouldn't mind picking up the Blu-Ray when it comes out.6/10","5 out of 8 found this helpful."

And yet I rated this movie 6 out of 10 stars you might think?Well, yeah, I gave it 6 out of 10 starts because this movie was entertaining for what it was. And what was it? Well, it was a mixture of all the previous movies compiled to make this movie. So if you have seen the older movies, both the ""Park"" and World"" movies, then you have essentially already also seen ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"".The visuals were astounding, as to be expected from a movie such as this, and let's be honest here, the action and the CGI is what kept ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" afloat. The CGI was, as it has always been in this franchise, realistic and visually beautiful to look at. The dinosaurs are realistic - well, as one would assume dinosaurs would be - and that is pleasing on the eyes.""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" was almost totally void of having a solid storyline. Again, everything here has been seen before, and it made no sense why they did the things that they did in the movie. Yeah, let's move the dinosaurs from the isolated island and bring them in on the mainland, whoa, wait a minute, haven't we seen that before? Check. And running away amidst a herd of stampeding dinosaurs and not get trampled, haven't we also seen that before? Check. Taking the DNA from dinosaurs to clone and genetically alter to make a super dinosaur, ring any bells? Check.Actually, that last bit with them creating the new hybrid was so ridiculous. They knew what happened with the Indomitable Rex at the Jurassic World resort, so why on Earth make something more powerful, dangerous and just downright nasty? It made absolutely no sense what so ever.The acting in the movie was adequate, as it has been throughout the numerous movies in the franchise. However, don't bet your money on any outstanding and award winning performances here though.""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" suffered terribly at having a rather watered down and poor script and plot, but was shamelessly salvaged by the grandiose special effects and CGI.You know what you are getting here when you sit down to watch a movie in this franchise, so take that as you might - a warning, an advice, or just a flat out statement of truth. This movie will not challenge you intellectually in any manner, so just unstrap your helmet, buckle in and enjoy the ride.","8 out of 15 found this helpful."

Fallen Kingdom is so lacking in surprises, anyone who's seen more than a handful of movies will foresee every little thing. The amount of series clichés is staggering: some forced reason for going back to the island, recklessly dumb militarized villains, rich men making ineptly evil decisions, some dangerously upgraded dinosaur, the T-rex's last-minute rescue...it's a slapdash mix of familiar (non)awe and (non)terror. 
The ethical concept is a decent: what obligation do we have to save once-extinct creatures from annihilation? Unfortunately from there, very little time is spent on actual plot and character setup, opting for annoyingly blatant exposition in order to get to the forgettable action quicker. The film is covered in poorly-written character making inexcusably bad decisions, and corny story-beats leading to laughably ill-advised emotions; at one point, I swear I saw a dinosaur tear up. 
I honestly had high hopes for this one with director Bayona (Monster Calls) at the helm, and he does manage a couple of strong visuals (roaring dino being engulfed in ash) and mildly tense thrills (underwater Gyrosphere). But with writing this bad, there's only so much one can do to save it. 
I get that making these movies is like printing money; of course studios are going to continue the series. But after 25 years and 5 movies, we've yet to come close to the greatness of the original. As Ian Malcolm so deftly put it: ""You were so preoccupied with whether or not you could, you didn't stop to think if you should.""","39 out of 68 found this helpful."

Owen and Claire return to Isla Nublar in order to save as many dinosaurs as they can while they will try to avoid a volcano which is ready to erupt on the island and destroy all life there. Another thing that they have to keep in mind is that a conspiracy has taken place that can disrupt the natural order of the entire planet.I have to admit that I expected more from this movie and since I was not a fan of the first one, I have to say that this movie is just an average movie and nothing more. The plot was a bit boring and in some points, it was just like we were watching hide and seek. Regarding the interpretations, I have to say that Chris Pratt who played as Owen Grady was once more amazing and very funny. Once more the interpretation of Bryce Dallas Howard who played as Claire Dearing was average and I believe that she did not rich her potential. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Rafe Spall's who played as Eli Mills and he was very good at it. The direction which was made by J.A. Bayona was not as good as the first one and since I am a big fan of the first trilogy and especially to the first Jurassic Park movie I believe that Jurassic World cannot even reach it.Finally, I have to say that ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is another average movie with dinosaurs and nothing more. Unfortunately, this time some good interpretations and good CGI's cannot overcome the bad and boring plot. If you are a fan of dinosaur movies I am sure that you are going to be let down by it and if you are a fan of the first movie or the first original trilogy of Jurassic Park then I am completely sure that you are going to waste your time watching it.","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

Bayona's 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.' While this was billed as one of the event films of 2018, it quickly becomes clear that 'Kingdom' is inferior to its predecessor in many ways.We quickly get sucked back into the perils of the park in the opening scene, and from there a new story is born. Many wondered where things could pick up after the events of 'World,' and so the concept in 'Kingdom' is probably one of the most logical options they had to work with (rescuing surviving dinosaurs before Isla Nublar blows its core). However, once we're about halfway through the film, we reach a jumping off point that's hard to recover from. It's fair to say the events that take place on the island are the highlights of the film, and everything that happens thereafter is a major disappointment.Sure, the wonky chemistry between Chris Pratt's and Bryce Dallas Howard's lead characters makes up for some of the ridiculousness, but it's not enough. Even the cameos from Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm are kind of ""meh."" The new cast introduced here - Justice Smith and Daniella Pineda as two dino-loving sidekicks, the former being more comic relief, James Cromwell as the wealthy financier of much of the research responsible for events since 'Jurassic Park,' Rafe Spall as the estate custodian with ulterior motives - are not all that impactful. Isabella Sermon makes her debut as the granddaughter of Cromwell's Lockwood, and is one of the bright lights in an otherwise dark story.But it's the dinosaurs who really run the show here, from everyone's favorite raptor, Blue, to the unassumingly lovable stygimoloch to pretty terrifying lab-created beasts like the indoraptor. The scenes that feature these creatures are definitely engaging and are worth the price of admission, as the CGI is on-point and one of the highlights of 'Kingdom.' But again, this is rarely enough to carry a movie.Despite a lot of hype and expectations, 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' falls far below where it should be, as its predictability doesn't do it any favors. Although there is setup for further adventures, it's hard to see a case where we can get back to the glory days of this franchise.","40 out of 70 found this helpful."

Keep your expectations realistic. Every single Jurassic Park has the running theme of morality behind it as it applies to the question of human responsibility over technological development and now that we've crossed that line unapologetically, what is our moral role as keepers of our own creation? No surprises here, same story, different point in the timeline.What makes this Jurassic Park any different? It's all about feelings. I'm not going to give any spoilers, but I'd say, much like Star Wars, we're simply seeing a rehashing of the original trilogy. Welcome to the Lost World of Jurassic World.I still love Land of the Lost - the original TV show, so as long as Hollywood wants to pump big money into dinosaur CGI, then I'll keep enjoying it for what it is.

The script is so bad, like, SHOCKINGLY awful. It lacks any genuine thrills and since this is a Jurassic Park movie, that's terrible. It repeats the same boring love story from the first Jurassic World and Chris Pratt isn't as charming as he usually is which is just straight up sinful. The CGI and effects are very good, but that's really the only upside to this broken dumpster fire. It has a stupid and awful script, bad characters, mediocre acting, a moronic twist and it lacks any thrills or decent attempts at humour.

Dino-mania never ceased to exist, certainly since the Jurassic Park movies. I just like to look at dinosaurs. If you don't like them, you won't like the movie either. 'cause ok, Lets be honest, this movie only survives on special Dino-effects, action and humor, sometimes borderline slapstick. The story line is secondary. This is pure mindless entertainment.What bothers me a bit is the fact that it's kind of a remade story of Jurassic Park 2 when they too go back to the island... And some movies are ok to be remade but not the original JP's. Why? They are classics spanning over 2 generations.
The movie lacks originality, but then again, where am I gonna see fun man eating Dino's in action... Only in Jurassic World.","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

May be better on a second viewing? Every scene was basically a lead up to one of the shots in the trailer(s). If you've seen all the trailers then you've seen the movie, what you haven't seen is the filler between all the moments in the trailers. Like Jeff Goldblum? You've already seen his entire part in the trailers, in fact, they cut out a couple of his trailer lines in the movie. If you've seen the Thai trailers with additional footage (like I had) then the entire experience will not have any punch. It was alright, it was not a bad movie per se. Owen and Claire, though cute as always, are relatively useless in this movie. They extract some blood and escape a jail cell, that's about the long and short of it. The majority of death scenes are ""implied"" which is lame, though there are a couple of decent kill-count moments. I didn't like the music during the volcanic explosion, it sounded really cartoony and out of place. There are no great flourishes like Blue's ""Lost World"" cue in JW1 and the main themes from JP are not used (bar one piano note melody and JP theme for credits music). Nice to hear the JW themes but even they aren't used much.Blue is probably the star and even she gets very limited time on-screen. All that aside though, it's probably fine, fun and scary for kids. And I have to accept that my fandom for JP comes from enjoying it as a kid. I think as a kid I would find it a very entertaining dino movie. As a pretty hardcore JP fan, I was left underwhelmed, but not entirely disappointed. There was still Blue, and dues-ex-machina Rexy, and Owen & Claire. The effects were decent enough, but as a whole it just never seemed to quite come together. If you've kept yourself free from any promos or trailers, you should see it. All the iconic moments from the movie won't have been spoiled for you. If you got into the hype and watched the trailers I fear there's a chance you will be left underwhelmed, wondering why you paid for filler when you can pretty much watch the best bits in the trailers. That said, if you have kids, and view it as a kids movie (some distressing scenes mind you) then it could be ""right up your alley"". It wasn't right up mine, not even the back alley. But yeah a passable JP with Blue who remains a legendary raptor, so 6/10.","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

The previews for it did NOT do any justice to the film and actually tricked me into thinking we would get just a cut-and-paste of The Lost World, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case.
In terms of CGI, the film was phenomenal. The dinosaurs looked incredible, and the Indoraptor had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
As far as story goes, however, it was somewhat lacking. While I do have to give the film kudos for somewhat improved dialogue and plot originality as well as realistic world-building (as realistic as a dinosaur film can be anyway), there's not much else beyond that -- it's just your standard JP franchise film with people inevitably trying to hide from the big bad dangerous lead dino and screaming bloody murder, which is why I gave it 7/10 stars. Still, what they did have in regards to story was done modestly well, and was fairly enjoyable. I particularly liked the nods to older JP films that were included from time to time.
Overall, I recommend going into this with an open mind. While it may not live up to the classic JP films and isn't everyone's cup of tea, it was a pretty good movie for what it was, and I'm far more inclined to rewatch it than I was when I saw the first Jurassic World movie.","9 out of 18 found this helpful."

However, when comparing this to its predecessors Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom stands as the most unique entry in a generally one note franchise, with the later acts taking place in a different setting with a different tone. Now this tone is somewhat inconsistent, and the emotional parts fall flat, but the suspense is good and some of the comedic aspects are fun. The film is an uneven mess, but it's certainly nice to see something new than something bland and predictable like Jurassic World or the other sequels.Also literally every call back it made to the first film was terrible please stop doing that it's really annoying","12 out of 26 found this helpful."

If you go into it expecting anything anywhere near the likes of the original Jurassic Park, you are setting yourself up for disappointment.  Visually, I have no gripes, the practical and cgi effects were convincing and the cinematography is masterful. The great cinematography contributes to the overall suspense of the film. There was one particular scene that was filmed all in one take underwater which was downright the most suspenseful and intense scene in the movie, and it didn't even have any dinosaurs. The actors and actresses also did a fine job for what they were given.  The concept of the story is a step in the right direction however it was executed disappointedly due to poor writing. The less than average script can also be seen affecting the film's pacing since the first and third acts are paced generally well, yet in the second act the story comes to a complete halt. Where one scene our characters are running away from dinosaurs and an erupting volcano the next they're in a Manor trying to stop evil corporations which just slows the pacing down by a lot. Also in the second act, if the slower pacing won't throw you off, the change in setting will. The transition from the island to the Manor was too quick and the change may seem a bit jarring to most viewers. The characters were easy to get behind however that is mainly due to the fact that we witnessed the previous movie, they aren't really given anymore development other than Claire's transition between films and Owen and Blue's continuously growing relationship. Other than that the poor script the actors were given just made Claire and Owen seem alright and some newer characters bland, but interesting enough to understand their motivations. Lastly, this film is a fun rollercoaster ride of a movie and I am proud to say it is a Jurassic Park film I can recommend.","6 out of 11 found this helpful."

Apparently Jeff Goldblum could not be bothered to show up to the shooting location, so they had him filming his scenes as testimony before Congress. Lame. Eventually they get around to the dinosaurs, and some action sequences that are similar to the last movie. They even use the same side of the mountain, where the new crew of precocious teens finds an old gerbil exercise ball from the last movie, just when all hell breaks loose. The ball is in brand new condition, not rusty or covered with weeds as if it had been laying around in an open field for 7 years. Nothing new or ground-breaking. Chris Pratt kept petting his favorite dinosaur on the head, and I kept hoping it would rip his arm off. Chris Pratt is annoying to watch for a full two hours. The dinosaurs are still sniffing out the human prey. Considering that their senses are 50 thousand times better than a human, the dinosaurs can smell and hear every move, and the humans in every scene should have been torn to shreds and eaten. But none of the goody two shoes kids gets bitten. This is a Spielberg kiddie movie. Teenage minorities and lead characters never get hurt in any of the Jurassic Park/World movies. I was hoping this would finally be the movie where all those politically correct 3rd world teenagers get ripped to shreds and T-Rex takes a big dump on their corpses, but NO. The action and dialogue in this movie is a rehash of the previous films. Same deep thoughts. What right do we have to clone dinosaurs?? 25 years later, after mega billions in sales, the hypocrisy of the ""save the dinosaurs"" discussion is hard to ignore. Fallen Kingdom has not one original idea. Stale dialogue backed up by bland, boring, and bloodless dinosaur action.","24 out of 40 found this helpful."

I loved it when I first saw it and I have never stopped. The sequels never did reach those heights again, but they were a good bit of fun, delivering the action that you would expect. Fallen Kingdom, however, is the first time I really felt like I was tiring of the whole mess.The island of the dinosaurs is ready to blow up, thanks to the never before mentioned volcano. Owen and Claire set out to save as many dinosaurs as they can before that happens, but a sinister 3rd party has other plans.The Jurassic sequels have all been silly, which has been part of their charm, as well as one of their main issues. Fallen Kingdom though is not silly...it is stupid! This is a Spiderman 3 situation, where everyone is doing their best, but the script is so bad that it is all for nothing.I can't get over how poorly written this movie is. The story and characters have too many inconsistencies to ignore. Motivations change at the flip of a switch. The geography of the island it noticeably changed to suit this films needs, such as the mosasaur lake being moved from the island centre to the coastline. And then there is the mess that is the hybrid and the cloning towards the end.They also hired two really annoying actors to play two really annoying characters. British actors are putting on bad American accents, and American actors are putting on bad British accents. This director is clearly not experienced with blockbusters. There are some overused sound effects, noticeably reused sets throughout the film and an unwillingness to challenge the writers and producers for the story. It has a really boring bit in the middle, and most of the early action scene are very lacking.All of that being said, there are some incredible shots in this film. The director knows how to make a horror film. The build up to any dinosaur is very well done and intense. It has some of the best effects of the series. The animatronics aren't as strong as they once were, but the Cgi is top notch.Towards the end, when the film goes completely off the rails, it is a lot of fun. Fun in that way classic Roger Corman movies were fun. Just dumb but full of energy. The gothic imagery helps out too. There is some good acting from our leads and a bunch of unintentionally hilarious moments.Fallen Kingdom is a misstep for the series, and is possibly its first major one. There are good moments, and excellent visuals throughout. But this script is very messy. After this we got Jurassic World Dominion, which I also reviewed here. Until that one came out, this was easily the worst of the series. But it is worth a watch if you are curious.","3 out of 5 found this helpful."

Asking which came first is as debatable as the chicken and the egg conundrum but the fact remains that 25 years on, the concept of cloning is as progressive in the real world as it is in cinema. In that line of thought, Crichton's 1993 cinema adaptation - Jurassic Park - finds itself cloned for the fifth time but as it turns out, what was once artificially magical is now organically ordinary. Fallen Kingdom's basic setup is to take the audience back to Isla Nublar, where after the pandemonium in the last film Jurassic World, dinosaurs now roam freely in a theme park decimated and reclaimed by nature; and nature is very angry. With the island now volcanically active, all the dinosaurs face extinction from the imminent eruption. Not again! That satire is kicked up a notch with a grand cameo from Jeff Goldblum, who besides cutting the ribbon for this 25th anniversary celebration, adds a bit of franchise nostalgia and insight into what is about to happen. The plan is to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island and who better than John Hammond's chum Sir Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell) to hire Claire and Owen to get the job done. Simple as it sounds but where's the fun if everything goes according to plan? There's more to the story that's best left for the audience to discover but that's all you need to know about the plot. What follows is an action packed first act followed by a sluggish middle section topped off in a finale that's a bit dark and whacky. Has anything changed since the last film? Not much but Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire isn't trying to outrun dinosaurs in stilettos anymore. On the other hand, Chris Pratt reprises his charming role as Owen but is nowhere near as funny as Star-Lord. Together, and like the last film, their onscreen chemistry is as palatable as a dollop of ice-cream on a sizzling steak. The real meat, literally and figuratively, is the dinosaurs and they've never looked better. From the terrific underwater opening montage, to Owen's fully grown raptor friend Blue, to the film's new and ferocious hybrid called 'Indoraptor', Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is at its best when there's a dinosaur on screen. To that effect, a staggering scene where a Brachiosaurus looks at the audience while the island implodes on itself is worth mentioning as the film's most memorable moment. As much as there's a lot of mayhem and fun in the film, Fallen Kingdom lacks the heft to stand out in the franchise. That's a bit of a letdown for anyone expecting a worthy homage to the original. Having said that, the introduction of a new character, along with and an interesting plot development suggests vast potential in giving the franchise a new twist. If Dolly the Sheep went on to deliver six lambs, then there's no reason Crichton's beloved dinosaur epic won't see a sixth installment. For now, it suffices to say that although Fallen Kingdom isn't anywhere near extraordinary, it still has enough bite to officiate the 2018 summer movie mania.","11 out of 30 found this helpful."

Lifeless, cynical sequel is a textbook case of a once innovative idea being stretched well beyond its limits; there's no sense of joy or imagination, no real sense of adventure, and eventually it all falters into some kind of Jurassic horror movie, with characters whose motives and actions are so inexplicable you're left wondering how it manages to go on for as long as it does. Goldblum and Cromwell are wasted, Pratt and Howard are reduced to caricatures amongst all the souped-up carnage and effects, and the rest of the cast members are given nothing substantial to work with. This might've been worthwhile had it been well directed...but clearly it's not, and feels like an inferior rehash of 1997s The Lost World: Jurassic Park. **","11 out of 30 found this helpful."

Partly that is true, but although the storyline is simple it does have a few unexpected moments. This film is like a rollercoaster, lots of adrenaline and great tension, too many action scenes can become boring, but in no way that happened here. It took us a while to come down from the rush. Good humor in the right moments. Also lots of cheesy moments and a lot of unbelievable jumps from scene to scene. But all in all a nice addition to the other films.

Blame that on a writer guild so poor on talent for so many years, and movie makers so poor on talent for so many years, that now the clueless are giving the instructions and deciding which scripts to use. The words spoken sound like someone just randomly picked words out of a dictionary, not big words, just words and phrases no one uses naturally.Then there's the sound. It goes from whispers of characters to the loudest bangs, up and down, and you'll spend the entire movie turning the volume up and down if you can.Then, there's the muddled directing and editing. The idiots making this movie think we can tell one dinosaur from another when they're on screen about a millionth of a second at a time, and everything just whizzes by.

This is nice, because some of the characters are rather annoying.
They've also created a new sense of sympathy within the movie that goes beyond just the surface. You want the characters to succeed, and you feel bad when things don't go as planned. There is an actual villain this time (and he makes sense too), instead of just the dinosaurs eating people.
And finally, the 128 minutes run time is on par. There's enough time allotted to get you involved, but it's not long enough to become a drag.It won't make as much money as Jurassic World, but it's a full tier better.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

The mass production has had an impact here because while the first Jurassic World felt the same way - it seems better now by comparison. There is so much with Fallen Kingdom that seems half-hearted, and indeed the consistency of this is the only thing that is consistent. We know the casting of the kids is important, we know that the baddies are being established only because someone has to be eaten, and we know that any narrow escape will always be just that - an escape. With all this knowledge there is no real peril or excitement, and the bigger the spectacle the more hollow it feels.The production standards are super high through, and this does help it. So as daft or convenient as so much of it is, it does look and move great throughout. The noise and sights are probably enough to keep you with it as long as you have your phone or something else to distract - I cannot imagine I would have been too happy in a cinema with this as my sole focus. In the end it feels like a film retreading the success of others, but not really trying to recreate so much as just keep the brand moving forward. It has enough to be entertaining in certain context, but it does feel heartless in the most part.","4 out of 8 found this helpful."

With the usual eye-rolling plot contrivances and ludicrously thin character development, this sequel won't garner many new fans. But talented Spanish filmmaker J.A. Bayona (replacing out-of-favour Colin Trevorrow) adds a bit of spice; his horror roots coming to the fore in the final act to craft some tense and exciting mansion-bound set pieces. It's a clever move shifting the action-after an unexpectedly enjoyable first-act disaster sequence-to a more confined space, the physical limitations helping to ratchet up the tension. There's a healthy spattering of humour and tongue-in-cheek knowingness, but the repartee between Chris Pratt's Raptor-whisperer Owen and Bryce Dallas Howard's Dino-lover Claire gets stale in a hurry. Bayona's zest behind the camera, and his willingness to veer towards the scarier side of the franchise, makes this a decent enough sequel, however Fallen Kingdom is hamstrung by its reliance on formula and penchant for silly moments.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

This movie is populated with set-piece puppets who serve no other purpose other than to be killed in rather dumb fashion or shown to have outright questionable 'sense' of things ultimately leading them to their deaths. 
Fallen Kingdom is an unnecessary continuation of a nostalgic franchise because who would want to continue preserving creatures who'd threaten the fabric of our modern society? At least Star Wars had the logic of having remnants of an old empire reform generations later as opposed to scientists playing god for failed theme parks!Fallen Kingdom isn't terrible but it's not really all that good either.

It continues the universe of films begun in the 1990s with the first Jurassic Park, directed by Steven Spielberg, which has marked the history of cinema forever with its technologies developed to be produced.
As well as the first film of this new trilogy, Jurassic World of 2015, the new film rescues the nostalgic feeling of the classics. In a way, we are moving to the same narrative already seen before, but in an updated way for the new generations. But in the background following the same mechanics of the second film in the original trilogy, where the dinosaurs end up
civilization, outside the island where they were confined and thus causing the development of history. Although this time this happens in a new way and in keeping with the current society.
The play is clearly a popcorn movie that will age, but without losing the magic of having fun if viewed unpretentiously. It makes us feel the most diverse emotions, such as distress when seeing the dinosaurs fleeing, pity to see them dying to the point of causing crying, happiness in developing the adventure that at no time loses rhythm, always keeps the viewer entertained. And no
final leaves a wonderful ""taste of want more"", when it shows us what is to come in the wrapping of this new trilogy, also making us understand the title that was in our face from 2015.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

Both Claire (Dallas Howard) & Owen (Pratt) are brought back in to help rescue the dinosaurs - basically it's a mash up of the plots of JP2 & JP3. My only wish for the film - we see dinosaurs kill over five humans...They try to bring back Ian Malcolm (Goldblum), but he's given far too little screen time, as are the new sidekicks - Franklin (Smith), Zia (Pineda) & Maisie (Sermon). You sort of get to know them, and then they're hardly used. The same could almost be said of Pratt, who almost seems a passenger in the film, basically phoning it in. Cromwell and Jones are likewise great actors underutilised. The only one who plays his part with relish is Eli (Spall), the profiteer. There's some good scenes - and a few frights done well where I had to clap - but overall, I'm left feeling that the film didn't really add anything to the franchise or story. Sure, we get to see plenty of dinosaurs (including a stegosaurus, yay!) for a few minutes, but mostly its's spent in a weird CGI-castle. The ""bad guy"" is another genetically-improved raptor (didn't that happen last film?) and there's plenty of what I'm sure the director hopes are call-backs, but just seem lazy. I don't like how they only pull out the T. Rex when convenient. Still, there was at least 10 people eaten by dinosaurs, so it's not all bad...","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

The movie passes a very dumb, very sequel plot line through with the thought that the audience would just love looking at the beautiful cg dinosaurs and not even notice anything else. However, in this day and age, great CG is expected not admired, and I wanted to walk out of the movie. There was way too many dramatic running sequences and a bad boring script that at one point had two adult strangers trying to persuade a little girl to come with them and to leave her family and everything she knows. Just so much left and right that was so not good that you almost couldn't look away, but actually it wasn't bad enough to even do that.

Bryce Dallas Howard does not enjoy much screen time (probably due to Pratt's star power) or any memorable scenes.

And the way I see it, those who gave it a bad rating either didn't understand the plot or the metaphor/moral of the movie, or is just complaining because they didn't get to be nostalgic about the old movies. In my perspective you can't rate a movie by comparing it to an older movie - this movie is nothing like the old JP's, but is that equal to the movie being bad? No.I liked everything in this movie. The acting, the characters, the CGI and the plot. It's both emotional, horrific and exiting - full of action and great scenes. I would advise the people who didn't like the movie to watch it an extra time - but this time consider what Dr. Malcolm(goldblum) actually was saying - and compare it to the real world. I can relate to each and every word of his, and the moral of what he's trying to tell is both tragic but very eye opening. So please, ignore the bad reviews and go watch the movie without speculating to much about it being exacly like the old movies.

People in America are debating whether to rescue the dinosaurs form the island or not. Clare and Owen, who have gone their separate ways between the films, are reunited in a privately financed effort to rescue the dinosaurs instigated by an old associate of John Hammond. Joined by a couple of workers from Claire's ""save the dinosaurs"" group (who seem rather a copy of the control room quasi-couple from the previous film), they travel with a group of soldiers-of-fortune to the island and start rounding up dinosaurs as the volcano rumbles. Unsurprisingly (though surprisingly quickly), nasty ulterior motives emerge, and the characters find themselves fighting for their lives, those of the remaining dinosaurs, and their own moral compasses. 
 The film is chock -full of references to earlier films in the franchise, which are fun to mentally tick off, and the audience is usually a step or two ahead of the action (what successes or setbacks will happen during the several escape efforts is usually easy to figure out). The film has an odd and uneasy relationship with violence; dinosaurs are seen dispatching humans in grisly ways, but person-to -person violence is handled squeamishly if at all. The filmmakers swing between a story of awed fascination and mortal terror, between clear-cut conflicts and moral ambiguities. Ultimately, the film can't quite decide on a tone or message as it zig and zags about the issue of the perils of the ever-expanding possibilities of science.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

When Claire learns that the dinosaurs lives are in jeopardy on Nublar she enlistens the help of raptor wrangler Owen in a daring mission to save as many of the dinosaurs as possible. However, it seems that the island itself isn't the only threat to the dinosaurs...In terms of overall cinematic greatness, Fallen Kingdom does seem to be one of those films that gives with one hand whilst simultaneously taking away with the other. Naturally, this produces a sequel that provides mixed results...To begin with the good then it's fair to say that this is quite an interesting story and is a nice expansion of the events that were depicted in the first film. It contains some moving moments and it's fair to say that the film has a lot of heart as well. Some may say that it goes overboard with the mush, but I think the film rides its luck just on the right side of acceptable in this respect.The downside of all of what I've mentioned is, that due to the weightiness of the more serious story, Fallen Kingdom lacks some of the charm and fun that was much more abundant in the previous film. Pratt and Howard had a great working chemistry in the first film that isn't quite as strong in this film. It also has to be said that this sequel is not quite as exciting or as fast-paced as the first film. It is saved though by some of the acting (particularly Spall who was the one that stood out for me).Despite some of its problems though it is still a much better film than Dominion and as I've already said despite it not being quite as exciting or fun as its predecessor it does have an interesting story which does compensate slightly for some of its weaker areas.Not perfect by any means, but far from the worst in the series (and I'm counting both sets of franchises here).","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

It also brings several surprises that ultimately make for a rather refreshing experience that unfortunately puts hurdles in its own path, by way of unnecessarily nonsensical plot-points and dull political-intrigue elements, and proceeds to stumble over them just when you start to settle into its rhythm. It is certainly an improvement over its immediate predecessor. In general, the characters are given a little more care and are allowed some room to breathe. Still, they don't really change and aren't great lenses through which to view this world. The most believable is the new character played by Justice Smith, who's panicked demeanour is unique yet honest and who's ability to act in situations he clearly (and rightfully) finds incredibly scary is admirable. The structure of the piece isn't conventional, either. This causes a lax pacing in the midriff that makes the movie feel a tad too long. As I mentioned, the scares are the best part. They are constructed like scenes from a perhaps more traditional horror movie, which is unsurprising considering the genre-confident director. Without a solid foundation, though, there's little to keep you engaged once the suspense inevitably falls away. It does so on multiple occasions in favour of your basic 'blockbuster' schlock that's only slightly better than average. The flick unfortunately doesn't really provide the pure entertainment, or even engagement, that should act as a net to catch all the fragments of its more successful elements. That's why it works so well at times, and so poorly at others. Instead of being mediocre throughout, there are flashes of greatness and a majority that pull those down. Still, at least it's interesting. 5/10","22 out of 37 found this helpful."

I generally found the movie too contrived and simply too silly to take even remotely serious.
Imagine my surprise when I realized that Fallen Kingdom is even worse in that department, and without even close to the charm that the first one at least managed to have.
Fallen Kingdom might as well have been called ""Plot Convenience"" - The Movie.
The entire premise and the first scene hinges on retcons and stupidity, and what tries to pass as a plot just gets worse from there, with everything from laser targeted dinosaurs (no this is not a joke), to a spooky castle (complete with fog), and teleporting characters and dinosaurs. Yes, we have characters and dinosaurs popping up at convenient moments without zero idea of how they even managed to get there. 
This is possibly best described by going back to the original Jurassic Park. Remember when the main characters were surrounded by the raptors, and just as they were ready to attack, the T-Rex showed up? Well, this happens at least four times in this movie. AT LEAST FOUR TIMES!!!!
This is the movie in its entirety.
Movies are supposed to try to suspend disbelief (something Jurassic Park managed to do quite well), but Fallen Kingdom seems to go out of its way to confirm our disbelief, by having humans and animals behave in ways that simply makes no sense what so ever.
Movies like this is an insult to basic intelligence and competent writing.
The only reason I do not rate it lower is because there are a few short scenes that work, and at times some excellent cinematography, but none of it saves this utter waste of money and time.
Watch the original (again) instead!","24 out of 41 found this helpful."

The movie has two very well marked parts. The first is very bombastic (blockbuster) that gives way to a second part much more gothic and even terror.

Bayona and is written by the duo of Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly. The island of 'Isla Nublar', where 'Jurassic World' took place, has a volcano that is just ready to blow. From this, political debate sparks into whether or not the dinosaurs on the island should be rescued. With this we have our movie. I'm a huge fan of the original 'Jurassic Park' and enjoyed 'Jurassic World' when it hit the big screens a few years ago. Going into this I had my doubts... it's not uncommon for a 'Jurassic' sequel to be a dud. Nonetheless, I was very excited by the prospect of heading into the theatres and seeing a different 'Jurassic' film than what I, and millions of others are used to. In that, 'Fallen Kingdom' did not disappoint. This is definitely the most ambitious film in the franchise since the original hit the big screen in the summer of 1993. Despite its attempts at being something different, 'Fallen Kingdom' often fell flat, failing to deliver a savoring taste of dinosaur, and 'Jurassic' magic.  The opening third of this film holds some intrigue, aiming to be a deeper meaning than some of the previous franchise sequels. I did not fully buy into Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howards characters going back to the island but the movie gave a solid attempt and it was somewhat believable. Both Pratt and Howard are a thrill to watch and I am glad the series continued on following those two characters. Despite good acting from Pratt, there was no real structural development to his character in the film which feels a tad like lazy writing. We now have two entire films and Pratt has yet to develop whatsoever. Bryce Dallas Howards character, 'Claire Dearing' did have a bit of a change of heart in this film and it was pleasant to see her character grow. The aim of truly wanting to make this new trilogy into a world is very clear in this film. I do feel however the movie was not fully focused on that and really danced around its main end-game. I do give 'Fallen Kingdom' props for taking some chances and doing different things with the franchise. The supporting cast in this film, namely the two that join Pratt and Howard's excursion, are rather boring. Justice Smith and Danielle Pineda are the two that star alongside our main duo. At times, both are borderline annoying as they try to convey some unnecessary comedic relief. Other new characters include 'Eli Mills' played by Rafe Spall and 'Sir Benjamin Lockwood' played by James Cromwell. Cromwell's character has an intriguing enough backstory but Rafe Spall's newly introduced character comes off as two-dimensional and generic. Child actress, Isabella Sermon plays 'Maisie Lockwood' aka the granddaughter of 'Benjamin Lockwood' in this film and I must say she did quite a good job. Her arc was also probably the most intriguing of the film and it might well be the thing that sticks with me most in the days and weeks following this movie. Jeff Goldblum also reprises his role as 'Dr. Ian Malcolm' in this film which is always fun as well.  Onto what we are really here for... Dinosaurs! 'Fallen Kingdom' has some very incredible looking sequences on the island that look great on the big screen. The special effects in this movie are also absolutely top notch and the close up combat with the dinosaurs looks really well done. However, many of the same scenes and gimmicks from previous films were used and I did feel like I was watching a rehashing of other 'Jurassic' films at times. So as a truly great action-packed summer blockbuster, this movie does not always deliver. I did have some fun with this movie though and there were undeniably some pretty good, fun sequences.  One of the biggest issues with the first film that carries into the second is the villains. The quality of villains in these films need to seriously be upped in quality as they always detract from the film as a whole. Their cartoony feel, which is present in both 'Jurassic World' and this film 'Fallen Kingdom', really don't do much at all to benefit the story. Michael Giacchino's score is a positive from this film and he is just continuing to show how much of a terrific composer he is.","4 out of 9 found this helpful."

 The entire movie relies on Starlord's character actions and present the other protagonists only when convenient; the dinosaurs are at the same time presented both as fragile dumb creatures that can be taken down with a single pistol bullet and also huge menaces that not even trained private soldiers can hope to hit a shoot even when standing literally 10 meters from them. Jeff Goldblum character has less than 5 minute screen time and change the story in absolutely no way serving only as an intro and outro narrator.
 Although the CGI is good it gets very saturated too quickly from the excessive amount of dinosaurs on a single scene at a time and worns off, the animatronics are okay though. The entire sequence on the island have a blue-green filter that dosen't fit with the situation and makes it look more akin to Peter Jackson's skull island from King Kong than isla nublar seen in the first movie and the last entry. Acting is good but only so far as the actors can make it, since the characters themselves are horribly written.
 Overall, it's both a bad Jurassic Park movie and a bad movie as whole, specially when seen alone, since it serves no purpose other than setting up the stage for the third and final entry in the Jurassic World triology. Fans of said triology may like, but conservative fans of the Jurassic Park series as a whole probably will not; even though it have a considerable amount of graphic imagery this movies seens to be aimed directly at kids and will be a massive grind to anyone that may try to take on it as an chapter in the series.","30 out of 53 found this helpful."

Plot is kept to a minimum.Bryce Dallas Howard can't act if her life was dependent on it, she's simply the most generic actor possible. Chris Pratt, usually a charismatic actor, is flat and almost transparent here - I really got the feeling he did it just for the money.There are endless possible drinking game with this movie: Drink every time someone is in danger so he stops and slowly looks at it instead of running; drink every time someone says: ""run""; drink every time someone is raising his hand to control/slow a dinosaur.So... boring... and so long. During the movie I looked at the clock and couldn't believe there's still a full hour to go. I think the people were happy this movie was finally over.The theme seems to rip off Joseph LoDuca's theme to ARMY OF DARKNESS (1992) (which was also ripped off in GODZILLA (1998)).","32 out of 58 found this helpful."

This last one is probably the best one in terms of visual effects, Byona direction is neat and clear. It even has several easter eggs reminding us about the first movie but it has a huge problem: the plot. After a glorious setup that everybody will like, the hero journey gets confused, action timing is first too slow and in the end too quick. There is no tension, the enemy is known, the finale predictable. A devent movie, but not the masterpiece we were waiting for. The hope is all for the last one coming in 2021.

For start, the dialog was much better, not that ""streight to the point"" one liners but real conversations..just like in the older Jurassic Park films. I think that hollywood have embraced that one-liner action script and this movie took a step back from it and for the good.
Second - CGI and practical effects. In the first Jurassic World movie the special effects weren't all that convincing. It had some flaws and I didn't always find the effects convincing and real. In the new film, the dinosaurs looked very real and it added a strong sense of realism into it.
I think that some of the plot lines are very daring and it's obviously to me that the new director wants to take this franchise to new places.
if you haven't see the movie yet than I strongly recommend you not to read any spoilers, you would be very surprised by some of the twists toward the third act of the film.

I thought #JurassicWorldFallenKingdom was okay. Not good, but okay. It was probably tied with JP3 for worst Jurassic film in the series and definitely didn't live up to the previous movie. I was just kind of disappointed. I left the theater unsatisfied. JWFK was drawn out, tedious, and predictable. Hell, most of the movie takes place in the mansion/estate. The best part of JWFK is everything in the first half of the movie up until the point that they left Isla Nublar as it was being destroyed by the volcano (if you've seen the previews, you've basically seen the entire movie). In addition, the plot was terrible and the acting was mediocre from everyone. Especially the little girl, Maisie, who just screamed the whole time and lacked any sort of basic survival instincts. Furthermore, how can they say ""the dinosaurs are becoming re-extinct"" if there's another island full of dinosaurs (Isla Sorna, Site B)? And am I the only one who thought the Indoraptor really wasn't all that scary, or threatening? I mean the Indominus Rex was stronger, faster, smarter, and was far more deadly and terrifying. My only other gripe is that the JP/JW carnivores are exceedingly one-dimensional and flat. The only thing they do is hunt, scare, kill, and eat any living thing in sight 24/7. No matter the situation. They have no emotions or anything else better to do. The only exceptions to this are Blue (Velociraptor), the Indominus (I-Rex), Rexy (T-Rex) to an extent, and that one random seen in JP3 with the Ceratosaurus and the Spino poop.","22 out of 38 found this helpful."

Bayona, the film promises a lot when it comes to presenting concepts and characters, but at the time of developing the story, it falls into the same sin as Jurassic World.Just as Jurassic World was remade on a larger scale from Spielberg's Jurassic Park for consumption by the younger generations, 'The fallen Kingdom' too, seems to aspire for the same with the continuation of the lost world.Here you see more reptiles, close and upfront, in all their glory and action. The action-sequences are intense but at times appear deliberate and dumb, just to stimulate heartbeats.The actual story begins with some exposition about the end of the first Jurassic World. The theme park on Isla Nublar off Central America's Pacific Coast is destroyed and the dinosaurs roam freely on the island for three years.While the Former Jurassic World Operations Manager, now an animal-rights activists - Claire Dearing (Bryce Howard) is working to save the dinosaurs, we then see Jeff Goldblum, reprising his role from the first two films, addressing a committee. He tells them that he thinks the dinosaurs, ""should be eliminated by the volcano"" that threatens the island, and Goldblum works hard to give this plot exposition some urgency.Claire is joined by her ex-boyfriend Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), a former dinosaur trainer when she teams up with Benjamin Lockwood, to bring the creatures to a sanctuary in America. But soon she and Owen are betrayed and mayhem follows. There is also a helpless little girl Maisie (Isabella Sermon) who elevates the emotional quotient.Chris Pratt is a charismatic, good-looking and funny guy. He returns as the leading man and everything he utters tends to sound like a double entendre. ""If I don't make it back, remember, you are the one who made me come,"" he tells Howard at one point and pauses just enough to generate a laugh.Also when Howard is on top of a dinosaur and needs to sedate it with a syringe, Pratt matter-of-factly states, ""You are going to have to jam it in there!""The plot hinges, as so many large studio films do, on the evil of villainous capitalists who have no shame or moral scruples. These villains are poaching the dinosaurs to make their millions and also to use them for warfare.The director unfolds so comfortably with this material that one ends up scrutinizing the frames, wondering if any of the reptilian offspring that appear on screen will end up looking clumsy.But instead, the CGI is spot on and the visuals are aesthetically mounted. Director of Photography, Oscar Faura's live-action frames mesh smoothly with the CGI and together, you experience some enchanting images.Overall, this edition is still much better than its predecessor.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

In the 90's Jurassic Park reigned supreme in this genre, and brought Crichton's novel to life in ways we could not imagine. Nearly three decades later, the technology continues to push the dinosaurs animation to new heights and potentially make the carnage all the sweeter. Robbie K here, bringing another review on the last silver screen smash to grace the theaters this week. Let's get started as I review: Movie: Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018)Director:
 J.A. Bayona
Writers:
 Derek Connolly, Colin TrevorrowStars:
 Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rafe Spall 
LIKES:Animation: Let's face it, the 90's brought an incredible baseline of work, and the advancements in animation make these extinct creatures shine like no other. Computer animation brings fluid movements of running, mangling, and hunting, while the robotics creates the realistic sheen that hooks you in. A nice balance between the two styles really crafts the piece together. The Acting: Pratt is still great, a blend of sarcasm meeting heroic cowboy that sharpens him into a great lead to keep the series alive. Howard dropped most of the edgy, monotonous tone (and the heels) and with it brings that more dynamic, caring approach to life to round out the roguish nature of Pratt. As for the rest of the crew, they play their parts well, though I can't say they were the best approaches direction of the characters I anticipated, primarily Toby Jones who somehow played a stiff, one dimensional character with little bite. The Pace: Like the stampeding herd in the trailer, the movie moves at a good pace, always moving and at times trying to keep the action/suspense nature alive. It shifts easily from one dynamic to another, attempting to keep the drama down and the chaos high. More Dinosaurs: The movie manages to expand their collection of thunder lizards to terrorize and amaze. Both carnivores and herbivores will stomp into the group with majestic prowess, or perhaps stalk in with nightmarish grins as they attempt to obtain their next meal. Regardless, the repertoire is impressive and many get their shining moment to actually warrant their inclusion. The Originality of New Direction: We've understood the cliché of Jurassic Park movies and how a band gets put on an island, forced to pit their instincts against the prehistoric predators. Jurassic World 2 decides to deviate from it and take a more moral dilemma approach. The movie honestly has a lot more discussion of ethics vs business, mercy vs. survival, and selective vs. global compassion. Much of the movie is geared towards these tug at your heart issues and trying to pick a side of the two extremes. While political, the movie will certainly stir up emotions you might not expect in this series. The Character Development: Surprisingly, Jurassic World 2 manages to beef up the character development of some of its leading groups. Chris Pratt's Owen really gets under the microscope to examine the connections to Blue, bringing with it a deeper connection to one who was so shallow in the previous installment. As for Claire... she too gets a little more depth, but surprisingly took the back seat in this movie compared to Pratt, I guess her family was the driving point for evolving, and without them she lacks the motivation. As for the rest of the crew, there are some decent looks into their lives, but haven't quite gotten to the multiple layers you might want in a leading role. The Nostalgia: Got to love when your childhood memories and references come back into the screen, and this installment is happy to bring back a few of these moments to have you smiling. They haven't quite mastered showing some of the bigger, iconic references, but they got enough for a good start. 
DISLIKES: The New Characters: I don't know whose direction or decisions it was, but the new characters are a little too modernized for my taste. Very emotional, angsty characters, the younger cast is a bit too extreme for me and felt like a forced comedic ploy that failed to pick up steam. The villains themselves lacked much dimension as well, falling into stereotypical, boastful blowhards who have little beyond bragging rights. Why such extremes? I don't know, but they failed to impress me given some of the other baddies to infiltrate the parks. The Twist: There are a number of these in this film, but one in particular about a character will bring with it a new level of soap opera dynamics. By doing this they help establish some more motifs to all the madness at hand, but it really didn't stand and hold place in a movie about creating and unleashing the torrent of dinosaurs. Sorry guys uniqueness gets an A+, but in the grand schemes not needed. Predictable/Pushed carnage: Since Lost World, the series has been more about the kills as the main source of thrills. Jurassic World and World 2 were still on that gimmick, not so much setting it up to go with the suspense and storytelling element. The movie sets up obvious ploys for killing and often relying on stupidity and foreshadowing to set up their kills with little regards to necessity. I miss the suspense of that first movie and grow tired of the focus of how to make it gore fest, no matter how justified they are. The Inhumane Moments: The director wanted to elicit emotional responses and he managed to succeed very well. However, in this installment, those moments are sometimes a little too inhumane for my taste and a little unnecessary at times. Fallen Kingdom is going to continue passing the baton of who the real monsters are, but for me this director has a little more sadistic side to the cinematography and plot elements he wants to show. Being an animal lover, no matter how savage they are, it was hard to see some of these moments come to fruition and enjoy the film. If you're like me, steel yourself, because there are going to be some over the top moments to punch you hard and leave you feeling depressed. Didn't Fell Jurassic: The movie held so much potential for another island adventure that showed danger, mystery, and more of that great survival of the fittest we thrive on in the series. However, this part was rushed, simplified, and very lacking until the big run from the volcano scene. The movie missed all that suspenseful, thrilling moments for the ethical debates, and the though the second act turned out stronger than I expected, it still didn't hold the elements (or the bite) of the movie I longed for. The VERDICT:  In truth, Jurassic World 2 is a decent sequel that tries out some new things to try and evolve the dinosaurs' reign on the silver screen. Given the new morale dilemmas, the character development and increase in gimmicks like more dinosaurs and better animation, the movie is obviously worth the trip to the theater. However, the movie still does not quite have the feel of the movies proceeding it, lacking the thrilling adventure of defying debt, for more soap opera and convoluted antics. In addition, the twist and heartbreaking moments may deter you from enjoying the movie at full potential. As for it being appropriate for kids... it depends on their ability to handle the cruel treatment of animals, adult themes, and darker moments (Endoraptor is nightmare inducing) that are often loud. So targeted age is probably 12 and up. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0","2 out of 5 found this helpful."

Bayona gives us a number of memorable set pieces combine tension and thrills in the right balance, but overall, these dinosaurs deserve so much better.

This one reminds me of the classic sci-fi/adventure movies in which fleeing an island to escape an erupting volcano provided all the suspense and excitement of wondering whether or not they will survive (e.g., Journey to the Center of the Earth, with Pat Boone). IN ADDITION to that plot line this movie gives you fleeing dinosaurs and evil men who want to save them just to make money.

Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are still a good leading couple. But there is also the show stealer Daniella Pineda. She's game in every scene. Also newbie Justice Smith was kinda annoying and with Isabella Sermon we get the best child actress of the whole franchise yet. There are a lot of dinosaurs, some throwbacks to the original film, totally over-the-top moments and some story elements you'll never wanna see again but probably will. I missed a 'Jurassic Park' moment with the theme. We get a quiet moment but no bombastic one. And I cried a lot of tears for the dinosaurs. Mankind is so damn evil.","2 out of 6 found this helpful."

And also the acting of Chris Pratt, that let's be honest, isn't great. I never realy liked him as an actor and it won't change after this movie.

The park is gone, creatures have been captured, humans are selling them in an Auction and they survives with the help of our heroes. Done with the brief story, no spoilers at all, all these stuff were shown in the promos and Film fulfiils all the expectations built by promos but what about showing something else? Something more? We're used to it now, dinosaurs's freedom, human's interruption in their lives, human's wanna be rich nature by using natural miracle creatures, some good people saving them and bla bla. Get over it and show us something else, how long you gonna make movies on the same stuff?Keeping those personal thoughts aside let's come to the review. Fallen Kingdom is another entertaining film in the franchise but there is nothing to be remembered. Half the film takes place in the park, 2nd half happens in a Bungalow. There are some terrific scenes but some moments too typical, cinematic and are too slow, test your patience litteally. No loo breaks unless you have seen enough monster scenes already and feel boring watching it again cause for some people this franchise is all about those terrifying scenes. Visually this film is Rich, the technical team has done a great job. Unfortunately i couldn't watch it in 3D otherwise i would have talked more deep on that. Talking about minuses, the first one is, the high note ending is missing. Raptors and a little girl are shown smarter than others, unacceptable. I don't want more films on dinosaurs, enough with this now and even if they make it then I'll make sure that i won't watch it in theatre.As a whole, Fallen Kingdom is Good watchable film for the monstrous and explosion reasons but just don't expect anything else. I fear this one might fail to catch its predecessor at box office as people can't show interest for the same thing again and again. I give 6/10* to this one which is less than Previous Jurassic World film (7/10*).","2 out of 6 found this helpful."

Second in the series, the plot revolves around protecting the wild dinosaurs on the island, bad guys with ulterior motives bring the dinosaurs to the mainland, chaos ensues. The Jurassic Park trilogy lacked a cohesive story from start to finish. Each movie sort of stood on their own to a certain extent. Fallen Kingdom made the Jurassic World trilogy have a cohesive story. The second half of the movie leans heavily into the ideas from Jurassic world regarding genetically modifying the dinosaurs and making them into living weapons. It's this idea that is the linchpin of the Jurassic World trilogy and Fallen Kingdom is the pivot point on which the final movie turns. Fallen Kingdom's second half is dark and almost like a horror movie. In that way it was different from any Jurassic film so far. My first viewing I was a little ""meh"" but my second viewing made me grateful that Fallen Kingdom took the big risk to do something different. Solid sequel.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

Fallen Kingdom made me angry.I've never seen a movie like this in my life. It feels like it was made in a boardroom by people in suits looking at marketing charts. This is exactly the movie you want, presented in the most mechanical way possible. That doesn't make the movie impossible to enjoy, but it's a bit like ordering fast food from McDonalds. You know it's bad for you, you know it's made from tongues and eyeballs, but it's still edible.Fallen Kingdom feels like you're watching a two hour movie trailer. Even during so-called ""down time,"" the movie is rushing you through a summary of its plot, never letting any one emotion or thought sink in for very long. There's no humanity in this movie, no heart, it's all just a rickety scaffolding to prop up the next CGI dinosaur brawl.And all of it, every minute of the movie, is slathered in a nostalgic worship for that first Jurassic Park movie. From a pointless cameo by Jeff Goldblum to straight up remaking multiple shots from the original film, Fallen Kingdom is obsessed with reminding you of better movies instead of just being itself. Fallen Kingdom wants you to love the fact it loves Jurassic Park, when I'd much rather cut out the middleman.A twist to the mythology here or a couple of cool moments there just doesn't make up for how hollow and plainly calculated this movie is.There's nothing wrong with eating McDonalds. But when you expect more, and better, a McDonalds hamburger can feel like a slap in the face. That's the only way I can describe how I felt after the credits rolled on Fallen Kingdom.","9 out of 14 found this helpful."

The only people who gave any effort in this movie were the CGI folks--and really, how hard did they have to try considering they probably had everything they needed saved on a hard drive somewhere. I can't believe how bad this movie was. Almost immediately I was shaking my head in disapproval.Jurassic anything is no longer original and no longer unique. That's OK though. We're willing to watch so long as you can bring an interesting enough plot. Well, that didn't happen.The premise is that the dinosaurs have to be rescued from Isla Nublar because of an active volcano that's going to destroy them all. We could just let them die but where's the movie in that? We have to rescue them but we also have to have some other nefarious plot in play to make it interesting. At the core of it all was an ethical dilemma: allow the dinosaurs to die or rescue the dinosaurs. Ethical dilemmas is part and parcel of Jurassic Park/World. From the very beginning it was an ethics issue by recreating dinosaurs, so there is no reason to stray from ethical dilemmas now. And I agree with that. In fact, that was the only interesting thing about this entire movie. After that it was just a replay of the first Jurassic World: you know, catastrophic failures, harrowing escapes, bad guys getting eaten, a kid right in the middle of it all, etc. The whole thing just annoyed me.How one dimensional can you make these characters? Almost every character was a walking cliche: the macho shoot first henchman, the smart witty doctor to show brains are better than braun, the shady child-yelling antagonist, the genius kid and other character types that wore bright neon signs letting you know their role and their fate.I was rolling my eyes the entire movie as I just watched the first Jurassic World play out before me as they tried to convince me this was different. They will make a third, fourth, fifth and so on because as long as they have sharp toothed prehistoric beasts and evil gullible homo-sapiens they have a formula for hundreds of millions of dollars.

In the first Jurassic Park, the highest tension was created by a falling jeep, an electric fence and a threatening storm. In this movie, we have a volcano, a transparent pod and a gothic mansion - all used to great effect!The dinosaurs are definitely characters in their own right. Some of the most moving moments in the film are focused on the experiences and feelings of prehistoric animals. Their plight is as important as the risk they pose to the human cast - and the line between is sometimes very thin...Worth a watch if you enjoy some Jurassic thrills - but if you like prehistoric animals, you might be better off with a re-watch of Walking with Dinosaurs.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

But for me, as a lover of the Jurassic movies, I felt somewhat disappointed leaving the movie theatre. Yes. There are a lot of dino's. Yes, we all want them to be saved from the volcano that is going to whipe away Isla Nublar, but who came up with the idea to do this story and then throw out all the logic. I had so many questions. Why didn't Owen have any injuries after touching the lava? Does any animal 'hunt or attack' another living creature for food when its life is in danger? Why don't dino's jump in the water when there's lava surrounding them? Why didn't they sedate Blue? Why is a small wooden door strong enough for an animal that burst through nearly anything? Why does a huge animal take the time to silently open a window to creep up on someone? Why hide in a bed and create a Nightmare on Elmstreet moment? And why does Owen crawl in the bed with the girl? Why doesn't anyone seem to be intelligent? So many questions, I won't ask them all here, because I don't want to put spoilers out there, but I believe there were about 20 or more scenes where I thought 'Seriously?' and after the first, very chaotic half of the movie I knew it wasn't going to be any better. No, it became worse. They didn't learn from creating Indominus Rex, because now we have the Indoraptor. The dino's should have passed out from gasses at some point, but they didn't. At some point there are a few scenes where I thought this was actually a remake of the movie Relic. And they give away the ending like 10 minutes before it actually happens. You just know what will happen. 
Besides this all, some of the actors with smaller parts are really stiff and acted as if this was a stageplay. I am giving 5 stars. Why? I did enjoy the movie for all the action and dino's in it and after the biggest part of the first half I was able to watch it, disconnecting it from the Jurassic-series. Even though there are quite a few 'nods and winks' to the first trilogy. The main characters are enjoyable to watch, the younger actors belonged more in an X-men spin-off though. Can you expect something close to the previous Jurassic movies? No, this is something totally different and the ending leaves a lot of room for a next movie, so there will be more to see for sure. Just keep your fond memories of Jurassic Park, The Lost World, even JPIII and the first Jurassic World and try to watch it with an open mind, not connecting it to what it could or should have been.","48 out of 103 found this helpful."

I'm still excited to see more movies in the franchise and I thought Jurassic World was pretty good.
What I don't like about Fallen kingdom is the fact that my inner boy and dinosaur fan gets disappointed when the movie is basically about human beings mistreating gorgeous animals. The Lost World: Jurassic Park had the same problem. People shooting dinosaurs and pulling out their teeth violently is not a nice thing to see. I know they're not real animals but it hurts to see the mighty T-Rex sedated and in a small cage.
Simple mayhem and survival action is what made Jurassic Park 3 and Jurassic World much better movies than this.
On a positive note, it's always a pleasure to see Jeff Goldblum back.
It's not a horrible movie at all, just not an especially good Jurassic movie.
I hope the third Jurassic World movie will once again be about the dinosaurs being back on top.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

I knew it wasn't going to be on par with the original Jurassic Park, I knew it wasn't going to win any Oscars or awards or any praise from critics. Nope, the only thing this movie was going to be was a ridiculous, unbelievable, farfetched dinosaur fest made for the summer blockbuster season to cash in on an established franchise. And sure enough, that's what I got. Does that mean it isn't entertaining? Not at all. In fact, if you go in to the movie with the same mindset that I did. there's a good chance that you will have a really good time for two hours. The dinosaurs look absolutely incredible with the CGI, the T-Rex is scary for the first time since Jurassic Park: The Lost World, the new genetic monstrosity that's created and known as the Idnoraptor is an awesome creature, and on top of it all, we have Starlord himself, Christ Pratt, returning as Owen Grady to save the day. In addition to Pratt, we also have Bryce Dallas Howard returning as Claire, and the addition of new characters played by the likes of Ted Levine and Rafe Spall. Unfortunately, where the movie goes bad is it's plot. If you've read up on this movie at all, you probably have a good notion of what it is so I won't go into too much detail about it other than to say that Claire and Owen are contacted by an old partner of John Hammond's, Benjamin Lockwood, (played by James Cromwell ) for a rescue mission be undertaken to get the dinosaurs off the old island because of an eruption of the island's volcano that will wipe it out all the dinosaurs and correct man's mistake. Little do Claire and Owen know, it's all a lie, as Lockwood's associate, Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) plans on double crossing all of them by auctioning off the dinosaurs for the highest bidding to anyone who will buy them, arms dealers, warlords, crooked corporate executives, etc. As a result, the movie goes from being on an island to being at a giant mansion where the dinosaurs are taken to be held, displayed on fashion runway, and then naturally escape to cause havoc. As you can imagine, this is where the movie is most farfetched and hard to believe, and has plot holes galore! Why go to all the trouble of using dinosaurs as weapons (in particular the Indoraptor) when drones and robot technology has made killing machines more efficient and deadly than ever before????? There are many more plot holes you can find from other reviews or by seeing it yourself; I just don't have the space to point them all out! Still, I can't lie, I enjoyed dinosaurs run amok in a large mansion in the dark of night and if you're like me, you will too. Bottom line is, this movie won't be one you'll remember or cherish for years after seeing it like the first JP. But if you happen to be looking for some mindless fun for two hours, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is your film. 
P.S. Also starring Jeff Goldblum, in a small cameo as Ian Malcolm.","1 out of 2 found this helpful."

I appreciated that, and even 25 years since the original, I felt nostalgic and enjoyed seeing the movies I grew up with shine on.
Movie had a lot of original premise and circumstance. I actually got scared of dinos again, just like when I met the beloved T. rex as a kid. The only shame is how the plot came short and maybe a little hollow, but the love and inspiration was still there. It's obvious a JP fanboy made this film. Maybe a few more creative fans are what we need in Hollywood.
I feel IMDb is too full of righteousness. People who believe a film is bad because it only leads justice for the fans. That's wrong, which is why I gave it 10 to counter this unfair average. Just cause you don't ""get it"" doesn't mean it's bad.
I was taken from this world for a brief 2 hours, and delivered into Spielberg's version of Michael Crichton. If a film can do that, then it's good altogether.","152 out of 254 found this helpful."

In some ways I guess you could say the Jurassic Park series had a lot of dumb elements to it - even the first movie had many dumb elements (mainly the idea of having a theme park dedicated to resurrected dinosaurs) but it also knew how to have fun with it as well as make the audience believe the dinosaurs were alive.Now for Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom: A volcano is about to erupt where the dinosaurs live, and the former people in charge of Jurassic World have to decide whether or not to let them die or rescue them. However, behind the government's back, Clair and (Chris Pratt) are going to move the dinosaurs to another island where they can thrive and live in peace. But little do they realize, they're being duped and once again the military wants to use the dinosaurs as weapons of war (didn't we learn why that can't happen in the last movie?). It's another Man vs Nature story much like Lost World (just as I predicted).Oh this is somehow very dumb and yet very fun. Anytime you go to see Jurassic Park (any of the movies) usually you don't care about the plot or the human characters, all that matters are the dinosaurs, and I think they knew that. For that reason, the plot is a mess but the effects for the dinosaurs are good.So what bothers me about this movie? The villain. Good grievences, did we really need a military money power villain again? That's been the third time in the series we've had a villain like that including in the last movie (though to be fair the previous villain was a lot more unlikable).
Also, this feels like two plots rolled into one: 1) Dilemma on whether or not to save dinosaurs from extinction 2) Man is evil and wants to sell dinosaurs (how come they didn't learn from Lost World and Jurassic World that it's a bad idea?). If it had been about the first one, it would have been enough to hold a movie.
And probably one of the visually dumbest moments is there's a little girl in a red sweater sneaking around and yet somehow she slips by unnoticed. How do you do that in a RED SWEATER!!?!!
Not to mention, for a serious killer, the new dinosaur sure is slow to kill one of the important characters.
And while it was great to see Jeff Goldblum return, he's only there for three minutes. Though to be fair, he was the voice of reason.This movie embraces every tense moment and it often pays off. 👍 Also the acting is really good from everybody including the kid. The special effects for the dinosaurs once again look great, though I was slightly disappointed that the T-rex didn't get much of a chance to shine.Final Verdict: Overall, I say plotwise it is a dumb movie. I find it pointless that the series continued and that the characters never learn from the previous movies. However, as an action film it's enjoyable, especially if you don't think too hard about the situation. I think How it Should Have Ended described best how the issues should have been resolved by everyone.

It's mindless action (with dinosaurs!) that works in the moment but don't expect to think much about it afterwards.It actually starts really well. In the first few minutes I got the same old vibe from Jurassic Park but sadly this doesn't last throughout the film.
The time spend on the island seemed a bit reused. I found it a bit too repetitive with the whole running from dinosaurs and you've seen most of the problems and solutions in the other movies.
The part back on mainland worked better for me. Not that the plot gets better but I felt it was better paced and I couldn't predict the outcome in the same way (well other than things will go horribly wrong).
The subplot with the girl was the worst. It felt like they tried to make the film deeper which doesn't work. 
Other than that be prepared for a lot of facepalms because people make incredible bad decisions when facing dinosaurs but that's part of the fun I guess.So if you like dinos and mindless entertainment watch it. Otherwise it might be best to just skip it.","3 out of 13 found this helpful."

The original Jurassic Park had so many moments that are extremely memorable and for me will remain the best in the series.I enjoyed Jurassic World (the one before this) and took it for what it was worth - a kind of reboot for the newer generation while continuing the franchise for the fans. And for what it delivered, it was entertaining and decently plotted.Fallen Kingdom however is really more of a monster movie at its heart. There's a predictable formula of the dinosaurs escaping, the good guys get lost amongst all the chaos and the bad guy gets his due at the end. Now I don't mind the usual formula but as long as it can hold itself throughout the movie. This one unfortunately falls flat very early on.There are some very good action scenes but what is severely lacking is any build of of suspense. The opening scene of the movie was probably the most suspenseful part of the movie and if only it was able to keep the suspense going for the rest of the film, it would have been much more entertaining. I didn't really care about the characters at all and I actually found the overuse of the CGI with all the dinosaurs everywhere kind of feel like overkill. It makes the dinosaurs seem less magnificent and more like tons of extras.The music score also is very disappointing - there's none of the original Jurassic Park theme and is rarely used (except the end credits). I know that they are probably trying to distinguish this film away from the originals to make it feel fresh, but the plot itself is also dull. Not to mention there is a twist at the end with one of the side characters which felt like it was thrown out of nowhere as an afterthought and then is not even explored properly afterwards. If you were going for a shock, it failed miserably.I know the Jurrasic World films won't ever recapture the magic of the first film and I don't expect it to, but the fact that it can't even hold my interest all the way shows that these films have simply become action blockbuster films with no real soul in them anymore.","9 out of 15 found this helpful."

Directed by J. A. Bayona (The Orphanage, The Impossible), it offers more of the same dinosaur action and destruction that one would expect from this popular series of films.Three years after the events of Jurassic World, the now abandoned Isla Nublar and the remaining dinosaur inhabitants are in danger of being destroyed in a massive volcanic eruption. Determined to save the last dinosaurs from another extinction, former employees Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) form a team to rescue the creatures from the impending disaster and ensure their safety.Thankfully, the film does not completely rehash The Lost World: Jurassic Park but instead expands upon the story first established in its 2015 predecessor. Dinosaurs still roar loudly and at some point a T-Rex will eat somebody. The film's visual effects were more convincing this time around and most of the CGI was tolerable, which I took issue with in the 2015 film. As usual, most of the human characters, especially the villains, were flat and predictable with little personalities outside of wanting to exploit dinosaurs for money, with the main exceptions being Owen and Claire, who proved to be generally likeable protagonists. The film is self-aware that it does not expect us to take every plot point seriously and for the most part this adds to its fun factor, so I suggest sitting back and enjoying the dinosaur action for what it is.I rate it 7/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

The movie did have a lot of potential but they didn't really use it. They tried to make the second half, a horror film. Some scenes do scare you. But I feel they really aimed low in the second half. Nothing much happened. The supporting cast I don't really know why they are there. They don't add anything to the movie. Chris Pratt and Bryce are main characters. I did like the young girl. She was nice. But the other characters, supporting our main protagonists didn't really need to be there. They don't bring anything new to the table. I think Jurassic World was way better than this second installment. And definitely it is not even anywhere near Jurassic Park 1 and 2 as some other reviews proclaim.","45 out of 100 found this helpful."

It should also drop the ""Jurassic"" word that shamelessly try to bait us with the movie magic conjured by the 1993 masterpiece but ended up needlessly bringing shame to the franchise.Movie couldn't be more formulaic. Plan to monetize dinosaurs gone wrong. Plant in a pre teen kid to l increase the stake cos we get numb at adults being chomp upon by dinosaurs. Body shots of amazing creatures bellowing for no apparent reason and demanding our shock and awe. They are probably saying, ""where is the Hollywood asteroid that is coming to wipe out our existence so that our good names can't be further sullied?""The thing I don't get is that one moment the movie demand u respect and fear these creatures, with another, the characters are cracking jokes with one another with the Dino snapping at their feet. Chris Pratt is more interested in looking suave and building his 14-17 teen girl fanbase than to act his part.In a sense I don't blame anyone but the money making motives of big Hollywood studios. There is just so little to work with dinosaurs. We can cross breed them, domesticate them and even gave them pet names. At some point you cross the boundary of being creative to being ludicrous.Overall, this is just another Transformer movie with more teeth and dinos who really really really love the taste of human flesh and will even stop for a bite will a volcano burning up behind them.p.s: is there actually a way to post spoilers in this movie?","36 out of 78 found this helpful."

Still the movie made more than a billion at the box office, so a sequel was inevitable, I know, because I just sat through it, yes that is the level of masochism I have become willing to endure to write these reviews...that I'm still 99% sure nobody ever reads. 
Now I'll be fair, the first 10 minutes of this movie actually was pretty good, the opening was very similar to that of the first movie: very gritty, quite intense, the dinosaurs were mostly kept in the shadows...if they had just stuck to that formula, I actually would have loved this. The few minutes after that wasn't too bad either, Jeff Goldblum made his cameo for the trailer, we had an appearance from John Hammond's walking stick, it was all serviceable...and then we're reintroduced to Chris Pratt, yes I know his character has a name, but screw it, from now on I'm just always going to call him Chris Pratt, because he ALWAYS plays the exact same character: 'Jurassic World', 'Guardians of the Galaxy', 'Magnificent Seven', hell even 'Passengers', a movie I really liked, still had him playing that tough guy, one liner spouting, slightly sarcastic, using a bad boy image to hide his heart of gold, character, and it's just starting to run really stale, really quickly. Bryce Dallas Howard returns too, and I will admit that she didn't annoy me quite as much here as in the previous entry, but that's kinda like saying that my Tinder date who spent 30 minutes making fun of my speech was slightly less awful than the one who threatened to shoot me. Tim and Lex from the original film return too...okay fine, it's not Tim and Lex, these two morons are called Zia and Franklin, and they're completely different to Tim and Lex in the sense that in the original Tim was the tough kid dino expert and Lex was the scared hacker kid, forced by circumstances to find her inner courage while here: Zia is the tough kid dino expert and Franklin is the scared hacker kid, forced by circumstances to find his courage. These two are the comic relief characters and I cannot put into words how much I detested every second that they were on screen. There's a little girl who makes out a 5th of the hero pack too, who simply gets waaay too much screen time with her limited acting ability. These five characters are not only our main protagonists: they are our ONLY protagonists and this is the first major fault with this movie, we know the Jurassic Park formula by now. They are not going to kill off a kid, they are not going to kill off the comic relief characters (no matter how much we wished they would) and they definitely are not going to kill off our two main heroes, so we're stuck watching a movie with zero intensity, because we know from the beginning that none of our heroes are going to die. The villains, on the other hand, we know the exact outcome, none of them have any character traits other than being greedy and villainous; Roland Tempo from 'The Lost World' was technically a villain, but he had redeeming qualities, qualities we could relate to and what's more, the villains had connections to each other, when they died, their friends felt it, so we felt it; here, if a villain dies, we don't care, because the characters don't care, they are simply cannon fodder, thrown in, because finally in the third act the writers remembered that this movie should probably kill some people off for fan service. Then we get to the plot, lol, a plot in a Jurassic World sequel, I make myself laugh sometimes. The just of it is that dinosaurs are facing extinction, because a huge volcano is threatening to destroy Isla Nublar and all the dinosaurs on it (I have two words for you Isla Sorna, did you forget that exists??). A greedy corporation wants to capture the dinosaurs and sell them to the highest bidder, so they go to the island to capture them, before the volcano erupts, and our heroes are invited along, because, well, I guess we had to bring them into the movie somehow. So, I know what you're thinking, isn't that basically the exact plot to 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park'? And yes, they did basically remake that movie, only difference is they removed everything that people actually liked about it and focused on the parts that were critically panned. You like the island sequences? Well don't get too attached to it, because, regardless of what the first trailer made us believe, we're only there for about 10 to 15 minutes before switching the movie to the mainland. Yep, the bulk of Jurassic World plays off in a mansion owned by a man named Benjamin Lockwood, who apparently helped Hammond create the dinosaurs, funny how we just made it through four movies without any mention of a co-creator...convenient. From there on, really nothing happens, our villains do villain things, our heroes do heroic things (which in this universe means they act like idiots and just get lots of people killed) and the movie ends with the second part of Jeff Goldblum's trailer monologue and setting up the next sequel. So, is there anything positive I can say about this movie? Uhm, the original John Williams theme is still there and that's always nice to hear, uhm, the CGI is better than the previous film, anything else? NO! This movie is awful, it's a waste of time and yet another painful entry into, what was once, a brilliant franchise. In closing, I will say that this movie didn't anger me quite as much as 'Jurassic World' did, but that was simply because I had spent 14 years waiting for that film and went in with the highest hopes, while here I waited less than three and went in expecting nothing...exactly what the film gave me, so at least I can say it lived up to expectations...so, I guess well done for that?","6 out of 9 found this helpful."

We only got a glimpse of how exciting that would be at the end of ""The Lost World"". For this go round, thankfully a few other wrinkles are added to mix it up a bit. Part of that is the animals get off the island. In this case it is the crux of the first act, a volcano is about to erupt, we must prevent these dinosaurs from being killed. That is the patchwork to reunite the leads Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard. It also provides a cameo for Jeff Goldblum. Many action set-pieces were drawn up for this film. Many of them have good shock moments. Following along are two college-aged kids. They are given things to do but are flimsy as characters. Less successful are the set of characters surrounding an old estate. We learn that there is an underground dinosaur facility there. Really, for the movie's sake, is all you really need to know as it becomes the center of the third act. However, we are given a dying billionaire, a housekeeper/surrogate mom, a granddaughter, and the designated greedy corporate bad guy. But these characters, other than the bad guy, are not directly connected with the storyline up to this point. They are tossed in to create set-pieces, or at least artificially manufacture some heart tugging emotional moments (that don't work). Most reviews I looked over mentions that the sheer excitement factor of the action set-pieces makes it enough to enjoy going to see this film in the theatre. Yes and no. Most would agree that it is possible to put human emotion into a dinosaur film as demonstrated by the very first Jurassic Park. This script has obvious moments that feel slapped together to take us to the next set-piece. As for the excitement level in the action scenes, I would say about half of them gave you a good jolt. The other dinosaur attacks are now starting to get old, now on the 5th iteration of this kind of film. Through the years, other films have brought us CGI monsters, and one wonders how much shock value these kind of dinosaur attacks still hold. The action that creates the most excitement are based on other hazards (lava, water, explosions). There are moments that are supposed to tug your heart, but I wasn't moved. I suppose the conclusion about whether to see this film is to stick to the standard line ""leave your brain at the door and you will have a fun time"". Meant as a roller coaster ride, it is too bad since the original Jurassic Park had a lot more substance.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

Trite characters who never learn anything from the previous ones. Barely anything truly new, just rehashes. Etc. Etc.
Even at their most mediocre, the previous quartet of Jurassic movies always had some element of a sense of wonder about the scientific breakthroughs. Here, all the new characters are crass boars who deserve to be stomped and chomped. Of course, these people exist in the ""real"" world -- but, who wants to spend 128 minutes with them if there's so little else? The treatment of science here is borderline offensive.
Hidden late in this mess, is exactly ONE new revelation, but even that is buried because of the rush to get to the next chase (crikey, every time a character takes a wrong turn, it becomes a five minute sequence just to get them back on course - hasn't Director J.A. Bayona and his editors ever heard of...editing?). Even more to the point, IF the scientists can achieve THAT monumental breakthrough in genetic science, why the hell would they have to go to an island sinking in the ocean because of volcanic activity to ""save"" older experimental samples? (Yeah, I know they give maternal & economic reasons, but, come on).
Chris Pratt is ok. The kid (Isabella Sermon) is fine. Nice to see James Cromwell and Geraldine Chaplin in small support roles. But, poor Toby Jones. He has to spout more cliches than there are dinosaur species running around all by himself. And, what happened to Bryce Dallas Howard? She'll never be confused with Marion Cotillard as an actress, but she is just a blank here. I know that some revere Michael Giacchino (mostly for his Pixar work), but this score, like most of his other live action ones, is bland. More accompanying 'noise' than anything.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

My favorite film in the series is Jurassic World, followed by Jurassic Park. The rest are kind of just in there. I was rooting for Fallen Kingdom to be great. Obviously, the special effects for Fallen Kingdom are some of the best, since they used the latest technology. Besides that though, it's obvious that the creators are running out of plot lines and sub-plot lines. While I watched this movie, there were several times when I said, ""Haven't I seen this plot/scene/situation in a previous Jurassic Park Film?"" Yes, I had. Further, the creators tried to create some new sub-plots, but that only murkied the storyline further, and the those sub-plots were never tied up nicely or understandably. I'm glad I got to see Fallen Kingdom in the theatre, but I will not be disappointed if I don't get this for Christmas. A great movie is worth watching again and again; Fallen Kingdom isn't. If the JP creators actually venture to add another film to this series, then I hope they try some new angles that they haven't thought of before. Maybe some prequels? I would not let your kids see this film if they get scared sleeping in their rooms at night; there are a few scenes in Fallen Kingdom that would be especially scary for kids.","2 out of 11 found this helpful."

Most of the comedy was pretty dry, but it was still funny throughout. There's not enough depth to the movie, and it's something I can just watch while my brain's shut off. But the idea was so grand and the execution was pretty good nonetheless, so I won't complain a whole lot. I did really enjoy all the new dinosaurs, and I was happy we got such a nice, new variety. The beginning was a little stronger than the end, with the end feeling like there wasn't enough writing to keep it alive. The ""big twist"" was a little too predictable and wasn't strong, but was a twist nonetheless. The very end did have some pretty cool dinosaur scenes, but that didn't revive a good portion of the time before it.

Directed by J. A. Bayona and serving as the fifth installment in the iconic Jurassic Park franchise, this film successfully breathes new life into the prehistoric world while exploring thought-provoking themes. With its mesmerizing visuals, heart-pounding action sequences, and a touch of genuine emotion, Fallen Kingdom proves to be a worthy addition to the saga.Set three years after the catastrophic events of Jurassic World, the film follows Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) as they embark on a daring mission to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from Isla Nublar, which is on the brink of destruction due to an impending volcanic eruption. However, their noble intentions become entangled with a sinister conspiracy that could forever change the balance of nature. As the duo races against time to save the dinosaurs from extinction once again, they find themselves facing new threats and moral dilemmas that challenge their beliefs.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom effectively captivates the audience from the opening scene, setting the stage for a thrilling adventure that seamlessly blends nostalgic elements from the original Jurassic Park films with fresh and exhilarating storytelling. The film's screenplay, penned by Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly, skillfully balances action, suspense, and character development, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats throughout.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its stunning visuals and masterful use of CGI. Bayona's direction brings a sense of awe and wonder, showcasing the grandeur of the dinosaurs and their environments. From the terrifyingly realistic T-Rex to the gentle and intelligent Blue, each creature is brought to life with meticulous attention to detail. The lush cinematography combined with the mesmerizing score by Michael Giacchino enhances the immersive experience, making Fallen Kingdom an absolute visual treat.While the action sequences are undeniably thrilling, what sets Fallen Kingdom apart is its exploration of ethical and moral dilemmas. The film delves into the consequences of humanity's hubris in playing god and the blurred lines between preservation and exploitation. It raises thought-provoking questions about our responsibility towards these majestic creatures and the repercussions of tampering with the natural order. This thoughtfulness adds depth to the narrative, making the film more than just a popcorn flick.The performances in Fallen Kingdom are commendable, with Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt reprising their roles as Claire and Owen. Howard brings a newfound strength and resilience to her character, evolving from a corporate-minded park operator to a passionate advocate for the dinosaurs. Pratt effortlessly embodies the rugged charm and wit of Owen, providing moments of levity amidst the chaos. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, driving the emotional core of the film.Furthermore, the supporting cast, including newcomers Justice Smith and Daniella Pineda, deliver solid performances, adding depth to their respective roles. The film also sees the return of Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm, whose brief appearances offer insightful commentary on the moral dilemmas at hand, further connecting Fallen Kingdom to the original Jurassic Park trilogy.In conclusion, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a thrilling and thought-provoking adventure that surpasses expectations. With its seamless blend.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."
"3","/10","A Poor Film In This Franchise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7647399/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","15 December 2021","After watching the previous films in this franchise I have come to watch the newest Jurassic Film - Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees the island being destroyed by a volcano which causes Claire and Owen to return and try and save the dinosaurs.Main Character
Chris Pratt is back as Owen Grady for this film and he is fine here, he mostly has the charm and charisma that he usually has and it makes him likeable enough. It's just hos character has no development over this film after the last film, his motivations at first are pretty poor and you wonder why he really goes on the journey.Supporting Characters
Bryce Dallas Howard is back as Claire and the one thing I can say is that her character actually had some development here, she is a more loving person for the dinosaurs then the previous film. But she does spend plenty of this film just screaming and I just don't feel her and Pratt have any real on screen chemistry and that continued in this film. Rafe Spall plays a really generic character here and you really won't care at all, you know what his motivations are and you know where is character is going. Also if you are watching this film because you saw the trailer and saw Jeff Goldblum back as Dr Ian Malcolm then don't because he is literally in two scenes that are both in the trailer which was hugely disappointing.Story
The story is where the film really falls down, the characters motivations for going to save the dinosaurs is really mixed and you find it hard to believe. All the characters who seem like villains are and they all have really poor motivations and basic performances. There is also this story involving this young girl that feels really tacked on and there is a twist involving it that is absurd and even worst it literally plays no part in the story at all. The ending sets up an interesting idea for future films but it also feels silly and over the top and after watching the plot you have checked out by then.Script
The script is really poor too, the romance between the two main characters is really poorly written and it feels like we wasted our time dealing with it in the previous film. Plus characters are written to do really stupid things and the humour doesn't work especially with a couple of characters that are literally in there to try and be funny but they just fail.Style
The style of the film is where the film kind of improves, the dinosaurs look great here and there are some fun action sequences. Plus this film maybe does the best job in the franchise at building tension and focusing on the more horror elements which is a nice thing to see. But also this film is pretty slow and its pacing holds it back, the slower parts of the films aren't interesting and it holds the film back.Overall
Overall, I was really disappointed by this film, it is much slower then its predecessor and the film isn't as exciting. It is a poor film and not worth a watch even if you are a big fan of this franchise.Rating - 3/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful."

The 4DX made it for me. Despite its flaws, I found it a better first time experience than Jurassic World. Which I loathed.The villain of the piece was in full on pantomime mode, with the lame cliche reason of financial greed being his motivation. Chris Pratt was surprisingly subdued and the two sidekicks were awful. Bryce Dallas Howard stands out in this movie. Considering I hated her in the last movie, that is quite an achievement. What a waste off Jeff Goldblum. Considering I have seen him promoting the movie a lot, I expected him to be used a lot more.As for the dino's, they all look great again, and I really felt for one in particular. Oh and d**n, the raptor Blue is so loyal to Chris Pratt. I'd love my own little Raptor Blue.Considering what happened at the end, I'm intrigued with where they will take the next one. Surprising considering I wasn't interested in this one.","1 out of 5 found this helpful."

Jurassic Park is in almost every shape or form, a superior film. Jurassic World by no means was a great film. It did have some pretty good scenes but all in all, it was no Jurassic Park. The sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom recycles the Lost World's premise - only this time, the dinosaurs are gonna die. And so, our (reluctant) heroes venture into the danger zone where they are exposed not only to dangerous animals but also predictable plot points and a hammy Act 2. My biggest problem with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was with the character, Franklin. He's a goofy doofus. It's evident. He's the only one applying bug spray. He's afraid of small planes. He screams like a child when he sees a carnivorous dinosaur. Things just don't seem to be right for him. Seems to me that the character's purpose is only to provide comic relief. But, here's my question? Is comedy really necessary? You've got the visual spectacle, the thrill and some impressive looking dinosaurs. Do we also need forced humour? My head was deep in my palm whenever Franklin was on screen. It was just cringey to watch him spoil the entire movie. Note to Spielberg: PLEASE! PLEASE! Direct the third film or stop this madness at once.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

Selling dino's, regenerating them, becoming friends with 'blue' again helping them. Nah, not for me, the further this franchise goes the more we enter a Disney feeling. Okay, the attack and do eat people and the effects are stunning and playing with shadows did work too. Childish isn't the exact word but I guess you know what I mean.It took me 2 years to finally watch it, I was afraid, afraid it would let me down, and it did.

I absolutely adore this film and I have it on Blu Ray. I love dinosaurs very much, always been a fan. I own all the Jurassic movies and I love them all. There are dinosaurs, people screaming, dinosaurs eating people, absolutely stunning CGI for these dinosaurs and great sound effects for them as well. It's fun, there's action, and there's humor as well. The movie is fantastic. But it is not without several flaws. I personally think there was too much... Down time? Boring time? Too much times spent doing unnecessary scenes or doing things that just took too much time. In the last Jurassic World movie, I was blown away with the Indominus Rex, she dominated the film. In this movie? The Indoraptor is by far my FAVORITE of the two hybrids, he's brilliant, but he doesn't have enough mind-blowing screentime as the Indominus did. He's scary and all, I loved him, the idea of this deadly predator moving as a quadruped is just amazing because it adds to his overall level of scary. But it took SO long for the movie to movie along and get to where we finally are introduced to him. With the Indominus, we see her so many times throughout the entirety of the movie. She is fully fleshed out. The Indoraptor gets thrown on screen last minute and then killed just as quickly. I'm also disappointed to hear he DID have more scenes, but his extra scenes were cut from the final movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful."

What would possess anyone to think: ""Hey, let's use prehistoric DNA to clone the unstoppable killing machine!"" When is that ever a good idea? Well, never. Director J. A. Bayona's sequel ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" inherits its own faulty DNA in the perpetuating premise. Yet, J. A. along with Writers Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow manage to navigate the repetitive narrative sideways. We actually cheer for the vicious dinosaurs against mankind. Mostly, because mankind occurs as stupid. Human creators played God, and were arrogant enough to think that they could control the Raptors and other creatures. Perhaps, messing with evolution. Creating a brave new order? No.""Fallen Kingdom"" opens with the familiar face from ""Jurassic Park"". Now elder scientist Ian Malcolm, surprisingly humbled Jeff Goldblum, testifies before the Congressional Committee. The cataclysmic volcanic eruptions on Isla Nublar threaten the second extinction of DNA cloned dinosaurs on the Island. Ian advises Congress to let the creatures all die in the volcanic aftermath. He says that this may be Nature's way of ""self-correction"". Of course idiocy prevails: Congress orders the military rescue of at least 11 species of dinosaurs for the sake of having a movie to make. The Government enlists passionate idealist Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire, now dinosaur preservation activist, as part of the operations extraction team. Claire seeks out her estranged ex-lover Owen, whimsically aloof Chris Pratt, to join their mission. Owen has a unique affinity for Raptor named ""Blue"". He's like the ""dinosaur whisperer"". Predictably, reluctant Owen joins Claire for the helicopter ride to Isla Nublar. In the clandestine background, Jurassic Park co-creator Benjamin Lockwood, played by weary wise James Cromwell, suffers over his precarious legacy. His estate executive Eli, played by cool calculated Rafe Spall, has more mercenary intentions for Lockwood's legacy. Lockwood entrusts the care of his innocent young granddaughter Maisie, played by bright strong Isabella Sermon, to Eli. Maisie also has strange affinity for her Grandfather's dinosaur creations. ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is nonstop action eye-candy that overwhelms any semblance of character development. The fierce Raptors and T-Rexs are visual effects marvels. Chris is charmingly game as Owen, and delivers martial arts skills along with flip one-liners. Bryce is intense, yet light-hearted resilience as purposeful Claire. I loved Director Bayona's ""A Monster Calls"", which is the greater movie. ""Fallen Kingdom"" benefits from his amazing visual style. In ""A Monster Calls"" Bayona's authentic gift is his endearing connection of childhood. I believe that gift resuscitates ""Fallen Kingdom"" in the story of young Maisie. Resisting the overplayed child in peril scenario, Isabella's Maisie sees both the wonder and terror of ""The Fallen Kingdom"". There's a very touching scene midway through as frightened Maisie hugs Owen. He holds her close. He promises that everything will be all right. Maisie holds hope for the brighter day to come. Hope that the evil that men do shall come to its end. That glimmer of childhood idealism revives ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" above the state of the art action movie fare. We see the hope through the eyes of the child.","1 out of 6 found this helpful."

I was hoping it wasn't just The Lost World: Jurassic Park all over again, and I was pleasantly surprised by the end of it. The island part of the movie doesn't feel like a slog to get through compared to The Lost World, and it felt like two movies in one when it came to an end.If you were expecting action and dinosaurs, you'll get that, but one thing that surprised was there were quite a few emotional scenes in it. The themes of greed and extinction lead to some interesting scenes spread throughout the movie, and I definitely got a bit of a classic Jurassic Park vibe to the movie in small doses. Is it perfect? No, there are quite a few cliches and predictable parts to it, but it didn't destroy the movie for me. I enjoyed both the first half and the second half equally, and I also got a bit of a Horror vibe to it in parts too.The acting is decent. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are the same as they were back in Jurassic World. The new characters are good and the little girl in this one has some decent moments. Even Jeff Goldblum's appearance didn't feel wasted and made sense in the plot of the movie. The CGI/Special Effects feels more polished here, the music is good, and the directing seems much more solid compared to Jurassic World. Overall, I liked this movie but I think it's going to be quite divisive. It's impossible to top the original Jurassic Park, but I appreciate the new things they added to keep things fresh in the series.7/10","1 out of 7 found this helpful."

Despite seeing that movie numerous times, it never gets old. If you're up for a movie night, an entertaining thriller, Jurassic Park is an ideal movie to see for a movie night.Since Jurassic Park came out, they have done sequels and rewrote the story to Jurassic World. I will say, I thought it was impressive with the first Jurassic World of how they finally got a secure dinosaur amusement park. It felt like a real place!! I wish this new movie had included Gray and Zach from the first to give more of a sequel feel.Anyway, I just want to say that they seem to have trouble coming up with sequels and make them appeal as much as Jurassic Park. For one, I feel like the dinosaurs looked and seemed more realistic in Jurassic Park with practical effects than they do now as CGI. I also thought their eyes looked more realistic in Jurassic Park. With CGI being so big nowadays, I still am often times more for the practical effects. In Jurassic Park, the dinosaurs look like dinosaurs, but with the CGI we have nowadays, some of the time while watching this new movie, I thought the dinosaurs looked like they could be aliens instead from an alien movie attacking.Another thing to mention is we remember and like the characters from Jurassic Park: Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler, Ian Malcolm. In these Jurassic World movies we think of Claire and Owen as the main characters. There are other characters, but mostly these characters in the Jurassic World movies aren't all that interesting, just like characters to play a scene in an action movie with dinosaurs. There's like no character development in this movie, as a good part of Jurassic Park is how we see character development with Alan Grant.I ought to say, I thought the action sequence we see from the trailer with the volcano was cool. Often times when we think of dinosaurs we think of volcanoes. But, I thought the other action sequence, while it still kept you on your seat I thought of it as cheesy, and not really seeming realistic, just including action scenes with dinosaurs.While this movie was okay, it's not a movie I'd really care to see again or really recommend seeing. It entertained me, but didn't really leave me feeling excited. I'd leave it at a 5/5.","14 out of 28 found this helpful."

The series has never quite reached the heights of its progenitor, though the previous entry did a good job of capturing a number of ideas from Crichton's original book that did not feature in the original trilogy, while carefully steering the series into a new direction.Fallen Kingdom, however, fails to capitalize or reach the lofty levels that its predecessor did. At the heart of it is the introduction of John Hammond's heretofore unknown former friend and partner, played by James Cromwell. Injecting such a character with such a deep history and link with Hammond throws a wrinkle into what we have had up to this point, and makes itself somewhat problematic.The set pieces, animatronics and action are some excellent parts of the movie (even if in some occasions they border on the absurd), but some development, particularly of Owen, is sacrificed. The two newer ""good-guy"" characters aren't much more than one-note, and Owen gets little actual development beyond being a bit more badass than last time.There is a brilliant twist in the latter stages that escalates the stakes and acts as a sort of game changer for the world built out of the original movie. It could cause reverberations in further installments, depending on decisions future creative teams could make.In many ways, this movie feels like the adaptation of the Lost World, in that it was a cash grab that didn't do much to expand on the original, and featured Jeff Goldblum. It is fun, there are certain points that are good, but they fail to string these ideas together well enough, and the notion that the previous film presented of the Franken-saurus now feels overused. But for fans of the series, and fans of dinosaurs eating people, you should have a good time.","1 out of 8 found this helpful."
"6","/10","Fun Popcorn Flick","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4218733/?ref_=tt_urv","WooderIce64","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur84421527/?ref_=tt_urv","28 June 2018","Jurassic World was one of the biggest popcorn flicks of the decade. It's a fun movie, but that's about it. It borrows a lot from Jurassic Park, and relies heavily on nostalgia. Fallen Kingdom is a follow-up to it. It does have quite a bit in common with the first film, notably that it's nothing more than a decent popcorn flick. Most of the good qualities about the movie come from that. The visual effects are spectacular. The dinosaurs still look awesome. The action sequences are great. Some of the new stuff is also interesting. The second half of the movie is set in a giant mansion, rather than in the park. This is a very neat setting for this movie, and a welcome change of pace for the franchise. The first half is a rescue mission, which isn't particularly interesting and feels rehashed. The second half makes up for it. The new characters are nothing to report on. Gia is this sort of dinosaur veterinarian. Not much else to say. Franklin's whole thing is that he's a coward, and that's all there is to him. He shows up for a few jokes, and that's it. Maisie is the granddaughter of John Lockwood, John Hammond's former associate. After all, it wouldn't be a Jurassic Park movie without a kid. Is it just me, or is every child actor out there British? Not that that's inherently a bad thing. Lockwood himself appears as a dying old man. The non-dinosaur villains are lame, but then again, since when were Jurassic Park villains not lame? Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) return from the previous film. They're given most of the attention, as they are the main characters. Dr. Wu returns from the other films, although here he's a villain of sorts.I think the problem here is that it wasted too much potential, for new ideas and nostalgia appeal. For the latter, the ads heavily featured the return of Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who gets 2 minutes of screen time at max. It also could have made better use of the classic John Williams soundtrack from Jurassic Park. It's in it, but only once in the movie and once in the credits. Look how well that worked for the new Star Wars movies. For new ideas, there's a twist involving Maisie that's totally out of left field and only referenced once, but was interesting and had the potential to bring a whole new edge to the series. The cliffhanger ending was a good new idea, and leaves open the ideas for what will happen when Jurassic World 3 inevitably comes out.","1 out of 8 found this helpful."
"6","/10","Ludicrous at times, but still an enjoyable ride.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4249055/?ref_=tt_urv","rustonreviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur78526769/?ref_=tt_urv","22 July 2018","Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park (1993) is a landmark in cinema that still holds up today. With iconic moments including the still impressive T-Rex introduction and the tension filled sequence in which Raptor's stalk the kitchen in search of Hammond's grandchildren, the original film remains one of the greats. The Lost World (1997), a somewhat underrated piece of work, continued the adventure and packed many more memorable moments (a T-Rex patrolling a sleepy neighbourhood being a definite highlight). Audiences were less favourable towards Jurassic Park III (2001), and it wouldn't be until 2015 in which Trevorrow revitalised the franchise with Jurassic World, albeit with mixed results. I found Jurassic World to be a simply okay film; an undoubtably fun ride with room for improvement. When it was announced J.A Bayona (a terrific director) would be at the helm for Fallen Kingdom, I was immediately intrigued to see where the franchise would be heading. Picking up three years after the previous film, it is brought to attention that Isla Nublar's volcano is active with an eruption inevitably on the horizon, thus sparking the debate whether the dinosaurs on the island should be rescued or left to perish. Whilst Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum in a criminally short cameo) argues that the dinosaurs should be left to die to ensure that Hammond's drastic errors are corrected, Claire Dearing (Dallas Howard) actively works to prevent their second extinction. Bringing aboard a reluctant Owen Grady (Pratt) and a team of mercenaries, they embark on a journey back to Isla Nublar to transfer the dinosaurs to an island sanctuary. Because, of course, that totally sounds like a good idea.I had a lot of fun with Fallen Kingdom. Bayona's distinct visual style is evident from the beginning, resulting in what I consider to easily be the best looking instalment in the franchise to date. It's a thrilling ride with some fantastic set pieces, and the combination of animatronic effects and CGI is thankfully well balanced. The return of Pratt and Dallas Howard is a welcome one, and the films climactic battle is tremendously awesome and stands as one of the films most memorable moments. Despite being thoroughly entertaining, it doesn't change the fact that Fallen Kingdom is monumentally ridiculous at times. 
Connolly and Trevorrow's script is riddled with ludicrous ideas. Some much required character development is non-existent, and many decisions and actions present in the film are frustratingly illogical. One specific plot point is unapologetically recycled from the previous film, and there is a plot twist that feels entirely irrelevant and contributes nothing to the overall narrative. It is a plot twist that had no business being in the movie, which unfortunately leads into an ending that is both stunningly idiotic and baffling. But, despite all that, Fallen Kingdom succeeds where it matters most; it's bombastically fun, despite how cripplingly ridiculous it all is. For what it is, it's an enjoyable ride, providing you don't think about it too much.","1 out of 9 found this helpful."

If so, then you'll enjoy the 5th installment, for it is more of the same - man's hubris causes giant animals to run amok and chaos, death and destruction ensues.The plot of this film is simple enough - the island where JURASSIC WORLD was built is now in trouble as a dormant volcano is now dormant no more. The debate rages - should Man go to the island to save the Dinosaurs trapped there - or should they let nature take it's course (again). Some nefarious fellows - who's intentions don't seem to be as pure as we are led to believe - convince our heroes from the previous film, Claire and Owen to help ""save"" the dinosaurs.But, of course, the plot is just an excuse to get some pretty awesome looking CGI Dinosaurs on the screen - and to put our heroes in peril. And on that score, this film succeeds wonderfully well.I remember back in 1993 how awed I was at the spectacle on the screen. The CGI Dinosaurs were LIFE-LIKE! I was blown away by it. Today, I have come to expect the CGI will be top-notch - and I was not disappointed, to the point where I forgot that I was watching CGI.As for the action and acting, Director J.A. Bayona (A MONSTER CALLS) keeps things moving along at a sprightly pace, not letting us catch our breath - or more importantly - stop to think of the plausibility or logic of decisions being made. His mantra seems to be ""move our heroes from peril to peril"" - and he does that well.Chris Pratt is back as Owen, the ""Raptor handler"" and his charm and charisma on screen is in full display and really carries the weight of this film. He is able to charm his way into the audiences heart, so you end up rooting for him fully from start to finish. Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of ""Opie Cunningham"" Ron Howard) comes into her own as Claire, the Dinosaur ""Scientist"" and quasi-love interest for Owen. She is able to avoid (mostly) the cliches of ""damsel in distress"" or ""kick-ass chick"" and gives us a rounded character that I rooted for just as strongly as Pratt's character.The rest of the cast - save two - are pretty much throw away that are set up to be Dinosaur food. The two that stood out are the great James Cromwell as an aging Billionaire who has a connection to the originator of Jurassic Park, John Hammond. Cromwell is his usual, solid self. And...the funniest character in the film...computer expert Franklin Webb (played by Justice Smith) who, of course, is asked to do more than just ""computer stuff"" that he is ill-equipped to handle.Going into this film, you know what you are going to get - and this film delivers that entertainingly enough. As I stated at the top, if you like the first 4 films of this series, you'll like this one.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","1 out of 10 found this helpful."

My adrenaline kept going up as I witnessed Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard return as the lead roles Owen and Claire, while they take on another challenge in the ruins of the abandoned theme park.Three years have passed and with a volcanic eruption imminent on Isla Nublar, it's up to former park employees Owen and Claire to take on their newest challenge: Rescuing as many roaming dinosaurs and getting them to safety. But for Owen, it's about finding the last surviving Velociraptor he personally raised, Blue. As before, this also attracts attention of corrupt individuals willing to use these dinosaurs for nefarious purposes as well as encountering a new species of dinosaur never seen before.Director J.A. Bayona definitely painted a darker picture in the Jurassic Park universe. Story-wise, I say this latest installment is basically a dark clone to its 1997 predecessor The Lost World. And the return of Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm was worthwhile and a nice touch to said film, but I kind of wished his role was expanded more than given here. James Cromwell's role as Ben Lockwood is an interesting person with his ties to the late founder of Jurassic Park John Hammond. Given Chris Pratt's reputation in action-adventure films, his performance kept me on the edge of my seat as I simply just picture him as Star Lord on a separate, solo mission. I know there's still a sequel film on the way following from this and judging by what the end result of the movie had shown, it feels unfinished. The story comes in short supply, but the performances were more than enough to keep an open mind.","1 out of 12 found this helpful."

Let dinosaurs be extinct for a second time. In a similar vein the Jurassic Park franchise has run out of gas.Set three years after the destruction of Jurassic World. Isla Nublar is facing catastrophe as the dormant volcano becomes active and threatens to destroy all the creatures on the island.Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is fighting to save the dinosaurs by trying to get political support. She is hired by a wealthy former business associate of John Hammond to rescue the dinosaurs and place them in another island where they could live in an isolated environment.However the company's chief officer Eli Millis (Rafe Spall) has another plan up his sleeve to auction off the rescued dinosaurs and create genetically enhanced dinosaurs as military weapons.Owen (Chris Pratt) is persuaded by Claire to return to Isla Nublar for the rescue which quickly goes wrong.Whereas Jurassic World was a retread of Jurassic Park, this one has the basic story of The Lost World: Jurassic Park which was never that good.The first half is set on Isla Nublar, the second part is set in a country mansion that looks like it is in England than California.The plot is just plain daft, it makes no sense whatsoever and contradicts previous films.","15 out of 31 found this helpful."

Some find the dopiness overshadowing the good while others are too impressed with the visuals to knock it. Well I am here to say all the people that bash this are simply wrong. Trashing a movie with such great qualities like great visuals and exciting danger just makes you sound more like an idiot than a film expert. Those that gave it a warm or normal thumbs down for this are more trustworthy.Back in the fun are Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt. We have grown to love them since the first, so we really don't want anything to happen to them. Rich evil scientists try to take the dinosaurs off the island (which is in really bad shape) and make money off of them, but Howard and Pratt want them to live in peace. Right away, this is a pretty dumb storyline. All the other instalments deal with the fact that humans and dinosaurs cannot coexist. Dinosaurs can cause so much destruction and can easily extinct humans. Pratt and Howard don't want any of them to die? Give me a break. The scientists wanting to make money off of them is downright silly and the most annoying element. And that is mostly who we deal with aside from the two heroes. So yes, there are flaws that prevent this movie from being great.But there are true redemptive elements that are a ton of fun. Like all the others, the dinosaurs look real. That alone is a plus. Here, they run rampant and cause way more mayhem than usual. The look and style of some of the dinosaurs have been made to look more badass and simply more awesome. Anybody that does not like to see realistic dinosaurs in action, I ask this question: ""Are we at that point in society where seeing a dinosaur is as trivial as seeing a dog?""A spark of originality in these dinosaurs is that they are basically anti-heroes. There is a total of three characters in the entire movie that we like (Howard, Pratt, and James Cromwell's granddaughter) other than that, we would rather see these prehistoric creatures open up a can of whop-ass on the cast. When they do, it is awesome. Annoying characters we want gone are destroyed by amazing creatures. Is that not great? Is that not what you wanted? As long as they leave the three alone, seeing them cause carnage to dopes we don't like is a real treat. And all of which is done in very impressive feats. NOBODY can deny how amazing these prehistoric creatures looked and how awesomely directed the entire thing was. The mayhem on the rise caused further excitement and even admiration for the crew in just how impressive this sheer creation was.So is 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' great? No. There are simply too many heavy flaws that prevent this from reaching an overall high quality. However, I ask you to please not overlook the strengths this movie has. Many of them cleanly overpower the weaknesses.3/4","1 out of 13 found this helpful."

I've slept on it to properly digest it so here's what I think. The film itself is decent enough, I'm a big fan of all the films (even the bemoaned JP3) and this one sits itself along the others quite well. 
I loved the first one, brilliant entertainment, Owen the swashbuckling hero and Claire the corporate employee who did everything by the book and wanted to preserve the company and generate profit above all else. It was a rollercoaster of a film and had all the elements you'd want from a Jurassic Park film (albeit with some ""suspend your disbelief"" moments)This film, however, still has some elements of the first one but has become slightly darker. The light hearted humour moments and one liners are rarer and the film seems intent to become more sensible and tell a more moral story rather than be more lighter entertainment. 
The film goes at a good pace with some good set pieces that you'd come to expect and the 2 odd hours flew by but I couldn't help, as much as I liked it, that it was missing something. The new director for this and I assume for the 3rd instalment has his own ideas on telling the story which is all good but this film feels different to the first, not in a good or necessarily bad way, but it'll make the trilogy feel a bit disjointed. The main protagonist Mills (Rafe Spall) doesn't convince as the main ""bad guy"" for me. He seemed very one dimensional and a bit wooden, his character never developed and maybe it should have been a little bit. Overall it's a good film and I took my 6 year old son and he enjoyed it but it left me a bit wanting. I hope the third one is an improvement. 6.5/10 for me","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

I wonder going forward how many other secret partners David Attenborough's dearly departed brother is going to have had that get thrown in to support the latest plot idea.Speaking of David Attenborough, I wonder what he would think of what his brother did in making all these creatures de-extinct as is the phrase coined in this movie? However he referred to them, Morrissey would probably have a problem with it. But then he is an animal that should have become extinct years ago himself.So, the blind girl from The Village has split up with Star Lord, but needs his help to go and rescue a load of dinosaurs from a volcanic island that is about to explode. Yes, the old completely incompatible couple that get together, then conveniently have split up before the next movie, then we discover they still really like each other and all that business.We have the completely predictable story of people messing with things they shouldn't be messing with and they all go out of control. Again. No matter how many times the Grandmaster Ian 'Chaos Theory' Malcolm tells them, they just won't listen. No wonder he just disappeared to his own planet to promote and enjoy superfights between various space creatures and animated rock formations with Kiwi accents and of course, Hulk v Thor.We also have the renegade child running around the place getting saved and looked after by the in-love/not-in love/in-love-again incompatible couple as seems to be standard in this and similar franchises. Although there is a secret about the child that turns out to be an interesting little twist in the movie that is a nice little addition to proceedings.Then of course some of the dinosaurs have to have their little handbags at dawn fights and Blue and the ever-popular T-Rex have their little grandstanding heroic moments. Yep, it's all pretty standard and in fear of getting a bit like the Star Wars franchise.

The various dinosaurs have been left to live on their own little island. But now the dormant volcano is erupting, predictions are that it will be an extinction event for the dinosaurs. Unless some of them can be moved out to a safer place.There are some hearings, some want to ""protect"" the dinosaurs, even though they are not there naturally, some want to just let nature take its course, let them die.Chris Pratt as Owen Grady is content to be off in the wilderness building his camp when he is approached. It is old flame, Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing, who pleads with him to join her in an expedition paid by a private group to relocate some of them to a different remote island. He reluctantly agrees.The meat of the story is the deception, the wealthy group doesn't intend to simply relocate the dinosaurs, they want to capture them to do research to develop species they can weaponize and sell for millions.There is more and more action as the movie moves along, some scenes similar to the older Jurassic movies where a raptor of some sort is hunting down people and they, usually, narrowly escape. Not a great, high-concept movie but suitably entertaining for 2 hours.","1 out of 4 found this helpful."

I think my mother enjoyed it more than I did, but I can at least say the movie was entertaining, I was never bored, and I liked some sequences like the chase scene with the volcano and the sleeping T-Rex scene which were all seen in the trailers.Somewhere down the line, though, I started getting taken out of the movie. It starts out strong enough. We are taken underwater where a sub finds the skeletal remains of the Indominous Rex from the last film and takes a tooth from it for some reason. Then this poor bastard in the rain hears a dilophosaurus (which once again doesn't make an appearance which angered me yet again) and then he gets chased by a T-Rex. Then he escapes via ladder from a helicopter and laughs at the T-Rex until a reprise from the Mosasaurus from the last film chomps him. The helicopter goes unscathed and returns back to wherever it is returning to.This sequence, though thrilling, proves my point about films today. In the first Jurassic Park it took its time before the action and it was developing characters and a story. Audiences were bored of that so this sequence and the rest of the movie is purely action. We are then introduced to Claire from the last film who isn't as pompous as she once was, and now has two people working for her: A girl who looks like Velma from Scooby Doo and some wuss named Franklin. Soon Claire visits a place called Lockwood Mansion and meets with a guy who looks like a cross between Bradley Cooper and Patrick Wilson named Eli. They seem to know each other very well and Claire sees some little girl hiding from her. Eli tells her that they need the raptor named Blue from the last film and one man alone can retrieve it.That man is of course Star Lord himself, Chris Pratt playing Owen again. Like the last film she finds him in some secluded area where he's building a log cabin. She buys him a beer in some bar and Owen would rather Blue die in that volcano eruption and leaves her at that. Somehow his mind changes when he watches home videos from when Blue was a puppy so just like that, he was sleeping in their plane the whole night waiting for them. He even mentions to Franklin how he rode a motorcycle with a pack of raptors.Then, in some strange turn of events, the movie starts to copy Lost World. There is a bunch of mercenaries hired by Lockwood to find these dinosaurs and when Owen finds Blue, they suddenly turn on them and try to kill them. What? From this point on, it's nothing but action. When I say nothing but action, I mean one action scene to the next. One minute they are running from lava, the next they are underwater where Owen can shoots bullets and use a knife to open the gyrosphere. After that they rush to the boat and watch the dinosaurs die horrifically in the ashes of the volcano. Then they are trying to get blood from a T-Rex to save Blue.Then the movie starts to be more of a cartoon with this auction and characters better seen in a Looney Tunes cartoon. This is where we are introduced to yet another hybrid dinosaur called Indoraptor. I can't take this thing seriously. It's like every frame of it is like watching something out of Animaniacs or something. It's just not scary at all. There's even a scene where it plays dead and opens its eyes and smiles to the audience as its next victim looks away. It's really dumb.Another thing that bothered me as that the last half of the film felt very rushed. There's this quick scene of Owen, Claire and that kid running and it looked like they were just picking up on the yell ""Action!"" but then soon they are held at gunpoint by cartoon villains. Then there's a scene with Owen being saved by Blue out of nowhere (which is in the trailer) and yet after the events that transpired, how can this animal even trust him?Oh yeah, I forgot to mention Jeff Goldblum is in this movie. You would think this is a big deal but he's in it less than a minute of screen time. By the end of the movie, I felt like I barely got to know any of the main characters. They were just there trying to slug it through. No real character arc or development. The action scenes were thrilling, and the dinosaurs look good, so I guess that's all you can ask for in a Jurassic sequel.I know it sounds like I'm harping on this movie, but I did enjoy it for what it was and looking forward to seeing another one. I hope they take more time on that one because this one just felt uninspired in the end. I hope to see the likes of Dr. Grant in the next one. He needs to show up one last time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

Well, yep that's exactly what they did. Where Jurassic World stayed on the island for the entire movie (showcasing the park in all its glory or the first time), and about 65% of Fallen Kingdom takes place in a mansion. WHY are these films called Jurassic World if they take place in a confined space? And that's just the premise, the film itself is a big waste of time. Admittedly, the first 30 minutes sucked me in with the thrills of seeing the island go up in flames in a big action set piece, along with some unexpectedly emotional beats mixed in. But it's far from enough in what is slow building, lackluster thriller, with some seriously questionable character choices made in the 3rd act. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are perfectly fine, with the ladder having much more to do this time around, but I can't help but think this film needed more bold choices and something different. There's so much repeated in the script, ""scares"", and laughable 3rd act. Seriously, it takes place in a mansion?! Do we seriously have to wait for a 3rd film to get the dinosaurs out into the real world?4.3/10","11 out of 22 found this helpful."

It's easy to say that none of them will be as good as the original. The movie's basic plot is that the island the last dinosaurs are living on is about to be consumed by a volcano, so scientists try to get some specimens off the island. Halfway through the movie, the entire plot however, is changed. Now, it's about these villains who want to auction the dinosaurs off. It really does help that Chris Pratt is a good actor.The problem is that in the second half, they just re-use the plot from the previous film! They create a new dinosaur as a weapon and it's smaller than the first one and we don't even see it run in the wild! The best part is probably how we still get a nice relationship between Owen (Chris Pratt) and his raptor, Blue. It was nice to see Jeff Goldblum come back...and he's on screen for only a few minutes. In my opinion, you can just watch the first half and leave the theater. Hey, this is the first movie I saw using Fandango! **1/2","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

I loved it and thought it was a really fun and nostalgic theater experience. The trailer for Fallen Kingdom got me nowhere near as hyped for the film as its predecessor but I still wanted to see it as quick as I can because of my love for the series and dinosaur goodness. I was wary about the very negative critic reviews that were coming out. Never listen to them, because I had a lot of fun with this film. There's plenty of stupidity all around in the plot, but the action, directing, and dark tones were welcome.The film takes place a few years after Jurassic World. The park has closed down and there is a volcano on Isla Nublar that is near imminent eruption and Owen Grady and Claire Dearing are tasked with getting some of the more valuable dinosaurs off the island. Little do they know, the purpose of the mission is to capture these dinosaurs and sell them off to the highest bidders while also unleashing a brand new engineered Indoraptor, the ultimate predator who also serves as a dangerous weapon. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard return in the title roles.First let me get through what I didn't like. I thought the plot was at times weak and shallow. The film doesn't feel as rich in plot as the original and some of the decisions are stupid. Especially character decisions. I found the subplots (especially with that of Maisie Lockwood), felt extra. There's also a predictability in sequences because of familiarity with the series. Its definitely weaker than the original Jurassic Park and I'd say Jurassic World, although I know many people will disagree with that. The villainous plot also reeks of standard cookie cutter villain actions. Also, there are so many impossible survival scenarios that occur that you would think this is a heightened version of Indiana Jones.The film is well acted, and Chris Pratt continues to show that he works as a leading man. The mix of animatronics and CG is good. I like J.A. Bayona's style in filmmaking as you can see darker tones and the use of shadows is prevalent. The film feels darker and more mature at times as there is a dilemma of needing to save these dinosaurs and also considering the implications of letting dinosaurs out into the world where humans live.I had a fun time with this film. Its not an amazing effort but its really not as bad as what I hear about it. Sure, the film franchise is showing signs of wear but I was able to enjoy the film and the action it brings. Visually, the film is a joy to look at on the big screen and I still feel like the film brings good dinosaur fun. I think the series should end for good with the final film in the Jurassic World trilogy though. I'd like for some of these blockbuster series to bow out when the time is right instead of going on forever.7/10","0 out of 6 found this helpful."

On the other hand, there are too many action scenes and to few story and character development scenes. They movie tries so hard to go for big explosions and menacing dinosaurs hunting their prey that they deviate from such developments. The dinosaurs are now mostly being dominated by humans instead of being an indomitable force like in the original Jurassic Park trilogy and right there is where the movie differs from what made the original trilogy so memorable and exciting, not to mention the lack of likeable and interesting characters. It's like they are there just because the actions scenes have to contain somebody to get through them.Overall, a fun movie to watch if you are willing to set those considerations and weak points aside.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

There are some great emotional scenes, sometimes the films give you the thrill you want from a Jurassic Park film. The director can use smart solutions.
On the other hand the film sometimes build on cliches, using bad type of humor killing the thrill you felt a moment ago. 
I can tell the same about the acting. The lead characters usually okay, but the new ones, especially the villain, are bad.
Plot also has some serious issues and believe me, you will be pissed off at the end. The next film will start from bad base position. Great moral weight imposed on the characters, which is hard to deal with. I recommend to skip that part of the film. Stand up when the last danger disappears and leave the movie. No matter where you see it.
The visuals however are pretty good. They put a great effort to the visual effects. Dinosaurs, environment all look cool.Jurassic Park films still have potential but they need to decide what kind of film they wanna make. Horror movie or action movie or anything else.

I liked the original Jurassic World much better because it had action, didn't fail to add a little comedy to it, and it just had an awesome feeling overall, I can't explain how I felt when I watched that movie but it was just such a cool feeling that transports you to another world with dinosaurs. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom was kind of different, the dark scenes in the house, more horror like violence than the first one, I just didn't like it. I am a HUGE fan of JW, my room literally has a ton of JW fan posters and figurines all over, I love it so much, but I don't like horror movies.Edit: After watching it a couple more times since it has come out on DVD, I've grown to like it much more.

Not bad but entertaining. Jeff Goldblum strongly argues Fallen Kingdom's social message of Natural Law vs Man's interruption of nature. What will happen when new technology is unleashed on nature. New genetics, people, different animals, bugs being introduced to places nature did not intend could have negative results. What happens to the environment, the genome, killing bio diversity, and the eco-system! Funny, a usually P C script, with a social message which contradicts the P C culture.

Sitting at an unbelievable 50% critics rating on Rottentomatoes.com, reviewers are claiming this entry is stale, unimaginative, and lacking the magic of its predecessors. I completely disagree with those criticisms and believe the film actually improves on its predecessor by being darker, scarier, and providing all the expected dino-action without sacrificing the heart and character of this franchise. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom should leave moviegoers totally satisfied with action, thrills, and a scarily plausible plot in today's world.
The film picks up 3 years after the events of Jurassic World. Now that the raptor's out of the bag, the world is debating over the creature's rights, with an active volcano threatening to sink Isla Nublar. Scientist Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard, sans high heels) and dino trainer Owen (the eternally awesome Chris Pratt) are called into action by elderly Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), who promises to relocate the creatures to a sanctuary safe from pesky humans. Little do they know this expedition will lead to a conspiracy that will change human life forever.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom absolutely delivers as a summer blockbuster. The story feels realistic, the characters have developed a bit, and the action is some of the best you'll see this summer. The effects are still astonishing and mix flawlessly with the dedicated human actors, who continue to sell the outlandishness. Newcomer Isabella Sermon is also great as Lockwood's young daughter. She's cute, likable, and believably terrified when called upon, all the more impressive when you realize it's her first acting role. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard continue to have wonderful chemistry, and the climax is nothing short of awe-inspiring.The film has a few problems that hold it back from being one of the greats. Rafe Spall's human villain simply lacks a threatening screen presence and is one of the weakest baddies this year. The writing for his character isn't amazing, but I was more taken in by Wayne Knight with his goofy shaving cream can in the original than by this guy. Knight was enticing in his greed, but this guy is so milquetoast that he comes off more like one of those 90's villains who wants to close the rec center than a manipulative businessman. Worse still, Toby Jones appears as a secondary bad guy, and is much more engaging. I either would have made Jones the main villain or recast Spall with David Cross (Tobias from Arrested Development). There's also some mediocre aging make-up and weak explanation for Sermon's accent, but they don't sink the ship.These problems are minor in the grand scheme of things. We come to these movies for the dinosaurs and characters, and we get great results with both. While it might not be as good as the original film, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a surprisingly solid sequel with great action, good characters, and the possibility for future adventures. Also look out for Jeff Goldblum in the beginning and end returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, and BD Wong as Dr. Wu. This is one attraction you need to see up close.Rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Science Fiction Violence and Peril","0 out of 0 found this helpful."
"4","/10","All Bark and No Bite","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4227588/?ref_=tt_urv","slicedbread117","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26777495/?ref_=tt_urv","6 July 2018","If anyone ever wondered what a Transformers movie with dinosaurs would look or feel like, here it is. Jurassic Park's legacy is without debate; it's one of the most acclaimed films of all-time and 2015's Jurassic World, in my opinion, was a worthy re-entry back into the classic franchise. So how does Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (FK) stack up against those two films? How does it relate to a Transformers movie? All hat and no cattle, frosting without a cake, a funhouse mirror image of what this franchise aims to be.What's different in this review, is that first I must talk about the trailers and marketing campaign of Fallen Kingdom, which isn't an aspect that should have hardly any effect on the film itself, but it does here. FK basically loses all credibility for practically ruining most of its greatest moments by spoiling them in the trailers. Now, one could say don't watch the trailers, simple. But when you're sitting in a theater before another film and the second or third trailer for FK comes on, you don't have much of a choice. And regardless, trailers are made to tease you into wanting to watch the rest of the film, not give away its best moments. I had to address this, because it's a recurring problem throughout the rest of the review.Fallen Kingdom's story structure reminds me of a huge hoagie that starts off looking promising and then just completely falls apart as you eat it. We're initially presented with a simple premise; dinosaurs exist on an island which a volcano will erupt on any day, and mankind must decide whether it's in their best interest to save them. It's a safe, if not kind of lazy way to get our main characters back running through a jungle, but in real life, this would actually be a compelling storyline. And for what it's worth, the first half of the film did feel a little bit like a Jurassic Park story, which I can't deny is fun to watch. But that narrative dies faster than the idiot guy from the opening scene, however, when things take a ""unexpected"" turn as the plot shifts, leading to our first trailer buzzkill. The entire first plot twist moving into the new main narrative is completely spoiled in the trailers, from Owen's (Chris Pratt) Velociraptor, Blue, getting shot, to Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire screaming ""it was all a lie!"" and then the ensuing footage of bad people selling dinos to worse people, the unveiling of the new big-bad dino, the Indoraptor (totally unnecessary), and the ensuing home-invasion-style hunt, and that's pretty much the entire plot. If only it played out so neatly. Fallen Kingdom has a severe case of dreadful pacing; the film spins off into pointless subplots that draw attention away from its main story, and these subplots truly have no justification or development. FK can't always seem to keep its head on straight, it runs around more than the characters on screen.Where Fallen Kingdom's story really goes wrong is in its second half story featuring a generic cardboard cutout villain wanting to sell the dinosaurs for other buyers to use as weapons while our antagonist makes a few million bucks. Its bland, dry and worn out. The film becomes way too confined in its setting, no variation and no room to breathe unique ideas. Director J.A. Bayona tries to explore new territory in the franchise's storytelling, which I give credit for, but there's no room to explore stuck in an evil-lair-mansion for more than half the movie. The confined spaces do, however, make for one of the most positive aspects of the film. Fallen Kingdom delivers some of the best utterly tense and somewhat frightening moments seen since the original Jurassic Park, and that's a big thumbs up. Many moments had me drawn into the film, even if most sequences become unbearably predictable thanks to the trailer spoilers. FK still is able to build suspense and keep you engaged in several areas. Unfortunately, the humor to balance out the welcomed intensity is basically non-existent or terribly forced, with the best moments being shown off in the trailers yet again. The writing from Derek Connolly and Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow along with the vision of Bayona is way too overconfident, trying to jam together a compelling screenplay which instead turns into a sloppy romp over two hours.Where the story is viewed as more of a mixed portion of the film, the cast of characters and their writing is what truly stands out as the ugly duckling in Fallen Kingdom. Not one single character, with the occasional exception of Owen, is intriguing in the slightest. Even Jeff Goldblum's return to the franchise was a shameless marketing plug, his lines in the film almost entirely can be found in the trailers word for word. I wouldn't have cared at all if any of the characters died in the film, everyone is just filler for a movie that works best when dinosaurs are in focus, yet another Transformers comparison. The human cast is dumbed down, unconvincing and emotionally disengaging. Alongside Owen and Claire in their quest are two tag-along interns from Claire's new dinosaur rights movement group, Zia (Daniella Pineda) who is at least of use in the film and Franklin (Justice Smith) the supposed comic relief turned into the absolute worst character in the entire franchise, annoying me to the point of wanting to plug my ears and gauge out my eyes. Least of all exciting is the aforementioned main antagonist, Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) who takes the easily foreseen twist from the good-hearted heir to Jurassic Park's creators to the mustache twirling, cliched capitalist with zero moral fiber and a lame agenda. The dinosaurs of the film actually do receive strong characterization, you care for them a heck of a lot more than any of the human cast. This does provide some heart in a film brimming with distress, a small shot of adrenaline for an overall stale set of characters.If nothing else, Fallen Kingdom does provide some stunning CG visuals to complement its occasional intensity. The dinosaurs look gorgeous, finely detailed as they roar with ferocity. It shows off its big budget with fun, if sometimes over-the-top action sequences, splendid cinematography and then there's still that giddy joy in watching a dino devour a bad guy or witnessing the king T-rex claim his dominancy on screen even for a brief time. FK does give some nice little bits of nostalgia for long time viewers to chew on as well, always a welcomed touch to a long-running series.Fallen Kingdom could maybe be best described as if you were to look at a picture of a pool from a resort, all glimmering on top, perfectly blue as if it couldn't be real. But then, you were to dive in and find nothing but sewage and grime, almost drown, only to pop back up to see the beautiful view on top. Rinse and repeat. It can be a fun ride with several thrills and big-budget CGI, cool looking dinosaurs and a scarcely engaging plot. But don't fooled, it's all style and no substance, all bark and no bite.4.5/10","8 out of 15 found this helpful."

A somewhat exciting plot, but much of the action - both dinosaurs and humans - were overkill or overly done. The acting was OK, with Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard delivering for the film, while newcomers Justin Smith and Daniella Pineda gave overzealous and crappy performances.

It was nice to see the park finally open, the two main leads (Pratt and Howard) were enjoyable and while the special effects could never compete with the groundbreaking grandeur of the original Jurassic Park, they weren't that bad. Sure, the plot had at that point been recycled so many times that it was as brown as brown can be, but it was serviceable and at least the movie had the sense to spice it up towards the end.This sequel is more of the same. Add another layer of brown and a one big hurrah for recycling. And that's this film's biggest flaw. Because to be completely honest, many of the minor flaws of the previous film are in fact improved upon. The special effects are more convincing, the locations are more interesting, the two leads are still very good and even the mandatory Jurassic Park kid who needs to be rescued (TM) is miles better than the two brats Howard's character had to look after previously.But the plot is the worst. It is the exact same plot that we have already seen in the previous four movies. There are dinosaurs, there are evil, greedy people who want to use those dinosaurs, the dinosaurs have to be saved, while at the same time the dinosaurs themselves pose a threat to everyone around them. The same ""nature good, military and money bad"" paper thin ethos we have already chewed through so many times before. In fact, this is chewing the cud. We are cattle, regurgitating and eating the same stuff over and over again.But what else did you expect? For what it is, it's not bad. Just don't go in expecting anything special and you'll get your money's worth.","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

Before I start... I just want to point out something. I know that most of you are familiar with that fact, but I just cannot go on without saying that. Most of Hollywood films in the last 8 years, or so, were made just for one purpose - to take your money away. And, that is just it. Yes, I know, now you think, Hollywood has been doing so ever since it existed. True, but we had so many good Hollywood films in the past. Movies that WERE worth your money. So, movies today... they rarely have good characters and that good old feeling... The feeling of connection between the audiences and characters. You could enjoy a good, well executed story and other things. But today's films... they just don't have characters anymore, I dare to say, metaphorically... they don't have soul anymore. So, let's dive in in this dino-turd.To mention that first Jurassic Park film was really something tremendous and magical in 1993, and I think that even the 1997 sequel was not that bad, until 2001 sequel came a long and slapped a shameful whack to the audiences all over the world and fans. And in 2015, we got Jurassic World - the beginning of new franchise (because Hollywood is now taking the sequels and not calling them sequels directly - rather ""a new beginning in franchise"". Speaking of no more ideas...). So, the 2015 film was not the best film around, but the ending was cool. But this film... this was something very ugly. It has a lot of terrible things in it. The movie essentially borrows from The Lost World - Jurassic Park (1997) - the idea is similar to ""rescuing"" dinosaurs and transport them to a better and safer place. However, the movie also introduces an evil people who are not for rescuing of dinosaurs. So, nothing new! Just the same as 2015 film, only double in appearance. The movie was directed by J.A. Bayona. Not the best director for JP films. It was written by Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly. Colin directed the first Jurassic World, but he didn't brought anything new with this one in the script, it was basically the same thing over and over. The characters were dull, not interesting and characters of Owen and Claire were not developed, nor evolved. We have some new characters... an irritating computer geek and a paleo -veterinarian. A what? Is that even real? Dude, you need a dinosaur to learn how to operate on them. Now, I know that you think ""we should not take these movies seriously"". Sure, I agree. But, in order to make a good film - you need to put some sense into it! From older actors, we have Ted Levine as a dinosaur hunter. Levine is a good actor, but this time, they wasted his talents. He is just a hunter who likes to collect dinosaur teeth. And that's just it. Another one is James Cromwell, who is John Hammond look alike. I am not going to spoil you anything, but it seems that we needed some old character to resemble Hammond. But, the problem is - Hammond was interesting character. Also, we have D.B. Wong as Henry Wu, the man who designed dinosaurs of Jurassic Park. In first film, he was likeable (no matter how shortly he was there), but in the JW, you can clearly see a change in the character. But, here, he was nothing but a ridiculous, villainous slime ball. And, finally, we have Jeff Goldblum, just to spew out his lines from trailer and that's it.Now, let's talk about other things. The music score was tolerable, maybe. There was a lot of original score, but I think that John Williams should have been a part of this movie. Cinematography was decent in some shots, production design... nothing new. I thought that production design was better in the JW. CGI? Well, I didn't like it. It was uninspiring and in certain scenes - terrible. OK, I would say that volcano and lava CGI is OK enough. Practical effects were used minimally. Editing was OK, it was consistent and clean. The script and dialogue were freaking horrific. As I said... no connection. Not even between the characters, or characters and audiences.So, what was the point of this film? I cannot really tell. There were a lot of terrible things. It is just a mess. As I mentioned, the pace is just ugly and everything is escalating so senselessly. Who is the target audience here? All of us, sad to say. Because, Hollywood needs money. So, they expect that their movie will work? Do they think that their movie will be timeless? I guess - not. Today's movies are just... lost. Everything is lost in this meaningless, pseudo stories and characters which don't serve nothing to the audience. For example, we have this little girl in the film and she is nothing but a little jerk who hides around in a large mansion. That is it. What else do we have about her? Nothing! Well, later it was revealed who is she. Most of people don't like child actors and characters in the film, but I could connect to the kids in the first and second film, but in this one... not even close. One more thing... I don't know why, but this film also give a few manipulative scenes. The manipulation of emotions. This was such a pathetic attempt for audience to feel sorry for some things. Why? Nobody cared for that. And how can I care, because I could not relate to most of things in the film. My friendly advice is to avoid this stuff and turn your head toward cinema from other countries... maybe you'll find something better there.","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

It was written and refined to the point that while it has story beats and the hero's journey, it's just so full of tropes, cliches and rehashing of overused dialogue that it's not one I will watch again.It made its money and I guess that's what the studios wanted, but the heart of good storytelling isn't there. It's become a mechanical movie with no heart and soul.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

The two sequels to follow that film were fairly weak in my opinion, but I was actually pleasantly surprised by its return in 2015 with Jurassic World. Many fans dislike that film for being nothing but nostalgia, but I thought they did a solid job in bringing people back into this world (so to speak). For that alone, I have been anxiously awaiting the next chapter, but the trailers made me a little nervous. Sadly, if you've seen any of the trailers for this movie, it gives away the entire film, so I would recommend staying away from all promotional material. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom isn't really the follow-up I was hoping for, nor that I believe many were hoping for, and here's why.For obvious reasons, the park is now deserted, with the only living things being the dinosaurs themselves. For reasons that I won't disclose in this review, especially for those who have chosen to stay in the dark about the plot, the volcano on the island is erupting and the plan is to get as many dinosaurs off the island as possible. Bringing them back to land (which is not even the dumbest plot point throughout this film) makes for some very big consequences that may or may not be a plan for future instalments going forward. Personally, I did enjoy watching this film, but the plot itself really had me thinking I was watching a spoof at times. The real plot doesn't kick in until about halfway through, which I found to be very stupid, so if that description turns you off, then this movie definitely isn't for you.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard both reprise their roles and are easily what makes this movie as enjoyable as it is. There are quite a few annoying new side characters that will have many people cringing at their intentional mannerisms and characteristics. Although, the addition of the Isabella Sermon as Maisie. Not only did she act circles around most of the newcomers, but this young actress has easily one of my favourite arcs throughout the movie. Some viewers may find her character to be quite strange towards the end of the movie, but I thought she was a nice surprise for the film and the Jurassic Park universe in general.Something that has always been a staple of this franchise is the fact that some of the most memorable dinosaur moments come from the fact that practical effects are used. While this film definitely showcases a lot of (solid) CGI, the numerous sequences that feature practical effects were absolutely a breath of fresh air. From that aspect to the great direction by J.A. Bayona, this film feels far more like a cinematic experience than its predecessor, but that's also a slightly odd decision, as the rest of the franchise has different looks and tones to them. For this film though, it's a huge plus.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom will absolutely not win over any newcomers and definitely won't make you change your mind on the franchise if you haven't liked any of the previous movies. That being said, there are some exciting aspects to this film and the core characters are as likable as they were in the previous film. The way the plot moves along is very, very slow, and I almost got bored at times, so I had more of a frustrating experience than anything. This isn't a bad movie by any means, it's just not really all that great, either. The way this film ends gets me excited for the next film, but that's not really enough to warrant a big recommendation, at least in my eyes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."
"2","/10","So Poorly Written, There Is Not A Single Good Performance In This Abomination. Crichton's Spinning In His Grave.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9221380/?ref_=tt_urv","tjstarr-99199","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur69653175/?ref_=tt_urv","28 July 2023","Thank god Michael Crichton was not around to see and hear this garbage film. JW2 compared to Jurassic Park 3, a bad film, actually makes JP3 tolerable. The overall plot of JW2 is strangely a bad shadowy ripoff of Spielberg's The Lost World. Greedy rich man and his company want to remove dinosaurs from the island and take them to mainland where they'll eventually escape and roam wild, and it's up to a small group to stop them.Quickly getting the pros of JW2 out of the way. Visually, this is gorgeous looking film with some incredible and memorable shots. The dinosaur with the lava pouring in, a shot similar looking to the original artwork of JP. The scary hybrid raptor in the girl's room after roaring on the rooftop. T-Rex roaring with an exploding volcano in the background. The Brachiosaurus trapped on the dock. There are several amazing visual shots in this film, and there's a few decent sequences. One of the best being the sinking tour ball in the ocean.However, and very sadly, this ends any praise for JW2. It's all downhill from here...The biggest problem with the film is the script. The script is not just bad, it's bigger than the pile of crap Malcolm commented on in JP. The script is so bad, it affects every single performance in the absolute worse way. There is not a single good or decent performance in this, and there are some great actors in JW2. Even Toby Jones and James Cromwell cannot give a good performance. Not their faults, because the script (dialogue and character actions) their performance is based on is trash. Isabella Sermon gives an acceptable child performance, but unfortunately her character does one of the dumbest things in the entire Jurassic series. Some actors like Justice Smith, and Daniella Pineda are so bad I would be fine without seeing them in anything ever again. Especially Smith's non-stop screaming, yelling, and all other sounds. Jeff Goldblum makes his glorious return as Ian Malcolm. For all of 3 minutes in this. This film heavily promoted Malcolm's return, and yet he has no bearing on the film. He's there just to get people interested and that's it.The dialogue is painful, the contrivances are eye rolling, the characters make dozens upon dozens of dumb decisions it actually hurts one's brain. Our main protagonists have to once again fall in-love all over again, because seeing their ""strong"" chemistry form again was worth taking a second look at. The messages/themes do not work and contradict each other, outcomes are predictable. The script cannot support a 2 hour action thriller featuring dinosaurs.Just a few examples...
Old man, weak in bed, demands the person he just discovered to be a villain to retrieve the phone for him, and tells him it's so he can, ""call the police on him."" So painful, I almost left the movie.Blue is shot and is dying, and Daniella Pineda says a blood transfusion will save Blue but it can only be from a two-fingered dinosaur. Movie, go home your drunk!A demonstration is shown of a hybrid raptor being capable of carrying out commands of attacking anyone. They demonstrate this by pointing a laser on a gun at a person and the raptor goes nuts. You do not need the raptor when the laser is attached to a GUN.Ted Levine (another really good actor) character's obsession with collecting dinosaur teeth is a terrible setup for how the hybrid raptor escapes. Sure, it is a setup with a payoff, but it's still terrible and cringe.Clone girl releases dinosaurs upon the world where they will attack and kill countless humans. The film justifies this pure villainous act as righteous by having her say, ""I had to. They're alive, like me."" Get real movie!Since the characters of JW2 are so terrible and miserable to watch and listen to, I am rooting for the dinosaurs 100 percent of the way. Even in The Lost World, I cared about the characters. Even the minor ones like Ajay, Roland's best friend, who gets killed by raptors hiding in the field of long grass. No one in JW2 is worth time and effort, because time and effort did not go into this script.Also, stop trying to militarize dinosaurs. They would be terrible in a war against guns, missiles, planes, bombs, etc.Jurassic World was a decent guilty pleasure, but whatever fun perks that film had going for it are derailed with JW2.","3 out of 4 found this helpful."

Got goosebumps throughout the entire movie...Also the most terrifying movie of the franchise as there's barely any censor to the most gore-filled sequences.As the author of the recent graphic novel series ""Congo - A Forgotten World"" this masterpiece sure inspired me, go give it a watch while it's in the cinema if you happen to live in Europe. If you're in the US wait for the movie to come out because it's not worth of watching in low resolution just for the sake of your impatience. Be patient.

But like the raptors it's stalked me until one day it pounced out of nowhere leaving me to only think, ""clever girl"". Unlike the previous movie this one is more concerned with telling it's own story only using minor doses of nostalgia to call back to other films when relevant. The most interesting aspectof the film is the question of whether this artificial nature should be given the same treatment and respect as actual nature and characters both new and returning are written much better. This film also has plenty of tense scenes made even more so with logical writing and not leaning to hard on nostalgia making for a better movie.

I hope that tomorrow I can have a good surprise and enjoy Dominion (don't really care about critics, I love Lost World and even enjoy JP3, for example).Ok, the good things. The first act is good. It makes sense - kind of - and it works. Good pace, fun, funny, introducing cool characters, betrayal, vulcano, lava, sad dinosaurs...After that? Jeez...I still like some specific scenes (the kid in the room with the Dino) and deaths (all the bad guys...), but this is just too much. Too much stupidity, overlong and overstuffed.I like the Jurassic films because I like to watch loads of dinosaurs in their habitat hunting and killing humans (fighting each other is a bonus too). I don't want to see dinosaurs trapped in a house, hunting humans like Jason Voorhees. That is stupid, boring and doesn't make any sense. In fact, most of the scenes of the 3rd act can even be offensive to what JP was supposed to be and what made it fun.This could be cool on a TV episode of a JP/JW show.

MILD SPOILERS AHEAD!After 2015's surprisingly good Jurassic World, I was pretty excited for Fallen Kingdom. With J. A. Bayona in the director's seat and Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, it seems to be a sure hit, and for the most part, it does. Though the film was bogged down with stereotypical villains, uninteresting side characters, and rehashed plotline, it's still a good movie nonethelessPros:
Everyone is amazing in this movie (well, except one). Star Lor- I mean Chris Pratt is great as Owen Grady. Bryce Dallas Howard is also great as Claire Dearing. I also really liked Daniella Pineda as Zia Rodriguez. My favorite of the bunch is Isabella Sermon as Maisie. She really shines in this movie. Her screams are a bit annoying of course, but she's a great character that I hope will be explored in the future. B. D. Wong returns for brief performance as the ""still mysterious"" Henry Wu, and he did a good job. Rafe Spall and Tobey Jones were great as Eli and Gunnar, but I'll talk about them later. James Cromwell is amazing as Benjamin Lockwood, and lastly, Jeff Goldblum has a brief but great performance as Ian Malcolm.This is, hands down, one of the most well shot movie I've seen all year. Seriously, kudos to whoever shot this movie. The cinematography here is spectacular. I notice that there's no shakey cams in this movie (at least what I saw), which is a breath of fresh air. There are a brief moments of bad CGI, but for the most part, it looks incredible. The fact that they use a mix of animatronics and CGI instead of full CGI for the dinosaurs, deserves a praise.I love the dinosaurs in this movie. Blue the Raptor is back, and I love how he's essentially, a main character, and I love it. Rexy the T-rex is also back, and although he's taking the backseat in this movie, I can't help but smile whenever he's on screen. The Indoraptor is, however, the true star of the show. He's menacing, he's dangerous and for the most part, he's freaking scary! Oh, did I mention that some of these dinosaurs were unexpectedly cute and adorable?J. A. Bayona surely knows how to make a good movie. The movie, though opens with slow, and uninteresting first act, quickly changes once it enters the second act and from there it just keeps going. From simply dumb fun, to actually intense and scary movie, to some really sad moments. I just love the change of pace in this movie and I love in particular, how they embrace the horror aspects in the movie and amplified it to 11. I jumped out of my seat several times because how surprising it is. Overall, it's fun, it's scary, it's funny, it's intense, and it's sad, all in one movie.Michael Giacchino, you've done it again! The music is intense, eargasmic and just epic. The music during the third act is just amazing, and surely does help in making intense scenes even more intense.
Cons:
The villain, Rafe Spall as Eli Mills, like many Hollywood movies before, stereotypical money-hungry baddie. You'll saw him being the bad guy from a mile away, and although he did his best, that doesn't mean he's a compelling villain. Toby Jones as Gunnar Eversol is also not a good villain, in fact I think Toby Jones is wasted in this movie. Ted Levine as Ken Wheatley, though a bit more interesting, doesn't mean he's a good villain. Like Tobey, he could have done so much more. The Indoraptor is also admittedly, not as menacing as it's predecessor, Indominus Rex.Justice Smith as Franklin Webb is, by far, the worst character in this movie. Totally uninteresting, useless in most part, and honestly, very annoying. He's screams like a girl, which though it's a natural response when you're face to face with a dinosaur trying to kill you, but c'mon, can't you just stop screaming and complain? Granted he did something useful in the end of the movie, but honestly, it's too late to redeem his character.There are some plot points that were left unresolved, and that's disappointing. *MILD SPOILER* There's this one character who just disappears without a trace although the movie clearly seems to indicate that this character would return for someone else, but no, they just leave it unresolved. *END OF SPOILER*Conclusion:
Overall, this movie is a must watch for fans and average moviegoers. It's fun, it's exciting, it's intense, and overall, a great movie. Though, after you read my review, you'll probably thinking: that's this is essentially The Lost World all over again. I'll admit: It's a rehash of The Lost World, but I recommend you to go watch this movie with a open mind, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the ride. Oh, and try not to watch the trailers, because that kinda gives away most of the plot (lucky me, I guess?)","35 out of 53 found this helpful."

Since then I have watched it many times and below are the reasons why I feel that it stands the test of time as one of the greatest movies ever and why its sequels fall short:1. The premise was simple: huge and hungry carnivorous dinosaurs are out to eat you and if you're caught in between, you must run for survival. This simplicity is critical for any survival movie because giving the impression of a clear danger is fundamental to evoking fear in your audience. Sequels of Jurassic Park have abandoned this simple premise in the favor of complicated plots where these humongous beasts are clever, intelligent, empathetic, know right from wrong, forgiving, and respect family bonds. More drama than thrill. If Jurassic Park is 10/10, Fallen kingdom is 5/10 on this dimension.2. Humans are vulnerable: Every character in the first movie is someone you can relate to. They are scared and just want to survive. Not in the sequels and it looks fake. Moreover, if characters onscreen are not scared, your audience won't be either. Kills thrill factor. FK, though did a better job at this. If JP is 10/10, FK is 8/10 on this dimension.3. Dinosaurs are beasts and humans are humans and humans will defend each other against the dinosaurs. IMO Fallen Kingdom is way off on this one. Characters that probably have no regrets eating chicken for lunch and mutton for dinner, have so much love for these beasts that they not only risk themselves but the entire humanity to save them. kills thrill factor as the lines between good and bad and right and wrong are blurred. If JP is 10/10, FK is 2/10.4. There are two types of dinosaurs: ones that eat humans and ones that don't. I remember having difficulty at the age of 5 understanding how in JP people could go so close to some of these animals without being harmed until I was told the difference between carnivores and herbivores. That's not as simple with current movies anymore. In FK, there are carnivores that only eat bad people, mutants that go after good people, human sympathizers that defend humans, some that can be trained to accomplish tasks, and others with individual personality and traits. This may not be a bad thing necessarily but it does make them approachable and beings that can be rationed with, in some cases even more than humans. It adds to the confusion of the audience and kills some of the thrill factor. If JP was 10/10, FK is 8/10 on this dimension purely because FK has good character development.5. The execution is about creating and holding tension. JP does this amazingly well with its execution. The setting is dark, gloomy with relatable,vulnerable, unsuspecting characters travelling through a scenic park with hungry and ferocious dinosaurs. The only thing protecting them from the dinosaurs are the electric fences and to some extent their jeeps. There is clear sabotage and defenses are compromised. This creates a self sustaining tension throughout the movie until the characters escape the park. In fact the tension was so strong that it survived the movie and lingered in our memory for days after. FK and most of JPs sequels fail miserable at creating this level of suspense and instead keep it limited to action sequences. If JP was 10/10, FK is 7/10.Having said all of the above, I must say I really liked FK. The acting, surprisingly, was top notch and the humor was good. There was a lot of action too and as previously mentioned, character development was good and the plot was well explained.I also liked how they used the old mansion on a full moon night to add a touch of draconion horror movies. Overall, I'll rate it a good 7/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

If Jurassic World was a remake, this whole reboot trilogy would be more respectable -- it would still be an abomination -- but it would be easier to write off and ignore. At least in that scenario the abomination would exist in a separate space, yet here we are in our present reality with an awful vain movie that claims some connection to the original story.This movie is straight up cartoonish, and every moment that transpires is unbelievably annoying and stupid. As with the 'first' JW, this awfulness is punctuated by some of the worst music I have ever heard. I seriously have no idea why the music isn't criticized, even in negative reviews. It never matches the scene, it doesn't sound like anything that would mesh with JP, it's unsubtle, uninspired and stupidly loud. There isn't a single theme or tune throughout that you could hum afterwards or even remember at all. Not that it would matter if there was because you'd still have the awful visuals, writing and acting to contend with.The dinosaurs are big loud and dumb. Every time the tyrannosaurus is onscreen it outstretches its neck and lets out a thunderous roar, I guess as some kind of attempt at getting the nostalgic nerds fired up. Needless to say, it does not punch at all and makes no sense for an animal to stop in the middle of a stampede escaping an erupting volcano to save some humans and then stop to roar triumphantly as if we're supposed to feel something. It worked in the first movie the first time it escaped its enclosure and for dramatic effect at the finale. Enough already. We get it, the big dinosaur that's everyone's favorite can roar. Loudly even.The CG dinosaurs look terrible in terms of art direction, animation and presence. We are expected to believe some of these dinosaurs on Nublar are supposed to be the very same feaututed in JP. Okay. Maybe they aged but why are the effects worse and why do they look so cartoonish and open their mouths wider than anatomically possible? Even something like the Disney movie ""Dinosaur"" had more convincing effects than this.The plot has no substance. In short, it is a reboot of ""The Lost World"" (you know the good ol days are gone when they start remaking movies like LW. What's next? The 1998 ""Godzilla""? Don't give them any ideas.) Of course, these hacks can't restrain themselves so they also opted to end the movie with dinosaurs being brought back to the mainlaind with one twist. (At the end of LW, a t-rex escapes and is recovered whereas in this bomb -- it's not hard to figure out.)The laughable non-characters are not even competently written two-dimensional archetypes, which would've been acceptable -- they're straight up video game NPCs. Neither their roles nor anything they do makes sense for their ""characters"" (lightly.) The broad from JW is now a dino activist (told you this was bad) so I guess that's supposed to be her 'arc.' Essentially: ""Woman no care about dino in movie 1, woman now like dino in movie 2."" Meanwhile the raptor whisperer has moved on with his life: ""dino man care about dinos in movie 1, now no care about dinos in movie 2 -- which is a rehash of JP3. All you get is a brief scene of Claire in a busy office of volunteers watching a tv news report about some congressional hearing that adds nothing to the story. I didn't think the writers would have included the issue of saving the dinosaurs being politicized but in 2018 everything is politicized, apparently.The writers could've made this work (I guess) but they didn't pull it off at all as there is no energy or enthusiasm behind it. The idea doesn't go any farther than a cameo of a bored Jeff Goldblum talking to a cartoonishly southern, bible-thumping congressman that can't grasp the concept of dinosaurs. Delusional much?Claire easily convinces a reluctant Owen in a bar to come with her to save some dinos but the scene is just a sequence to promote Budweiser -- the worst beer of all time. (Another rehash of JP3 -- I'm warning you this is bad.) What ensues for the next hour and a half is a nonsensical series of scenes involving moronic people and badly rendered CG dinosaurs. The 'good' people need to do a thing, dino shows up. Other group of shady characters do bad thing because they're greedy and nasty, bad things happen, characters come back together to thwart bad guys plan, dinosaurs run amok.If this movie tried just a little to implement a shred of scientific literacy or intellgence, maybe there could've been a thoughtful script that tells a story with something worthwhile to say. Even as a dumb monster movie it fails. It seems Universal has embraced the dumbest, shallowest interpretation of JP imaginable and ran with it because people in China like to see greedy Western capitalists get chomped by monsters or something.If you could ignore everything that happens, there still wouldn't be any way to forget about the stupidity of the final act. I mean this movie DOUBLES DOWN on stupid. What happened here? How was this approved? The auction in the last act is one of the stupidest things ever put to screen, in which dinosaurs that cost billions in investment to engineer, breed and maintain are sold for a few million dollars each. The sheer unoriginality and lowbrow premise of what is being set up by the final scenes for the next abomination is truly an achievement in bad filmmaking. This is the last 'Jurassic' film I will watch until it is properly remade a couple decades from now, once these movies are long forgotten and only remembered as obscure failures that came out of a late 2010s feverdream to capitalize on the creatively bankrupt reboot trend.Hollywood needs a reset and it's going to take some time. Maybe one day a new American film industry will emerge with fresh talent far from the west coast of the US and people like Colin Trevorrow will never be allowed near a movie set or writer's room ever again. One can only hope.","4 out of 6 found this helpful."

From the awe to the great music and building story, Spielberg's film is a really high level to reach again. We will never see wonderfully rendered Dino's on the screen for the first time again. That being said I thought JWFK was a ""fun"" movie that was well made and looked great with superb action sets. But the story is prettt shallow although if they had developed some of the points raised in the more it could have been so much more. Too many interesting sub plots were brought up only to go nowhere. That is the most disappointing aspect of the film for me. But if you want a fun action based popcorn summer movie than JWFK is a great choice. BTW, the picture looks, sounds and feels great in Dolby Cinema.

I didn't go in with very high expectations. The last film was a big, stupid, but fun mess. Jurassic world 2 did not disappoint in that regard.So plot wise the film is separated into two distinct parts. The first involves returning to Jurassic Park to save the dinosaurs while the second involves stopping a nefarious organization from exploiting the dinosaurs. Both are fairly cliche ridden and predictable. Of course the plot is just an excuse to see CGI dinosaurs fight each other. Gone are the days from Jurassic Park 1 and 2 where the the movies plot had a degree of substance. This movie has no qualms about being big, stupid, and fun. Character-wise again the film didn't cover any new ground. The good and bad guys are just cartoon caricatures without any real depth. Don't expect any degree of character development or even really liking the characters. Everyone is just a placeholder for CGI dino action. Even Chris Pratt's likeability can't save his character for being boring.Speaking of action this is the one area where the movie shines. The movie was a nonstop action ride. From start to finish the movie provided ample amounts of CGI action to keep the audience entertained. The action scenes where well choreographed and are enough to keep your inner child asking for more.The CGI was outstanding all around and provided plenty of moments to root for your favorite dinosaur. I was very impressed with the attention to detail that went into crafting each dinosaur. As far as being pure eye candy the movie succeeds all around.I will say I miss the elements of horror found in the original series. Gone are the days of being terrified of the T-Rex and Raptors. They are the good guys now! The T-Rex even saved the day three separate times in this movie. It's just silly, but that is what they are going for.Jurassic world 2 is not the kind of movie I really enjoy. It's big, stupid, and shiny with nothing more than action and CGI to keep you entertained. That being said there is an audience for popcorn flicks and if you can turn your brain off at the door it's not a bad ride. A 6.5 out of 10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

The Jurassic world film (2015) played on nostalgia and it felt fresh because the franchise was revived after 14years but it got old really fast with fallen kingdom. Don't get me wrong I still love the Jurassic park franchise I would rather watch dinosaurs than most other blockbuster films any day of the week. However, Fallen kingdom really doesn't have much of a story it's just lost world with a few tweaks and not nearly as good. A lot of dinosaurs a lot of running and screaming and then it just ends. I wish they had kept the horror/thriller element that made the first two movies really great. The dinosaurs aren't scary or magical anymore they're just loud and more colourful. I hope Jurassic park is rebooted into a great TV series that explores the origins of the science behind genetic cloning and Hammond's ambitions.

In order to protect these creatures Owen and Claire return to the island in hopes of saving the remaining dinosaurs.Well I'll be honest I was not a fan of Jurassic Park 3 but I'm even less of a fan of this film. The vast majority of this film comes down to extremely poor writing. There isn't a single plot or character that is written well.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are both great but their characters have zero development. In the first film you get to see Owen and Claire grow but this time around there is none of that.They brought in some new characters played by Justice Smith, and Zia Rodriguez but neither are interesting in the least.The so called villains are basically like Saturday morning cartoon villains and they reused the poor plot choice of using dinosaurs for military purposes, which makes zero sense.I will say J. A. Bayona did an incredible job with his direction and that is why my score isn't as low as it could have been but the script is so unbelievably bad that his talent was wasted.4/10

From the towering brachiosaurs to the lightning-fast velociraptors, each encounter is awe-inspiring and pulse-pounding. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard return as Owen Grady and Claire Dearing, navigating the consequences of their past actions with renewed purpose. The supporting cast adds humor and depth, particularly Jeff Goldblum's ever-witty Dr. Malcolm.However, the narrative, while fast-paced and action-packed, doesn't quite reach the same heights as the original. Familiar echoes of previous Jurassic adventures might leave some viewers wanting more thematic depth or innovative plot twists. While the film certainly entertains, it might not leave the same lasting impression as its predecessor.Visually, while impressive, a few moments might betray the seamlessness of the CGI, particularly in some fast pace action scenes. However, these are minor distractions and don't significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.Ultimately, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom offers a fun and visually spectacular return to Isla Nublar. While it might not match the groundbreaking spirit of the original, it delivers a thrilling dino-packed adventure for audiences seeking another trip to the park. Remember, even if the stakes aren't quite as high this time around, the dinosaurs are still just as awe-inspiring and terrifying as ever.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

The story was poorly written. The dialogue was predictable and stupid. 
The sequencing lacked sense and were not believable. Clearly underfunded. There were some over acting bits.
Killing the brontosaurus was a gratuitous heart wrenching scene - not for kids.
Limited humorous breaks.
The worst was the torturous musical score. Too loud, too heavy handed, no connection to emotion of movie. It was horrible.
Dinosaurs were beautifully rendered, that's where the money went.
I hope sequel will have an entirely new director and production crew.","7 out of 13 found this helpful."

What struck me as odd, was how much emotional drama was put in into play here, and it wasn't half bad either. Sure the plot lacked integrity and the cast wasn't pushed to new heights by the script, but it was a slightly darker and thrilling spectacle nonetheless. And while dinosaur effects hold up this well, there will always be something to look for in this franchise. There were a bunch of cool and zany ideas that the plot explored, some better than others, but neither lacked potential really and the ending, while a little underwhelming in retrospect, opens up an intriguing new direction for the possible third outing. All in all, a perfectly acceptable dino flick with action and a surprising amount of heart to compensate for a slightly open ending and dumb narrative.The good:
-Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are still as good as they were back in the first movie
-The Indoraptor was a step up from the last big-bad dino
-Neat visuals and effects
-Isla Nublar scenes were winners
-Auction set piece was coolThe bad:
-Dumb script and story
-Tame jump-scares
-Forgettable and weird Lockwood family drama
-Ending was a little underwhelming","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

"2","/10","Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom is just...to quote Jeff Goldblum, ""That is one big pile of sh*t""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4212477/?ref_=tt_urv","RforFilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv","22 June 2018","What I loved about Jurassic Park was that it was more then a ""lightning in a bottle"" blockbuster with a blend of physical animatronics and computer animation. The movie was also morale about the dangers of scientific genetic creation. It presented several sides about making new animals and even whether they should exist among humans. It was a Frankenstein story along with dinosaurs. When it came out in 1993, it was one of the biggest movies of all time. Even today, in 2018, it still holds up as an awe-inspiring adventure that was both terrifying and optimistic.When Jurassic World, a long awaited sequel, came out in 2015, audiences were split on it. While a lot of people, including myself, phrased it for giving the story a proper push into its story of gene manipulation and the business behind it, many people also felt they just got a copy of Jurassic Park with dinosaurs that were majority computer animated. I'll admit that I can understand that as even I can see further how fake the dinosaurs looked. I still support that film for at least being a fun blockbuster that I could enjoy. Will Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom take a step forward or backwards? A step backwards.Following the events of Jurassic World, the former theme park as been abandoned. A volcano is also about to erupt, endangering the entire dinosaur population stuck there. While the U.S. Senate, along with Dr. Ian Malcolm (Played by Jeff Goldblum), feel like the creatures of instinct should be eradicated, several dinosaur-rights activists, including former operations manager Claire (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) wants to save them. Claire is contacted by Banjamin Lockwood (played by James Cromwell) and Eli Mills (played by Rafe Spall) with plans to move the dinosaurs to a sanctuary (guess they forgot about the other island from The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3). Claire agrees to help and brings along systems analyst Franklin (played by Justice Smith) and dinosaur veterinarian Zia (played by Daniella Pineda). Knowing that securing the last remaining raptor will be difficult, she also gets former trainer Owen (played by Chris Pratt) to come with them. When they arrive, they see that time is limited as the volcano is about to erupt and a team has already been securing various species. When they do successfully get off, Claire and Owen realize that the company gathering the creatures is going to sell them on the black market.Like the title, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom shows how far things have fallen from grace. I guess we can begin with the story and plot which messes up right from the beginning. It wants to make an ethical case on why the dinosaurs should live, but given how the previous Jurassic Park movies have stated that the creatures and humans cannot coexist. Plus even if they were all killed, don't the companies have instructions on how to simply recreate them again? There's really nothing at stake. Jurassic Park, and even Jurassic World had some memorable moments with action and the dinosaurs. I cannot think of one memorable sequence with the dinosaurs, and the ones that do stick out are stupid or unexciting. I can say that the majority of the movie is off the island. That's right. Much of it is either on ships, in offices, or a mansion where the second half of the movie is set. So things either feel familiar or, especially with the house, feel like a disappointing downgrade, given that it becomes a ""monster in the house"" plot. How about those dinosaurs? Eh...there in the movie. You get your pterodactyls, raptors, t-rexs, brontosaurus, pretty much stuff you'd expect and want. I will say there is a greater effort at using a mix of animatronics and computer animation...to a point. Sometimes, they can look good, but they also seem less fluid and more transparent, given some of the designs and color choices. Without spoiling anything, I'll say the ending does bait a potential sequel. It wants to take a different direction, which is fine, but the decision on how they get there is so stupid, that you still fail to understand why dinosaurs need to live. You can't make the situation scary and compassionate! I'll give this two wrecked Jurassic Park trucks out of ten. If your looking for simple dinosaur action, you'll get more of it here, but minus the memorable characters. This makes me realize that I doubt we'll ever capture that same magic of the Spielberg classic that will remain a masterpiece. But as with Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom, the series looks to be heading for extinction.","15 out of 35 found this helpful."

Characters debating ethics, new experiments being tried, that kind of thing gets me in the chair to see the movie. It all goes back to that dinner conversation in the original movie where they are debating the whole idea. Brilliant. Grant, Malcolm, Hammond, the lawyer, really cool conversation, even if the middle of a big budget flick. #2 - The awe and wonder. Epic scenery, swelling music, and CGI that seems to blend in well with the natural environment. And then #3 - The horror elements, of which I am not a big fan, but it seems like the only way they can get people in to see these movies is with blood and guts.So, how did JW:FK do in these three areas?1. Lots of ridiculousness. Malcom seemed to disagree with Claire and Owen, but you'd never know it because they never met. Basically, the plot line was Lost World all over again. There were several times I found myself rooting against the main characters. Frankly, they are responsible for a lot of the death in the film. The plot line just didn't seem thought through.2. JP and JW got this one really right. LW, JP3 and FK just have bland sets that don't really get your attention.3. Yeah, there is plenty of guts, cause I guess that's why people pay for. So if that's what you're into, go for it.I like the franchise, but this film was pretty freaking ridiculous. Bring back Alan Grant and I'll probably go to the next one.","21 out of 53 found this helpful."

The only character who outperformed Chris... was Blue (and with good reason).So, bottom line - A good family movie for senseless entertainment; bad historical education for the kids.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

They will never give you a Jurassic park level movie again. This movie was an amazing sequel. 
I enjoyed Jurassic world but it was very ridiculous at times and very much geared for kids. This movie is much darker, much more graphic and pulls at your heart strings. There is one sub plot that is a disgrace to the franchise and I am pretending it never happened. That being said, this was the best the dinos have ever looked. They did what jp did mixing rain and darkness with cgi and animatronics. I hate too much cgi but the cgi was outstanding. Part of the plot I didn't like as much but it wasn't too bad. The actors and characters were much better than JW. the kid wasn't obnoxious and I actually believed she was scared unlike the last movie. The pacing was great, the bad guys were very good at making you hate them. I only watched the first trailer and am very glad. There were so many moments I didn't see coming that the trailers would have ruined. If you go in KNOWING this is a 2018 action blockbuster and not the original then you won't be disappointed. Realistically for me jurassic park is a 10. It's my favorite movie. Lost world is a 7.5 and would have been higher if the last 30 min wasn't so terrible. Jurassic park 3 is a 5. It was awful. Jurassic world is a 7 and this is an 8. There's a few things that could have been done better but I will def see this movie 5 times once it actually comes to theatres here. I watched it on fire stick. The people who say it's bad are ridiculous. It's a sequel. It's not Jurassic park but it's a fantastic sequel with a TON of throw backs to the original. People say tjey ""copied"" the original but it wasn't that. They did scenes that were a tribute to the original. This was nothing like the others. Go see this movie. It's the best sequel yet and sets up the 6th movie and makes you want more. Best opening scene of any of them as well.","144 out of 246 found this helpful."

Bonya for doing the best he could with the script he had. This movie was beautifully directed. The story, however, was very lacking in emotion and meaningfulness. The action was incredible and fun to watch, but the plot was dumb. As far as story goes, nothing really happens in this movie that hasn't been done before, but the movie shines brightly with the gorgeous cinematography - all to the sound of Michael Giacchino's score, which was one of the best parts of the movie and a lot better than the score to Jurassic World (2015). In summary, this movie excelled with good directing, exciting music, intense action, and extremely beautiful visuals. The movie falls with the poor story and lack of emotion (there were a few emotional scenes, but they had more to do with the direction than the writing). I love the first Jurassic Park movie and I never thought it needed sequels, but this was still enjoyable and it's worth watching if you're looking to have a fun time. Also, I would say I liked The Fallen Kingdom more than Jurassic World, but I wouldn't say it's as good as the original Jurassic Park or even The Lost World.

While the dinosaurs themselves were very entertaining (at least the real ones) to view, the movie writing, plot, and pure ridiculousness have utterly wrecked such a celebrated film. The original Jurassic Park will continue to live strong in the hearts of those who were captivated by the simplistic story, imagination, dinosaur fascination, and majesty of the Tyrannosaurus Rex. As well as continue to give us hope that perhaps one day Dino's can roam the earth again. This new movie is no better than any second rate dinosaur film, that is not worthy to carry the title ""Jurassic"" in it. Michael Crichton is no doubt rolling around in his grave, and it pains me to see Spielberg's name attached. Fallen Kingdom indeed!","15 out of 37 found this helpful."

Bayona. The trailers of the film looked quite good and with me liking the first part (Jurassic World), I was quite excited for this one. But alas, it mostly disappointed me.Plot: Owen and Claire travel to Jurassic World to rescue the remaining dinosaurs in Jurasic World from a volcano that would explode any minute.Story and direction: This film series boasts mainly for its special effects and visuals. That box is ticked with every instalment in this series and it never fails to impress me. The action sequences are spot on and have been directed very nicely. The character designs for the dinosaurs also surprised me. The music of the film is also wonderful (partial thanks to John Williams who did the main JP theme). The technical department work on this film is accurate and wonderful and never for a moment did I feel it was superficial. The main problem this film posed was the story itself. The story was just a normal action-adventure movie when I expected something more out of the film. While JURASSIC WORLD had its small character moments, this film fails in that aspect. Where the first half of the film felt justified, the second half is where the film goes downhill. The plot turns absurd and I was cringing almost every minute and waited for the film to finish. Even the characters (especially the villains) were poorly written. The film does have a post credit scene too, which was totally unnecessary.Performances: Chris Pratt was good at his role and did provide some comedy in the film. Bryce Dallas Howard also complemented Chris' character. James Cromwell gave a good performance. Justice Smith's character was very poorly etched and was very disappointing. Same can be said for Rafe Spall and Toby Jones. Finally, it was great to see Jeff Goldblum reprise his role from the previous instalments. Even though it was roughly a role of 10 minutes, it was a treat to watch him.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Own watches a video of him training Bue and the others raptors. This scene very well depicted the bond that Owen shares with Blue and how much he cares for him. If this theme was stretched a bit then the film would have worked wonderfully.Verdict: FALLEN KINGDOM felt more like a filler film which was just needed to make a trilogy. The scenes basically make no sense and were full of absurdity. This felt more like a money making vehicle. I do hope the third instalment (and the final one, hopefully) brings back a good story and throws back some sense into this series, that has just run out of ideas.I am going with a 6/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

Owen Grady and Claire Dearing, who witnessed the devastating fall of Jurassic World, are tasked with over-seeing the salvation of the dinosaurs. Among the species that are in need of saving is Blue, the last living raptor trained by Owen since infancy. The island becomes ash in a CGI mind-blowing spectacle but Owen and Claire soon discover upon saving the prehistoric creatures a conspiracy that leads them to a mysterious estate where they uncover a dark secret underway.So Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom is the fifth entry in the Jurassic Park franchise, a franchise that falls under the category of a studio that uses it's property merely for the intention of obtaining an instant cash grab rather than creating something special in film history. It is also a case where fans of the original Jurassic Park from 1993 feel as though every sequel to the original is not only a waste of time and energy but an offense to that original. Indeed 1993's Jurassic Park earns the title of legend, being a film that impacted the film industry upon release for it's ground-breaking special effects, terror aspect, brilliant cast, music, beautiful backgrounds etc. and twenty-five years later it doesn't fall short of the masterpiece that it is. The franchise's sequels have been decent over the years. 1997's The Lost World is memorable for bringing back the franchise's most popular character getting the spotlight and contained brilliant action scenes (T-Rex rampaging through San Diego anyone?) and possessed the same dark sinister tone as the original. 2001's Jurassic Park 3 contained some of the most brutal moments in the whole franchise but didn't quite live up to the same level of epic as the original or even the Lost World did. Then the franchise was revived about a decade later with Jurassic World released in 2015 which managed to bring back everything fans of the original Jurassic Park loved about the film with a new brilliant twist to it through the creation of the Indominus Rex. Although some would disagree, Jurassic World was able to introduce us to new characters to the franchise and we were given enough time with these new characters enough to care for them to the end. With Fallen Kingdom on the other hand, this was not the case. Every new character added for this movie unfortunately was so flat and one dimensional as characters that never once did they produce a spark of interest. Apart from the lack of interest factor, each character's actions and decisions were predictable and frankly the opposite of intelligent. That said, the entire premise of Jurassic Park from the beginning was proven to be an unintelligent creation on John Hammond and his scientist's part. In their defense, there was no way of knowing for sure the disaster Jurassic Park/World would become. The problem is repeating the same amount of stupidity can be just as harmful as repeating similar themes from past film entries. In this film, we get another genetically modified dinosaur creation that first of all feels less of a cinematic impact than the Indominus Rex and second of all is nothing more than a horror film villain in disguise as a caged animal. This destroys the purpose to what made Jurassic Park such a unique film and that was for it's portrayal of it's prehistoric antagonists as aggressive living things who have no idea what century their in and will defend themselves violently if necessary as Ellie Sattler from the first movie put it perfectly. The dinosaurs were always trying to survive the 21st century from the beginning just as the humans were trying to survive against them when stuck on the island. It was a fight for survival on both sides but this never made the dinosaurs evil. They were creatures who were as scared as the humans were of them. It was one thing with Indominus in the first Jurassic World which brilliantly brought something new and creative to the franchise but now this new genetic hybrid delivers a feeling of sinister dread that it's as though the writers are trying to depict the dinosaurs as ""evil"". The dinosaurs always possessed a great intelligence before but the way this film carries itself out gives viewers the nervous chill they get when experiencing a horror flick than a dinosaur/nature thriller at times. The film suffers from an underdeveloped scenario as well. The first half of the film takes place on the island itself and the rest at a dark mansion (classic horror film setting) that makes us viewers feel as uncomfortable as the characters.On a bright note, Jeff Goldblum returns as Ian Malcom from the first two Jurassic Park films though his role in the film is sadly reduced. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard return and sadly despite good performances weren't able to save the film from falling short nor were they as convincing as they were in the first Jurassic World. The writers definitely should have improved their story arcs. It can become difficult for a franchise to produce new ground-breaking material that will appeal to audiences when it's prime was it's triumphant stage. Hope is not entirely lost for the Jurassic World films as it's next sequel is set for a 2021 release date. Fans of the series will be very excited for more thrills and one on one dino battles and visuals. This is what earns Fallen Kingdom credit for it's entertainment value, visuals (even though to this day the original Jurassic Park's visuals are more stunning) and action. This review may have felt as more of a film rant of bad story telling. It was simply difficult to believe this was the best they could give fans after the success that was 2015's Jurassic World. Overall it did accomplish what it set out to be as an entertaining popcorn thrill ride. Piece of advise for the writers: drop the genetic hybrids and bring back the dinosaurs. They should remember what Lowery said in the first Jurassic World about what made the original Jurassic Park so great and that is they had dinosaurs, real dinosaurs.","0 out of 0 found this helpful."

However, after finishing every one of those movies, I was not too impressed by the final product. When Jurassic World was released in 2015, the excitement returned but quickly diminished after watching it. All that to say, I went into the theater without high expectations, and I left satisfied that I didn't expect too much.As my philosophy believes, I do not check movie reviews before watching a movie. Reading reviews alters what I expect. If the movie is something that I am interested in, I am going to watch it regardless of the reviews it gets. Plus, I have MoviePass so until that company becomes defunct, I will watch what I wish to watch. Anyways, I felt that Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom had a terrific first half. The action and visuals were great, the atmosphere created through the setting and music score was tense, and it felt like the movie was going somewhere. As I elaborate on this point, I will say that the main premise of the story is spoiled in the trailers.For anyone who watches TV or a lot of YouTube, you have certainly seen trailers for this movie. A blockbuster of this scale is certainly going to have a lot of marketing to back it up. The trailers show how a certain group plans to save a few dinosaurs from Isla Nubar, the home of the now-desolate Jurassic World theme park, and sell them to bidders. Naturally, whatever intentions that bad guys have must be brought down by the good guys. This premise is shown in the trailers, but the beginning of the film seemed to be building on that premise. It may have had a message about the effects of animal abuse and capture for personal gain, as well as potentially negative aspects about genetic modification. However, the second act of the film is a dud that takes the premise and crashes it, becoming mindless and dumb.I do not wish to spoil anything about the movie, but I will say that the second half is drawn out just to fill in time. It is effective in being tense and scary, with some jump scares, but it just doesn't go anywhere. The last movie also did not have an actual plot, but at least there was an objective that made sense.To summarize, the good parts about the film include it's visual effects, tension-building atmosphere, connections to prior Jurassic Park films appearances made by Rolls-Royce vehicles, and Chris Pratt. Star Lord is the best (or my personal favorite MCU) character, mostly due to Pratt being awesome. However, it is severely hampered by it's mindless second half and overall lack of a plot. I would give this film a 5.75 out of 10, which makes it at least worth your $2. However, I would also say rent it once and never watch it again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful."

Unfortunately their characters in these films are dull and 1 dimensional. There motives for doing what they' doing change from movie to movie and even sometimes scene to scene.The action sequences were boring and the tension felt really forced when compared to Jurassic Park for example.A side character who was there for comic relief was absolutely unbearable and I was shocked that we got a character like that in this film.The reason this movie exists became obvious by the time the credits rolled.

Jurassic things is about survival and how deep we can go to the fear of extinction that became the main idea of whole story here. Unlike other Jurassic movies, here there are some sad scenes about the human choices to direct dinosaur. Human is being boss for other creatures, but in some point money can lead also the mentality of human. When human becoming not focus, the dinosaur lead themselves. This is really intriguing idea. The movie can blend the sci fi and drama in this point, but still stick to the memories came up about the human error in previous ""Dinosaur Park"". That's why the scene begins with a trial because human rights concern also other creature's destiny, to be exist or not to be exist. This kind of philosophical question is well-acted by the actors and actress, yet the touch of comedy that make us still have fun and relax in some creepy scenes. Of course there are people being eaten by dinosaur. How big they are and how big problem coming to human, is also being thought by the Director. The fear is not coming along just like that, but well edited by Editor by the help of Cinematographer. For me, this movie is movie for holidays, without really deep sense of meaning that can stick to our heart, well perhaps audience already think the ending and already being normal to see dinosaur in this movie. I think we must improve in some point of delivering a sci fi. Please continue to make Jurassic World: Rising Kingdom maybe...lets see....","0 out of 3 found this helpful."

It had great action sequences, but the story could have been betterPlot: 
The movie's plot was simple. A team goes in to rescue the dinosaurs from the island. However, there were a few problems I had with the film. There were a few moments in the film were I easily predicted what would happen. I won't give away any spoilers.Characters:
I enjoyed most of the characters from the movie. Chris Pratt was funny, but also charming. Bryce Dallas Howard did a good job with her character. Pratt and Howard's character had great chemistry on screen. However, I feel some of it was forced. If there have been more dialogue between the characters, the relationship would seem more natural. There were some new characters, but some of them were two-dimensional.Acting:
The actors and actresses did a decent job of acting. Nothing exceptional, but they performed well in the film.CGI:
I thought the CGI was done well. The dinosaurs looked realistic.Conclusion:
The movie was enjoyable. For me however, it's one of those movies I'll watch once and move on.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

What I found was that I could've pretty much copy and pasted my review for that film onto this one. My biggest gripe with these films is how predictable they feel. I guarantee that if you had paused the movie once every character had been introduced I could've given you an exact list of which characters would live and which would die. Hell, I could've even told you which characters would have the most brutal deaths. That to me isn't good enough. I'm aware that these films are probably meant to be more about the visuals and the action than the plot twists and turns and unexpected events, but it still feels like if they want to be something great they could chuck something into the mix. They just play it far too safe for my liking. There are some great action sequences in the film, the visuals are again amazing and I think the humour worked a lot better in this film than the original. All of these aspects make this a more enjoyable experience than the first one in my opinion. I do have a soft spot for the dinosaurs coming back to civilisation too I have to say. At the end of the day though I can guarantee I will have almost entirely forgotten about this film by this time tomorrow, and until they change things up and decide to be a little more daring, I fear every film in this series is going to be just like that.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

I sincerely disliked Jurassic World; it looked to CGI-y for my taste. The story, the characters, the dumb situations made JW simply unbearable.Step in Jurassic Park: Forgotten Kingdom. I don't really like the title, especially the ""kingdom"" part, but I wanted to give it a shot. And boy was I taken for an adventure. Everything I dislike about the previous entry in the series was mostly swept away and exchanged with better character development and the well-known intentions of some bad people close to the creators of the dinos, who want to either monetize or weaponize the dinosaurs, as was almost always the case. Chris Pratt is more likable this time, BDH is less annoying and more trying to make things right. I can't stress how much I really disliked the previous movie and thought this one would be even worse (because movie titles like this one don't sound too promising when it comes to quality content). But I was surprised in so many ways; the humor is way better and a lot less forced. The puns are spread wisely and there is a decent amount of slapstick comedy. The side characters are not just caricatures of SJWs or nerds, they actually get something to do. Overall this is a vast improvement on the series and a great way to introduce those who might have never watched a single Jurassic Park/World movie. If you watch any Dino-themed movie or TV show besides The Dinosaurs (which you should), make it JW:FK.","0 out of 2 found this helpful."

This movie was a bit away from other movies, because it showed us how far gone people could become when they were money driven.

yes, the movie looks great.
But i will go as far as to say that this is the Worst written Jurassic Park movie of the entire franchise (and yes that includes jurassic park 3) The plot of this movie is ridiculous and predictable. 
This movie is basically just a remake of Jurassic Park: The Lost World. 
the same exact plot points are used in here. if you saw Jurassic park 2 you can guess and predict everything that is going to happen in here. The trailers basically spoil the entire movie down to the ending, thats how simplistic and show thin the story is. the plot is so thin that all the major points are shown in the trailers. The story is just very stupid. there is no other way to say it. the motivations for going back to the Island are the same as the second Jurassic Park movie, the way they get out of the island is the same way it happens in the second movie, 
the motivation for the bad guys is the same as the second movie. 
Everything basically copies the second movie but it is done poorly in here. The reason i say that this is Worse than Jurassic Park 3 is because at least part 3 tried to do its own thing (as bad as it was) and they tried to create their own silly story. As much as people hate the big Dinosaur in JP3. and as annoying as the kid was in that movie, AT LEAST it tried to tell a new story that did not copy Jurassic park 1 or 2This movie is just a rehash of things from the franchise you liked. this movie was very sloppily written and it is very boring","15 out of 40 found this helpful."

Sadly we now find ourselves suffering cover versions of what was once a great and thought provoking premise with high octane thrills into the bargain.I guess once they started personalising the Velociraptors, making one of them a friend of man, it was the beginning of the end. But we accepted it - sort of - jumping into 2015's Jurassic World with carefree abandon. More dino carnage we wanted, a bright cast fronted by the ever likable Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard drew us in, but it was merely ok, a franchise entry that was just a quick fix but nothing more. But of course box office talks and the franchise lumbers on to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom...Plot returns to Isla Nublar which along with all the dinosaur inhabitants is about to be vanished from the planet by the mother of all volcanoes. Cue mankind jostling over whether to save a species that was once extinct whilst others have nefarious motives for financial gain.Off we go then, stock characters that are over familiar are performed by different actors but go through motions we have witnessed before, whilst the writing strains for a sort of human empathy factor that never hits the mark. There is nothing remotely fresh (well Howard has at least changed her footwear to something more credible) or exciting on offer here, it's a tired cash cow that's in dire need of extinction itself.Naturally another instalment will come along, and naturally it will make money, with myself and the other millions of Jurassic zombies filing in to view what we hope will be a return to the heady days back in 1993. But it's most likely a forlorn hope, so maybe, just maybe, it should be enough now, enough? 5/10","5 out of 10 found this helpful."

It's supposed to be an adventure movie not a horror movie! (Have you seen the trailer for The Nun?) It felt like the ghosts were replaced with dinosaurs. Well, the movie begins with the death of a human. Nothing as fancy as being lifted off the pot but a human dies on Isla Nublar. Then we have Dr. Malcom telling the U.S Senate that the once dormant volcanoes which have now become active on Isla Nublar is nature's way of correcting Dr. Hammonds' mistake 25 years ago. He espouses the cause of letting nature take its course instead of intervening again to save Dinosaurs. Except Claire Dearing thinks otherwise and on Eli's urging manages to convince Owen Grady to head back to the island. That is when the ""adventure"" begins.On one hand Owen, Claire, Zia and Ken head out and once on the island things don't go too well for the team. On the other hand Lockwood's granddaughter finds herself in the middle of a series of events that would petrify any 11 year old. The events on the island lead to evacuating a few species but is that all? Ah well... there is murder, mystery AND ACTION all of which apart from being predictable are also lacking in so many ways.Plot holes are aplenty and dear good lord god! The extension charm features in the movie! Because if you jump into water in skin tight pants and still manage to bring out a pistol, a knife and later a pair of binoculars those pants must come from the wizarding world.Here is what ruined the movie for me - This movie single handedly destroyed my childhood memories of the Brachiosaurus sighting in the first movie. I believe the movie was trying to pay homage to the previous movies but it just ended up making bad choices again and again.People in their 30's will certainly not enjoy the movie. Definitely suitable for kids below the age of 10 because all they need is CGI to be impressed.Recommend: Go only if you have a child that is interested in dinosaurs, else skip it. Make your kid watch the first movie and then take the child for this movie.","10 out of 25 found this helpful."

There is so much you can do and stretch story wise. Considering this, the film plays relatively well. As a JP fan of the original it kills me to see the obsession of over the top CGI. This area is where it let me down the most, there were some aspect where animatronic and CGI was well executed and some scenes it looked rushed or unbelievably fake. Nevertheless it was still an ejoyable ride. It is one of the few ""Family Friendly"" movies that are coming out these days. It has the action coolness and has the emotion feels for drama. If you are a JP fan you will love it, if you are a casual movie goer you will find it decent watch but if scientific inaccuracies and movie logic bothers you this film you will hate. Action (8/10): over all amazing, two sets of action from explosive to thrilling. Times unrealistic but amazing to look at. A lot of animatronics in this film which is great for the soul of the scene. Acting (7/10): Nothing great or anything that stood out to be Oscar worthy. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas-Howard were the only stand outs. The rest of the cast was forgettable. Oh and ""Blues"" character was enjoyable to watch aswell.Story (6/10): Only season story has an average rating is because everything was revealed in the trailers/promos/tv-spots. As a fan I watched all of those so hence story wise I wasn't blown away but still it was decent enough to keep you interested in the moment. Plus it's also the 5th film in the franchise. Sound (10/10): I had the joy of experiencing this in a Dolby Atmos cinema. While Dolby Atmos Cinemas essentuates sounds of all movies, you can tell if the movie has been produced in a Dolby Atmos sound mix. The surround sound effects in the third act were brilliant and made the dino scenes terrifying.Feels (10/10): This movie dealt with a lot of emotions. Not on a human side but from a dinosaur perspective. This movie gave the dinosaurs character and soul. This is what you want from a dino movie. Over all critic rating (8.2/10) Over all FanBoy rating (10/10)Jurassic Fun","127 out of 217 found this helpful."

The first was the best, of course. Lost World and III weren't great, but I thought Lost World was better than III. Jurassic World really redeemed the movie series, until Fallen Kingdom. I am glad that Jurassic World III will be the last because I think they are just ruining a great thing and just need to let it be.

Isabella Sermon is another to watch out for, she was just brilliant in my opinion. Then you have the dinosaurs, well that makes it almost perfect.Being a bit predictable and a bit cliched took a few stars off, but it is still up there with the good ones for me and I would recommend it to anyone to go and see.This movie was entertaining, fun, funny and had no dull moments, so much so that the 118 minutes felt like a few minutes, I don't count the credits which run for nearly 10 minutes.Anyone who scores this lower than a 7-8 either did not really watch it or is a real hater of someone involved.","49 out of 78 found this helpful."

I'll tell you how it's because it failed to have a story worth telling! There is no reason to create this movie, there is nothing worth adding to this franchise! It's worthless! It's garbage!All that aside, this movie is very seriously flawed. First off, if you saw the trailer, you saw the movie, you have even less reason to see this failure of a film. For a movie that lasts for two hours, it fails to keep your attention once it gets to the second half. This is mostly because the writing is just non-existent. It's the same story of The Lost World except it's less interesting and the second half has all the dinosaurs trapped in a house. We also get more of the evil military business from the last movie, and obviously, the executives didn't realize that nobody liked that element from the movie, and the movie goes exactly where you will expect it to go with them.None of the actors are bad per se, at least not in the way that characters in a Michael Bay movie are, but they just have no impact. They have no lines to chew on, no dialogue that will leave an impact or any sort of memorability. This film desperately needs some badass one-liners for Chris Pratt but the writers were too lazy to do that and it shows. Even when the film attempts to add some new concepts which the audience will learn towards the end of the movie, they aren't developed and fully realized, just shoved into the movie as a way of saying ""Hey, that's different, that's a cool idea!""This whole movie just comes off as a lazy Hollywood screenplay. Some may try to defend it by saying that people are hating it because its popular. Here's the thing. This isn't being hated in the way that The Last Jedi is hated where the criticisms tend to be illogical and poorly based, this is hated in the way that the Michael Bay Transformers movies are hated. The hatred for this movie is due to how unoriginal and lazily written it was, and peope are upset because they don't want the Jurassic Park franchise to become the next Tranformers franchise where every movie is the same uninspired pile of garbage. Frankly, it's easy to understand why.4/10 at best, it's a bad pop-corn flick that has no substance. It just sucks.","3 out of 5 found this helpful."

The acting is predominantly over the top, since subtlety will be completely lost on the mindless masses. The screaming contest between dispensable characters in the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the film. You know you have a movie on your hands which can only be seen if you can fast forward to the CGI scenes and skip the dialogues entirely.The direction is atrocious. There are flaws galore. For example in one scene, in the time it takes one character standing next to a door to swing around startled, another character seated in a chair across the room, some twenty feet away, managed to reach the door and is already dutifully screaming. Apparently, that person has the gift of teleportation.Neither me, nor my friends were every as arrogant, obnoxious or plain stupid as the director would have us believe most of the characters in this movie are. Still, I suppose the characters are believable to somebody, certainly not anyone with any brains, that is for certain.Believe it or not, but a dry PBS documentary on dinosaurs will be more entertaining to you than this craptastic big-budget big-screen movie.","3 out of 5 found this helpful."

It is a decent film I love the film. I would put it in my second favorite Jurassic Park film in the franchise. I know I am going to get a lot of hate because it is not a rant. In my opinion it is a good film I love it, if you hate the film is your opinion I have no problems with the film, but it is an improvement over Jurassic World I hated that film. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard returns and they are decent I love them in the film so much.When the island's dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen and Claire mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event.I enjoy the practical effects, the explosions, the acting, the story and the action. I love the CGI effect for the raging volcano This is a faster paced film it goes fast around. I enjoyed the film it was entertaining and I wasn't bored with it. I understand the story, the twist and what they try to do with the film. I got this movie on Blu-ray disc and I enjoy it, I enjoy the film it is a guilty pleasure of mine. Call it whatever you want it I love it.Chris Pratt as Owen Grady was decent and really a good hero, he does good performance, he has more stuff to do than in the first one. Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing was one hot mama who showed emotions and she cared about dinosaurs and a rescue mission. She wasn't annoying she was fine and entertaining. I like Bryce Dallas Howard because she was in Spider-Man 3 as Gwen Stacy and I have enjoyed her performance more than Emma Stone in The Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2. I enjoy Ted Levine in this movie he was in Joy Ride and The Hills Have Eyes remake and I enjoy his performance to be a bad guy. I enjoyed Isabella Sermon as Maise little girl she wasn't annoying I liked her. Rafe Spall was awesome as Eli Mills the villain he was practically like Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser) from Aliens who wanted a profit of capturing aliens while Mills try's to get rich by selling a live dinosaurs.CGi are better than in the previous movie and gets criticism for trying something different. At least this movie did not copy the first one or other movies like Jurassic World did. I love the first Jurassic Park to death it is the best one in the franchise by a novel who directed Steven Spielberg. I love Jurassic Park III and this one. Directed was by J. A. Bayona who made a good direction. I enjoy the film I would put the film between Aliens and Deep Rising the opening sequence is a really horror aspect, you see a man been eat by a sea monster. Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow wrote a script for the film and they did a good job Colin Trevorrow previously directed Jurassic World so I respect him.I love the idea the rescuing dinosaurs from raging volcano I thought was better idea then the Jurassic World did. The rescue mission was a ploy and Claire and Owen must try to save the dinosaurs from been sold on a black marked. The problems and dumb idea was the cloning little girl that was stupid and bad idea. Of course the T Rex- Veloceraptor blood transfusion was a bad idea too.My favorite scenes are in which Indoraptor hunts Owen and Maise throughout the mansion they are both on the roof but Claire shows up and distracts Indoraptor and of course Blue Velociraptor comes and saves them, kills prototype Indoraptor I loved that in the film. Jeff Goldblum has a cameo scene in the beginning of the film as Ian Malcolm and on the end of the film I don't mind him. BD Wong as Dr. Wu is also back as the bad guy he does a solid job. I love Claire and Franklin in an abandoned gyro-sphere to flee from the pyroclastic flow, but falls into the ocean that scene scared me because I thought they could have died for real. Excellent scene in the movie one of my favorites.I watch this movie twice in the row now, I know it is not perfect film it is not the greatest movie or the best one ever, I know it is stupid but I love it. I enjoy the film it is my second favorite film in the franchise. That is my opinion I forgot they mention a guy who is an arms dealer and they mention Slovenian my country yes I am from Slovenia so I am honored by this movie.","104 out of 176 found this helpful."

Jurassic Park gave them a second chance. Three years after it's shut down, a new team is recruited to rescue the remaining species in the Isla Nubler island. And this time these creatures find their savior in human greed. The opening scene itself gave a lot of nostalgic vibes. Jurassic World 2 is contained with a lot from Jurassic Park trilogy. It's impossible for a fan to miss those. There are many moments that extensively feel like throwbacks from Jurassic Park movies.
Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard again proved to be a fantastic cast. 
But for a sequel, you expect something larger. Fallen Kingdom's huge canvas became narrow as the story carried on. This time you're not getting a mega dino adventure but the movie is as thrilling as it's precursors. 
Maybe because I grew up watching practical dinosaurs, I find some of the CGI shots very sluggish and weird. Making a creature with the use of computer is a mammoth task and they still haven't found the proper formula. The effects of raptor are terrifically puppeteer-ed. The volcanic eruption is brilliantly choreographed. 
The narrative was very much drawn to the use of music. The climax portion has some intense rhythms to up the tension. The thing is they can make ten other Jurassic movies about dinosaurs running unleashed and I'll happily sit and watch all of them. I love Dinosaurs.","107 out of 182 found this helpful."

It was a beautiful love letter to the original films, deeply rooted in nostalgia, but it also amped up the action and gave us a new set of characters to fall in love with. I loved every minute of it, and never wanted it to end.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a completely new monster. This carries the basic DNA of what we expect from a Jurassic movie, but takes it to crazy new heights, relying very little on nostalgia or setup from earlier installments. New director J.A. Bayona brings a new perspective to the sweeping action set pieces and a dark, riveting tone that isn't present in any of the other franchise entries. The ensemble cast, including Chris Pratt's charismatic Owen Grady, Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing, and (my personal favorite) newcomer Isabella Sermon's Maisie Lockwood, all bring something to the table that fits together in a nice cohesive way thanks to a lot of onscreen chemistry. Maisie is the anchor of film's twisty story, and she is just downright adorable unlike some of the annoying children this series is known for. Depending on how you look at it, the real stars are the dinosaurs and special effects, which are the best they've ever been. This one feels like a love letter to the dinosaurs themselves in more than one respect. Best of all, though: this might be my favorite sequel since the original Jurassic Park.The opening sequence alone made me fall in love with the film almost immediately, already setting up the scarier tone and feel. This movie has such a large scope that it dwarfs any other Jurassic film in that way. It just feels bigger, and of course it's extremely entertaining. The action pace is nonstop, but Bayona also gifts us with beautiful and tender shots (there's one in particular that broke my heart) and great character beats. The claustrophobic setting of the film's second half is atmospheric gothic horror meets creature feature. It's something I never thought I would say about any Jurassic film, but it felt exciting and new and certainly nothing like what we've seen previously.Fallen Kingdom is a dark, explosive blockbuster that takes the series in an exciting new direction and I absolutely loved it. It expands the scope of the series in such a way that it feels like there is so much more story left to tell here. I can't wait to see it again, and I can't wait to see where this series will go next.","130 out of 224 found this helpful."

Many people think that this is a rehash of The Lost World, and in certain ways it is because of the fact that humans are taking the dinosaurs to the 'real world'; nevertheless this movie has a totally different vibe and can stand up on its own merit. All plot issues aside, this movie never fails to entertain, which is the first thing I look for in
this kind of films, and especially the Jurassic Park movie franchise. The acting is good, no one seems to be out of tune; there is a fairly good chemistry between Chris Pratt and the always gorgeous Bryce Dallas Howard, however in the previous movie they had more serious romantic interactions between them. What happens is that in Fallen Kingdom the action and the primary plot starts to develop quickly from minute one and it virtually doesn't stop. I find that to be one of the good things about this film, you don't have to wait for the events to be set in motion, they already are at full blast. As a fan of the original Jurassic Park, I loved the inclusion of Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm even if it doesn't come from the center of the action. Toby Jones does a fair job as the evil rich eccentric man; Isabella Sermon plays Maisie Lockwood (Benjamin Lockwood's granddaughter), because it's not a Jurassic Park/World movie if it doesn't include children. The supporting characters Zia (Daniella Pineda) and Franklin (Justice Smith) spend most of the film apart from the leads which I thought that it was a different but acceptable approach, since they proved themselves useful nonetheless. Rafe Spall (Eli Mills) as the main antagonist in my opinion was passable. He wasn't too great nor plain bad, just okay. Maybe he lacked a bit of evilness.As for the dinos, they looked great, particularly the animatronics. They always give such a genuine look sometimes overdone by CGI. The relationship between Blue and Owen reaches new heights; it falls to a deeper emotional level where we actually find ourselves rooting for her. Oh, and there's a new dino in town, a hybrid between the Indominus Rex and a Velociraptor. This new addition, the Indoraptor, doesn't appear fully in picture until the third act more or less. While in Jurassic World the main attraction was the Indominous Rex and appeared from the beginning, the Indoraptor is only revealed later on; and it proves to be a highly menacing creature.All things considered, I found the entertainment I came looking for; I'm aware of certain plot flaws but that can't take away the fact that I had a blast watching this movie, and sometimes you have to put that first, but many people seem to discard that by looking for infallible logic in a hugely popular dinosaur movie franchise. I mean come on. If you're like me, this action-packed adventure will not disappoint you. On a side note: should we start saying ""is not a Jurassic World film if the Mosasaurus doesn't jump out of the water to eat a person?"" or is it too soon? But I think I'm noticing a trend here. I just wish the filmmakers would give the Mosasaurus a much bigger involvement.","39 out of 61 found this helpful."

It's terrible and this is by far the worst movie in the Jurassic Park franchise. The action scenes are awful because they are so unbelievable. Like in the beginning, when Owen and Claire go to the dinosaur island and the volcano explodes. First Owen is paralyzed, yet comes around right when the lava is mere inches away. Then when he is running from the volcano blast, some how he can out run it, when the dinosaurs can't. And he can hold is breathe long enough to get Claire and Franklin out of the bubble. Then the launch of the truck to make the boat as its leaving. That was impossible. Then you have the one dimensional villain whom wants to sell the dinosaurs. And of the course the ending, no one would have made that decision. I guess in the sequel the US mainland will be a dino kill zone.FINAL VERDICT: Even the special effects can't save this movie.

Overall I enjoyed it more. The action was great, the claustrophobic feel of the mansion gave the movie something original and the scenes on the island were enough.The indoraptor, i thought was better than the indominous Rex just because of the look and creepy feel. CGI looks a lot better than last time, but the crowning achievement in effects, has to be the animatronics used. Overall it's not the best film ever made but go into it just wanting to have fun.

The film takes place after the disaster of Jurassic World being overrun by dinosaurs and money hungry men in suits, as they try to retrieve several of the dinosaurs from the park. But to no one's surprise, we find out soon enough the men in suits are using the rescue op as a chance to snatch up the dinosaurs and sell them as predators.The film almost exclusively takes place in only 2 locations, the island and this insanely large estate. The moments in the park go by so fast that we are out of the park only 50 minutes into this 2 hour film. For people here to see Jeff Goldblum, he's literally only in the movie for one scene of exposition. His moments are so detached from what else is happening, you could edit him out and the movie wouldn't be affected. There's also a scene involving Chris Pratt outrunning a valance eruption, and it's as ridiculous as it sounds.Its not all bad, as some of it's horror like tone helps with the of the tension in some moments, particularly one moment that involves reflection and shadows really nicely. There are some moments when Blue, the raptor is fighting with one of the dinosaurs that gets pretty nice to watch. There are some moments where the dinosaurs are attempted to give them distinct personalities and a bit of moral conflict is woven into the plot.My biggest issue with the Jurassic World franchise so far is it thinks you are more invested with the characters than you really are. This film made me wonder if there is any where else this franchise can even go, as I feel it's told me the same things already. Here's hopes JW3 is more interesting, but so far, the needle in my mind has yet to be moved.Rating: 4.7 / 10","4 out of 8 found this helpful."

Personally, I don't know how to qualify what I just saw, reflecting a little on the career of J. A. Bayona, who proved to be skilled in films like ""The Orphanage"". I think a film like this may not be the director's strong suit.The script is a sequel to the precedent 2015 film: after the closure of the ""Jurassic World"" and the death of Masrani, the world witnesses the eruption of the volcano on Nublar Island, which puts the laboratory-made dinosaurs in the imminence of a new extinction. So, millionaire Benjamin Lockwood makes an effort to save some specimens and take them to a sanctuary, away from humans. What nobody knows is that there are people interested in the animals never reaching this sanctuary.Again, we are witnessing a remake of the old formula of the franchise, with dinosaurs on the loose and the failure of all security measures to contain or transport them. Again, we see situations that are very similar to what we have seen in previous films. Again, we feel that everything is empty, meaningless, lifeless and that there is no danger or emotion.Again we have an irregular cast, but in a worse shape than in the previous film, where the feeling of newness helped to refresh things: Bryce Dallas Howard looks worn and with nothing new to give us, but she is competent in what she does; Chris Pratt did a good job, however he is very much like an Indiana Jones determined to save everyone and everything; James Cromwell is a veteran and does his job well but only appears on time, just like Toby Jones, competent as another opportunistic character. Rafe Spall sounds fake and never seems fully committed, Isabella Sermon exists only to be in danger and to help at the last minute, Ted Levine looks like a sergeant in the military recruit and Jeff Goldblum makes a honour cameo but that's all.Again, and as a standard of the franchise, the bet goes to the action and danger scenes, as well as technical details, effects and production values. However, even at these points it is not convincing or capable of impressing us. The lack of life and emotion removes the sense of danger from the most intense scenes and the technical details and CGI seem worn out. There is a lot of money involved, but there is nothing really new. The incredible soundtrack is still present and the sets and props are very good. Cinematography is also good, but the color we admire on the previous film is missing. This one, being darker and with many essential scenes in low light environments, looks more foggy.Betting on the continuation of exhausted franchises, like this one, is usually a mistake that is justified only by the good it usually does to the coffers of the industry and film companies. Thus, there are films that turn out to be true casino machines, ready to take money from the audience in exchange for very little, almost nothing. This is one of those films, and I don't recommend it.","4 out of 8 found this helpful."

Also how did SO many trained soldiers and enforcers get brutally maimed by dinosaurs but the little girl and the other four main characters who mostly have zero training in fighting not take a scratch.

But a review of the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet made me curious since it was the first time that I read that the film has two parts, meaning the island scenes do not take up the whole plot. So I decided to give it a try. My hopes were still not high. I mean how exciting can it be to watch people for two hours getting out of vechicles with eyes and mouths open, staring up at feeding dinos? But I was very positively surprised. This is an amazing and almost perfect production, very good action scenes, not a boring second. The chemistry between Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard is good and much better than in the last one which dwelled too much around their relationship problems. The only reason for not giving 10 points is that there are some cliché-ridden aspects; you will understand what I mean if you watch it. But they don't really ruin much of the movie. I had a really, really great time. I saw the IMAX version which was flawless with some fantastic effects. I have no idea how they make all the effects, but the dinosaurs look very real; respect to the producers and makers. And with a high degree of creativity they have come up with new and exciting creatures. Also the new castings are mostly very well done. In sum, one of the best action movies I have ever seen.

It's competently done for the most part. And yet ""inept"" kept creeping into my thoughts as I watched, even though ""lazy"" is probably closer to the mark.The basic premise is Jurassic World is about to sink and people are conflicted about whether to save them. When the chance to save a bunch of them arises, Claire - that lady who ran around in high heels in the last movie, but seems to have developed some sense in this one - persuades dinosaur wrangler Owen to come to the island to help.Of course, if good people are risking their lives to save monsters, figure bad people will too. The reasons for this are pretty nonsensical, and the bad guys have that incompetent indifference that is just what you don't want in people handling dinosaurs. They make the first of the movie's many, many unforced errors; people are really stupid in this movie.The director seems to wants to mix excitement with humor, like Guardians of the Galaxy, but instead manages to pit the two against each other, with weak humor diluting the suspense. The movie desperately wants to make you laugh, and cry, and scream, but it can't pull off any of those.The story is predictable and bland. The director sometimes fails to make clear what instigated a situation, so I often felt vaguely puzzled by why things were unrolling as they were. And while the series has always been about vast jungles full of dinosaurs, most of this movie takes place in a guy's mansion. If the writer had a secret vendetta against the series and wanted to kill it off, setting a dinosaur movie in a house is pretty much the perfect way to do it.There are decent moments, like one capping an otherwise rather uninteresting opening sequence, and the special effects are excellent, but I wouldn't say this film is remotely worth watching.","5 out of 11 found this helpful."

The first half is a rushed retelling of Jurassic Park 2, only bigger and with more explosions. A volcano is about to wipe out the Dinosaurs in the Island and the heroes accompany some shady mercenary types to rescue them. But oh no, the mercs work for a shady business man who wants to turn Dinosaurs into weapons.The second half then turns into a strange horror movie in a gothic mansion with ever more ridiculous ideas and setpieces. There's a new engineered super Dinosaur. The Indoraptor, aka Smaug from the Hobbit. It's basically a dragon that can be targeted with a laserpointer.Yes, the movie is that stupid. There's also a girl who's the key to everything. There's a twist about her, that leads nowhere.While the film is a total narrative mess, by some miracle It's oddly watchable. It's beautifully shot, and while some of the CGI cartoon physics are dodgy, there are some undeniably gorgeous shots. One shot of a Brontosaurus (or Diplodocus?) is particularly beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time.T-Rex and the Raptor from the last movie have a lot of predictable last minute rescue moments again. Whenever a situation seems hopeless, expect a T-Rex to appear and save the day.The acting is pretty bad across the board except for the villains. At least they're having fun with their roles.Objectively this is a bad film, but the second half is so bonkers and weird, that it almost makes up for it.

But life finds a way.... welcome to Jurassic World!Three years after the disaster when the park was opened because of Indomunous Rex, a volcano threatens to eliminate all life from Nublar island (yes, including all dinosaurs). From there, the rescue begins. But as Owen Grady said during his recruitment, ""what could possibly go wrong."" The action is non-stop, the threats are real. And the T-Rex remains awesome. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom exceeds all expectations, especially when the obvious comparison is to that of Jurassic Park II. John Hammond's vision of the initial Jurassic Park has now evolved fully. To push sequel after sequel something has to be lost for the story to move forward. This time, it was the park/island itself.Back on the mainland, two new dinosaurs made their mark on the franchise. The Indo Rapter and an unnamed dinosaur self titled ""Ramasaurs"". The latter becoming the comic relief while the first becoming the top bid from the arms dealers. One of the more interesting subplots is that of Maisie Lockwood, the granddaughter to John Hammond's former business partner played by James Cromwell. Owen and Claire have to band together once again, this time to save the dinosaurs, first from extinction then from being in the wrong hands.Fallen Kingdom is a great, fun and action packed thrill ride without the use of a theme park!","91 out of 154 found this helpful."

It's almost impossible to make sequel to give the same excitement. But fans just wants to see more of it and I'm glad we're getting it.Fallen Kingdoms story is pretty much revealed in the trailer. To be honest it was an exciting and enjoyable ride. I thought the first half was excellent, the whole island getting destroyed by the volcano was showed well as well as showing all the animals we want to see. Also it made me feel sad to see the beloved animals getting killed in the catastrophe, especially the scene when the ship departs island and a helpless Brachiosaurus looks at them from the edge of the dock with entire island behind her on fire. It was moving.The rest of the story is typical, rich international co-operates trying to make money at the expense of living things, which was not as good as the first half, but decent enough to watch. Thanks to some funny moments, good performances especially by that little girl, raptor Blue and good CGI. They've clearly tried to show respect to the original series and as well as satisfying the fans.Overall, super first half , awesome GCI and a visual treat. The story could have been better. Unlike other movies where we saw dinosaurs only here and there, in this one you see them almost in very scene. In Jurassic world its all about the what you see (can I say I enjoyed it far more than Black Panther).","62 out of 102 found this helpful."

And not even the acting is very good. Especially Bryce is totally annoying while she can't decide whether to look good or emotional all the time.And just to wrap things up: No, dinosaurs aren't your cuddly ones from the petting zoo.

"4","/10","The dullest entry since Jurassic Park III","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4340461/?ref_=tt_urv","tomgillespie2002","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3741220/?ref_=tt_urv","15 September 2018","Everybody's favourite mathematician, Dr. Ian Malcolm, warned misguided entrepreneur John Hammond 25 years ago of the perils of playing god and re-awakening dinosaurs from their extinct slumber. Of course, he was right, and the result was a personal childhood favourite. What he didn't foresee were the increasingly numbing sequels that would follow in the wake of Steven Spielberg's 1993 classic, which serve as a reminder not only of Spielberg's magical touch (let's pretend he wasn't responsible for The Lost World), but that general audiences will happily hand over their money to watch the same thing again and again. Jurassic World was unbelievably stupid, but its slightly schlocky attitude managed to scrape it a pass. Somehow, it became the third highest-grossing film of all time, so a sequel, or a trilogy (why not?), was quickly set in motion. Despite attracting a fantastic director in J.A. Bayona, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is the dullest entry since Jurassic Park III and manages, once again, to somehow make dinosaurs boring.In the wake of a devastating volcanic eruption on Isla Nublar, Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm is back to warn the U.S. Senate that rescuing the soon-to-be-lava-toast dinosaurs could have devastating repercussions for humanity, and once again states his belief that such unnatural tampering should have never been attempted in the first place. Protesters have gathered across the country in an attempt to convince the government that these creatures deserve another chance, and just when you think the film will serve as an allegory of our own mistreatment of the planet, the action zips across to Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has set up a fundraiser to rescue the animals. The efforts of Claire and her cronies Zia (Daniella Pineda) and Franklin (Justice Smith) have failed to raise enough cash, but things look up when Claire is invited to the estate of Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), John Hammond's former partner. Lockwood and his slickly-dressed aide Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) reveal a plan to rescue as many dinosaurs as they can and transport them to another island facility, where they will live in isolation and peace.As soon as you set eyes on the mercenary team led by Ted Levin's Ken Wheatley, you'll have figured out exactly where the story is going and what everyone's motives are. Mills' combination of slicked-back hair and friendly demeanour is a dead giveaway, and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom continues Hollywood's recent obsession with the amoral corporate bad guy. Wheatley's is Pete Postlethwaite's character from The Lost World, only without the gravitas and sense of backstory. Of course, their plan is to steal the dinosaurs and sell them on the black market, backed by Toby Jones' millionaire auctioneer Gunnar Eversol. They've also been working on their own little project, the Indoraptor, the genetically-modified brainchild of mad scientist Dr. Wu (BD Wong). Thank God then, that amidst all of this mess emerges the lovable face of Chris Pratt, dressed in manly clothes and building a manly house. Pratt's Owen Grady and Claire ended Jurassic World as a happy couple, but they have since drifted apart, presumably because Owen only plays by his own manly rules. They are reunited because Claire wants him on Isla Nublar, and we remember what little chemistry they share. But Pratt is charismatic and hugely likeable, a true movie star should he ever find a decent role outside of Guardians of the Galaxy.What makes Jurassic World: Fallen Kimgdom so unforgivably dull is the sheer lack of care taken with the set-pieces. One thrilling struggle under water - shot with one impressively long take - aside, Bayona and writers Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow don't seem particularly interested in exploring fresh ways to pit man against dinosaur. The opening scene, shot in near darkness, sees an unfortunate soul stalked and gobbled up by one of the predators, but the piece is crafted with such lazy editing and unimaginative build-up that it barely raises the heartbeat. For a director who conjured such wonderful atmospheres in The Orphanage and A Monster Calls, Fallen Kingdom is glaringly hollow, and the whole thing reeks of movie-making by committee. The dinosaurs relocation from jungle to Mills' underground laboratory - a labyrinth of corridors, control rooms and difficult-to-close dumbwaiters - is the only thing that really passes for invention, and it's a relief not have to watch the characters hunted in the jungle once again. The ending leaves the future of Hammond's dinosaurs as something to be explored in the next film, but there is little doubt that this franchise will strut on for many years to come. My investment in it, however, has all but vanished entirely.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

Excellent storytelling.When Jurassic World was released, I was impressed. So often, remakes can turn into the question 'Why would they?', but not with that film. However this film has flawed ideas all through it.The idea that dinosaurs can be tamed by humans is bizarre. Ever thought of keeping a pet crocodile in your swimming pool & swimming with it? NO! And yet somehow we are going to save animals that are a real threat to humans & may not be able to be contained. There is some really braindead scenes of romanticising the dinosaurs. At that point, the humans are focusing on a brachiosaurus, much easier to feel empathy for than a velociraptor!There is a strange 'good guy, bad guy' undercurrent to this film, except its got a modern day rebranding with all the current versions in the world of who is good or bad. Little understanding, more judging.The final section off the island is ok but the best scenes are on the island. Brilliant settings & photography & cgis of the dinosaurs are totally believable.","2 out of 3 found this helpful."

Visually, the movie is stunning, with epic wide angle shots. Light and shadows are used to excellent effect, heightening the tension. The dinosaurs look better than ever, especially the animatronic ones. The soundtrack, while never really blasting out the classic John Williams score, adds to the tension and excitement. The film has a great deal of tension and is probably the scariest since the original Jurassic Park. The opening scene is fantastic and sets the tone well. The movie barely lets up from here. The story is the most interesting of the sequels and while some twists are predictable, other moments are a surprise. The character arks of Owen and Clare progress well, though not in the direction expected. The new characters are welcome additions, though Toby Jones would benefit from more screen time for his rather obnoxious role. It's not all perfect, some scenes don't work. Chris Pratt trying to escape the lava is poorly executed and slightly cringy. Some scenes jump quickly to others, leading to a lack of contunuity. The music interrupts the flow of some dialogue. Despite these minor issues, the movie is a very exciting addition to the franchise. I was left thinking about one scene, a haunting scene, beautifully shot and filled with regret. The dinosaurs retain a serious threat, but we very much care about their survival. Well worth a second viewing, let alone a first!","100 out of 171 found this helpful."

When people are torn apart on screen, there's no gore, no blood. I expected this of course, but it still disappoints me. This movie would be much more chilling if it had a bit of blood in it.I wish someone would make movies like these, for adults, with good scripts and more graphical violence. Less ""family movie"" vibe would be better. This movie was probably the worst so far.

Did you see it? Yep we just did the close-up of the dilating pupil again! Remember that??""""Or hey, do you recall when the girl banged that ladle on the floor to distract the 'raptor from eating her brother? ... Yep that's in there too.""""Want to see a girl struggle to pull down a cupboard door she's hiding in again? You're in luck!""Christ. Just stop.
The recent Star Wars films are littered with them; Jurassic World itself was swarming with them - and this movie carries on that recent phenomenon in earnest. We're here to see ""new"" scenes, not shot-for-shot replicas like some internet fan remake.God know what Jurassic World IX or Star Wars XIII will be like ... some sort of ""30 Greatest Moments"" pastiche, stitched together from all the previous film into a 2 hour running time with little concern for plot or indeed continuity.A little reference back to an iconic scene or moment is quite a nice touch but for the last third of Fallen Kingdom, I think I'd given up taking any notice of the actual story and just sat counting the number of nods to previous Jurassic Park moments*. Doing it in every other scene is simply indulgent... or simply filler, demonstrative of the film maker's chronic lack of ideas of their own.*Fifteen I made it, for anyone who was interested.","1 out of 1 found this helpful."

The T-Rex is always built up until at least the second half, and the T-Rex will show up at the very end, usually saving the main human characters in what I've dubbed ""Deus Rex Machina"". This ""Jurassic"" installment breaks the mold by having neither. (Good. These films were starting to get a bit predictable.) Parts of it still feel a bit too familiar, mostly because the first half of the film is essentially a remake of ""The Lost World"" Jurassic Park movie, and some of the ""twists"" are really, really stupid, even for this franchise. And yes, there are a lot of really dumb decisions made by the characters. The action sequences are edge-of-your seat, the danger and stakes have been upped significantly, and the second half turns this from action movie into horror movie, and it is intense! The CGI really needs to stop though. The first ""Jurassic Park"" looks better than this, and that came out in 1993. After watching ""Park"" and then this, the CGI really stands out in a bad way. They really need to go back to using practical effects. This is still a very fun movie, despite being more of the same, and I'd say it's at least worth a rent.

The plot of ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is a botched mash-up of ""King Kong,"" B-movie SciFi, and James Bond-knockoff spy flicks.
Chris Pratt is wasted. Bryce Dallas Harper is wasted. The villains are vapid, melodramatic caricatures (think of GI Joe's old enemy, Cobra and his minions).
And there's this really weird sub-plot involving a little girl of suspect origins that seems to exist only to give pseudo-gravitas to Jeff Goldblum's cameo as Dr. Malcom, reprising his overwrought science-is-dangerous soliloquy.

I'd rather do just positive reviews and say nothing at all for films I dislike but the way this franchise has been handled is sickening. J-World was just about a 2 star from me but this film is even worse. None of the wonder or magic from the original 2 films exists in this franchise anymore. This could not feel less like a Speilberg movie and he set the example, he simply does not make films of this poor quality. I'm not clued up on what executive producer really means but how can Speilberg be happy with this (I'm guessing and hoping he's not and just has to ignore this trash like the rest of us with any sense of why this film is such a stain). I agree with the poster's comments about fake reviews; I know a worrying number of people thought this film was brilliant but you can also spot the fake reviews a mile off.I'm not criticising because of some nostalgic snobbery or bias towards the originals, I think the Star Wars franchise for example has been recovered reasonably well after the dodgy prequels, although I was not a big fan of Last Jedi. Force Awakens just about had the right balance of nostalgia and light humour and the actions scenes were well put together. Unfortunately These two recent Jurassic films have nowhere near achieved what the Force Awakens did. Watching these films now is like a cross between Fast & Furious and Transformers, all action and hollow albeit spectacular set-pieces, no soul or credibility. The exaggerated shots of a t-rex roaring just as the volcano erupts and the hybrid dinosaur on the roof perfectly positioned in-front of the moon are examples of the lack of subtlety portrayed.Cannot get behind or believe these characters or the ridiculous, but strangely predictable plot which may have worked in better hands but these reboots have been poorly executed. Irritating characters, far too many wise-crack lines you would get in your average US sitcom, it's a farce and unfortunately linking these films with the originals has simply pi***d over their legacy. Then there is the BD Wong character, his short appearance in the original is a far cry from the pantomime character of these reboots. Ian Malcolm's speech was the only half credible element of this film except for the stomach turning insertion of the title 'this is now Jurassic World' at the end. I'm not saying the original was not in any way a far-fetched plot but it was executed and acted in a way that made it believable, you understood the characters and the action scenes were so well put together and well backed up by a memorable score from Williams. The score for Fallen Kingdom is bland beyond belief except for the insulting and out of place insertion of extracts from the original score. The Lost World was a perfectly good sequel minus the San Diego scene and kept the series intact; it should have been left alone there after unless a seriously good script and the right director came along.Rant over, but wish the industry would stop tarnishing the legacy of such films. Peter Rabbit is another example of how not to produce a film associated with original cherished material; would Beatrix Potter or Crichton approve?","3 out of 6 found this helpful."

Bayona. I have faith in that guy and loved his works such as The Orphanage, The Impossible and A Monster's Call. If you haven't seen those movies or at least one of those, I suggest you go check it out. I was curious when he said in an interview that he wanted the sequel to be horror. Now, I've seen his movie The Orphanage and I have to give it to him that he can direct a horror movie. Now what I am really interested in is, having seen three of his movies that I mention, I notice that all three (for lack of better word) have ""heart"", I don't know but they just give you the ""feels"". But really, that's the reason why I am very excited to watch this one out and see if a gigantic and popular movie franchise like Jurassic Park which is popular for its park and man killing dinosaurs could ever give me the ""feels"". AND IT DID! I just can't believe it, J.A. Bayona made me care about dinosaurs! What I also loved about my movie experience with Jurassic World: The Fallen Kingdom is it was such a fun ride. The theater I was in felt like I was inside an actual amusement park and the reactions of other viewers made me enjoy the movie even more. It's really nice to know that I am not the only one having fun with this movie. I recommend you guys watch Jurassic World in a nice theater in your area, buy some popcorn and drinks and enjoy the movie ride!","113 out of 197 found this helpful."

I even thought its two sequels weren't that bad. Jurassic World was the movie I didn't like. To me it was a mildly entertaining mess and its global success was a total mystery to me. I really wasn't looking forward to seeing Fallen Kingdom, but luckily I did. Surprisingly it's very good!The story picks up four years after Jurassic World. The dinosaurs of the island Isla Nublar are in danger because a volcano is about to erupt (!). Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) wants to save them and gets an offer from Benjamin Lockwood, former partner of park founder Hammond, to relocate all the animals to a new island where they can live undisturbed. She agrees and even convinces her (now) former boyfriend Owen (Chris Pratt) to join her. Back on the island they discover that they have been lied to and that their own actions have led to this...Fallen Kingdom isn't the big Chris Pratt show and that's a good thing. Don't get me wrong: I love Pratt, but in terms of characters the film has a lot more to offer. Bryce Dallas Howard gets most screentime and even the kid in the movie, old Lockwood's niece Maisy, isn't annoying like the ones in the previous films. She's a real heroine. The role is played by first timer Isabella Sermon, of whom we without any doubt will hear much more from in the future. Well done!The first half of Fallen Kingdom, when the gang gets back together and discover what happened on the island, is the best part. The hommage to Raiders of the Lost Ark (""Jock! Start the engine!""), when Owen and Claire must run for their lives because of the eruption and dive into the ocean (as seen in the trailer) is the best sequence. But there's also a lot of fun in smaller scenes. I won't spoil it for you, but there's a moment when Owen gets drugged and something very dangerous is approaching him. In typical Pratt fashion he escapes. In another scene he has to draw blood from a dinosaur in a truck. Very funny.I also like the fact that Fallen Kingdom does a lot with suggestion. In Spielberg fashion we see a lot of silhouettes of dinosaurs which adds to the suspence. It also makes the film look very good. The ending of the movie is a bit strange, though. It's okay to have a heart for the dinosaurs, but to do something like that... well.. that's pretty extreme. It does make way for an interesting part 3.Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom will be the big summer movie of 2018 and without any doubt rule the global box office. It deserves that success because it's a well crafted and very entertaining action movie. The special effects are excellent and the characters are more interesting than in most action flicks. Go see it!4/5","72 out of 122 found this helpful."

There were very few parts of this ridiculous movie that were tolerable but for those jurassic park fans that have loved this franchise from the beginning see this movie as ridiculous and far fetched. Adding in the fact heat Hammond never had a partner not even in the books and then to have this clone girl in the twist is far from what this movie should have been. I will never watch this garbage again and don't consider it part of the jurassic park chain at all. All involved in the movie should be ashamed. The fact that they let a brand new director who didn't know what he was doing direct this film tells me they knew the script was Crandon the get go or else they would've had a seasoned director who knew what he was doing!

The movie centres around the debate on whether these dinosaurs should be saved from an extinction level event. This is an interesting idea and an appreciated twist on the Jurassic Park formula. I did have issues with the idea that the dinosaurs should be saved (Jeff Goldblum returns as Dr. Ian Malcolm and he summed up my line of thinking in an all too brief appearance) but I did my best to keep my mind open. We do spend some time on the island but most of the movie is set on the mainland. The mission to save the dinosaurs isn't what it seems (which is obvious to everyone but the characters in the movie) and things spiral out of control from there. They also explore ideas in weaponizing these dinosaurs and what the implications of that would be (the original Jurassic World dipped their toes into that but Fallen Kingdowm dives into the pool). So as much as I didn't agree with the line of thinking the movie promotes, I did appreciate the attempt to bust out of the formula. Director J.A. Bayona comes from a horror background and one of the reasons I was rooting for this movie (he made A Monster Calls which was one of my favourite movies of 2016). One of the best aspects of Jurassic World 2 is that they do a good job of showing a more horrific side of these dinosaurs. The film is impressive between the visual effects and the cinematography and there are some really nice shots where the dinosaurs are presented like a monster in a horror movie. There was an interesting sequence where a carnivore is creeping through a tunnel and the light is flickering in and out. The movie is surprisingly violent for a film that you can bring your kids to and it had the right idea to bring the focus back to the potential danger that these creatures could possess. We all love watching dinosaurs but the context of what they would mean to the world is more accurately presented here.One of the things that makes Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom so disappointing is that the cast is so good across the board. Chris Pratt is charming and fun to watch even when he's dialed back the funny banter that you're used to seeing from him. I'm a fan of Bryce Dallas Howard and while despite the problems I had with her character from the first entry, she's just as good if not better in a more sympathetic turn as Claire. Rafe Spall comes out of the gate strong and just avoids descending into becoming a cartoon by the end. Danielle Pineda was so strong that one of my biggest disappointments about the movie was we didn't get to spend more time with her. James Cromwell is surprisingly warm as Benjamin Lockwood, Toby Jones is underused but effective and while I found his character unbearable, I credit Justice Smith for giving it his all as Franklin Webb. It was hard to stomach so many things in this movie. The pacing is all over the place, the first act is so slow and the 2nd act moves so fast that its here and gone (its especially disappointing when the trailer features so much of that surprisingly short sequence). While many critics praise the 3rd act, I thought it just fell into nonsense. There's some nice shots and the ideas that drive the plot are fresh for this franchise. But there's plot hole after plot hole and stupid sequence after stupid sequence, I was honestly shocked that someone didn't fix these problems while the script was being written let alone when it was filmed. One of the characters expects the villain to call the police on himself when there is no logical reason to do so (that's just one example of many). I saw this with a friend and over the course of the ride home, we must have come up with 10-15 separate issues. There's a bombshell dropped that's so bizarre and its never addressed again. Plus, there's a decision made at the end that could cause the deaths of so many people and it's the good guys that put these people in jeopardy. I can't go into it more without going into spoilers, there are movies that can distract you from logical leaps, but Fallen Kingdom just couldn't do it for me and it left me shaking my head.This is the most conflicted I've felt about a movie for a long time. There's plenty of good reasons to go see this movie. The big names in the cast all perform capably, there's some really creative cinematography, the action is decent, and they swung for the fences by taking the plot in a different direction. But I can't excuse the gigantic plot holes, the poor decisions by so many important characters, pacing problems and Fallen Kingdom can't hurdle the problems with the premise, let alone the ones that crop up over the course of the movie. If you can't stand the latest entry of the Jurassic Park franchise, I understand that line of thinking and if you can get around some of the obvious problems with Jurassic World 2 and enjoy it for what it is, I can see why. I have to split the difference and give this a 5/10. I can't recommend this though; the movie had become so unbelievable by the end that I was having to avoid snickering and laughing on the way out to the parking lot.","4 out of 10 found this helpful."

They spoil way, way too much. Many of the movie's best sequences, or at least fragments of them, are shown in the trailers. Several times I found myself thinking while watching the movie, ""I know where this is going because I saw a clip in the trailer.""Now I'll give a quick plot overview of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.After witnessing the carnage, chaos and death that ensued during the theme park's meltdown in the last movie, you may be wondering why any human would ever set foot on the island again. It's a very reasonable thought.In brief, all the dinosaurs on the island are going to become extinct after the island's volcano erupts. Nature is clearly trying to tell us something, right? Just let nature correct the mistake humans made in bringing back the most dangerous predators to ever exist. While we're thinking about the volcano, I'm also curious about why the founders of the park ever chose to build on an island with an active volcano that could wipe out all nearby life. Seems like poor planning. Also poor planning, is endangering human lives with a rescue mission to an island with an erupting volcano.Against all logic, operation: Save the dinos has its supporters. An animal protection group, headed by a less steely and less robotic Clair Deering (Bryce Dallas Howard), convinces a billionaire to fund a mission to rescue the dinosaurs.But, oh no! The team needs help tracking Blue, the last surviving raptor. Cue raptor trainer extraordinaire Owen Grady (Chris Pratt). Those two are joined by a paleo-veterinarian (apparently a real thing) and an annoying tech guy who is afraid of absolutely everything, including bugs and planes. As you can imagine, he does not hold up well around dinosaurs.I'm not sure why the scaredy-pants character was ever written into this movie. He's meant to provide comic relief, but isn't that why Chris Pratt is here? Pratt is actually funny, and he's wasted in this movie, relegated to a puppet of a character, who showcases none of the charismatic cool he demonstrated in the prior film.Beyond the obvious character development flaws, there is one unavoidable issue: I don't agree with their mission. How can I root for these heroes if they're doing something indisputably foolish? I love animals, but these particular animals have killed countless humans and will surely kill more. I cannot support risking more human lives for this mission.That's not the movie's only problem. For one, the directing is spotty. A few sequences will wow the viewers, as long as they haven't already seen these clips in the trailers. Director J.A. Bayona has a background in horror that becomes evident in this movie. He creates dingy lighting and makes clever use of shadows as dinosaurs approach their victims. When the dinosaurs fully reveal themselves, Bayona knows to focus the camera on teeth, claws and eyes--the scariest parts of the creatures.Some of the action is legitimately scary. Other times, it's cartoonish. One scene in particular feels like something you would see in Scooby-Doo.The issue with the action, other than being occasionally cartoonish, is how often in leans on callbacks to past Jurassic movies. Sure, the concepts are fun and well-executed, but we have seen them all before.Here we are at the fifth movie in the franchise, and the filmmakers are clearly out of fresh ideas. They're banking on fans flocking to see the movie solely because it has dinosaurs. I demand something more from my movies, and you should too.","41 out of 66 found this helpful."

The island rescue (action) and the Lockwood mansion chaos (almost horror in its style). The strongest for me is the first half and features some great moments and some really emotional scenes. One in particular (which was devoid of dinosaurs) was the way director J.A. Bayona shot a rapidly sinking Gyrosphere. This director certainly knows how to use water to build tension from his incredible 2nd film THE IMPOSSIBLE and this moment is claustrophobic and a joy to watch. The 2nd half pulls in the resigns somewhat and gets super dark and suspenseful. I guess your enjoyment of each varies on your preferred genres.
Speaking of beautiful, JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM features some of the most stunning cinematography I've seen in a long-time throughout its entire run-time... The Indoraptor roaring on the rooftop and the final shots of the island to name just two are gorgeous to look at. Some of these moments are sure to become timeless as the franchise continues.
It's also stuffed full of some of the most incredible CGI I've ever witnessed, it really doesn't miss a beat and this time out, unlike 2015's movie, spotting the shift to animatronics and back again was almost impossible.
As a long time Jurassic fan there's an incredible amount of fan service dotted throughout, including countless dialogue moments that are ripped straight out of the original Jurassic park film. Many shots and sequences from both the original and its sequel are expertly recreated in ways that are both new yet recognisable.
The script is a noticeable improvement from 2015's release with very few cheesy or awkward dialogue moments however the story itself is much more confined, taking place in only two locations in its 2 hour run-time. This came as a bit of a disappointment, especially considering I'd seen the trailers and they unquestionably gave far too much story away and left little in surprise, (there are still a few twists and turns awaiting even for the most researched fans though!) This isn't technically the films fault (I'm laying the blame on Universal) but it definitely robbed me of some enjoyment.
FALLEN KINGDOM also sees the return of Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, both do a Dino-Mite job! The chemistry between the two is great and has some real depth as we slowly piece together what happened to them after the events of the first film. The real star of the show here though is young Isabella Sermon (Maisie Lockwood) She had some of the most emotional driven scenes in the whole film and she smashed it! Supporting cast members Daniella Pineda and Justice Smith walk the fine line between comedy relief and silliness without it being cringe. Ted Levine who plays ranger Franklin is just about passable but the film could have done without Toby Jones who (for me at least) always brings B-class movie cheese with him wherever he goes. It was great to see Jeff Goldblum and BD Wong reappear in the series but don't expect to see them much.. It's a shame really as for the screen-time they are given they bring a lot to the story.Overall FALLEN KINGDOM is a solid and surprising claustrophobic dino thriller, stuffed with fan pleasing easter eggs and stunning cinematography. The overall story doesnt evolve as far as I would have liked but it injects some much needed terror and style into this 25 year old dinosaur franchise.www.popcornography.co.uk

Film of Choice this morning at The Plaza Dorchester Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Like Gods, man interfered to bring back the dinosaurs and their arrogance gives them reason to believe they can manipulate the natural order to their own means. As in previous outings to Jurassic Park and in the words of Dr Malcolm..... 'life finds a way'. This latest instalment of the hugely popular film series takes us back to Isla Nubla ostensibly to rescue the dinosaurs from a volcano, but hey that's not really going to get bums on seats is it? Throw in some bad guys with an ulterior motive, a crazy scientific dude who is torn between the love and passion of his developmental work and the dirty dollar, mix it up with an elderly man and his granddaughter, some kick ass special effects and the relationship between Chris Pine and his velociraptor Blue and you have a pretty darn good film. Touching at times we see a different side to the dinosaurs and are introduced to yet another new hybrid which proves biggest is not always baddest. As we came to the final scenes of the film we are left with a line that could either end the franchise or leave it wide open for another instalment, I personally want more!!!!","91 out of 158 found this helpful."

Guess who wins!JIM'S REVIEW: It's them vs. us again! Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom has more dinosaurs to meet, more destinations to visit, more scary moments of dino-chomping, more self-depreciating humor from our anti-hero and all-around good guy Owen (Chris Pratt, still charming as ever), surprisingly more sensible foot ware for his love interest, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), and more-of-the-same escapist entertainment any moviegoer can expect from this series. This chapter follows its successful formula and then verges off into new territory under the more than capable direction of J. A. Bayona.Yes, it's the hunter getting captured by the game as the many breeds of dinosaurs are nearing extinction on their island. Volcanic activity threatens to put an end to them in an ironic close encounter of their kind. Both Owen and Claire want to help them and evil forces want to use them. Greed, big business, and hefty dollar signs are involved in this messy food chain. The dinosaurs (and their human prey) never saw it comin', although any moviegoer beyond the age of 7 surely has.The problem with all this danger and peril is that the creatures whose brain is small and disproportionate to their bodies seem to be better equipped at survival than their human counterparts. It's always dinnertime and we foolish mammals have no real smarts! Logic always loses itself to the simplistic plot. If one can accept that factor, moviegoers will enjoy the set-up and thrills to a higher degree. Otherwise, it's idea-fatigue that is on display.All in all, the CGI dinosaurs are first-rate and their realistic details of sharp talons, scaly textures, and drooling teeth are state-of-the-art impressive. These monsters bring the chills and scares. Some set pieces ratchet up the tension quite nicely (I loved the monster in the bedroom motif.) and the film's violence is refreshingly not gory in the least.The screenplay by Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow takes awhile to stage the two-pronged story of island danger and creatures running rapid in an old Victorian mansion. Fortunately, they never take their subject matter too seriously and add some humor to the narrative. (At times, I was as giddy as that inner 60's teenager enjoying at a Saturday matinee serial, thoroughly entertained and laughing out loud at the chases and far-fetched dangers. ) The villains are of the cardboard variety and one watches for their dastardly comeuppance, which you know will occur and one savors those moments. After all, the film is straight formula with a little flourish and a lot of strong production values. But it is the director who truly saves the day. He paces his horror film with an onslaught of memorable images that make this one of the better installments in the franchise. His use of lighting and shadows reigns supreme and he keeps the action moving and the tension high. Mr. Bayona brings on the gravitas with a light touch of tongue-in-cheek humor. It's a wonderful balancing act from a skilled director.Back again are Mr. Pratt and Ms. Howard, very likable actors who add some nuance to their stock parts. Daniella Pineda and Justice Smith are the younger mismatched couple and Isabella Sermon is that child actor in jeopardy. They play their roles well. In close pursuit as possible human hors d'oeuvres are Toby Stephens, James Cromwell, Geraldine Chaplin, Ted Levine, and Rafe Spall. Even Jeff Goldblum makes a welcomed visit to bookend and warn us of all the genetic tampering that will be the death to us all.Jurassic World: Hidden Kingdom is mindless big budget fun. As escapist fare goes, chomp away!","70 out of 120 found this helpful."

The movie itself seems to be made for fans and those who have been so since part one, the little bits and pieces say it so. I loved the soundtrack, the imagery, the action, the science, it was all quite good. Could it have been better given the earnings of the previous chapter? possibly, yes. But I also think they have to store funding and invest for the next chapter, it is all an investment in Hollywood, as these things cost money. I loved alien covenant because I was a fan of Prometheus, and that was badly received, but i am pleased, the fans are pleased with these films being created for us.

But while picking apart this movie i just always couldn't help but think that a lot of the bashing this movie gets it extremely unwarranted. Yes there are flaws with the movie and I won't deny that. The biggest criticism I think I've seen is that 1: It's boring and doesn't have enough dinosaur action, and 2: It is too different from the original. The first criticism i find somewhat understandable, but then again this movie is a lot more story driven than it is action packed. There are balances between the two in most of the other Jurassic movies but this time around it decided to sacrifice one for the other. And whether you like or hate the story is completely subjective, but the bottom line is that it is trying to be a more story driven movie. The second criticism is actually kind of correct it is very different from the original jurassic park. Yes it's different from the original movie, but it's a lot similar to the BOOK that this series is based off of. This movie is making the franchise evolve in a way Michael Crichton planned for it to all the way in his first book which keep in mind was three years before the original movie. Does this movie have flaws? yeah. The way the indoraptor escaped was dumb, and in my personal opinion all the parts on the island are incredibly mediocre. But i think the rest of this movie is fantastic... Okay i'm prepared for the hate","64 out of 109 found this helpful."

The one thing that the film fails at is the plot and characters. The plot, at times, can be very messy and convoluted and the pacing was all over the place at points. The characters were very uninteresting and most lines of dialogue were jokes and placed for comedic effect.

Ever since I have seen the first Jurassic Park movie, I've been admiring it. But after that Steven Spielberg's movie, no Jurassic movie sparked the same interest in me, again. Every instalment is getting worse. After the start of the Jurassic World franchise, it is becoming even dumber. The animations, VFX & special effects, are awesome in this movie. The music, and acting are good to some extent, but the story is too much flawed. When incidents like this happen, would the governments, militaries and International Scientists Unions sit silent and enjoy their popcorn? So, now they have Science technology to create humans artificially but do not fail proof systems to contain the animals? There are also many moral flaws throughout the movie. If only the story of the movie is the criteria, I would have given it 0 rating, but the affects are rescuers here. I haven't seen Jurassic World: Dominion, yet, but I will.

The fantasy-filled theme park is no more and dinosaurs are roaming in the wild as nature intended. There's only one problem; Isla Nublar's dormant volcano is going to erupt. Without human intervention, all the dinosaurs will soon cease to exist (again).Here comes the moral dilemma. Do these previously extinct prehistoric animals, revived by a private enterprise, deserve protection of the U.S. Government and at the expense of taxpayers like other endangered species? When the answer is no, a company connected to Jurassic Park's founder, Dr. John Hammond's former business partner, Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), reaches out to a dinosaurs protection organization led by now conservationist Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas-Howard, ""Hereafter"").The plan is to rescue these animals by moving them into an island sanctuary nearby. As the former operations manager of the park, Claire's expertise is needed to get into the old park's system and locate the dinosaurs. She persuades her ex-boyfriend and raptor trainer, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt, ""Avengers: Infinity War"") to go with her and her team, tech geek Franklin Webb (Justice Smith) and paleo-veterinarian Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda).It's no surprise that things do not go according to plan. As a matter of fact, the plan is not what it seems. Mercenaries and profiteers (Rafe Spall, Ted Levine, Toby Jones, B.D. Wong) want to save the dinosaurs for their own self-serving benefits. These dinosaurs are worth millions and can be used for other purposes. Director J.A. Bayona sets up suspenseful set pieces and action sequences from the start. Unlike the sun-lit wonder of ""Jurassic World,"" 'Fallen Kingdom' starts off with a harrowing underwater nighttime expedition in the rain. Once Claire and company arrive at the island, they are trapped in an underground bunker, cracking with shots of hot lava and a monstrous creature coming out of hiding. Then out in the open, dinosaurs are running amok, trying to outrun shooting fire balls and engulfing smoke. Chaos descends on land and in the ocean, with a rolling and sinking gyrosphere.Once the dinosaurs are off the island, they are transported into the mainland, specifically an expansive estate in Northern California, the Lockwood Estate. Caught in the mayhem is Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), Benjamin's granddaughter. Terror reigns in the manor. Hide-and-seek and attack occur in confined spaces, lending a claustrophobic feel. The filmmaker takes advantage of the Gothic setting with a play of light and shadow.The film is shot beautifully for maximum chill. A lone, gentle giant left behind on the shore, disappearing into a desperate silhouette in an ash cloud. A ferocious hybrid creature roaring on the rooftop against the backdrop of a moonlit rainstorm. A gigantic beast lurking beneath the sea surface dotted with surfers and swimmers. An intelligent dino roaming across rocky scape and looming steps away from civilization.The kingdom may have fallen apart, but life finds a way. There's also a twist that doesn't stop with loose dinosaurs. The ending sets up for a sequel where humans would have no choice but face the consequences of their action. ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is a tense and thrilling ride with a surprisingly thought-provoking message.","37 out of 60 found this helpful."

Sure, all the same elements of the first film are usually present in each subsequent movie, but the magic seems to have been all used up in the first go. Each version is only a slight variation to a story that never ends well.Now in the fifth installment of this franchise, I'm a little surprised that this storyline hadn't appeared yet. Sure, we had dinosaurs making their way to the mainland in The Lost World (1997), which was probably why Jeff Goldblum had an extremely minor (and entirely unnecessary) cameo in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) to act as a framing bookend to the film. Sadly, many of the mostly hidden weaknesses in Jurassic World (2015) came to light in this sub-par sequel. Like I said in my review of Jurassic World, I don't care about these characters, even if their relationships seem to be written to elicit a response from the audience.Furthermore, while the plot of Fallen Kingdom seemed like low-hanging fruit (which is probably indicative that they're scraping the bottom of the barrel for plotlines), none of the twists were surprising or unexpected. Heck, the biggest twist was already obvious almost at the beginning. While I will praise this film as having quite a few neat bits of CGI and special effects, most of them felt like they were part of a demo reel for a college final. It didn't help that the dinosaur mayhem didn't even take place until the last quarter of the movie. By that point, I had lost all suspension of disbelief as children were outrunning velociraptor-type dinosaurs with ease. Nobody felt in danger, even if I really wanted the annoying and obnoxious ""tech support"" character to be eaten as soon as possible (it didn't help that he only appeared to conveniently move the plot along).A franchise that once again needs to go extinct, I give Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom 2.0 stars out of 5.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

No, this movie absolutely pales in comparison to the last movie, Jurassic World! While that movie had a pretty weak story and characters, the action was absolutely thrilling and I regularly rewatch it for that alone. It's tied with Star Wars: The Force Awakens for my favourite movie of 2015. Fallen Kingdom didn't have any of that. What little character the first movie had was gone, replaced with cartoon characters with exaggerated and over-the-top personalities, and it was much tamer in comparison. Most of the movie is set in a house and there's only one dinosaur on the loose! What kind of Jurassic movie is that? That's like something someone would make up as a joke, making fun of movie series that have clearly run out of ideas! Also, out of all the subplots in Jurassic World to follow up on, why did they choose the weaponized dinosaurs? That was by far the weakest aspect of Jurassic World! It's stupid and makes absolutely no sense! There's a lot of that in this movie, it feels like a Saturday morning cartoon! I have to say though, the ending was pretty awesome. I wish I didn't see literally all of it in the trailers. I'm looking forward to Jurassic World 3, it has a very interesting setup that really makes me wonder why they didn't just make that movie instead. They could've easily skipped over this movie and made the next movie this movie! Anyway, as you can tell, I really didn't like this one. I don't recommend it, even if you do like the other Jurassic movies.","2 out of 4 found this helpful."

Not only Bayona developed that in a smart way, but he achieved quite efficiently to move on from a déjà vu plot to bring his own view on how a Jurassic movie should be. And damn, I wish we never came back to Isla Sorna, Isla Nublar, or any other island from now on.This movie proposes new characters and plot developments, brings new perspectives to the jurassic park saga in such a way that we leave the present movie with more questions than answers.Juan Antonio Bayona's direction and photography is by far the most artistic of all Jurassic Movies and he has achieved to bring horror movies standards to a film with dinos, something I never expected to be so enjoyable.Although the screenplay is too predictable and suffer inconsistencies and irregular rhythm, I have really enjoyed how Bayona is able to generate many tensions, something I though only Spielberg was able to create with dinosaurs. I am not easily impressed, I just remember how I was shivering and feeling stressful when I first watched iconic scenes such as the appearance of the T-Rex in the first movie, and the rescue of the baby T-Rex by its parents in the Lost World. Well, I got that feeling in Fallen Kingdom, not only once, but several times in one single movie.Fallen Kingdom is really an excellent entertaining movie, as long as you watch it with an open mind.Lots of watchers give bad review complaining that it's not Jurassic Park anymore, but what do they expect, really ? Just pick up a DVD so that you can keep watching a movie you enjoyed.","39 out of 64 found this helpful."

It seems they were setting up a MUCH better third film, but to me ""Fallen Kingdom"" wasn't too much to get excited about as a standalone film.Chris Pratt delivers well with his witty humor as well as BDH. They introduce a new character ""Franklin"" that is a well written comic relief, but other than this, the movie falls flat on its own.

The T1000 morphing in Terminator 2, the face hugger in Alien and of course the first time we saw dinosaurs in the very first Jurassic Park. The problem is over the years with more and more films using special effects we as an audience have grown used to seeing them so they have lost their awe.Prime example this film. Yes epic, 
Yes great special effects, 
Interesting but silly story, 
Typical role models throughout the film with the obligatory child thrown in for good measure, 
But missing something and I really can't put my claw on it. I don't do spoilers but why if in the previous film you fight to survive are you now fighting for..........????Personally I felt let down, enjoyed it but personally I feel something was missed, with a slight tangent (the girl) this could been taken in a whole new direction.But unfortunately it is same-o-sane-o.For me Jurassic Park 3 will always stand out as the one to beat where the T Rex was brought back to LA and it ran riot to find its baby (whatever happened to the mom and baby because since then we have only ever seen one T Rex)?Kids will love this film (another Rampage) but as an adult I'm not too sure.

Clearly the writer struggles writing compelling characters and any sense of a plot (that doesn't rip off other movies). What a bunch of tripe. Somehow Chris Pratt was dulled down to a complete bore in this- how can you do that? Dude has so much charisma- yet this movie somehow achieves to do this. A bad movie writes characters into situations just to extend the plot where the writer wants the movie to go- and WOW does that happen in this movie- nearly the entire time. And I'm not nitpicking - just sit back and think about what the characters do- their motivations - just horrendous writing. The ending is a straight up rip of Planet of the Apes - it's not even funny. The twist is laughingly bad - and the way it's told to the audience (exposition city here folks) is just awful. Clearly people who just want to see dinosaurs might enjoy this. If you like any semblance of a plot, character development, intrigue, suspense, then you're not going to find it here. Shame - because I admire the director a lot - but Colin T.'s writing is burning this series to the ground. Jurassic World (1) had some cracks.

It delivered what I wanted it to. It kept things the same that I wanted to remain the same but it broke boundaries too. You can't go into this film expecting dinosaurs in a non-functional Park like JP, TLW, JP3 and JW. It inevitably had to step away from the park at some point but it did it extremely well with explanation as to why certain things happened. I thought the Indoraptor was going to be a terrible idea but it was surprisingly really cool. The film could have stood without it but it opened up avenues to do certain things in the beginning of the film. The little girls character could have been left out completely and I wasn't that fussed by her, she didn't leave me impacted but I'm not going to jump the gun, maybe her timeline is important to the next film? People are mentioning plot holes but it's a trilogy, there's massive hints that things will be explained in the third instalment, people are jumping on it just like Star Wars: The Last Jedi.I loved the use of different species of dinosaurs, the locations of the film, the darkness to it and how you can compare greed and power to the current world we live in.","82 out of 145 found this helpful."

This one was far superior, to the point where I consider it the 2nd-best Jurassic Park movie (after the first one, of course). The action kept me on the edge of my seat and never let up. It also packed an emotional punch similar to the original Jurassic Park, where you feel for the dinosaurs and genuinely want them to survive. It also posed an interesting ethical dilemma so that the question of whether or not the dinosaurs should be allowed to exist was never given a clear right-or-wrong answer. It made you consider every angle. Because the emotional depth was more apparent than the first Jurassic World, I think it's obvious that this sequel far exceeds it.

The plan is to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary, but that's not the way it works out.My title blurb pretty much says it all for this fifth film in the franchise. I mention Indiana Jones because the movie has a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) vibe more so than the other movies. The reference to Dracula's castle is due to the fact that the entire second half takes place at a cool, gothic chateau in Northern California and there's a scene with a genetically-enhanced raptor acting like Dracula.Curvy Bryce is just stunning throughout and easily blows away any other woman in the series. Meanwhile Pratt seriously upped his game as leading action hero (I wasn't overly impressed with him in the previous film, although I didn't dislike him either). At the end of the day I'd have to rank this installment as my favorite, followed by the original 1993 movie and 2015's ""Jurassic World.""The film runs 2 hours, 8 minutes and was shot in Hawaii and England/Scotland.GRADE: A-/B+","39 out of 65 found this helpful."

This sequel its the same deal, only it uses the already inferior ""The Lost World"" as its main source of inspiration. There's not a single plot element that makes sense, everything is jammed down the viewer's throat and the character's are a bunch of one-dimensional stereotypes. It's easier to list its few virtues than dwell in all its shortcomings:1) Visually speaking, its 100 times more appealing than its predecessor. Kudos to the director, the cinematographer, art department and all the other people involved. The lighting, especially, is more interesting. Despite the fact it is shot with digital cameras (the Alexa 65, which currently is the state-of-the-art, along with a few other machines, when it comes to digital imagery), it feels more like an old-fashion, Technicolor epic than its captured-on-film predecessor. 2) Despite the script's lack of truly suspenseful set-pieces (we're talking about the JP franchise here: who can forget the kitchen sequence in the original? Or the caravan hanging on the edge of the cliff in Lost World?), Bayona does a good job in instilling a quasi-gothic, horror-movie vibe in the last act. Nothing that will prevent you from sleep at night, but you can tell the guy knows what suspense is. I wonder what he could've done with a better screenplay at hand. 3) The opening scene does work: it's a nice way to kickstart the flick. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. The rest is highly forgettable. The pseudo-science is one of the things that kills me every time I watch current sci-fi blockbusters: these things, of course, have never been actual textbooks you could take seriously, but nowadays it really seems that the writers don't even bother to check wikipedia and just rely on stuff they have seen in other movies. As such, not only we have to swallow a ton of silly technobabble fro Dr. Wu (who, since the last movie, has become a diabolical villain), but we are also supposed to believe you can actually do an on-the-spot, interspecies blood transfusion between animals that originally lived millions of years apart. And that's just the first example that came to mind, but there are many more. Hollywood definitely lost the mold for this kind of movie a long time ago. And the people there probably don't even care.","4 out of 12 found this helpful."

Not to worry though, to paraphrase two of the film's taglines, ""life finds a way"" even though ""the park is gone"".Returning to pen the sequel's script with his former writing partner Derek Connolly, 'Jurassic World' director Colin Trevorrow boldly choreographs a sequence of events that will see the dinosaurs transported off their isolated little island paradise of Isla Nublar to the mainland, which also sets the stage for an all-out man versus dinosaur showdown in the next chapter to follow. That journey will see park manager-turned-animal activist Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) reunite with raptor expert Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), as the couple join an expedition to save the surviving dinosaurs that happens to be the former business partner Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell).of the original 'Jurassic Park's' misguided entrepreneur John Hammond. Not surprisingly, that expedition is but a façade for a more sinister business venture involving Lockwood's right-hand man Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) and geneticist Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong), precipitating a series of things-gone-awry that will result in the animals being unleashed on civilisation at large. Although most of the action is pretty much contained in one of two locations, namely Isla Nublar and Lockwood's sprawling gothic mansion, there is plenty of creative space between them for director J.A. Bayona to pull off some genuinely white-knuckle edge-of-your-seat set pieces. Oh yes, more than the plotting per se, the 'Jurassic Park' movies were always about the scenes of tightly-wound tension, and we dare say Bayona not only equals Spielberg's flair for such roller-coaster thrills, he even manages to top the first two movies from the latter.The pre-opening is in itself demonstration of that - two pilots in an underwater pod in the cordoned-off seas around Isla Nublar run into the park's Mosasaurus, while his counterparts on land are greeted by a T-rex. That is only but warm-up for the film's piece de resistance, which sees a thunderous stampede down the slopes of the volcano as it blows up, threatening to crush Owen, Claire and her scaredy-cat tech nerd colleague Franklin (Justice Smith). Having depicted the horrifying 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in his 'The Impossible', Bayona exercises the same disaster-movie sensibilities here, crafting a breath-taking sequence of genuine visual awe. It would have been difficult to top that, and wisely enough Bayona never tries; rather, he moves to a more confined playground, opting for intimate scenes of well-tuned dread and suspense.Within the tight corridors and stony basement of Lockwood's residence, Bayona plays to his strengths in his previous horror films 'The Orphanage' and 'A Monster Calls', unleashing the new genetically engineered Indoraptor on his lead couple and Lockwood's bright young granddaughter Maisie (newcomer Isabella Sermon). There are plenty of nail-biting moments here, some of which like the tap-tap-tapping claw are in deliberate homage to Spielberg, while others like the romp through Lockwood's private national history gallery of bones are bound to be classic. To be sure, this second half is on a much smaller scale than most audiences would expect the action in a 'Jurassic Park' movie to be, but equally it is precisely this change in tone, character and atmosphere that makes this entry more refreshing, engaging and stimulating than the other sequels.Just as uncharacteristic is its intellectual musings about conservation and evolution. Now that mankind has brought the dinosaurs back to life from the dead, should we make an effort to conserve them given the impending extinction extent on Isla Nublar, as we would any other endangered species? Or should we accept our actions as an aberration of nature, and therefore let nature take its own course henceforth? That conundrum forms a running theme throughout the film, underlining the difficult choices that our heroes are faced with and bookending the brief but effective appearance of a bearded and greying Dr Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum doing his signature staccato brainaic thing for the series).Nevertheless, the 'Jurassic Park' movies have always been about taut human-versus-dino showdowns, and 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' has plenty of that to spare. Like we said, this is a masterclass in tension, suspense and dread, punctuated by moments of campy humour by Owen and Franklin and enlivened by the hearty chemistry between Owen and Claire. Just as significantly, this chapter finally takes the thrill out of the theme park, switching up the usual scenery and setting up a brave new world for the trilogy's final chapter. Sure, it doesn't have the same nostalgia as its predecessor did coming some twenty years after the last movie, but this one is actually even better, even more thrilling, thought-provoking and tense. It's right on top with the first as the best of the series.","56 out of 98 found this helpful."

Jurassic Park is a movie that is a product for its time as well as an all time classic movie that cant be replicated ever again. and 2018 even though we can long accept that Fallen Kingdom wont measure up to the original, it definitely doesnt even live up to a standard monster movie because thats all it is, a movie with dinosaurs and genetically designed monsters with a beyond far fetch and hard to swallow storyline, beyond dumb dialogue and actions by characters despite the movie trying to have a smart sci fi element, this movie would be lower if it wasnt for the first half where they are on the island and hell is breaking loose, but as shown in the trailer once they come back to civilian life the film takes a nose dive and the ending is just way too weird and just contradicts everything that they were trying to sell. Even the dinosaur scenes lost their appeal and its just a watered down sub par monster movie. if it wasn't for the first half which was entertaining it would be lower so i have to give it 4/10","3 out of 8 found this helpful."

I believe this is the best sequel since the original. Take a moment, let that sink in. Want to know why? Simple, J.A. Bayona. Set after the events of 'Jurassic World', the island is left in a desolate ruin where its once dormant volcano becomes active. Owen and Claire are sent back to rescue the endangered dinosaurs from extinction, but not for a justified cause. We all know what to expect from this franchise. Fantastic visuals, engaging characters and some thrilling tension. All that exists, the narrative structure remains unchanged. However, what Bayona effectively embeds is a subtextual layer of melancholy (as with all his films). Tackling connotations of animal cruelty, environmental issues and the all important theme of ""mankind destroying Earth"". These dinosaurs are no longer the invincible predators of the animal kingdom, they've been subjugated to a world fuelled by greed. After the volcanic eruption, which is absolutely phenomenal by the way, there is a scene that evoked pure empathy as you watch these genetically created species perish in the ferocious flames. Selling dinosaurs like poachers trading ivory. Identifying characteristics in order to weaponise them. This is what humanity has become, this is what we are doing to our own ecological system. Bayona sidelined the standard ""runnnn! It's a dinosaur!"" and ensured the humanitarian construct was at the forefront. It worked! He proves you can have enthralling set pieces and elevate them through acute subtextual details. His directing technique is consistently engaging, with a standout one shot take where the Indoraptor unlocks a door. He was rotating, flipping and zooming in simultaneously. I muttered ""that was beautiful"" where the couple next to me glared at me and whispered. It's true, this comes across as unoriginal as it takes strands of DNA from previous iterations. However the blend of meaningful context and exciting set pieces makes for a roaring sequel that many will judge unfairly.","78 out of 141 found this helpful."

The returning characters exist merely to provide a moral base for the audience amongst evil men looking to make money at all costs, and their new sidekicks are total cliches given lines merely to make ten year-olds chuckle (as they were wont to do constantly every time the sheepish computer nerd made a badly-scripted ""I'm such a wuss, I'm so funny"" one-liner).The portion on the island should have and could have been handled better, but the entire thing felt rushed as an excuse to get our group and their dinosaur captors into the second phase of the story, which was the most interesting. The darker second half involving the evil corporations and military industrial complex saved the film from total humdrum, but the contrast between settings only serves to highlight how uneven the film is as a whole.The special effects are typically amazing, but the thrill of seeing dinosaurs on screen has long passed, hence the creators rooting for us to connect with them emotionally rather than visually. It works, but one wonders what the franchise is saying when you're rooting for the dinosaurs more than the humans.No set piece ""wows"", but there are enough decent ones to make some fun entertainment if you don't have your standards set too high.It's too bad they didn't put as much effort into the script as they did the special effects.","3 out of 8 found this helpful."

Had me on the edge of the seat realizing that this sequel had its own unique and welcoming twist.
 From the opening scene, this film has you white-knuckled and feeling as if your not watching a remake of a classic flick about dinosaurs in a theme park. You feel a taste of horror and a lot of thriller and action adventure.
 Throughout the movie, you develop those feelings from the first-excitement and awe mixed with a hint of nostalgia from the John Williams score. But make no mistake, this is not the stereotypical sequel of a remake of a hit 90's franchise. This is another great piece to this collection of adventurous and fun movies. It puts its own flare to it though, with scares scattered throughout that make this the definite winner for 'must-go-to-the-bathroom-before-watching' title. 
 I am so excited for the next (and, for now, final) movie in this continuation franchise. They have set it up to be a writer's paradise and I am rooting for Trevorrow and Bayona. They have proven they can still make this series entertaining and cinematically magnificent-enough to give Spielberg's masterpiece a good name. 
One for the collection; makes its own footprint known among the other classics.

What the first Jurassic Park novel and movie both tried to do was to expose the point that Genetic technology was (and still is) a deeply unknown subject which, in association with the notion of the chaotic nature of reality, should be treated with respect and caution. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom respects this message and successfully iterates over it, exposing the hypothetical consequences of this type of meddling. The Pandora's Box is open.
Bayona, Trevorrow and Connolly triumphantly created another successful addition to the franchise, achieving a glorious film that combines heart, soul and thrill. Bayona plays with the shadows as a skillful artisan, making our inner child jump on the seat as a six year old. All this, combined with multiple of the new most memorable, inspired scenes of the entire series turn Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom a real masterpiece and the new definition of what an epic blockbuster should be.","20 out of 31 found this helpful."

When that character development gets resolved, we're treated to non-stop action when they have to deal with plenty of dinosaur chaos as well as with many people doing stuff against their policies concerning those lizards. This Jurassic series entry has even more thrills than before and it seems pertinent that Universal is the studio that does these movies as that company has done monster movies for nearly 100 years now from Lon Chaney Sr.'s Hunchback and Phantom of the Opera to Bela Lugosi's Dracula to Boris Karloff's Frankenstein Monster to Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man to The Creature from the Black Lagoon to Jaws to the recent versions of King Kong to these now-iconic dinos.

I personally dislike the 3D format. In my humble opinion 3D cheats the audience out of watching (any) big budget film for its quality acting and expected crisp cinematography. Instead, the director relies on cheap tricks, a slight of hand, and having our eyes focus solely on some stupid object as it pops out in front of us rather than on a film's plot, acting, and/or film content. In this film the two main stars Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt work well together with their on screen presence and they are an appealing couple while conversing one on one. Granted, neither the film, nor these two stars can compare to bonafide stars like Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart in the 1951 film classic ""The African Queen"", nonetheless I enjoyed both of their performances.What I did like about the film was Ted Levine's performance as the smarmy Dinosaur wrangler Ken Wheatley who likes to yank a tooth out of each dinosaur species he captures to add to his necklace. Ahhhh, but Hollywood can be cruel to their actors sometimes and Mr. Levine who was looking for a big payday both as his character in this film, and in real life for starring in this feature film was in for the biggest surprise. He must have re-read the script several times to verify if he really was expected to go into the cage that houses the genetically enhanced most vicious dinosaur predator on the planet to try and extract one of this bad ass dinosaurs front teeth to add to his collection.There was sufficient interaction amongst the cast to keep our interest and the dinosaurs were well imagined. My only real complaint is I wish the studios would stop pushing the failed 3D format down our proverbial throats and to add insult to injury jack the admission fee by 20 percent for the privilege (puhhhhleassssse) of watching their latest big budget film in an inferior film format. Oh how I wish the original Technicolor format was re-instated!I give the film a decent 8 out of 10 rating","26 out of 42 found this helpful."

It is a great follow up to the previous movie and nice to see some of my favorite characters back on screen. The movie stays true to the franchise and is full of adventure and thrills. There is never a dull moment in the movie as something exciting keeps taking place and you find yourself in the edge of your seat. The CGI and effects are amazing as always and they feel more refined and real. There are also some heartwarming moments where I actually felt more empathetic towards the dinosaurs. Another good thing about Fallen Kingdom is you don't have to watch the previous installments to figure out what's happening. Even a newbie to the franchise can pick up on what happening and would want to watch the previous movies.The characters are a mixed bag. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are charming on screen as always, but there is hardly any character development between them. Daniella Pineda and Justice Smith are good supporting characters that provide comic relief. Isabella Sermon is adorable in her debut role as Maisie Lockwood and has done a terrific job. The remaining actors who played the villains are amicable but are easily forgettable, since they are very clichéd and don't bring anything new to the screen. In fact, Toby Jones seems to be look bored in his scenes, and Ted Levine's character was just annoying. The movie would have been better if the villains were more complex and interesting.Apart from the characters, the only reason I am not giving it a full star rating is because it was predictable. Since this is the fifth installment, we can expect that is going to happen in the next scene. While this is fun, I would have loved it the thrills deviated from what we are used to seeing. Having said that, ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is a full-on family entertainer that is definitely worth watching in the cinemas. It is in no way close to the original 1993 movie, but it is much better than the others in the franchise.Read more of my reviews at rajivsreviews.com","90 out of 168 found this helpful."

I guess in the previous installment everything felt a little more fresh. Chris Pratt is spectacular as Owen Grady. Bryce Dallas Howard is outstanding as Claire Dearing.

In this sequel Owen Grady and Claire Dearing return to the abandoned Jurassic World theme park, in order to rescue the dinosaurs there from an imminent volcanic eruption. 'JURASSIC WORLD's writers, Colin Trevorrow (who also helmed the 2015 film) and Derek Connolly, returned to script this entry as well, and J.A. Bayona took over directing duties.

It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's another gigantic hit at the Box Office as well of course. I loved it.A volcanic eruption is set to destroy Isla Nublar, and the United States Senate is holding a debate on whether the dinosaurs there should be saved or not. The Senate disapproves doing anything to save the animals, so Claire Dearing (Howard) creates the Dinosaur Protection Group, and she receives financial support from Benjamin Lockwood (Cromwell) in order to go to Nublar and rescue the dinosaurs. Claire also enlists the help of her former lover, Owen Grady (Pratt). Things get complicated when Lockwood's aide, Eli Mills (Spall), double-crosses the team in order to sell the dinosaurs for a huge profit. The movie is spectacularly entertaining! There's definitely some really cool creature attack scenes in it, and an awesome volcanic eruption escape scene as well, involving a drugged hero narrowly fleeing his death (in a totally classic scene in my opinion). There's also a great animal liberation message throughout the film too, that I love (being a vegan and Animal Rights activist). I really had a great time watching it, and I think the movie is an important animal rights film (for everyone to see) as well.","24 out of 41 found this helpful."
